WHITMAN EXPECTED TO ANOUNCE $1 BILLION PROGRAM OF PROPERTY TAX
REBATES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Under pressure to address New Jersey's high
property taxes, Gov. Christie Whitman was expected to outline a
five-year, $1 billion plan on Tuesday that would eventually provide
an average rebate of $600 to homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would use money from the state's general funds to cover
part of the homeowners' local school taxes, which now make up 55 to
65 percent of the average property tax bill. The proposal would not
change how much money local school districts receive, because the
plan would provide the rebates using state tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, say they
embrace efforts to reduce the property tax burden on homeowners,
some expressed concern about whether the state would be able to
afford $1 billion in rebate checks during an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is an intriguing proposal,'' said Assemblyman
Anthony N. Impreveduto, a Democrat from Secaucus. ``The question is
how are we paying for it? The economy is robust now. Unfortunately,
the economy is like hemlines. It rises, and it falls. But I am glad
that she has finally listened to us to do something about property
taxes. I think Democrats would certainly consider being supportive
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman won national attention for cutting the state's
income taxes when she first took office five years ago, she nearly
lost her re-election bid in 1997 because of voter anger over paying
the nation's highest auto insurance and property tax rates. The
average property tax bill in New Jersey is $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and state lawmakers have already taken steps to ease the
auto insurance rates for some drivers. She will make the property
tax plan the centerpiece of her annual address to a joint session
of the state Legislature on Tuesday. In the speech, she was
expected to ask state officials to recommit themselves to what she
describes as the core Republican values of cutting taxes and
controlling spending.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has already taken some steps to reduce the state's high
property taxes. She is encouraging school districts to share costs
and has also signed legislation that freezes the amount of property
taxes that low-income elderly and disabled homeowners now pay. She
also signed legislation that once again allows New Jerseyans to
deduct part of their property taxes from their state income tax
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics warned that the 30 percent income tax cut in
early 1994 would significantly reduce state aid to local
governments and drive up property taxes, Whitman points out that
the overall property tax collection statewide has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   But homeowners and local officials have continued to put
pressure on Whitman and lawmakers to take more aggressive steps,
because property tax rates are still sharply rising in some towns.
Under the latest proposal, tenants would receive an average rebate
of $100, Whitman administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most sweeping property tax reform that this state
has ever experienced,'' said Pete McDonough, the chief spokesman
for Whitman. ``It will cut the average school tax bill by more than
a third.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tax rebate proposal is by far the most extensive effort that
the governor has taken to address a longstanding complaint of New
Jersey property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Under her proposal, which would be fully operational in 2004,
property owners would get a rebate check directly from the state
for the reduction in their local school bills. The plan is intended
to recalculate the school-tax portion of the local property tax
bills but keep school spending levels the same. The plan exempts
part of the assessed value of a home from the school tax rate to
calculate rebates.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman's program is fully phased in after five years, the
rebate checks would average about $600. Starting this year, the
proposal would phase in the rebates at 20 percent a year. The first
rebates would average $120.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, homeowners in Livingston, Essex County, where the
average assessed value of a home is $75,000, would receive an
average rebate check of $624 from the state. In Montclair, where
the average home is assessed at $247,000, the average rebate check
would amount to $778.

 $1 BILLION PLAN FOR PROTECTING LAND  &HT;     By ALEX BARNUM 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
President Clinton will propose a $1 billion program Tuesday for
land acquisition and protection next year, the largest single-year
investment in the protection of land in U.S. history,
administration officials said Monday.
<P>
   The budget proposal represents more than a doubling over this
year's spending of $459 million, and it would fully fund the
federal Land and Water Conservation Fund for the first time in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects on the administration's priority list are the
purchase of 450,000 acres in and around Mojave and Joshua Tree
National Parks, protection of the Lewis and Clark Trail along the
Missouri River and acquisition of lands within Gettysburg, Antietam
and other Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are expected to announce the
proposal at a ceremony Tuesday at the National Arboretum in
Washington. It is one in a series of budget initiatives that the
administration is announcing this week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as part of a broader effort to fight suburban sprawl,
Gore unveiled a proposal for a $10 billion bond program to help
urban communities preserve open space, reduce traffic and clean up
abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for approval of either initiative in Congress are
uncertain. The administration will submit the full fiscal 2000
budget next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, which takes in more than
$900 million every year in royalties from offshore oil and gas
leases, was originally meant to be used to acquire lands for parks
and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   But since the 1980s, a cash-strapped Congress has diverted much
of the funds to deficit reduction and other programs. Republican
lawmakers argue that the government already owns too much land and
can not maintain the land it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups praised the administration for trying to
return the fund to its intended purpose. ``It's something we've
been struggling for for a long time,'' said Will Rogers, president
of the Trust for Public Lands, a San Francisco-based conservation
group.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal would provide $442 million for
federal land acquisition and $588 million to state and local
governments and nonprofit groups in the form of matching grants for
park acquisition, farmland protection and planning.
</P>
<P>
   It would also spend $183 million to help states protect ocean
and coastal resources and grant permanent ``wilderness'' protection
to more than 5 million acres of backcountry in 17 national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's anti-sprawl initiatives may fare better in
Congress, analysts said, because controlling growth has emerged as
an major bipartisan issue in metropolitan areas around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 local and state open space initiatives were on
ballots in last November's elections, and the majority of them
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the administration's program is $9.5 billion
in ``Better America Bonds,'' which would allow state and local
governments to obtain interest-free financing because investors who
buy the 15-year bonds would receive tax credits in lieu of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Bond proceeds would be used to restore urban parks, buy or get
permanent easements on suburban open space and clean up abandoned
industrial sites in the inner city. Money also would be used to
protect wetlands and natural flood zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an essential first step toward addressing suburban
sprawl, which is now the fastest-growing threat to our
environment,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1970 and 1990, more than 19 million acres of rural land
have been lost to development. According to the Trust for Public
Lands, four square miles of open space is paved over every day.
</P>
<P>
   But the building industry, which has complained of being
``demonized'' in the recent spate of anti-sprawl campaigns
nationwide, reacted warily to the Clinton administration's
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out trying to purchase open space or farmland. If it's
not managed correctly, we're going to see no growth,'' said Charles
Ruma, incoming president of the National Association of
Homebuilders.

COLUMN: SPEAK, STEINBRENNER, SPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If memory serves, George Steinbrenner III said that
once the elections were over he would state his druthers as to
where his New York Yankees should play after their Yankee Stadium
lease expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Crackerjack investigative reporting _ all right, it was a glance
at the calendar _ revealed that the elections took place two months
ago. Yet Steinbrenner has not uttered a public word about his
intentions on this critical civic issue.
</P>
<P>
   Every major public figure has managed to speak out on the
Yankees' future, including the governor, the mayor, the City
Council speaker and the Bronx borough president. But while they
perform their political opera, the owner of the Yankees offers only
the same studied silence he has maintained for years, despite
periodic promises to tip his hand.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed not unreasonable to call on his spokesman, Howard
Rubenstein, to ask what gives. Not much, came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still not making an announcement,'' Rubenstein said. ``If
he had made up his mind, he'd have announced it. He just hasn't
made up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to more questions. Don't New Yorkers deserve more than
endless silence, especially since hundreds of millions of tax
dollars are at stake? Might a reasonably sensitive New Yorker
conclude that Steinbrenner was not treating him and his fellow
citizens with utmost respect?
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect is intended, Rubenstein replied. ``He is not
purposely trying to leave anyone dangling to get more of
anything,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, dangling is what we have long been doing on this
matter, with no end in sight. This much, however, is known:
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner wants out of the South Bronx. He makes it sound
like the Korean DMZ, even though police say that on game days the
neighborhood around Yankee Stadium is the safest in the city. His
chief ally, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has rhapsodized about a
possible billion-dollar ballpark on the West Side of Manhattan,
above rail yards owned by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not get a satisfactory deal from the city,
Steinbrenner has warned, he is ready to decamp to New Jersey. But
he has never spelled out what exactly he wants, and lately he has
even tried to sell his club to Cablevision, the media titan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki says of the Yankees that ``they
belong in the Bronx, period.'' He gets no argument from Fernando
Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who has offered his own $535
million plan to renovate the existing Yankee Stadium and develop
the surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a new wrinkle from Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He says he and President Clinton were talking last week about
(of all things) the Yankees, and the president spoke glowingly of
Yankee Stadium as ``a national treasure'' that should remain where
it is. Clinton, the congressman said, called the stadium an anchor
of the South Bronx, and suggested that economic-development money
might be steered toward that neighborhood under the 1993 federal
law creating so-called empowerment zones.
</P>
<P>
   No concrete plans emerged, Rangel said, a point echoed Monday by
the White House. But he added: ``Sometimes it takes an outsider to
make you appreciate what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor took a wait-and-see attitude on possible federal
involvement, Rubenstein seemed intrigued. ``If the president can
throw huge dollars into the Bronx, and the mayor and the governor
like the idea, George would consider it big time,'' he said.
``That's a huge commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   What do these bits and pieces add up to? Perhaps nothing. But
also perhaps everything.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe that New Jersey has offered
Steinbrenner a single turnstile, let alone an entire stadium. You
have a club owner who, for all his bluster about pulling up stakes,
thrives in the limelight that only New York can provide. You have a
governor in Albany who wants the team to remain in the Bronx, and
he controls the MTA board that would decide what, if anything, gets
built on those West Side rail yards. And you have a mayor who
admits that deep down he, too, wants his beloved Yankees to stay
put.
</P>
<P>
   That is why some people involved in this soap opera say they
would not be at all surprised if 2003 found the team right where it
has been all along, in the House that Ruth Built and Today's
Politicians Rebuilt.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MINNEAPOLIS _ Minnesota Vikings owner Red McCombs was standing in
the middle of the tunnel leading off the Metrodome field Sunday
evening, wiggling his hips, flailing his arms and shaking his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   It was a giddy kind of Funky Chicken Meets The Dirty Bird
interpretive dance. And it was a perfectly placed bump-and-grind
display by this new darling of the NFL, entertaining everyone who
watched and putting a cap on a most noteworthy weekend of NFL
moving and shaking.
</P>
<P>
   There is a New World Order in this once staid and starched
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   There is something definitely happening, something definitely
moving and important. And it's good.
</P>
<P>
   If football fans didn't notice it before, or didn't want to
notice, that special something about the 1998 season smacked us
across the face this past weekend like a chop from ``Stone Cold''
Steve Austin. Or maybe it hit us like a piercing howl from ``Nature
Boy'' Ric Flair or perhaps even a wallop from the governor of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   However you saw it, you definitely had to notice. It opened eyes
and hearts. The NFL now has what the NBA needs. A transition game.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it has two transition games _ Atlanta at Minnesota and
the New York Jets at Denver on Sunday, for the right to get it on
in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   These are not your father's Cowboys, 49ers, Packers or Steelers
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams all will be watching Sunday's conference
championships from home. Those teams all definitely seem to have
problems and are sliding backward.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, we saw the new teams with catchy identities _
Dirty Birds, Vinny and the Jets, Purple Pride. And even if Broncos
fever has been around for years, the dominance and aura of it all
now revolves around the young Most Valuable Player, Terrell Davis,
as much as it does the old and likely soon-to-be-retiring John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   These are for the most part new styles and stylish new NFL
heroes arriving to the stage just in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the NBA, the league is all but clinging to Michael
Jordan's ankles as he drags his legs out the door. For all the
NBA's talent and high-flying action, there apparently is no team or
player worthy of stepping in and capturing the nation's attention
like Jordan and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But the past NFL weekend showed that while numerous NFL players
and teams might be exiting stage left, several more are entering on
stage right.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' Jerry Rice clearly no longer is the No. 1 man even in
his own town, and he punctuated the downfall with an
out-of-character locker-room tirade near the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the Vikings' young Randy Moss, flying through the
season and the playoffs as if he's jumping off a turnbuckle. Here
he is, apparently turning over a new leaf with consistently good
conduct reports.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and Steve Young aren't getting any younger, and
their teams are falling. But the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson, the
Falcons' Jamal Anderson and Davis couldn't look more like
unstoppable forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin throws a fist-pumping
sideline fit, his teammates mostly roll their eyes. But when
Anderson says something, everyone in Falcons black listens.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Holmgren has packed his bags and left a Packers team
that two years ago looked like a dynasty waiting to happen. But
Vikings coach Dennis Green, once embattled, should have all the
titles he wants if things continue to go well.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers coach Bill Cowher will spend the offseason trying to
find something that might resemble a quarterback and an offense.
But Jets coach Bill Parcells might spend the winter being compared
to Vince Lombardi and searching for a place to put his third Super
Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners used to sit perched high above the stadium, going
about the family business handed down from people named Rooney and
Brown. But today, the only thing perched are dirty birds, and there
was McCombs wriggling and dancing Sunday as if he was ringing in a
new era.
</P>
<P>
   He was.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Jets were 1-15 and the Falcons 3-13. The
Vikings were underachievers. The Broncos were Super Bowl goats.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they all are within one step of the Super Bowl while the
usual Super Bowl contenders slide backward.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows who will win Sunday's pivotal games? We do know
something pivotal already has happened: This will be fun. This will
be new and wild. This transition game already has been won by the
NFL.

DENVER _ Bill Parcells and the New York Jets are the last obstacle
in Denver's path to a second consecutive Super Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jets, who eliminated Jacksonville 34-24 in a divisional
playoff game Sunday, bring a seven-game winning streak into Mile
High Stadium for the AFC Championship Game. They are led by
Parcells, who has been to three Super Bowls and won two, and
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who is 13-1 as a starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of wanting money or fame,'' Testaverde said.
``I want a chance to play for a Super Bowl ring to make my career
complete. We're playing to win the championship, not to just play
in the AFC Championship Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who eliminated Miami 38-3 on Saturday, are the
defending Super Bowl champions. They have won 18 consecutive games
at home, and they are 3-0 in AFC Championship Games at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't faced them in a couple of years, so we don't know
what they're all about,'' Broncos quarterback John Elway said of
the Jets. ``We're kind of starting from scratch, but we've got a
week to prepare for them.''
</P>
<P>
   This game features one 2,000-yard runner in Terrell Davis
(Broncos), one 1,000-yard rusher in Curtis Martin (Jets) and four
1,000-yard receivers in Rod Smith (Broncos), Ed McCaffrey
(Broncos), Keyshawn Johnson (Jets) and Wayne Chrebet (Jets).
</P>
<P>
   Davis rushed for 199 yards and two touchdowns in the victory
over the Dolphins. Martin gained 124 and scored two touchdowns in
the conquest of the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Davis might have been able to break Eric Dickerson's NFL playoff
rushing record of 248 yards set in 1985 against Dallas if coach
Mike Shanahan had not removed him in the fourth quarter. Davis'
performance and Denver's 250 yards rushing showed that problems
they experienced late in the season were caused more by boredom
than the bullet train jumping the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' Denver guard
Dan Neil said. ``You know, everybody's an expert. We weren't
struggling. No one was panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are different now. This is the playoffs. We want to win
another Super Bowl. That game (Miami) showed what we're capable of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Martin will get a lot of attention in the game plans,
but both teams have outstanding passing games. With Smith,
McCaffrey and tight end Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos have three
formidable weapons for Elway.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets, Johnson and Chrebet combined for 158 catches, more
than any twosome in the league. Johnson even ran for a touchdown on
a reverse against Jacksonville. The Jets use tight end Kyle Brady
as a blocker more than as a receiver. But when receiver Dedric Ward
lines up outside and Chrebet moves into the slot, they are
extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Denver to double-cover Johnson with a cornerback in man
coverage and a safety in zone. The Broncos will probably jam
Chrebet at the line and drop a linebacker into the middle of the
field to try to keep him from excelling on crossing routes.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense is coming off its best game of the season. The
Broncos allowed a franchise-low three points in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Broncos) a Super Bowl team, and that's what we want
to be,'' said Johnson, who had nine catches for 121 yards and a
touchdown against Jacksonville. ``They're rolling. They've got the
edge. They've got their confidence back now.''
</P>
<P>
   The defenses are good but not great, which means it could be
another high-scoring game. Testaverde likes to stay in the pocket
as much as possible. Denver linemen Keith Taylor and Trevor Pryce
will try to collapse the pocket. Pryce, Maa Tanuvasa and Alfred
Williams will try to hit Testaverde as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, having the best season of his career, had 29
touchdown passes and only seven interceptions in the regular
season. He completed 24 of 36 passes for 284 yards and a touchdown
with one interception against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Denver's going to be tough,'' Testaverde said. ``It's
a tough place to win, but we've played in some hostile environments
(Kansas City, Miami, Buffalo and New England). We've played well in
those types of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who have won 11 of 12, are trying to win their second
Super Bowl. In Parcells' two seasons, they have finished 9-7 and
12-4 after going 1-15 in Rich Kotite's last season. When they
defeated Jacksonville, it was their first playoff game since 1991
and their first win since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Broncos and Jets played was the 1996 season
opener, and Denver won 31-6.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Jets _ linebacker Glenn Cadrez and end Marvin
Washington _ will be trying to get some revenge against their
former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are playing in their first AFC Championship Game since
the strike-shortened 1982 season in which they lost to Miami. They
upset Baltimore in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have what the Jets want _ Super Bowl rings. The Jets
seem to respect Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an amazing team,'' Johnson said. ``They're the Super
Bowl champion, and everything's in their favor.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There were no huge upsets, no teams putting on postseason surges.
This year's NFC Championship Game will feature the two teams that
were the best in the conference start to finish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems only fitting that with regular-season records of 15-1
and 14-2, respectively, Minnesota and Atlanta would be vying for a
trip to the Super Bowl. It will be Minnesota's first championship
game in 11 years, Atlanta's first ever. The Vikings have gone to
the Super Bowl four times, losing each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons secured a 20-18 victory over San Francisco on
Saturday, then sat back and watched the Vikings tear up Arizona
41-21 Sunday. It was a tough game to watch, and Atlanta safety
Eugene Robinson admitted he changed the channel when things got out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to watch a game like that, where they look like
world-beaters,'' said Robinson, who went to the Super Bowl the last
two years with the Green Bay Packers. ``I remember before my first
game against them in Green Bay, (Packers defensive coordinator)
Fritz Shurmur showed video of them looking just awesome. I said,
`Turn it off. Show me something when they got punched in the mouth,
when they're vulnerable.'''
</P>
<P>
   You would have to go through a lot of tape of this season before
finding that. The Vikings' only misstep en route to a near-perfect
season came at the hands of Tampa Bay 27-24 in Week 9. Atlanta's
only losses were to playoff teams, the New York Jets 28-3 and San
Francisco 31-20.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be whether the Falcons can stop the highest-scoring
offense in the league, one that boasts wide receivers Randy Moss
and Cris Carter, running backs Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard and
quarterback Randall Cunningham. The Vikings set an NFL mark for
points with 556, averaging 41.5 in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have been a quick-strike offense, dazzling fans with
the down-the-field bombs. Atlanta, on the other hand, has been a
ball-control offense, dominating the clock with steady, consistent
drives. The Falcons led the NFL in time of possession, averaging 33
minutes, 10 seconds per game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings tore apart the Cardinals' defense by
systematically holding on to the ball. Minnesota had three drives
that ate up seven minutes or more, frustrating the tiring Arizona
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I used to press to make things happen because I
thought that was what I was supposed to do,'' Cunningham said.
``Now, I see other guys can get the job done, and I hand the ball
off. They make seven yards. It wears you out, trying to throw the
impossible touchdown every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings accumulated 416 yards total offense, a fairly
balanced 228 in the air and 188 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that has to be demoralizing,'' Smith said. ``That's
something we've been able to do all season, and it has to be tough
on the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoard and Smith could have a tougher time against Atlanta,
which ranked No. 2 against the run this season and had no trouble
with the Garrison Hearst-less 49ers on Saturday. After losing their
star running back to a broken fibula on the first play from
scrimmage, the 49ers amassed only 46 yards on 20 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta secondary has been less impressive. The Falcons
finished the regular season ranked 21st against the pass. Saturday,
the Falcons allowed Steve Young to throw for 289 yards, though they
did nab three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has been able to stop the dual attack of Moss and
Carter. Teams that have single-covered Moss this season have
usually found he can outrun and outjump even the most talented
cornerbacks. Teams that choose to double him often get burned by
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not the one who has to figure out a way to stop
this team,'' said Hoard, who scored three touchdowns Sunday, two on
short runs and another on a 16-yard pass from Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it will be a new face representing the NFC in the
Super Bowl. Thanks to early losses by Dallas, Green Bay and now San
Francisco, the NFC will have a new representative for the first
time since Washington went in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extreme blessing to be in this position,'' Vikings
defensive end Derrick Alexander said. ``There's guys who play in
the NFL their whole lives and never have an opportunity to get to
this point. We're here now. All we have to do is want it, want it
more than everybody else.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Considering the freezing weather and the
extent to which they dominated the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New
York Jets sweated more than they should have in Sunday's AFC
divisional playoff.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jets' game plan worked to perfection in their 34-24 victory
at the Meadowlands. They ran the ball effectively with Curtis
Martin (124 yards, two touchdowns), passed accurately with Vinny
Testaverde (24-of-36 for 284 yards, one interception) and limited
Jacksonville's talented offense to 251 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets committed some costly blunders that do not bode
well for Sunday, when they face the defending Super Bowl champions
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing his team's performance against Jacksonville, Jets
linebacker Bryan Cox said, ``If we play like that next week, we'll
get beat by 60 points. We say around here that one play can send
you home. When it came down to it, we probably had six plays that
could send us home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Jets linebacker, Pepper Johnson, basically agreed: ``We
have to fight a lot longer than we did in this game, or else we're
going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring faux pas:
</P>
<P>
   On the final play before halftime, safety Jerome Henderson was
late covering Jimmy Smith, who caught a 52-yard touchdown pass on a
Hail Mary from Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, leading 31-24 with second-and-seven from
the Jacksonville 14, Testaverde sailed the ball too high into the
wind, and it was intercepted by Donivan Darius.
</P>
<P>
   But in a case of dumb and dumber, the Jaguars outdid the Jets in
the blooper production.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville cost itself a probable score in the second quarter
when safety Chris Hudson recovered a fumble by Martin, ran it 47
yards to the Jets' 35-yard line and then tried to lateral it to
cornerback Dave Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced off Thomas and was recovered by Jets receiver
Keyshawn Johnson, who had hustled upfield to pursue the play. The
Jets went on to score (Johnson on a 10-yard end around) to take a
17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been a different game if it's 10-7 there instead
of 17-0,'' Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Testaverde interception in the fourth quarter, Darius
made the mistake of running the ball out of the end zone and was
tackled on the one-yard line, with 2:24 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I caught the ball, I collided with Keith Byars,'' Darius
said. ``I jumped up, and my eyes were kind of blurred. I didn't
know where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said: ``I don't know what he was thinking. But I would
have liked to have had the opportunity to tie the game starting at
our 20-yard line. That might have been a legitimate chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells expressed concern over the ``stupid
errors'' but did not want to sound like a sore winner. ``We had
some real big-time performances out of Keyshawn, Curtis and
Vinny,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars All-Pro tackle Tony Boselli said for New York to beat
Denver, ``the key is to hold Terrell Davis down and keep them from
controlling the ball. But the Jets have a good offense, too. I
think the Jets can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York receiver Wayne Chrebet said, ``We've got to have long
drives and keep them off the field. But we have some of the better
offensive players in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern is Davis, who rushed for 2,008 yards this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets do have a capable run defense. They limited
Jacksonville's breakaway back, Fred Taylor, to 86 yards on 20
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Johnson said the way to contain Davis is to do like the
Jets did against Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him get the cutback runs,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of
defenses will chase after Davis, and then he cuts back and he gets
a long gain. You have keep the whole field covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick, Parcells' defensive coordinator, is a master of
containment. He faces his biggest challenge yet, but he could be up
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most brilliant strategy can be undone by untimely
fumbles, interceptions and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets realize they will have to be sharper mentally than they
were Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of dumb things,'' said center Kevin Mawae. ``But
we did just enough right to win.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The NFL coaches carousel took three more spins Monday when Ray
Rhodes and Andy Reid were hired in Green Bay and Philadelphia and
Marty Schottenheimer abruptly resigned in Kansas City.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were no surprises with the Packers and Eagles. Rhodes,
fired after four seasons in Philadelphia, replaced Mike Holmgren in
Green Bay. Reid, an assistant with the Packers for seven years
under Holmgren, replaced Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer, who just finished the first losing season of his
distinguished career, pulled a huge surprise when he resigned after
10 seasons with the Chiefs. They were 7-9 this season, the first
time one of his teams posted a losing record in a career that also
includes five seasons with the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years, it's time to give someone else an opportunity
to implement their plan,'' said Schottenheimer, who compiled a
record of 101-58-1 in Kansas City. ``I've decided to take a break,
to take some time and relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been retired. I'm going to work on my golf game.
Pat (his wife) and I are going to travel. I may even get back into
my aviation pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer denied speculation that his resignation was the
result of marital problems, calling those rumors ``absolutely false
and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Schottenheimer's decision was curious, to say the
least. He wasn't pressured into resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Lamar Hunt defended Schottenheimer vigorously after a
season in which the Chiefs were supposed to be a Super Bowl
contender but collapsed under a wave of injuries and became the
most penalized team in NFL history. Hunt said he twice asked
Schottenheimer to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility of the head coach very simply is this: You
have to create an environment in which your football team can
perform and play, and then you have to make sure that every week
they are prepared to do that,'' Schottenheimer said. ``For a
multitude of reasons, we were unable to get that done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it was our most disappointing (season) since we've
been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer's earlier disappointments in Kansas City came in
the playoffs. The Chiefs reached the postseason seven times under
Schottenheimer. Yet they were only 2-5 in their opening playoff
games and made it to the AFC title game only in the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1997, the Chiefs led the AFC with 13-3
regular-season records and won home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs. But each time, they lost their first game.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Carl Peterson, who hired Schottenheimer 10 years
ago, will begin the search for his replacement immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand and respect Marty's decision to step
away,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham, Eagles
defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas, Steelers defensive coordinator
Jim Haslett, Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer,
Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick and Kansas State
coach Bill Snyder were candidates being mentioned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Green Bay, Rhodes was returning to the team he
served as defensive coordinator under Holmgren in 1992-93. Rhodes
must feel like he died and went to heaven leaving the Eagles for
the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, 48, called the Green Bay job ``a dream come true.''
After Rhodes guided the Eagles to the playoffs in his first two
seasons and was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1995, the team
bottomed out, finishing 3-13 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes is getting $1 million per year over four years. He was
hired by general manager Ron Wolf, who said he wanted to replace
Holmgren with a coach who had been on a championship team and could
give the Packers a ``little electrical shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a football team that's not broke,'' Rhodes
said. ``Right now, what you do is pull a few sparkplugs out, wipe
them off, you make sure you keep the car fine-tuned, and that's
what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes is friends with the coach who is replacing him in
Philadelphia. Reid, 40, becomes the second-youngest coach in the
league, behind Oakland's Jon Gruden, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Reid coached tight ends and quarterbacks in Green Bay. He could
have joined Holmgren in Seattle or remained with the Packers as
Rhodes' offensive coordinator, but when Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie
offered the job, he jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step in putting the Philadelphia Eagles back
on the map,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid joins Rhodes, Gruden and San Francisco's Steve Mariucci as
former Holmgren assistants to land head coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Holmgren was a great teacher, not only to his players but
to his coaches,'' Reid said. ``That speaks highly of him, and I
would be very foolish not to study that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, Kansas City, Baltimore and Chicago are still looking
for coaches. Barring any more surprises _ Pete Carroll at New
England, for instance _ nine teams, including the expansion Browns,
will have hired coaches since the regular season ended.

SEC FINES 28 WALL STREET FIRMS $26 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission fined 28 Wall
Street firms more than $26 million and suspended 51 traders Monday
for reputed abuses on the Nasdaq stock market, ending an
investigation that began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement negotiations between the SEC and the brokerage firms
have been going on for months. While accepting the sanctions and
the penalties, neither the firms nor the traders admitted or denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to payment of $26.3 million in penalties, the firms
will repay more than $791,000 in gains. Traders named in the
settlement face suspensions of anywhere from one month to three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires the firms to improve trading
policies and procedures, SEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement involves many of Wall Street's biggest, most
respected firms, but the monetary penalties imposed were not
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Eight firms, led by Paine Webber Inc. and UBS Securities, were
fined more than $1 million. Paine Webber was fined the most, $6.3
million. UBS, now Warburg Dillon Read, was fined $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a professor at the Columbia University Law School
who specializes in securities law, said that in negotiating the
settlement, Wall Street ``wanted to use a kind of market share
formula,'' determined by how much trading each firm did on the
Nasdaq system.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Wall Street argued that to a greater or lesser
degree all firms were guilty of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has not happened,'' Coffee said. ``This settlement is a
little bit harsher than the industry wanted or thought they were
going to get away with, particularly as it relates to
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   By meting out suspensions, Coffee said, the SEC is telling
traders ``if you engage in conduct that injures investors, it won't
just be the firm that suffers, but also your job and career at the
firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gerlach, associate director of the enforcement division at
the SEC, said: ``Our investigation established that not everyone
did it. There are more than 28 market-making firms in the Nasdaq
marketplace, and the extent of wrongdoing varied tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber said: ``This is the final resolution of a matter
that occurred more than four years ago. Paine Webber cooperated
fully with regulators and has instituted policies and procedures to
address the issues raised in their investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1994, when the SEC and the Justice Department
accused major dealers on the electronic Nasdaq market of conspiring
in a form of price fixing that cost ordinary investors billions of
dollars on their stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   Those accusations led some investors to file a class-action
lawsuit against the Wall Street firms. Last year the group settled
with 30 firms for $910 million, the largest settlement ever for
such a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the self-policing body that
operates the Nasdaq market, settled with the SEC
</P>
<P>
   The SEC censured the dealers group, saying it broke federal
securities laws and its own rules in failing to enforce rules on
the Nasdaq. As part of that settlement agreement, the Nasdaq agreed
to spend $100 million over five years to improve market
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq officials declined to comment on Monday's settlement.

NEW YORK STUDENTS CONTINUE TO DOMINATE SCIENCE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Va., Calif., Md.)

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly half of the 300 high school students named
Monday as semifinalists in the Intel Science Talent Search are from
New York schools, including two city schools that have long been
dominant in the competition and a Long Island school that has
emerged as a science powerhouse in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island school, Ward Melville High in Setauket, received
nine nominations for students who submitted papers on subjects
ranging from frog muscles to binary stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, there were again strong showings from the Bronx
High School of Science, which has had the largest number of
finalists since the awards were established in 1942, and Stuyvesant
High School in Manhattan, which has had the second largest number.
This year, there are 10 semifinalists from Stuyvesant and nine from
the Bronx High School of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, schools in New York State far surpassed those of all
other states, with 145 nominations. Virginia was second with 21
semifinalists, and California had 20.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 finalists, to be selected on Jan. 25, will be offered
visits with scientific luminaries during a week in Washington and
will receive scholarships ranging from $3,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Westinghouse Electric Corp., which had sponsored
what came to be known as the Junior Nobel prizes, severed its ties
to the contest and awards program, choosing to concentrate on its
media businesses. Sponsorship of the program was picked up by the
Intel Corp., a leading maker of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Among the semifinalists from Ward Melville High in Setauket were
Cara Flavia Bonuso, whose paper was titled ``Correlation Between
Parental Relationships and the Optimism of Adolescent Males and
Females,'' and Robert Adam Glaser, who called his paper ``Role of
Bacteria on the Biogeochemical Cycling of Selenium in a Marine
Environment.''
</P>
<P>
   George Baldo, a physiologist who acts as the school's Intel
science program coordinator, said that one of the most important
reasons for the school's science success was the availability of
mentors from the nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory and from the
State University of New York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each student had a mentor who guided the student's project,''
Baldo said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the high schools with the most semifinalists were
Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, Va., with 15, and
Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., with 11.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been administered for 58 years by Science
Service, a nonprofit organization based in Washington that has
promoted public understanding of science through publications,
outreach programs and science education.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Korando, a spokeswoman for Science Service, said the
dominance of New York state in the competition is not new. ``For
the last five years, New York state has accounted for one-third of
the semifinalists and one-third of the finalists,'' she said. ``New
York took hold of the program and has been increasing its success
each year just a little bit.''

 HORMEL NOMINATION SENT BACK TO SENATE  &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  President Clinton has resubmitted his controversial nomination
of San Francisco gay philanthropist James Hormel as ambassador to
Luxembourg.
<P>
   With no fanfare, Clinton tossed Hormel's name back into the ring
last week, defying yearlong Republican opposition that kept the
nomination from coming to a vote during the previous Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, first nominated in October 1997, was targeted by
organizations allied with the Christian right that feared he would
impose a ``gay agenda'' on the tiny grand duchy of 402,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hormel's appointment sailed through the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., refused
to submit the nomination to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we had substantial majority support in the last
Congress,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Monday. ``We
anticipate having comparable support this year, and we believe that
it's only a matter of time before this nomination gets to the floor
and it's approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, said last year they would have voted in favor of Hormel's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's impeachment trial is likely to dominate the
Senate's attention, Toiv said it was unlikely that Hormel's
renomination would escape his critics' notice. The San Franciscan
has to begin the process all over by appearing before the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still believes that the 66-year-old Hormel is the best
person for the job, Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, heir to the Hormel Meat Co. fortune, is a well-known
civic leader in San Francisco and a major contributor to the
Democratic Party. He is active in the fight against AIDS and breast
cancer and is a vocal supporter of gay rights. San Francisco's
upper crust as well as its lesbian and gay community were upset
over his treatment in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While his nomination was pending, Christian right groups led by
the Traditional Values Coalition attacked Hormel's support of gay
causes. He was criticized for donating $500,000 to start what
became the James Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center at the San Francisco
Public Library. The coalition called some of the library materials
obscene and attacked Hormel for refusing to denounce their
inclusion in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, as is customary during a nomination process, declined
comment. But in a letter to the Senate, he said he had no control
over library materials. Even Hormel's pledge not to bring his
domestic partner to Luxembourg held no sway with his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gantman, spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-San
Francisco, said Feinstein will continue to be one of Hormel's most
vocal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator fully supports (the nomination) and really has no
intention of backing off,'' Gantman said. &QL;

JUDGE SAYS RAPPERS AND STATE SHARE BLAME IN A FATAL CRUSH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a blistering decision, a state judge has found New
York state and two well-known rap performers equally responsible
for a 1991 stampede at a City College gymnasium that killed nine
young people and injured 29 others.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision dated Dec. 31 but made public Monday, Judge Louis
C. Benza of the Court of Claims found that the organizers of the
rap event, Sean Combs, a rap impresario and performer known as Puff
Daddy, and Dwight Myers, a performer known as Heavy D, had
``proximately caused'' the injuries and deaths and bore 50 percent
of the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Benza assigned the balance of the blame to New York state,
which runs the City University of New York, the operator of City
College's Nat Holman gymnasium, where the rap event was held.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was ruling in a civil lawsuit for damages, filed by
two men and two women injured in the melee. He has not yet
determined the damage award, and has scheduled a meeting of the
plaintiffs' lawyers and representatives of the defendants for Jan.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lawsuits filed by relatives of those killed in the
stampede were settled in March for $3.8 million, in a case argued
before a different judge.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goidell, a lawyer for Combs, said Benza's ruling did not
apply to his client, but he declined further comment. Lawyers for
the plaintiffs and the state attorney general, however, disagreed,
saying Combs was a party to the suit and was therefore liable.
Alexander P. Hartnett, a lawyer for Myers, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, 1991, a large crowd gathered for a combination rap
concert and celebrity basketball game at the 2,730-seat gymnasium
on the campus, which is at 138th Street and Convent Avenue in
Harlem. Some ticket holders became unruly when they saw the doors
being locked, fearing that they might not get in. The crowd surged
forward against the gym's barred doors, leading to the deaths and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Benza based his 73-page decision on testimony heard at a
five-day trial in March, at which Combs testified. Benza spent much
of his decision excoriating Combs, Myers and the university for the
stampede and absolving the dead and injured of any ``culpable
conduct'' that might have contributed to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take an Einstein,'' Benza wrote at one point, ``to
know that young people attending a rap concert camouflaged as a
`celebrity basketball game,' who have paid as much as $20 a ticket,
would not be very happy and easy to control if they were unable to
gain admission to the event because it was oversold.''
</P>
<P>
   Benza said that after the stampede started, Combs' employees
blocked the gym doors with a table. Another of Combs' employees,
acting as security chief, Benza wrote, ``in a desperate attempt to
keep the people out of the gym, pulled out a gun and assailed the
people with racial epithets.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in the Court of Claims because it is the only
court with jurisdiction when the state itself is a defendant. It is
one of two major suits remaining against the state and the event
organizers. A wrongful death suit is still pending in state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brown, a spokesman for the state Attorney General's
office, which represented City College, said a total of about $3.8
million was paid last year to settle claims by relatives of those
killed, of which 45 percent was paid by the state and 20 percent,
or about $750,000, by Combs. In those settlements, Myers was held
17.5 percent responsible; the Pinkerton agency, a security firm
hired by Combs and Myers, 12.5 percent responsible, and New York
City 5 percent responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Peter A. De Filippis, a lawyer for Nicole Levy, one of the four
injured, who was a 17-year-old college freshman at the time, said
the latest ruling was significant because it put more
responsibility on Combs. Since the City College concert, he has
gone on to make millions in the rap music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous settlements, Combs got off cheap,'' said De
Filippis.

 CLINTON DENIES ALL CHARGES IN SENATE TRIAL  &HT;     By LOUIS FREEDBERG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The battle lines were clearly drawn Monday when
President Clinton sent papers to Congress denying ``each and every
allegation'' that he faces in the impeachment trial that will begin
in earnest later this week.
<P>
   ``The charges in the two articles of impeachment do not permit
the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected
president,'' Clinton's team of 11 lawyers argued in a 13-page brief
filed just 12 minutes before the noon deadline set by the Senate
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in papers filed hours later, House prosecutors insisted that
the evidence against Clinton ``overwhelmingly supports both
charges'' of perjury and obstruction of justice against him.
</P>
<P>
   The document filed by Clinton's lawyers outlined the legal
arguments they will use when the impeachment trial _ only the
second in U.S. history _ gets under way at 1 p.m. EDT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers _ five from a private law firm headed by
his personal attorney, David Kendall, and six from the White House
headed by White House counsel Charles Ruff _ argued that the crimes
Clinton is charged with do not ``rise to the level of high crimes
and misdemeanors`` contemplated by the founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   They disputed that he made ``perjurious, false and misleading
statements'' to a federal grand jury about his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the president specifically acknowledged to
the grand jury that he had an improper intimate relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that the charge that he lied about his
relationship with the former White House intern is ``too vague to
permit conviction and removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorneys noted that the first article does not
identify specific false statements he is alleged to have made.
Instead, they argued, ``the House has left the Senate and president
to guess at what it had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fundamental principles of our law and the
Constitution is that a person has a right to know what specific
charges he or she is facing,'' they said. In addition, Clinton's
legal team argued, ``the law and the Constitution also mandate
adequate notice to jurors so they may know the action they must
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically identifying what false statements they were
referring to, they argue, a trial ``becomes a moving target for the
accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also said the first article is ``fatally
flawed'' because it includes ``multiple instances of alleged false
statements in a single article.''
</P>
<P>
   The article alleges that Clinton made false statements in four
separate areas _ and gives the Senate the option of picking which
one out of the four to find him guilty on.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the White House argues, the president could be
convicted with as few as 17 senators finding him guilty on each of
the four statements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers wrote that it would be possible for the president to
be convicted and removed from office with as few as 17 senators
agreeing that any single statement was perjurious, because 17 votes
for each of the four categories in Article I would yield 68 votes,
one more than necessary to convict and remove.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorneys also rebutted the second article of
impeachment, which charges that he obstructed justice in trying to
cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is accused of trying to influence the testimony of his
secretary Betty Currie, encouraging Lewinsky to file a false
affidavit, and trying to find her a job as a way to buy her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president profoundly regrets his actions, and he has
apologized to his family, his friends and staff and the nation,''
his lawyers wrote. ``But he denies he had any corrupt purpose or
any intent to influence the ongoing grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House alleges that this article, too, is
unconstitutionally vague. ``No reasonable person could know what
specific charges are being leveled against the president,''
Clinton's legal team argued.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, House prosecutors reached starkly different
conclusions. The president, they charged, had engaged in ``an
ongoing pattern of obstruction of justice and witness tampering
extending over several months, which had the effect of seriously
compromising the integrity of the entire judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of his day hosting a state visit with
Argentine President Carlos Menem. In a noticeable departure from
tradition, he decided against holding a joint press conference with
the visiting head of state. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
a press conference would not have been ``a productive use of the
president's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the impeachment trial, said Lockhart, ``will be
going forward in the Senate, and that's where it should go
forward'' _ and not in the press briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides jockeyed for position, two liberal senators filed
a motion requiring that all the trial proceedings be kept open to
the public. Some Republicans have argued that witnesses should be
heard in closed door sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A secret debate is wrong,'' said Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., in a joint statement. ``It's dangerous,
and it's not representative of the open traditions of American
democracy.''

LESS ISN'T MORE FOR FLU-STRICKEN CLOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON, Calif. _ The Clippers' Keith Closs might be the only NBA
player to lose weight unintentionally during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Closs, the 7-foot-3 second-year center, weighed in at a trim 216
pounds Monday during the team's first workout at Veteran's Park
Recreation Center in Carson. That's an unfortunate decrease of four
crucial pounds for the shot-blocking stylist, whose offseason
weight dipped as low as 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the flu,'' he said. ``I was sitting on my butt,
basically. I didn't have any energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when he felt up to it, the highbrow morning pickup
games at UCLA's men's gym didn't seem like much of an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went a couple of times,'' he said, ``but I'm not much of a
morning person.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't prevent Closs from being one of five Clippers to
attend Monday morning's event (ex-Clipper Brent Barry arrived to
facilitate three-on-three battles).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty entertaining for us,'' Closs said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Satisfactory conditioning: Clippers strength and conditioning
coach Johnny Doyle was relatively pleased with the condition of
Monday's fab five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their weight was just about right,'' he said. ``Actually, a
couple of guys didn't come in quite as heavy as we'd hoped (see
Closs item above).''
</P>
<P>
   According to Doyle, the short preparation period is no reason to
accelerate the program.
</P>
<P>
   __ Three-on-three's company: Even if the Clippers HAD a coach,
he wouldn't have been allowed to monitor Monday's workout. Into the
void stepped veteran point guard Pooh Richardson, who organized a
three-on-three showdown. Richardson teamed with swingman Eric
Piatkowski and 7-2 Stojko Vrankovic in this grudge match against
free-agent Barry, 6-11 Lorenzen Wright and Closs.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had ``next.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing from action were guards James ``Hollywood'' Robinson and
Charles Smith and the forward trio of Lamond Murray, Rodney Rogers
and Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a short notice for the guys,'' said Richardson,
attempting to explain the 50 percent attendance of under-contract
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, beginning his 10th NBA season, admits he's a few
miles away from game shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm far from that,'' he said. ``Another week and I'll be at my
fight weight.''

TWO RESERVOIRS: ONE FLOURISHES, BUT THE OTHER FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WANAQUE, N.J. _ The Wanaque Reservoir looks nothing like the
workhorse of northeastern New Jersey's water supply system these
days. Even after a weekend storm, it is only about 32 percent full,
and some sections of it resemble a parched and snowy flatland, with
naked rocky banks, tufts of trees atop exposed mounds, and a few
ice-covered ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, though, was not what New Jersey water officials had
in mind a decade ago when they agreed to spend $200 million on a
pumping system intended to spare both the reservoir and northern
New Jersey severe water shortages well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   And now fretful officials are drafting plans to import emergency
water supplies for the area served by the Wanaque (WAN-a-kew) and
are thinking about ordering restrictions on water use.
</P>
<P>
   They are also openly questioning the adequacy of a project that
its boosters hailed a decade ago as the savior of northern New
Jersey's water supply. In rainy times, the system _ known as
Wanaque South _ relies heavily on a number of huge pumps that pull
water from two nearby rivers _ the Pompton and the Ramapo _ and
transfer it to the reservoir, in effect refilling it, as needed,
for the 2.2 million people who draw water from it.
</P>
<P>
   But because rainfall has been so sparce in recent months, the
rivers have been too low to provide meaningful amounts of new
water. And because a similar shortage occurred in 1995, New Jersey
water officials have started wondering whether the calculations
used in the early 1980s to predict stream flows into the Pompton
and Ramapo during long dry spells were too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   All across the region, rainfall totals were well below average
throughout the second half of 1998. But the impact on water
supplies has varied widely; almost all of Connecticut's reservoirs
are doing well, for instance, while the Wanaque and the reservoirs
that serve New York City are far below average. And the rain and
snow of recent days did little to help matters.
</P>
<P>
   On average, New York's three reservoir systems received 1.14
inches precipitation last Friday and Saturday and are now about
51.4 percent full. Normally in early January, they are at 80
percent of capacity, said Cathy DelliCarpini, a spokeswoman for New
York City's Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DelliCarpini said city officials now expect to declare a
``drought watch'' by the end of the month. Under that policy,
officials will intensify appeals to New Yorkers to conserve water
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   On average, northeastern New Jersey's 13 reservoirs, which
include the Wanaque, are also about half full, and like New York
City's, are about 30 percentage points below normal for early
January.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's next step in its campaign to save water could
include restrictions on some outdoor use of water. Such an order
could come in about a month unless reservoir levels improve
markedly, New Jersey officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   As some water officials look at what steps need to be taken to
conserve supplies, others are re-evaluating the assumptions that
led to the Wanaque pumping project. Paul Schorr, a research
scientist in New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection,
said the pumping project was based on figures on stream flow in
northern New Jersey between 1921 and 1979, when the design work
started. He called the 58-year record the best and most
comprehensive data available for the entire watershed of the two
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he conceded that 58 years was a ``very
short period'' to use for calculations of rainfall and stream flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than likely we can experience wetter or drier years
than what's in the record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, while the Wanaque falters, a similar-sized
reservoir in the region, the Barkhamsted in northwestern
Connecticut, is flourishing this winter. Things are far simpler for
the Barkhamsted. While each reservoir holds about 30 billion
gallons when full, the Barkhamsted serves 400,000 people in
Hartford and 11 surrounding suburban towns. The Wanaque serves 2.2
million people in several cities, including Newark and Paterson,
and scores of suburban communities.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wanaque has been unable to meet its safe yield because
of low flow in the rivers, average daily demand of 55 million
gallons from the Barkhamsted has remained well within its yield of
77 million gallons a day, according to the Metropolitan District
Commission, which manages the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Barkhamsted are quick to point out that it has
longed lived by the slogan that the Barkhamsted can survive for two
years without a drop of rain.

SMOKING BAN HAS NOT HURT RESTAURANTS, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the city banned smoking in restaurants in 1995,
restaurateurs have complained that the prohibition is bad for
business. On Monday, a group of academic researchers, admittedly
anti-smoking ones, released a series of six analyses suggesting
that the ban has not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law, which took
effect on April 10, 1995, has had no effect on local sales, job
growth or income. The studies, which were financed by the Substance
Abuse Policy Research Program, which receives money from the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, showed that restaurant industry jobs rose
18 percent from 1993 to 1997, to 19,347.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at
restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the
state. The number of restaurants in the city during that period
increased 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the researchers characterized their work
as the first comprehensive look at the city's ban on smoking in
restaurants with 35 or more seats. They said earlier studies
suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local officials can now go about their business of protecting
the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying
about this phony issue,'' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, who wrote an
editorial accompanying the articles, which are published in the
January issue of Public Health Management and Practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Neal, who owns O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street,
near Lincoln Center, supported the ban, saying it has helped his
business. ``If 75 percent of people don't smoke and 25 percent do,
that means 75 percent are going to eat out more and 25 percent are
going to eat out less,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the restaurant industry took sharp issue with the
studies' methodology and conclusions. Scott Wexler, executive
director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a
trade group, said in an interview that his group sponsored a study
in 1996 that showed jobs at city restaurants declining 4 percent.
He said that since his group's study examined statistics for the
months just before and after the law took effect, it could isolate
more fairly the ``cataclysmic'' influence of the smoking ban on
business.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said his group's study showed retail jobs going up 2
percent at the same time that restaurant jobs dropped 4 percent,
suggesting that something beyond general economic trends was at
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Tubridy, who owns Pier 92, a restaurant in Rockaway Beach,
Queens, said in an interview that he lost customers immediately.
``They said that if they couldn't eat at my place they were going
to Nassau County, pure and simple,'' he said. ``And you know what
happens? They don't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler also pointed out that 8,000 of 15,000 restaurants
included in the overall sales tax figures were small enough to
allow smoking or were primarily bars, where smoking is also
allowed. The study conducted by Dr. Andrew Hyland, a
biostatistician, and two colleagues at Roswell Park Cancer
Institute in Buffalo, acknowledged this limitation.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant trade group is heavily supported by the Tobacco
Institute, which recently admitted funneling $443,072 to the group,
after earlier claiming a far lower amount. The money was used to
lobby the state Legislature for less stringent laws than the
city's.
</P>
<P>
   The studies also concluded that the law has been enforced very
effectively. An examination of city records, one study said, showed
that city health inspectors found smoking at only 2 percent of the
251 restaurants they visited. Another study indicated that 90
percent of restaurant owners reported that their indoor areas were
smoke-free. Three out of four restaurateurs reported that complying
with the law cost them no money.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers said the next step would be a dual effort:
to pass laws like the city's in other counties, and to extend the
city law to bars, both those within restaurants and free-standing
ones. ``A bar is a workplace,'' said Dr. John Seffin, chief
executive of the American Cancer Society. ``You should not be
allowed to smoke in a workplace.''

HUSKIES MAKE SPLASH BY THROWING BIG CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you're still groping for perspective on how the new
Husky football coach is worth almost twice as much as the old
coach, who was already the state's highest paid employee, consider
this comparison.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA trumpeted the fact over the weekend that the contract of
head coach Bob Toledo was extended for seven years for an average
of $578,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say about us,'' said UW faculty representative
Robert Aronson, ``when our deal is twice that?''
</P>
<P>
   Aronson, a member of the search committee that chose Rick
Neuheisel, said it proudly. Indeed, any embarrassment over paying a
college football coach more than $1 million annually was nowhere in
evidence at the Tyee Center on Monday, where boosters,
administrators and staffers strutted about while showing off the
wunderkind coach.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the money is almost as big a point as the competency of
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be a splash,'' Aronson said. ``No one (on the
committee) talked in terms of a million dollars, but there's no
denying it had emotional impact. Immediately around the country,
there was a big boost.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same national spike accorded the Seahawks with the
hiring of Mike Holmgren for an NFL-record coaching salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel,'' Aronson said. ``It's not just Holmgren,
as good a coach as he is. It's the statement it makes about
commitment to winning and success. We wanted to get that kind of
boost. If Holmgren likes being there, you have to imagine that a
lot of other good coaches and players would join him.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Microsoft effect _ insistence upon the best and
brightest, regardless of budget or consequences. The prime
directive is to make the strong stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The high-priced hires of two coaches at the top of their sports
are further signs of Seattle's dramatically changed sports
landscape. Holmgren and Neuheisel are the latest renovations
symbolic of the old hippie joint gone high-end condo.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, in the 1980s, Seattle's three mediocre pro sports
franchises had out-of-state ownerships and played in minimalist
facilities. Husky football and men's basketball had some success,
but were led by reserved personalities in Don James and Marv
Harshman, and played in pre-World War II buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Now the three teams are locally owned and have expensive new,
publicly financed facilities. The Mariners and Sonics made serious
runs at championships, and the Seahawks appear on the verge. The
University of Washington jockyards will soon undergo a $70 million
facelift. Neuheisel joins men's basketball coach Bob Bender in a
youthful, dynamic makeover of the athletic persona.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's historic Scandinavian aversion to ostentatious
displays of wealth is as over as the Dog House restaurant. The
sports scene is a high-stepping, big-time scene. Turn in the
tie-dye for black tie.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever misgivings some might have about the change, the
expensive commitment to big-time success (with the notable
exception of the Mariners) is irrefutable, as well as the point of
spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   Grandiosity was at the core of the Neuheisel signing. According
to Aronson, Neuheisel wants to emulate Steve Spurrier, the highly
successful Florida coach who is pulling down an industry-high $2.2
million annual stipend.
</P>
<P>
   ``His goal is to be talked about in the same way as Spurrier,''
he said. ``We're not going to get Spurrier, but we talked to a lot
of people about Neuheisel, both his coaching ability and his
recruiting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players say he's the best. Several said they almost went (to
Colorado) because of him, but wanted to play in the Pac-10. He's
young and incredibly bright and won't make the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked out of the room, (the search committee) said,
`We gotta get him here.'''
</P>
<P>
   To make it happen, Washington had to supply him with cover for
the inevitable nuking he would receive in Colorado. As it almost
always is, the firewall was cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If I leave a job as good as Colorado and my
reputation is attacked, the deal here has to be so much better that
no one would question my decision,''' Aronson said. ``He felt that
if this was to be the premier program in the Pac-10, the salary has
to reflect it. If the deal wasn't a blockbuster, people would
question why he would leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies acquiesced, almost gleefully. The football-generated
revenue was there, and so were the humiliating losses in the Jim
Lambright tenure. One could fix the other, in the minds of athletic
director Barbara Hedges and the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to lose, but it's another to look like you
don't belong on the same field with Nebraska,'' Aronson said.
``Heck, we didn't look like we belonged on the same field with Air
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the loss of Husky pride, the budget dent was
nothing. If the salary is removed from the university context and
put where it belongs, in the realm of pro sports, it really is
nothing _ Neuheisel's stipend is about half what the Mariners are
scheduled to pay Bobby Ayala this season, and a quarter of what the
Sonics will give Jim McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   The guess is the Huskies will get the bigger bang on their
investment. Besides, the UW will have to pay it only until
Neuheisel is named head coach of the expansion franchise the NFL
puts in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the big time, that's how the game is played.

IN CAPITAL CASE, MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO 2ND-DEGREE MURDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A murder defendant whose case led New York's highest
court to restrict plea deals under the state's death penalty law
pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Michael Shane Hale, 26, admitted Monday that he had
murdered the victim, Stefen Tanner, 62, a businessman he had been
living with, in October 1995. He also pleaded guilty to kidnapping
and robbing the victim, and will receive a total sentence of 50
years to life for the three charges, meaning that he will be
eligible for parole in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the
law that allowed a capital defendant to avoid the risk of execution
by pleading guilty to first-degree murder and accepting a sentence
of life without parole. That arrangement was unconstitutional, the
court ruled, because it unfairly penalized defendants who exercised
their right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's plea arrangement was possible, defense lawyers and
prosecutors said, because the Court of Appeals ruling did not
prevent a defendant in a capital case from pleading guilty to the
lesser charge of second-degree murder, which does not carry the
possibility of execution.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence for second-degree murder, without
conviction for any other crime, is 25 years to life in prison,
which means a possibility of parole in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the Brooklyn district attorney's office have said
that Hale and the victim, Tanner, were apparently lovers, but that
their relationship turned bitter when Tanner became angry over
Hale's excessive purchases on the older man's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, fighting back tears as he described his crime,
told Justice Albert Tomei in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn on
Monday that as he robbed Tanner of money and his car keys in the
garage of the victim's Sheepshead Bay apartment building, he
smashed the older man's head on the concrete floor, then put him in
the car's trunk. He also admitted that he placed a plastic bag over
Tanner's head and face while the victim was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant district attorney, Kyle Reeves, told the judge
that, with Tanner dead or dying in the trunk, Hale drove to
Lexington, Ky., where he dismembered Tanner's body.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, had made the
Hale case the first death penalty case brought by a New York City
prosecutor after the state reimposed capital punishment in 1995. He
said the Tanner family supported the deal because it permitted them
to avoid the trauma of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Capital Defender Office, which represented Hale,
said in a statement that a death sentence was inappropriate in the
case because it was ``a penalty reserved for the worst of the
worst, not a penalty to be used in a tragic domestic dispute.''

BILL WOULD EXTEND PROTECTION TO ABORTION CLINIC WORKERS AND
CLIENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Spurred by the recent killing of a Buffalo doctor
who performed abortions, the Democratic leaders of the state
Assembly on Monday proposed legislation intended to protect
employees and clients of abortion clinics from harassment and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, modeled largely on the 1994 federal law that
makes it a crime to block access to medical facilities, would
impose a prison sentence of up to four years for anyone convicted
of ``attempting to injure, intimidate or interfere with'' a person
entering an abortion clinic. It would also allow prosecutors and
the state's attorney general to seek civil fines against anyone who
blocks access to a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the 1994 federal law, the bill proposed Monday would
also protect employees and clients of abortion clinics from
harassment and violence at their homes. That provision was drafted
in direct response to the slaying of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian of
Buffalo, who was shot in October by a sniper who hid in a wooded
field behind his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the battleground to insure a woman's right to
health-care services has now been extended from the health clinic
to the homes of those who work in them,'' Sheldon Silver, the
Speaker of the Assembly, said as he unveiled the legislation
Monday. ``This bill says clearly that we will not tolerate violence
against health-care workers where they work or live. Their lives
and the lives of their families must not be placed at risk simply
because they seek to provide women their constitutionally protected
right to health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the proposal has any chance of becoming law this year
remains unclear. The Democrats in the Assembly have passed some
version of the bill each year since 1993, only to see it defeated
in the Republican-controlled Senate each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the Senate responded coolly to the
latest version Monday, releasing a statement that noted it is
already a crime to harass or physically harm people entering
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   But both abortion-rights advocates and some Assembly Democrats
expressed optimism that a bill would be enacted this year, largely
because Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, said a few months ago
that he intends to propose his own legislation to address the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's decision to take on the issue comes as he seeks to
raise his stature as a potential candidate for national office. To
that end, he has often sided with moderates in his party who
contend that the Republicans can no longer afford to be viewed as
intractable opponents of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides declined to comment on the Assembly proposal
Monday, other than to say that his administration was working on
its own version of the proposal. But abortion-rights advocates
called on him to urge Senate Republicans to enact the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal opposition to the Assembly plan came from
conservatives. Michael R. Long, the president of the Conservative
Party, asserted that such legislation would interfere with the
rights of abortion opponents, who often pray and picket in front of
clinics. He has also questioned the need for a state bill when
federal legislation is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on a slippery slope of damaging and interfering
with the Constitution,'' he said. ``We are attempting to take away
the right of people to peacefully demonstrate.''

THE ART OF SERVICE IN THE SERVICE OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Maine)  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Houghton describes himself as ``this guy from
upstate New York,'' which is like calling the Metropolitan Museum
of Art that place with the pictures. True, Houghton grew up in tiny
Corning, but in a huge brick pile (his description) that looked
down on the family glass works. That was Corning Inc., founded by
his great-great-grandfather, who manufactured the first light bulb
for Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding Houghtons naturally ran the place and performed, as
expected, in public service. Houghton's grandfather, Alanson
Houghton, was ambassador to Germany under President Harding. His
father, Amory, was ambassador to France under President Eisenhower.
His brother, Amory Jr., is a member of the House of Representatives
and one of only five Republicans who opposed impeaching President
Clinton. Houghton's cousin, Arthur, was also a chairman of the
Metropolitan Museum and built the Houghton Library at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   One could go on, but one gets the idea.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly a shock, then, that James Houghton (pronounced
HO-ton), 62, who retired as chairman of Corning in 1996, is the new
Met chairman. He was more or less born to be Met chairman, even if
he lives most of the week in Corning. ``I suppose I could be useful
for a few rifle shots,'' Houghton said last week, describing how he
might aim at some potential donors. (The Met still needs $100
million to reach a $400 million fund-raising goal.) Philippe de
Montebello, the Met's director and chief executive officer, who was
in the same class at Harvard (1958) as Houghton, describes his new
boss as ``the kind of person you notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, there is a big dinner at the Met's Temple of
Dendur celebrating the changing of the guard. The new guard is
Houghton and David McKinney, the incoming president; the old guard
is Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the museum's outgoing board chairman and
chairman emeritus of New York Times Co., and William Leurs, the
outgoing Met president. Houghton described the event as ``the whole
smorgasbord.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Houghton talked for an hour or so in his very nice
Fifth Avenue office at Steuben, long owned by Corning. Up close,
Houghton looked very much indeed like a Met chairman, who serves as
the Sun King in the firmament of the city's cultural institutions:
slicked-back silver hair, red polka dot suspenders, monogrammed
blue striped shirt, big smile. Houghton is in the Ben Bradlee mold
of charismatic old-line WASP, although he isn't as outrageous as
the former Washington Post editor. Still, if Houghton asked you for
$500,000, and you had it, you might hand it over. One of his
principle tasks at the Met will be raising money. ``The place is
insatiable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I will not go to 200 black tie dinners a year,'' Houghton
announced. ``Philippe and I sat down and looked at the calendar and
divided it into things you've got to do, things that it would be
nice to do if you're in town and things _ forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton is in town with his wife, Maisie Houghton, two or three
nights a week, in an apartment on Central Park West and 72nd
Street. He said his biggest problem as Met chairman will be making
up for the $11 million shortfall in dividend cuts in the Reader's
Digest shares that the Met was given by Lila Acheson Wallace. Aside
from that, ``You've got to watch to keep your place at the top of
the pinnacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant event of Houghton's past occurred in 1993,
when he stepped off a curb during a meeting in Colonial
Williamsburg, Va., and was nearly killed when he was hit by a car.
The accident crushed his right leg, seriously injured his head and
kept him in the hospital for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to drill in and take the fluid out of the brain,''
Houghton said. ``Everybody says, `Jeez, what a terrible thing.' And
I say, `I'm so happy to be here I can't tell you.''' He held out
his right leg. ``All that's new,'' he said, pointing from the knee
down. ``The bone is now a metal insert, some sort of stainless
steel. I haven't kicked off any metal detectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton's rehabilitation from the accident was long and
difficult, and he still walks stiffly, with a cane. He has had to
give up downhill skiing and golf. Many of his friends say the
accident was a turning point, and caused him to step down as
chairman of Corning, where he was often described as a visionary
leader, to pursue work in education and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife counter that he had always planned to step down
when he turned 60, after 13 years in the job. The rehabilitation,
Maisie Houghton said, ``just sort of reinforced the Jamie-ness of
him. He just behaved completely in character. He's a person of
enormous energy, and he absolutely attacked it. He's not this
gorgeous athlete, but at 60 you don't really care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houghtons have two grown children and of course know lots of
people in the city. Houghton calls Annette de la Renta ``a dear old
friend,'' and claims Betsy Gotbaum, president of the New York
Historical Society _ he calls her B.G., an old nickname for Bad
Girl _ as a former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met at some WASP thing,'' Ms. Gotbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houghtons spend summers in Dark Harbor, Maine, where
Houghton has served for years as the master of ceremonies for the
Dark Harbor Dog Show.

TITANIC STILL MIGHTY AS MONEY MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``Titanic'' money machine just keeps on
rolling: video sales have now pushed total revenues past $3.2
billion, a previously unheard-of level for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox said Monday that overseas video sales have
topped $30 million while Paramount confirmed that more than 25
million copies have been sold domestically. The combined worldwide
total has dethroned ``The Lion King's'' 3-year-old record of almost
56 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount said the double-cassette version of ``Titanic,'' which
first hit U.S. store shelves Sept. 1, generated more than $500
million in domestic video revenues. Fox, which began selling the
tapes in Australia on Sept. 30, gave no estimate for revenues but
industry trackers believe overseas sales have hit 32 million copies
with revenues near $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   As with the film and soundtrack album, the ``Titanic'' video
outperformed analysts' expectations. ``It definitely did better
than we thought it would,'' said Barbara McNamara, an analyst with
Alexander &AMP; Associates. ``This title had a lot of family appeal and
we had thought the appeal would be narrower, mostly to
teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   The film grossed $600 million at U.S. theaters for Paramount and
$1.21 billion overseas for Fox. The soundtrack, released by Sony
Classical, sold 9.2 million copies domestically and 17.6 million
overseas, generating an additional $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Paramount took in $30 million from the sale of
domestic TV rights to NBC in a deal made before the film became a
hit. The price turned out to be a bargain in light of deals for
less successful movies such as $80 million for ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park'' and $55 million for ``Men In Black.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is expected to generate even more revenue in the
months ahead. There remain several sources of additional
``Titanic'' revenues _ U.S. stores, which received only 30 million
copies prior to Christmas; foreign stores in territories such as
China where the video has not yet been released; foreign TV rights;
and DVD, though Paramount has yet to disclose if it will release a
DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ```Titanic' is poised to continue its extraordinary sales
momentum this year and for years to come, given the sales longevity
it has already demonstrated in four months of release,'' said Eric
Doctorow, president of Paramount's home video operations.

ERICKSON RAISES EYEBROWS WITH OSU MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is difficult at this time to know whether to
applaud Dennis Erickson or worry about the soundness of his mental
capacity. However, we suppose we can look at the news this way:
</P>
<P>
   As the new head football coach at Oregon State, the only way for
Erickson to go is up ... unless he makes another surprise
announcement that what he really wants is to be tight ends coach at
Everett Pop Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about news. Goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 51, will be crowned King of the Beavers this morning
in Corvallis, just 15 days after the Everett native was released
from his duties as head coach of the Seahawks _ a team that now has
been catapulted into the stratosphere by the hiring of Super
Bowl-ring adorned Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   And just Monday, that deal was checkmated by the blockbuster
hiring of Rick Neuheisel by the University of Washington _ a place
where Erickson was never a candidate after his fellow Everett buddy
Jim Lambright was summarily dismissed 13 days ago because, as
athletic director Barbara Hedges declared, the future of Husky
football was at stake. And rightly so, we might add.
</P>
<P>
   For Erickson, who also was passed over as an offensive
coordinator candidate in Philadelphia and who did not get a call
for any of the myriad other NFL openings across the land, one has
to wonder if his latest career move is a case of how far the mighty
have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Or, is it possible that this Beavers job is an honorable,
laudable act of professional sincerity on the part of Erickson for
which all of us cynical, judgmental armchair quarterbacks should be
ashamed of questioning?
</P>
<P>
   The man wants to coach.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, Erickson wants a very-close-to-home
opportunity to stick it to the people who he must feel sold him
short during his embattled Seahawks tenure _ Behrings, Whitsitts,
media and all.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about the move, Erickson should not worry about image.
There will always be a list of famous people whose backslide into
embarrassment or oblivion totally outstrips Erickson's startling
decision to take over a resurgent Oregon State program.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Tarkenton went from Vikings legend to TV huckster. Top-40
stars Eddie Money and Joan Jett are now regulars at Parkers Casino
on Aurora Avenue North. Milli Vanilli went from Grammy winners to
music industry outcasts. Rep. Bob Livingston went from designated
Speaker of the House to admitted adulterer and congressional
resignee. The Mariners went from AL West champs to ... well ... you
get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   That Erickson decided to jump at the chance to coach again, near
home, for a Pac-10 program that, rightly or wrongly, not only has
been the conference doormat but the subject of ridicule is, yes, a
serious head-scratcher.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly Erickson is not fazed by the warps of perception his
move creates. For instance, Erickson the fallen NFL coach is now
following in the footsteps of Mike Riley, a 45-year-old
up-and-comer who will get his shot in San Diego. After faltering in
Seattle, Erickson did not get the call to lead the Ryan Leaf era in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Erickson doesn't care about image or perception. How
could he? Now, if he really has a sense of humor, he would hire
Lambright as his defensive coordinator and the two of them could
wreak havoc in the Pac-10 _ to say nothing of what the reaction
would be in Montlake.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone who would bet against Erickson in a duel against
Neuheisel, at least at this point?
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it is time to circle Oct. 9 on your calendars. The
Huskies and their photogenic, guitar-strummin' new coach will head
to Corvallis then for a date with Erickson and the Beavs.
</P>
<P>
   Lights out, fellas. Air Erickson just might be seeking his
little bit of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Erickson's choice must raise some eyebrows, at least. I
mean, no one charts a career path that goes from two national
championships at Miami to an NFL head coach in your hometown to a
job with the Beavers. Not on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   From a Vandal to a Cowboy to a Cougar to a Hurricane to a
Seahawk to a Beaver. Erickson isn't building a resume. He's
collecting clues for Pictionary. But, God bless him. He's got a
sense of humor. And maybe he thinks this is the way he can have the
last laugh on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaver bandwagon looks to gain a few passengers this season.
A questionable call by Erickson does not diminish the wild
entertainment possibilities that now lie head.
</P>
<P>
   What a week.

BEST AND WORST OF SEASON'S FIRST HALF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ It's half over.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hit the midpoint of their 82-game schedule Monday
night in San Jose, and those teams that haven't yet reached the
center stripe soon will. Here's a look at some of the more
interesting aspects of the first half of the season:
</P>
<P>
   __ Worst trash talk: In a 3-3 tie with San Jose, New Jersey
defenseman Scott Stevens told the Sharks' Brantt Myhres, who has
undergone treatment for alcohol abuse, to ``have another beer''
before the start of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Stevens) hit (Sharks winger Jeff) Friesen, and I said,
`Why don't you pick on somebody bigger?' '' Myhres said. ``He came
back with a comment on alcohol. That's pretty classy when your
buddy two seats down (Ken Daneyko) has the same problem. But that's
the mentality of Scott Stevens. An idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens didn't deny making the remarks. Come to think of it, he
didn't deny being an idiot, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you say things you regret, but I don't need him
yelling at me,'' Stevens said. ``Yeah, he's been through some tough
times, but sometimes you should be happy to be in the league. He's
had a lot of chances.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Best career turnaround: At 32, Kings left wing Luc Robitaille
seemed to be on the downside of his career, a former 50-goal scorer
reduced to a 20-goal man. He needed 22 goals to reach 500 this
season, and it figured he'd be racing the schedule to try to hit
the milestone before the end of the season in April.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Robitaille scored No. 500 last week, and suddenly, 600
doesn't seem far away.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best team: The Dallas Stars are nearing the season's midpoint
with only seven losses. This doesn't mean they will win the Stanley
Cup or develop into a dynasty, and they won't match the
accomplishment of the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens, who went 60-8-12
and won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worst team: Tampa Bay also is the team to beat, in an
entirely different sense. After all, everyone beats the Lightning _
except for the Kings, victims in two of Tampa Bay's nine victories.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best holdout: Vancouver's Pavel Bure has taken his puck and
gone home, even though his contract calls for him to be paid about
$8 million this season. Passing up that much money makes him either
a man of principle or a psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Vancouver general manager Brian Burke has been in no
rush to trade him. We've heard this before, but Burke lately has
hinted the end to the stalemate could be near. The Kings have been
one of Bure's rumored potential destinations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best Pinocchio: The Carolina Hurricanes signed center Ron
Francis, who is 35, to a contract that will pay him $5 million this
year. Francis has responded by being a minus player, and is on pace
to produce less than half as many points as the 87 he had last year
with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford insists he's completely
satisfied with the return on his expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we looked at Ronnie Francis coming here and
scoring a lot of points,'' Rutherford said. ``Given his age, about
a 50-point season is what we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coolest tantrum on earth: Colorado coach Bob Hartley replaced
goalie Patrick Roy with Craig Billington during a game against the
Mighty Ducks last month, because Hartley wanted to stall to give
his power-play unit a chance to catch its collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche scored the winning goal while Billington was in
the game, giving him the victory and not Roy. Roy responded
afterward by reportedly smashing two televisions and a VCR in the
coaches' room.
</P>
<P>
   __ Briefest dynasty: The Phoenix Coyotes began the season
14-2-2. They are 8-8-3 since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wakeup call for every single player on the team,''
right wing Shane Doan said after last week's 7-1 home-ice loss to
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. The Coyotes lost the next night 4-1 to the Mighty
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Best fight: During a recent Phoenix practice, teammates
Jeremy Roenick and Oleg Tverdovsky dropped their gloves two times.
Roenick was upset with mistakes Tverdovsky had made.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never like to see stuff like that happen,'' Roenick said.
`That's not something that should be involved in a team game. But
unfortunately, it does happen and sometimes, it needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Worst Michael Jordan: It's not Vincent Lecavalier's fault
that before the season, Tampa Bay owner Art Williams pegged his top
rookie as Air on Ice (``the Michael Jordan of hockey''). Wouldn't
want to put any pressure on the kid, now would you, Art?
</P>
<P>
   Lecavalier is averaging less than one point every three games,
which is about what is to be expected of just about any 18-year-old
whose last name is not Gretzky or Lemieux. &QL; 
MIDSEASON TOP 5
</P>
<P>
   1. Dallas: Stars will finish first overall for second straight
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Buffalo: Balanced, gritty Sabres have more going for them
than Hasek. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. New Jersey: Another strong year, but will they fizzle again
in the playoffs? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Philadelphia: Is this the year Lindros silences his
doubters? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix: Coyotes miss injured Tkachuk and their strong start
is fading into memory. &QL; 
MIDSEASON BOTTOM 5
</P>
<P>
   5. Canada: Toronto, Ottawa only north-of-border teams above
.500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. New York: Nedved, Palffy haven't turned around Rangers,
Islanders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Washington: Nice job building on last season's trip to
Stanley Cup finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicago: Tony Amonte has more than one-quarter of Hawks'
goals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Tampa Bay: At least Lightning gets to play host to All-Star
Game.

NEUHEISEL PROVIDES CHARMING ENCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Rick Neuheisel wowed 'em Monday in his introductory
news conference as University of Washington football coach, but
then, that's what Neuheisel does.
</P>
<P>
   He said all the right things about the school, the city, the
football program, ex-coaches Don James and Jim Lambright, and about
getting a million dollars a year to direct a football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who finds a way,'' he told an overflow gathering of
press, UW staffers and boosters in the Don James Center at Husky
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He was flanked by the woman who hired him, athletic director
Barbara Hedges, and her boss, UW president Richard McCormick.
Disarming and photogenic, Neuheisel seemed to charm an audience
waiting to be charmed.
</P>
<P>
   He had already impressed four days earlier, when he walked into
a 42nd-floor conference room in the City Center Building downtown
as the mystery candidate to an interview panel of eight assembled
by Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   There was faculty athletic representative Rob Aronson; former
players Rick Redman (1962-64) and Carver Gayton (1957-59); Hedges'
associate director, Ralph Bayard; businessman Ron Crockett;
attorney Wayne Gittinger; sports information director Jim Daves;
and associate director for external affairs Gary Barta.
</P>
<P>
   They had interviewed a candidate daily: Idaho's Chris Tormey on
Monday; ex-Texas coach John Mackovic on Tuesday; Toledo's Gary
Pinkel on Wednesday. Hedges was maintaining secrecy, never naming
the next day's candidate, but they knew that Tormey and Pinkel, as
scions of the James coaching tree, were locks to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two very fine candidates,'' Crockett called Tormey and Pinkel.
``I think from Barbara Hedges' standpoint, they would have been a
`safe' decision. They never would have been criticized, by any
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both, in their interviews, had data that Don (James) would
have followed, a mission statement which would have been fairly
common. I had difficulty in my mind separating the two. Matter of
fact, I couldn't even picture the interview today with one of those
two fellows.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Hedges left them with this teaser:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a mystery candidate tomorrow,'' she said.
``When you show up, you'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the panel received the usual folder of background
information on the day's guest. And then Neuheisel, 37, finally
coaxed by Hedges to interview, walked in the door from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have guessed in a million years,'' Crockett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous, quite frankly, not to belittle any other
candidate. This gentleman was above and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Thursday's session, members of the panel clasped
hands together in a vow of secrecy. Crockett says Hedges never
discussed money. Hedges called panel members Friday to inform them
she was going after Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Hedges could speak only in general terms of Neuheisel's
contract, saying it was for seven years at ``approximately a
million dollars a year,'' broken into university salary; outside
income such as radio and TV money and a share of the school's Nike
contract; and team incentives, such as postseason play or Bowl
Championship Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is how much of the contract is guaranteed;
Lambright's four-year rollover was guaranteed only for a year.
Hedges said she and Neuheisel had agreed only ``in principle'' on
the contract, adding, ``We haven't crossed that bridge yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Again defending the size of the contract, McCormick stressed
that no state money is involved and said, ``To get the very best,
you have to play in, and pay in, the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel has been scorched in the Denver-area media, some of
which say he has been disingenuous, an average coach and a weak
recruiter in his home territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had a saying,'' Neuheisel observed. ``The higher you go
on the ladder, the more your rear end is exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett scoffs at the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he said. ``You have a divorce, what does the wife
say? `He's a nice guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's new salary package, roughly a 67-percent increase
over what he earned at Colorado, is evidence of the difference he
sees in the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Huskies are a `have' in the Pac-10,'' he said. ``There are
haves and there are have-nots. There is not going to be a want for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Colorado it was difficult to get things moving. It was
slow, arduous, and as a result, it became frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, it is clear Neuheisel hopes to incorporate the best
parts of Washington's past in his plan. He is bringing back gold
helmets, and he has conferred with James and Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told both of them, I want to kiss the ring to make sure
I'm allowed into this family,'' Neuheisel said. ``Both of them were
extremely gracious. This is obviously a difficult time for
(Lambright). I wanted to make sure he understood I wasn't changing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel arose at 6:30 a.m. Monday and strolled the grounds
around the UW, perhaps envisioning next September, when the noise
at Husky Stadium will reverberate again and the crowds will
anticipate a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the right thing, the right place, at the right
time,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   At, he might have added, the right price.

NEW DISNEY WEB SERVICE A `GO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The information superhighway is getting an on-ramp
at Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Walt Disney Co. and partner Infoseek Corp. are
launching their easy-to-remember Go Network ``portal'' service at a
coming-out party at ABC Studios in New York City today.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to lure customers and advertisers from established
sites such as Yahoo! and America Online. It's the most aggressive
Web move so far by a traditional media giant and, according to
analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones, it's a move Disney has to
make given the current frenzy over Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the Internet stocks,'' she said. ``People have
accepted the idea the Internet will be the next new wave so Disney
needs to be there. There's not a lot of money being made but that's
not to say there won't be in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Disney shareholders got a taste of the Internet mania
that has swept through Wall Street recently. Disney shares gained
$2.8175 to $35.375 after ING Barings Furman Selz analyst Stewart
Halpern said Wall Street wasn't accounting for Disney's ``hidden''
Internet assets such as Go.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek got an even bigger jump, adding $32.675 to finish at
$87.75.
</P>
<P>
   But just because it's Disney doesn't make it a slam dunk.
``There will only be three to four portal winners and AOL and
Yahoo! are ahead of the pack,'' said Forrester Research analyst
Chris Charron. ``Go will be formidable but they still have a ways
to go. Building a new brand and portal is not easy or
inexpensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Disney nor Infoseek is a Web unknown, ranking eighth and
ninth in traffic separately and a strong fourth combined. ``On day
one, we're in a dead heat for the three spot with the power of
Disney brand names,'' said Barak Berkowitz, senior vice president
and general manager of Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, with annual revenues of $22 billion, brings an efficient
marketing machine that promotes theme parks, a movie studio, a
cruise line, TV networks and plush toys. It plunged into cyberspace
in June, swapping $70 million and its own Internet company for 43
percent of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like any of the portals, they're going to have to put a
lot of marketing muscle into it to make it successful,'' Bannister
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney wants to make it easier to jump to its sites like
Disney.com, ESPN.com and ABCNews.com, where consumers can buy
Disney goods and receive reinforcement of the brands _ another
facet in Disney's much-copied ``synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   But directing customers toward those sites is tricky. If the
companies' month-old test site is any indication, Disney and
Infoseek figures surfers don't want to be overwhelmed by Mickey
Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh every time they hop on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to make the name Disney-agnostic,''
Charron said. ``Users and partners might be turned off if the
portal were too Disney-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz said Go's key task is to build the brand. ``The Web is
about diversity and choice, so Go.com is not a portal for Disney,''
he added. ``There aren't mouse ears all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The test site offers free e-mail, stock quotes and ``follow-me''
tabs to move quickly between pages. Go will replace the Infoseek
brand with five content areas _ news, sports, entertainment, family
and money _ and 18 channels. Its guardian feature allows parents to
block out adult content.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have strong properties, strong technology and tremendous
off-line marketing so they have all the pieces,'' Charron said.
``But it's tough to cover 20 different channels. It can be
expensive to create or license all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The analyst pointed out that many portals lose money. ``Very few
have made any money besides Yahoo! or AOL; in many cases, they've
lost a lot of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz believes building a portal from scratch will pay off
because it contains features to cut the mind-numbing delays that
make Web-surfing a chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that the whole portal business happened by
accident with one feature becoming popular and the rest of services
being bolted on,'' he said. ``So by building from the ground up, it
allows the site to be simpler, more powerful with better integrated
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that experienced users will notice improved
performance while novices will be attracted by ease of use and
highly recognized names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people use one portal site,'' Berkowitz said. ``As
with TV, people are willing to sample a show from another network,
so it's reasonable to pull people from other portals. No one in
this business thinks they own customers.''

`ENEMY' STAR HAS FRIENDS IN MUSIC BIZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actor-rapper Will Smith wasn't just jiggy, he was
downright happy Monday when the American Music Awards presented him
with three top honors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said backstage that comic Jerry Seinfeld actually helped
make his single, ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit' It,'' a catch-phrase by
mentioning it on his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you started hearing newscasters and people saying it,''
said Smith, star of the current box office hit ``Enemy of the
State.'' ``It kind of took off and here we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who started his career as rapper Fresh Prince and later
starred in TV and movies, won in the favorite pop-rock album
category for ``Big Willie Style,'' as well as favorite male
soul-r&AMP;b singer and favorite soul-r&AMP;b album.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour 26th annual awards ceremony was broadcast on ABC
from the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' love theme songbird Celine Dion and country star
Garth Brooks tied with two awards each.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian country superstar Shania Twain, leading with five
nominations, received just one statuette and didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, who said backstage that she was planning to take a few
years off to start a family with her husband-manager, won awards
for favorite female pop-rock artist and favorite adult-contemporary
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite soundtrack honor went to the multimillion-selling
``Titanic,'' with the award accepted by Dion and composer James
Horner.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Titanic,' what do you want me to do?'' Dion told
reporters. ``I have to rest, I have to have a normal life, I have
to cook, to play golf. To be honest, what's going to happen to me,
I don't know. I need a break now.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Horner said he was looking forward to his next
film project after a year that saw the movie soundtrack sell almost
10million albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit surprised,'' the Britisher said. ``It's flattering,
but I'm ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Brooks, named favorite male country artist,
also won the favorite country album statuette for ``Sevens.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also presented Billy Joel with a lifetime achievement
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest honor _ presenting the award to Billy,''
Brooks said. ``He's a big influence. I'm sure he sees me and a lot
of other people ripping him off everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel, 49, who last won an American Music Award honor in 1981,
said he was pleased to have ``been around long enough to get one of
these. I've been in rock 'n' roll bands since I was 15 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners Monday included the Dixie Chicks, voted favorite
new country artist; leading Grammy Awards contender Lauryn Hill,
named favorite new soul-r&AMP;b artist; and teen heartthrobs 'N Sync,
who won for favorite new pop-rock artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out last March and everything's been blazing since
then,'' said 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake backstage. ``We have the
best fans in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the annual music awards were selected by a national
sampling of around 20,000 record buyers. The show also featured a
reunion performance by Blondie _ the '70s and '80s new wave band
that broke up 16 years ago is set to go on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can say about rap and Blondie _ we're not dead
yet,'' joked the band's singer, Deborah Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Twain, nominated five times, won a single award for favorite
female country artist. Enrique Iglesias was named favorite Latin
music artist, and Pearl Jam took the prize for favorite alternative
music artist.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper and label owner Master P got the honor for favorite rap
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If homework pays off, it paid off tonight,'' the New Orleans
rapper said after accepting the statuette. ``This award is not just
for me, it's for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, the scene was sedate compared to past years. Artists
causing the most stir in the press tent included Kiss in full
costume and makeup, and a colorful Cher, who is set to sing at the
Super Bowl.

JORDAN WILL RETIRE, 3 OFFICIALS WITH NBA SAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Jordan, basketball's pre-eminent player and
the world's best-known athlete, will retire from the National
Basketball Association for the second time in five years, according
to three officials in the NBA with knowledge of Jordan's plans.
</P>
<P>
   They said on Monday night that they expected the Chicago Bulls
star to make an announcement on Wednesday at a news conference in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's future has been the biggest issue in basketball in the
wake of the bitter labor dispute that ended last week after an
impasse that lasted six months and wiped out the early part of the
season. Aside from his athletic and entertainment value to the
league, he was viewed as a cultural icon and ambassador for the
sport who would help bridge the gap to disenchanted fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has not made a public statement regarding his plans since
the lockout ended, and his agent, David Falk, declined to comment
on Monday night on the possibility of Jordan's retirement. The
Bulls also declined comment. But the three officials said the
decision had been made and that the news conference would be at the
United Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more signs had pointed to the game's most prominent
star retiring again at the age of 35. Falk had not held any
contract discussions with the Bulls, and Jordan had not been
working out regularly. In addition, an editor of a new book by
Jordan, ``For the Love of the Game: My Own Story,'' acknowledged
that the publisher was counting on Jordan's retirement when it
decided to publish the book last fall, and had received positive
signals to that effect from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to make a decision had delayed personnel decisions
for the Bulls, who won six league titles with Jordan as their
leader and top performer. The Bulls have only four players under
contract, and most of the components from Chicago's championship
team were in limbo because Jordan was obviously the team's
priority.
</P>
<P>
   He would have secured a contract worth about $37 million for the
shortened season that is scheduled to begin Feb. 5, pro-rated over
50 games instead of the usual 82. Without Jordan's salary, Bulls
officials will have more money to sign two of their prominent free
agents, Scottie Pippin and Dennis Rodman. But, conversely, Jordan's
absence may be a factor in whether they want to return to the
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Pippen have been an All-Star tandem throughout the
Bulls' championship run _ Jordan has called Pippen his ``little
brother'' _ and Pippen may opt to play elsewhere if he concludes
that the Bulls' glory days will end when Jordan's career does.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's history of changing direction in his professional life
leaves open the possibility that he may return _ if not this
season, then possibly the next season. He retired for the 1993-94
season and embarked on a professional baseball career, saying he
was finished with basketball. But he ended a floundering career in
baseball's minor leagues in the spring of 1995 to return to
basketball for the latter part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times, the most ever. His
31.5 points a game over his career is the highest regular-season
average in NBA history, higher than Wilt Chamberlain's 30.1
average. He was the league's most valuable player five times, and
the All-Star Game mvp three times. In 179 playoff games, he has
averaged 33.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.7 assists, and he was the
mvp of the finals all six times he played in them.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the league into the post-Magic Johnson and Larry Bird
era with aplomb, his incredible accomplishments on the floor are
paralleled only by his commercial success off it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bulls selected him with the third pick in the 1984
draft out of the University of North Carolina, he has graduated
from amazing athlete to corporate pitchman to world champion and,
finally, to cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Fortune magazine estimated Jordan's career financial
contributions to the NBA as $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the statistics, Jordan became known for his drive and
perseverance, and a fiery competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   That was best exemplified when he shook off a viral infection in
Game 5 of the 1997 finals against Utah, leading the Bulls to a
crucial victory even as he was suffering from dehydration and so
weak that he needed to lean on teammates for support.
</P>
<P>
   He also became the sport's biggest draw, selling out arenas
around the league as fans turned out to witness his electrifying
array of soaring dunks and drives to the basket. A bronze statue
outside the United Center commemorates Jordan and his contribution
to the Bulls
</P>
<P>
   Except for participating in one or two early negotiating
sessions, Jordan was not a presence in the labor talks that
culminated with last week's agreement. He has instead been seen
indulging his passion _ golf _ in places like the Bahamas, and
Jordan's Bulls teammates acknowledge that he had not been
consistently working out and getting in prime physical shape _ a
prerequisite for Jordan in every off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been preparing; that's the biggest reason I think
he's not coming back,'' said Steve Kerr, a Bulls guard. ``Michael
hasn't told me anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was on vacation last week in the Bahamas, and it was
unclear whether he had returned home to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be leaving the game on the highest note possible.
</P>
<P>
   He led the Bulls to their third consecutive championship last
June 16, carrying Chicago to its sixth title in eight seasons with
a dramatic 40-second sequence in the clinching Game 6 victory over
the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But his retirement would be the linchpin decision in the
disassembling of the Bulls. The first departure was the coach, Phil
Jackson, who left the franchise after the Bulls won the title in
June, saying he would take an extended sabbatical from the game
before returning.

BOUCHER WAITS FOR HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ With the Kings' recent positive reversal of
fortune, defenseman Philippe Boucher has become a forgotten man.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher played well early in the season, struggled a bit later,
and lately has found himself a spectator with no end to his current
status in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game in Ottawa, my confidence was really low,''
Boucher said Monday, recalling a 3-1 loss five weeks ago when the
Kings were mired in a deep slump. ``When you hit a certain point,
no one can help you but yourself. I took (being benched) hard. You
feel like you're not doing your job sitting up in the press box.
You're not paid to sit in the press box watching games.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher was in the lineup for 20 of the first 21 games, but
since then, he's played in only five of 20 games and has been a
healthy scratch the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not happy,'' said Boucher, whose minus-11
defensive rating is the worst on the team. ``But I don't want to be
a distraction. You try to have fun with the team. But at the same
time, it's hard. You want to be in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher last played in a game 24 days ago, a loss at St. Louis.
But he said he will be prepared when his chance comes to return to
the lineup. The only question is when exactly that day will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be ready,'' Boucher said. ``But it's obviously
hard. Nobody can be happy in this situation. But you've got to be
ready. You never know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Change of routine: On days when NHL teams have games, the
time-worn routine begins with the all-important 30-minute morning
skate.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it's not that important.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson acknowledged as much Monday when
asked why his team flew to San Jose on the day of the game, rather
than the usual day early, and did not practice in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you have (the skate) just to get guys a little
focused, as opposed to staying at home,'' Robinson said. ``Most of
the time, you like to get in the day before to get accustomed to
the rink you're playing in or if you're going to the East Coast to
get used to the time change. Other than that, I don't think there's
any rhyme or reason teams do it other than it's part of their
ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the decision to travel the day of the game Monday
might mark the beginning of a new Kings tradition for games in
close proximity to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we don't do this more often,'' he said.
``It's a quick jaunt. We plan on doing it more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Reserve goalie Manny Legace, who is with the
Long Beach Ice Dogs, is wearing a cast because of a sprained right
ankle and is expected to be sidelined for a week. . . . The Kings
reassigned center Brandon Convery from Long Beach to Springfield of
the American Hockey League. . . . No Kings were chosen to the World
All-Star team, announced Monday. Center Marco Sturm of Germany was
the only Shark chosen. The North American team is scheduled to be
announced today, with left wing Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob
Blake the Kings most likely to be added to the roster. The All-Star
Game is Jan. 24 in Tampa. . . . The Sharks recalled defenseman
Andrei Zyuzin from Kentucky of the AHL. San Jose lost defenseman
Bryan Marchment to a shoulder injury last week that is expected to
sideline him for six weeks. . . . Kings defenseman Doug Bodger
missed his sixth game because of a cervical strain and bruised
shoulder suffered 15 days ago in Phoenix. &UR;  &QL;

ERICKSON RAISES EYEBROWS WITH OSU MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is difficult at this time to know whether to
applaud Dennis Erickson or worry about the soundness of his mental
capacity. However, we suppose we can look at the news this way:
</P>
<P>
   As the new head football coach at Oregon State, the only way for
Erickson to go is up ... unless he makes another surprise
announcement that what he really wants is to be tight ends coach at
Everett Pop Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about news. Goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 51, will be crowned King of the Beavers this morning
in Corvallis, just 15 days after the Everett native was released
from his duties as head coach of the Seahawks _ a team that now has
been catapulted into the stratosphere by the hiring of Super
Bowl-ring adorned Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   And just Monday, that deal was checkmated by the blockbuster
hiring of Rick Neuheisel by the University of Washington _ a place
where Erickson was never a candidate after his fellow Everett buddy
Jim Lambright was summarily dismissed 13 days ago because, as
athletic director Barbara Hedges declared, the future of Husky
football was at stake. And rightly so, we might add.
</P>
<P>
   For Erickson, who also was passed over as an offensive
coordinator candidate in Philadelphia and who did not get a call
for any of the myriad other NFL openings across the land, one has
to wonder if his latest career move is a case of how far the mighty
have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Or, is it possible that this Beavers job is an honorable,
laudable act of professional sincerity on the part of Erickson for
which all of us cynical, judgmental armchair quarterbacks should be
ashamed of questioning?
</P>
<P>
   The man wants to coach.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, Erickson wants a very-close-to-home
opportunity to stick it to the people who he must feel sold him
short during his embattled Seahawks tenure _ Behrings, Whitsitts,
media and all.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about the move, Erickson should not worry about image.
There will always be a list of famous people whose backslide into
embarrassment or oblivion totally outstrips Erickson's startling
decision to take over a resurgent Oregon State program.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Tarkenton went from Vikings legend to TV huckster. Top-40
stars Eddie Money and Joan Jett are now regulars at Parkers Casino
on Aurora Avenue North. Milli Vanilli went from Grammy winners to
music industry outcasts. Rep. Bob Livingston went from designated
Speaker of the House to admitted adulterer and congressional
resignee. The Mariners went from AL West champs to ... well ... you
get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   That Erickson decided to jump at the chance to coach again, near
home, for a Pac-10 program that, rightly or wrongly, not only has
been the conference doormat but the subject of ridicule is, yes, a
serious head-scratcher.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly Erickson is not fazed by the warps of perception his
move creates. For instance, Erickson the fallen NFL coach is now
following in the footsteps of Mike Riley, a 45-year-old
up-and-comer who will get his shot in San Diego. After faltering in
Seattle, Erickson did not get the call to lead the Ryan Leaf era in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Erickson doesn't care about image or perception. How
could he? Now, if he really has a sense of humor, he would hire
Lambright as his defensive coordinator and the two of them could
wreak havoc in the Pac-10 _ to say nothing of what the reaction
would be in Montlake.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone who would bet against Erickson in a duel against
Neuheisel, at least at this point?
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it is time to circle Oct. 9 on your calendars. The
Huskies and their photogenic, guitar-strummin' new coach will head
to Corvallis then for a date with Erickson and the Beavs.
</P>
<P>
   Lights out, fellas. Air Erickson just might be seeking his
little bit of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Erickson's choice must raise some eyebrows, at least. I
mean, no one charts a career path that goes from two national
championships at Miami to an NFL head coach in your hometown to a
job with the Beavers. Not on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   From a Vandal to a Cowboy to a Cougar to a Hurricane to a
Seahawk to a Beaver. Erickson isn't building a resume. He's
collecting clues for Pictionary. But, God bless him. He's got a
sense of humor. And maybe he thinks this is the way he can have the
last laugh on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaver bandwagon looks to gain a few passengers this season.
A questionable call by Erickson does not diminish the wild
entertainment possibilities that now lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   What a week.
</P>

HUSKIES MAKE SPLASH BY THROWING BIG CASH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you're still groping for perspective on how the new
Husky football coach is worth almost twice as much as the old
coach, who was already the state's highest paid employee, consider
this comparison.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA trumpeted the fact over the weekend that the contract of
head coach Bob Toledo was extended for seven years for an average
of $578,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say about us,'' said UW faculty representative
Robert Aronson, ``when our deal is twice that?''
</P>
<P>
   Aronson, a member of the search committee that chose Rick
Neuheisel, said it proudly. Indeed, any embarrassment over paying a
college football coach more than $1 million annually was nowhere in
evidence at the Tyee Center on Monday, where boosters,
administrators and staffers strutted about while showing off the
wunderkind coach.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the money is almost as big a point as the competency of
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be a splash,'' Aronson said. ``No one (on the
committee) talked in terms of a million dollars, but there's no
denying it had emotional impact. Immediately around the country,
there was a big boost.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same national spike accorded the Seahawks with the
hiring of Mike Holmgren for an NFL-record coaching salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel,'' Aronson said. ``It's not just Holmgren,
as good a coach as he is. It's the statement it makes about
commitment to winning and success. We wanted to get that kind of
boost. If Holmgren likes being there, you have to imagine that a
lot of other good coaches and players would join him.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Microsoft effect _ insistence upon the best and
brightest, regardless of budget or consequences. The prime
directive is to make the strong stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The high-priced hires of two coaches at the top of their sports
are further signs of Seattle's dramatically changed sports
landscape. Holmgren and Neuheisel are the latest renovations
symbolic of the old hippie joint gone high-end condo.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, in the 1980s, Seattle's three mediocre pro sports
franchises had out-of-state ownerships and played in minimalist
facilities. Husky football and men's basketball had some success,
but were led by reserved personalities in Don James and Marv
Harshman, and played in pre-World War II buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Now the three teams are locally owned and have expensive new,
publicly financed facilities. The Mariners and Sonics made serious
runs at championships, and the Seahawks appear on the verge. The
University of Washington jockyards will soon undergo a $70 million
facelift. Neuheisel joins men's basketball coach Bob Bender in a
youthful, dynamic makeover of the athletic persona.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's historic Scandinavian aversion to ostentatious
displays of wealth is as over as the Dog House restaurant. The
sports scene is a high-stepping, big-time scene. Turn in the
tie-dye for black tie.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever misgivings some might have about the change, the
expensive commitment to big-time success (with the notable
exception of the Mariners) is irrefutable, as well as the point of
spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   Grandiosity was at the core of the Neuheisel signing. According
to Aronson, Neuheisel wants to emulate Steve Spurrier, the highly
successful Florida coach who is pulling down an industry-high $2.2
million annual stipend.
</P>
<P>
   ``His goal is to be talked about in the same way as Spurrier,''
he said. ``We're not going to get Spurrier, but we talked to a lot
of people about Neuheisel, both his coaching ability and his
recruiting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players say he's the best. Several said they almost went (to
Colorado) because of him, but wanted to play in the Pac-10. He's
young and incredibly bright and won't make the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked out of the room, (the search committee) said,
`We gotta get him here.'''
</P>
<P>
   To make it happen, Washington had to supply him with cover for
the inevitable nuking he would receive in Colorado. As it almost
always is, the firewall was cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If I leave a job as good as Colorado and my
reputation is attacked, the deal here has to be so much better that
no one would question my decision,''' Aronson said. ``He felt that
if this was to be the premier program in the Pac-10, the salary has
to reflect it. If the deal wasn't a blockbuster, people would
question why he would leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies acquiesced, almost gleefully. The football-generated
revenue was there, and so were the humiliating losses in the Jim
Lambright tenure. One could fix the other, in the minds of athletic
director Barbara Hedges and the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to lose, but it's another to look like you
don't belong on the same field with Nebraska,'' Aronson said.
``Heck, we didn't look like we belonged on the same field with Air
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the loss of Husky pride, the budget dent was
nothing. If the salary is removed from the university context and
put where it belongs, in the realm of pro sports, it really is
nothing _ Neuheisel's stipend is about half what the Mariners are
scheduled to pay Bobby Ayala this season, and a quarter of what the
Sonics will give Jim McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   The guess is the Huskies will get the bigger bang on their
investment. Besides, the UW will have to pay it only until
Neuheisel is named head coach of the expansion franchise the NFL
puts in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the big time, that's how the game is played.

KINGS NICE START HAS UGLY ENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The night began with visions of sole
possession of a playoff berth at the midpoint of the NHL season,
only three weeks after the Kings had teetered on the brink of early
extinction from the race for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Kings applied early pressure on Mike Vernon, it
appeared inevitable that they would continue their recent success,
even though at first they couldn't get the puck past the San Jose
Sharks' goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it figured Vernon would have to crack. But he never
did, and the Kings cracked instead, allowing goals to Bill Houlder,
Joe Murphy, Dave Lowry and Alex Korolyuk en route to a 4-0 loss to
the Sharks on Monday night before a San Jose Arena crowd of 16,503.
The goals by Houlder and Lowry came on the power play, on which the
Sharks are third-worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon stopped 30 shots in recording his third shutout this
season and the 21st of his career. It was the sixth time the Kings
have been shut out this season.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the end of some positive streaks for the Kings, and
the continuation of one streak the Kings would be happy to see end.
</P>
<P>
   Six-game unbeaten streak? Dead. Four-game road winning streak?
Dead. Their streak of six games scoring a power-play goal? Dead. A
streak of 114 minutes, 29 seconds without a goal? Very much alive,
because the Kings haven't scored since a goal by Rob Blake at the
5:31 mark of the first period of Saturday's 1-1 tie with Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Kings (15-22-4) reached the halfway point of the
season with seven fewer points than they had after 41 games a year
ago. They also have two fewer points than do the Sharks (13-17-10),
who used the victory to gain sole possession of the eighth and
final playoff berth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It had all started so well for the Kings, too. They took the
first seven shots on goal, with Vernon robbing Donald Audette,
Vladimir Tsyplakov and Luc Robitaille in the first 5:39.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's chance, a point-blank rebound after an Audette shot
hit the post, was smothered by Vernon and came just after the Kings
failed on a power play. It was a sign of things to come: The Kings
would go 0 for 6 with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   With Sandy Moger off for a kneeing penalty late in the first
period, Houlder received a bouncing pass from Murphy at the blue
line, managed to settle the puck and unleashed a 55-foot wrist shot
that sailed over the glove of Kings goalie Stephane Fiset, who
appeared to be screened at the last moment by the Sharks' Patrick
Marleau.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was only a one-goal lead, but as was the case too many
times earlier in the season, the slim margin was mountainous,
especially with Vernon making difficult saves of two shorthanded
chances by Jozef Stumpel early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   And the mountainous deficit turned into Mt. Everest when Murphy
beat Fiset from the slot on a 3-on-2 midway through the second
period. Murphy was allowed to skate untouched into the Kings' zone
and scored off a Marleau pass.
</P>
<P>
   Once down by two goals, the Kings' scoring chances diminished
and Vernon's night became easier. They managed eight shots on goal
in the third period, and came closest to putting the puck past
Vernon with 5:45 remaining when Tsyplakov twice swatted at a loose
puck sitting in the crease. But Vernon was able to stick out his
glove and keep the puck from getting past him.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry scored the Sharks' third goal on a power play, poking in a
rebound with Fiset out of position after having made a sensation
sprawling save on a shot by Owen Nolan. Korolyuk finished the
scoring in the closing minutes.

   CONGO-CONFLICT (Kinshasa, Congo) _ From its earliest imagination
in the minds of outsiders hungry for its riches _ gold for traders
and souls for missionaries _ Congo has rarely belonged to itself
alone. Now this huge and unsteady state has become a battlefield of
soldiers from no fewer than six foreign nations. It is a war that
has as much to do with problems outside of Congo as inside it. A
fundamental reworking of the old rules of Africa may be unfolding

   U.N.-COUNCIL-IRAQ (United Nations) _ The United States is
finding itself increasingly isolated in its Iraq policy as a
growing number of Security Council members and Arab nations support
lifting an embargo on Iraqi oil sales or significantly relaxing
sanctions in other ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi
people. But contrary to what the Iraqis may hope, there is also
solid agreement that long-term international supervision is needed
to prevent Iraq from acquiring prohibited weapons. Among proposals
to be discussed are the creation of a new inspection system and
ways to monitor money that Iraq would earn if it sold oil freely.

continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he

puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Ottawa Senators, who were pushovers
for the New Jersey Devils in their first three years in the league,
have become a nemesis the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators continued their dominance with a 4-2 victory over
the Devils on Monday night at Continental Arena. Ottawa beat the
Devils by 6-0 on Jan. 2 in Ottawa, where the teams will play
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators won here in the final regular-season game of 1996
to keep the Devils from defending their Stanley Cup championship.
Last season, the Senators eliminated the Devils in the second round
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa's quick transition game has given the Devils all kinds of
trouble, especially when the Devils turn the puck over in the
neutral zone, which was a common occurrence in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a question that they beat us,'' said goalie Martin
Brodeur, who made 20 saves. ``It was more like we beat ourselves.
We've got to cut down on our mistakes and turnovers in the neutral
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik blamed his team for Ottawa's success. ``They play
the neutral zone trap very well _ they learned from our system,''
he said, referring to the tactic that Jacques Lemaire employed with
enough success to win the Stanley Cup as coach of the Devils in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Vadim Sharifijanov and Brian Rolston were the only
highlights of the night for the Devils, who were never in command
in this game. The crowd of 14,402 frequently expressed its
displeasure at the Devils' performance. The loss was the second in
a row for the Devils (22-12-5), who have only two victories in
their last six games and have dropped out of first place in the
Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Yashin, Andreas Johansson, Daniel Alfredsson and Marian
Hossa scored for the Senators, who extended their unbeaten streak
to nine games and improved to 22-13-5, the best record in franchise
history at this stage in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin opened the scoring 4 minutes 14 seconds into the game
after a Devils turnover in the neutral zone. Wade Redden picked up
the loose puck and fed the speedy Yashin, who beat Brodeur to the
far corner from the left circle for his 18th goal of the season.
The goal extended Yashin's game-scoring streak to nine, giving him
five goals and nine assists in the span.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils finally got through to Ottawa goalie Damian Rhodes
with 4:12 left in the first, when Sharifijanov converted Brendan
Morrison's pass from behind the net, putting the puck to the left
of Rhodes. But Johansson regained the lead for the Senators with
his 16th goal of the season at 3:48 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston tied it with his 10th goal of the season by jamming
Sergei Brylin's centering pass into the net. But another turnover
by the Devils, this time at their blue line, led to Alfredsson's
tie-breaking goal at 4:20 of the third period. &QL;

   The new goalie, Felix Potvin, was in the net, making his first
National Hockey League start in five weeks. The former No. 1
goalie, Tommy Salo, watched from the press box, counting down the
hours until he was traded. The team's billionaire co-owner, Howard
Milstein, strutted around the arena, hours after he signed an
agreement across town to buy the Washington Redskins football team.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing ordinary about this day was that the Islanders
lost, 4-3, to the Washington Capitals before 11,531 at the MCI
Center, extending their streak without a victory to eight games
(0-7-1).
</P>
<P>
   Potvin, who was acquired from Toronto last Saturday for
defenseman Bryan Berard, was every bit as rusty as expected.
Playing his first NHL game since Dec. 5., Potvin stopped 31 shots,
but allowed two questionable goals, one of which was scored from
behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that two of the goals shouldn't have gone in,''
he said. ``Whenever a guy shoots from behind the red line, you have
to make the save.''
</P>
<P>
   Salo, the player whom Potvin is to replace, did not dress for
the second straight game. A few months ago, Salo was anointed the
team's undisputed No. 1 goalie by the Islanders' coach and general
manager, Mike Milbury. Tonight, Salo sat stewing upstairs as
Milbury again failed to find a taker. (Nashville, Edmonton and
Calgary are said to be interested.) Wade Flaherty backed up Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Mike for about one minute today,'' said Salo, who
practiced with the team this morning. ``He said that he was trying
to move me as fast as he could. He said fast, but I don't know
when. Of course I'm upset. I'm disappointed with the way things
worked out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the status of Salo and the eight-game slump, the bigger
question facing the Islanders (13-26-3) is who will be the next
owner? Like a recurring nightmare, the franchise is faced with
ownership uncertainty for the fourth time in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   A group headed by Milstein signed an agreement on Monday in
Washington to buy the Redskins and their new stadium for a record
total of $800 million. That means Milstein will be forced to sell
his 45 percent stake in the Islanders because National Football
League bylaws prohibit cross-ownership of teams. Milstein, who
tried unsuccessfully to buy the expansion Cleveland Browns in
September, purchased the Islanders, along with Steven Gluckstern,
last February for $195 million.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Milstein, a New York real estate magnate,
lost interest in the Islanders last summer, when it became apparent
that getting a new arena built in Nassau County, along with a hotel
and a mall, would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein told Fox Sports New York that Gluckstern would probably
buy his stake in the team. Milstein also said that a deal for a new
arena for the Islanders was close.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps close is the operative word for the Islanders on the ice
these days, too. On Monday night the Capitals (15-20-3) got two
goals from Sergei Gonchar, and one apiece from Calle Johansson and
Mike Eagles. Scoring for the Islanders were Robert Reichel, David
Harlock and Ted Donato. Olaf Kolzig made 22 saves for the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles gave the Capitals a 3-1 lead midway through the second
period. He shot the puck from behind Potvin, who was hugging the
goal post. The puck hit Potvin's elbow and fell behind him into the
goal. It was as bad a goal as an Islanders netminder has allowed
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was O.K.,'' Milbury said, referring to Potvin. ``He was a
bit rusty, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar scored the Capitals' fourth goal 34 seconds into the
third period. The defenseman blasted a shot from just inside the
blue line that beat Potvin through the pads to stretch the lead to
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders were not done. Harlock and Donato scored
third-period goals to close the margin to 4-3 with 3 minutes 30
seconds left. Then they were done.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a bit of sideshow to the sideshow, a reporter asked
Milbury if he thought Milstein would give the Redskins' coach, Norv
Turner, another chance to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to ask me about Norv Turner's future?'' Milbury
said. ``I'm worried about mine.''

IF YOU REALLY AND TRULY LIKE MIKE, TRY ONE OF THESE SITES (For use

By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case we've seen the last of Michael Jordan's play on the
basketball court _ and chances are we have _ the Internet has
scores of sites dedicated to the Chicago Bulls star.
</P>
<P>
   Most are the same: Lots of images and Nike logos, statistics,
career highlights, guestbooks, links and _ because most are fan
pages _ URLs (website addresses) a mile long.
</P>
<P>
   But a few set themselves apart.
</P>
<P>
   Best virtual gallery: The Michael Jordan Virtual Gallery
(www.ac.wwu.edu/(tilde)n9345228/tom1.html). It takes awhile to
load, but it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Best fan-produced newsletter: Enter Air Time
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/3507). In fact, it's the only
known Jordan newsletter online.
</P>
<P>
   Best stats table: Air Jordan
(www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/3513/jordan.html). Very
detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Best frames page: Brad's Michael Jordan Page
(www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Studio/7938/jordan.html). Despite
frames, you won't get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bandwidth-hogging page: It's a bird, it's a plane, it's
Jordan (24.65.88.197). Yes, it's a numeric address. The background
music might run you off.
</P>
<P>
   Best splash-page graphic: Jersey No. 23
(www.bei.dsu.edu/jungem/ilike.htm). If you like wavy, reflective
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Best anti-Jordan page: My Anti-Jordan Page
(www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Lights/6143/jordan.html). The
author's No. 1 reason to not be like Mike: Jordan is a ball hog.
His No. 22 reason: The author hates how Jordan hangs his tongue
out.
</P>
<P>
   Best Jordan page in Spanish: Michael Jordan en Espa$ol
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/8937/index.htm). The moving
background on this site could qualify for Best Background That
Makes You Dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   Best big-media site: Jordan's Official Site
(jordan.cbs.sportsline). Multimedia features, trivia, contest,
member chats and e-mails answered personally by Jordan _ or so
we're told.
</P>
<P>
   POLL OF THE WEEK: The NBA is coming back with a whimper if
online polls are to be believed. Of 91,847 voting on an ESPN.com
poll, 53.7 percent say they have no interest at all in the NBA
lockout settlement. Another 27.5 percent are mildly interested,
12.2 percent are excited and 6.4 very interested.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNING TIME: With college football recruiting in swing, don't
miss the Star-Telegram's own Recruiting Update
(www.star-telegram.com/sports/recruit). The site includes an
interactive survey and recent recruiting articles produced by the
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   EBAY AUCTION HITS A SINGLE: The 70th home run baseball hit by
Mark McGwire finally got a bid before it closed Monday night. The
single online offer, from an unidentified would-be buyer, was
posted on the eBay site (www.ebay.com) at about 9 p.m. Saturday.
The ball and six others from last summer's home-run race had been
offered since Tuesday. The reason for so few offers might be the
fact that the seller, New York-based Guernsey's, set a $100,000
minimum bid. The final sale will be conducted online and by bidders
in person in New York today.
</P>
<P>
   HEAR HOCKEY IN BILOXI: The East Coast Hockey League all-star
game at 7 p.m. Tuesday in Biloxi, Miss., can be heard on

<P>
   Where some see an empty closet, second bedroom, or garage
apartment, others see a home office.
</P>
<P>
   But today's home work spaces don't have to be rooms dedicated to
computers, files and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on needs and workloads, a ``home office'' can be
anything from an elaborate L-shaped desk to a rollaway computer
cart, or even a hide-the-goods armoire.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 million of us doing at least some of our work at home,
and increasing tax incentives for setting up space exclusively
devoted to business, homeowners are seeking creative solutions to
fashioning home offices.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to start with the fundamental question: Where?
</P>
<P>
   Will the office dominate an entire room? Or will you make do
with a small wall panel in the den or family room?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have no space at all to set up a computer desk full
time.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant and author Candace Ord Manroe, who wrote ``The Home
Office'' (Reader's Digest, 1997, $23), says once you evaluate your
needs and have a clear idea of what you want, a space can always be
found. She's designed offices that have been tucked under
stairwells, in closets, attics and former pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Components exist to fit just about every need for a home office,
which at a minimum often means a personal computer, monitor, and a
printer/fax machine. The typical workstation has a hutch, a place
for a computer monitor, a pullout printer stand, a work surface,
file drawers and little nooks for paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that have an open 7-by-7-foot corner can accommodate
elaborate L-shaped centers of that size, with plenty of room for
accessories like a printer table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L-shaped and U-shaped desks are becoming more popular due
to space. The traditional executive type set up is just not
functional for the home,'' says Christina Erridge, public relations
manager of Staples Inc., the office-supply chain based near Boston.
``And people want more of a choice in fabrics, cabinet facings,
wood finishings. Not just the typical metal filing cabinets.
Something that complements their home and doesn't stick out.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, nearly 50 percent of homes will have some form of home
office, Erridge says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tremendous growth. A lot of homes are now being built
with an office in mind,'' she says. ``Home offices are growing four
times as fast as any other kind of business, which is great for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary 30-by-60-inch computer desks and workstations can
fit into rooms where just one wall is available. For a standard
desk you would need a 6-foot wall space.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for L-shape centers can range from $199 to $800, while
desks and one-wall workstations are from $99 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Most office furniture is made of laminated wood, and requires
assembly. If you'd rather someone else handle the screwdriver and
bolts, expect to pay an additional fee ranging from $35 to $125,
depending on the size of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Desks and workstations are available in more than just
dark-stained wood, although that's still most common. Homeowners
can order hues from whitewash to cherry to match their decor.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires have become the fastest selling home-office components
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Like entertainment centers, armoires allow owners to ``hide''
their computer behind closed doors when not in use. The armoire
then blends in with other furniture in the room, so the ``office''
literally closes up at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   If space is tight, the all-inclusive computer cart may be the
answer. Since it's on wheels, the computer can be rolled out for
work, then stashed away in a closet when done.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting into a space just 42-inches wide, the cart has space for
a computer, keyboard, monitor, printer and copy holder. It's a
popular option for a bedroom office.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for carts range from about $39 to $200, with a variety in
the $100 range. A matching hutch would cost about $50 more.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires and carts make even more sense these days as increasing
technology continues to shrink hardware. When home offices require
printers, copiers and fax machines, some companies have responded
with the ``all in one'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   These space savers combine a fax machine, printer, scanner,
copier, answering machine and telephone in a unit the size of a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Himowitz, who writes about his techno-addiction in
Fortune magazine, says his home office was greatly simplified by
the Concerto Switchboard, a $495 gadget from Centrepoint
Technologies that gives a home office the equivalent of a ``fancy
corporate phone system.'' It routes, screens or transfers calls,
coordinates the phone, fax and PC, and can even play music or
prerecorded messages while customers are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the big advantages of home offices is comfort, make
sure furnishings provide ergonomic support.
</P>
<P>
   Use chairs that raise and lower pneumatically to match keyboard
height. Prices range from $20 for simple models to $400 for leather
desk chairs.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget inexpensive copy holders, mouse pads, wrist
pads, cord ducts or cable guides for hiding cords from view and
preventing tangling.
</P>
<P>
   Other items to consider are power strips with plug-ins for all
electronic equipment and a master switch to turn everything off at
once. They run about $50, with surge protectors built in.
</P>
<P>
   Functional desk lamps needn't be elaborate or expensive ($9 to
$60). Reading lamps with soft-white bulbs work well, regardless of
whether they're floor or desk models.

   Barry Wine graduated from Tufts University in the mid-'60s with
a degree in science. The following year he entered the University
of Chicago Law School. His academic success landed him a job with a
prestigious Wall Street firm; his future seemed set.
</P>
<P>
   Within a short time, Wine decided he would be happier pursuing a
simpler lifestyle. He and his wife moved to a small town near
Manhattan and he hung out his shingle.
</P>
<P>
   His love and study of nouvelle French cuisine prompted him to
fulfill a romantic dream. He opened The Quilted Giraffe, a pricey,
25-seat restaurant. One night, when the chef didn't make it to
work, Wine stepped into the kitchen. He has never practiced law
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I knew we wouldn't starve,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Quilted Giraffe has earned a four-star rating, more than
tripled in size, became world famous and provided a glamorous,
time-consuming career, Wine said.

   The story reads like an endorsement for the best selling
inspirational career guide, ``Do What You Love, The Money Will
Follow'' by Marsha Sinetar, California organizational psychologist
and author of the new book ``The Mentor's Spirit'' (St. Martin's
Press, $16.95).

<P>
   ``People who are successful and fulfilled tend to be doing the
work they are suited for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys show that, at best, only 25 percent of the work
force are clearly happy with their jobs.

<P>
   Nevertheless, don't be discouraged if you haven't found your
niche.

<P>
   Nicholas Lore, a Maryland resident and author of ``The
Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of
Satisfaction and Success'' ( Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998, $14.)
said it frequently takes three jobs until the right career match is
found.

<P>
   Lynne Musgrove, an Ohio licensed professional counselor for 30
years identifies two midlife points at which many people rethink
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between the ages of 28 to 32, those who feel that what they
are doing isn't right for them begin to realize that time is
ticking.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the mid-40s to early 50s, dissatisfied individuals address
the important questions of life with respect to their career and
overall contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Sinetar says that the only way people, regardless
of age, can achieve personal harmony is to use their natural
talents, contribute to others, continue to grow and work in a way
that fits their personality, needs and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Changing to meet those criteria is no an easy task. There is no
guarantee of success. ``But if you want a guarantee, buy a
toaster,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Work feels good in any setting when the right match is made
between a persson's talents and the job requirements, experts
agree.

   ``I am definitely where I should have been all along. Business
keeps my mental juices flowing. I have taken some of my teaching
skills and applied them to a sales environment.''
</P>

<P>
   ``If you have a zoo, you want to have lions,'' Lore said. ``If
you have a business, you want to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much money you earn, however, it isn't worth it if
you don't find fulfillment career coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Arnold, 29, was on the fast track to financial success
before he left a sports marketing firm in Washington D.C. A few
years ago, he abandoned his goal of a master's in business
administration from a top school and decided to follow his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that the salary was something competitive for me. I
did it to tell people I could earn six figures. Now I use that same
ambition for getting acting roles,'' said Arnold will appear in two
consecutive parts of the NBC show ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lore's vernacular, what Arnold did was look into his personal
tool box of possibilities. Arnold decided that an acting career was
not a pipe dream, determined what he would have to do to get it
started and began to make the possibility a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that chasing your personal star necessitates giving
up all convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Moskowitz, a Cleveland, Ohio psychotherapist and
artist, is represented by numerous galleries, has had shows in
several states and sells many of his works. He chose to piggy-back
his painting career on top of his medical profession when the
limits of managed care frustrated and diminished his satisfaction
in psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extreme fantasy of moving to Santa Fe and living
above a studio gallery and seeing a few patients in
psychotherapy,'' he said. ``I call it an extreme fantasy because it
was partially rooted in fear. I was afraid I couldn't make enough
money to maintain the life my wife and kids were used to and that I
would be forced to cater to public tastes. That wouldn't be as
gratifying.''

current observations.
</P>

SUPPLEMENT OF WONDER
</HEADLINE>
  By KEN MCALPINE 
 c.1999 Ken McAlpine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is the short list of facts about creatine, the athletic
supplement:
</P>
<P>
   It works.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from talk show hosts to the salesman at your local
health food store is spouting off about the stuff (``Sure, take the
whole jar. That's why they make them big.'').
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kreide, associate professor at the University of
Memphis, is one of the country's foremost experts on creatine,
having conducted creatine supplementation studies of his own and
reviewed dozens of others. Equally important, Kreider was an
athlete before he was a scientist. ``Athletes should know the
facts,'' he said. ``Anyone who is thinking about taking creatine
should know what it is, what it does and what it doesn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so:
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid, one of the twenty naturally occurring
amino acids that form protein molecules. Your body manufactures
creatine in the liver, pancreas and kidneys. Most people produce a
gram or two a day, about half your daily needs. By eating high
protein sources, you can get the rest through diet (a pound of beef
contains two grams of creatine; ditto for a pound of salmon).
</P>
<P>
   Protein's main job is to construct and repair tissue, so it's
not hard to see why protein comes in handy in exercise and sport,
activities that basically tear your muscles down and then rely on
you to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   But why, with a bunch of other amino acids involved in the job,
is creatine so important? As your body makes creatine, or as you
ingest it as food or a supplement, it's whisked through the blood
stream to your muscles, where it's converted to phosphocreatine, is
an important store of energy in the muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine supplementation doesn't build muscle and power
directly. What it does is boost phosphocreatine levels in your
muscle cells. That allows you to work out more intensely. And that
translates to all of creatine's proven benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased one-rep maximum lifting strength, improved vertical
jump performance, enhanced sprint performance in sprints lasting
six to thirty seconds, improved high-intensity performance in
events lasting ninety to three hundred seconds, an increase in the
total amount of exercise performed, increased total body mass and
an increase in fat-free mass,'' says Kreider. ``The science is
virtually indisputable.''
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, bigger, stronger, faster.
</P>
<P>
   And the effects can be dramatic. Research has shown that
creatine supplementation can increase strength from 5 to 15
percent. In studies, short-term supplementation, as little as a
week, added roughly a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of muscle to some
athletes' frames. Longer studies, two to twenty weeks of
supplementation, showed muscle gains as high as 5.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is no scientific evidence to suggest any
concern,'' says Kreider. ``To date the only side effect reported
from clinical studies on athletes, untrained people and hospital
patients is weight gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider isn't the only one to give creatine a blemish-free bill
of health to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible of me as a scientist to say that
there's absolutely nothing that could go wrong if you use creatine
supplements,'' says David Pearson, an exercise physiologist at Ball
State University in Indiana. ``But personally I have very little
concern about our athletes using them in controlled doses. Creatine
is a naturally occurring substance in food. If you were eating meat
you'd be getting creatine anyway. ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if recreational athletes -- the weekend basketball player
who wants to recover faster, the 40-year-old weightlifter who
wouldn't mind a bit more muscle - could benefit from creatine,
Kreider gives them the green light, as long as they use the
supplement in a reasoned dose.
</P>
<P>
   But Pearson disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real benefits of creatine come from very, very intense
training,'' says Pearson. ``If you're just a jogger, a cyclist, a
swimmer or a three-day a week weightlifter who is training for
fitness benefit, don't mess with it. There is absolutely no
scientific evidence to support that creatine has a positive effect
on just the person who is working out for fitness reasons only.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson has a broader concern too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think creatine has been portrayed as much more important
than it really is,'' he says. ``Believe me, the changes that we see
with most individuals are less than dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is not a quick fix for anybody's workout. It's a
supplement that appears to enhance strength and power under very
intense training conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other concerns shared by experts who aren't on a
supplement providers payroll.
</P>
<P>
   First, that those who use creatine don't abuse it. The typical
recommended - and scientifically proven safe -- ``loading'' regimen
for a 160-pound athlete (dosages vary slightly depending on the
athlete's weight) is a 5-gram dose four times a day for 5 to 7
days, then 3-5 grams of creatine each day after that to maintain
the muscles' elevated creatine content.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, that those who do use creatine don't just go
out and buy the first, or cheapest, stuff they can get their hands
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be blunt,'' says Steven Plisk, director of sports
conditioning at Yale University and a certified strength and
conditioning specialist with the National Strength and Conditioning
Association. ``There's a lot of crap out there. Probably the most
insidious problem on the creatine market right now is the
counterfeit stuff that's coming in, especially from overseas. ''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, though Yale University won't supply creatine to
its athletes, Plisk makes sure he knows where the athletes are
getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of the long-term effects of
creatine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lingering question is, `Is it safe?' and we will certainly
be researching that,'' says Kreider. ``But athletes have been using
creatine as a nutritional supplement for over ten years, and to my
knowledge there have been no serious problems. Certainly, more
long-term studies are needed. But right now there is no evidence
that creatine supplementation results in any adverse effects when
taken in recommended dosages.''
</P>
<P>
   Krieder and Plisk take creatine. Pearson does not.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, you may have already reached this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to try it, fine,'' says Kreider. ``If you don't
want to try it, fine.''

CLEAR THE AIR WITH LIVING FILTERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TRACEY C. REMBERT 
 c.1999 ``E'' magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To lower stress, many physicians recommend a relaxing hobby like
gardening. But cultivating plants indoors may also lower the risk
of asthma, allergies and ``sick building syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency cites indoor air pollution
as one of the top five public health threats in America, and the
main culprit in the 60 percent rise in asthma over the last decade.
Now researchers are looking to houseplants for a solution to
polluted indoor air.
</P>
<P>
   The energy crisis of the 1970s led many Americans to
superinsulate their homes and offices against energy loss. Man-made
materials like particle board, synthetic fibers and plastic--which
emit harmful formaldehyde, trichloroethylene (TCE), benzene and
other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over years of
exposure--have also become ubiquitous indoors. And while air
filters are adequate at capturing particles like dust and dander,
they do little to eliminate noxious VOCs.
</P>
<P>
   Though debates have raged for over a decade as to just how
effective houseplants are in improving indoor air, studies in
Europe and the U.S. have reported that particular plant species can
lower VOC levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, NASA senior research scientist Bill Wolverton tested
houseplants for their ability to maintain clean air for future
habitable lunar bases. Testing in sealed chambers, Wolverton found
that philodendrons and golden pothos were excellent formaldehyde
controllers; gerbera daisy and chrysanthemums were impressive
benzene purgers; pot mums and peace lilies were highly rated for
TCE removal.
</P>
<P>
   His initial findings suggested that one to three mature plants
were enough to improve the air in a 100-cubic-foot area. He also
found that it wasn't just plants doing the clean-up work, but the
microbes that were specific to the plants' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverton's personal favorites are the lady palm, peace lily and
``Janet Craig'' dracaena--''because they're easy to grow, resist
insects and work wonders'' for a variety of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   His latest book, ``How to Grow Fresh Air: Fifty Houseplants That
Purify Your Home or Office'' (Penguin Books, $15.95), additionally
lists the areca and bamboo palms, English ivy and rubber plant as
top pollutant controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers are unconvinced. For years, the EPA'S
Office of Indoor Air Quality has remained skeptical. ``Under a
tightly controlled situation, using plants may have some merit, but
people bring in contaminants when they enter a room,'' said Skip
Boat, who writes the office's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Axelrad, former director of the EPA Indoor Air Division,
said NASA's studies did little to simulate the air changes of a
typical home or office. ``Our calculations indicate that a much
higher density of plants would be required (hundreds of plants in
the typical house) to achieve these results,'' writes Axelrad.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

 &HT;    In early January, John Travolta climbed into one his four jets
and flew himself to Palm Springs, Calif., for the night. The star
of such diverse movies as ``Grease'' (1978) and ``Face Off'' (1997)
picked up the career achievement award at the Palm Springs
International Film Festival.
 &HT;    Next morning, he was back in the cockpit speeding home to his
actress-wife Kelly Preston and their son Jett.
 &HT;    Travolta is a real action man these days--on and off the screen,
flying high in jets and in the very top of the top reaches of
Hollywood.
 &HT;    This year Travolta has two chances to go home with the best
actor Oscar which has eluded him in two previous nominations. In
the past 12 months audiences have seen Travolta in what are
arguably his best roles ever: a Clintonesque presidential candidate
in Mike Nichols' savage political satire ``Primary Colors,'' and an
elegant shark of a civil lawyer in ``A Civil Action.''
 &HT;    Based on Jonathan Harr's dynamite best seller, ``Civil Action''
is the true story of a tenacious personal injury lawyer who battles
corporate America over the pollution of ground water in Woburn,
Mass., and its terrible effect on neighboring families.
 &HT;    Many insiders felt Travolta couldn't handle the role of Jan
Schlichtmann, an odious bad guy; not for the first time, Travolta
proved them wrong. He says he's proud of both the roles. (He can
also be seen in Terrence Malick's World War II film ``The Thin Red
Line''--a cameo he played as a favor to Malick whose latest film is
his first in 21 years.)
 &HT;    Meeting the Los Angeles press in a cashmere turtleneck, sports
coat and slacks, Travolta, 45, looked comfortable with himself. ``I
relished the opportunity to play a man who is cynical, arrogant,
detached and abrasive because these are not the roles usually
offered to me,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``I also like the fact that this movie doesn't preach--and that
it's a movie like 'Philadelphia' (Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning picture
about a lawyer dying of AIDS.) This was a movie about character
rather than issues. I saw Jan as a bit of a blackmailer who had
been corrupted by power so he's actually a villain at the beginning
and is transformed through the experience of working with these
families.''
 &HT;    Travolta got the part in ``Primary Colors,'' opposite Emma
Thompson, after Tom Hanks dropped out. Though the movie was not a
box office success, most critics agreed Travolta did an uncanny
job. ``I was very proud of 'Primary Colors,' he said. ``I think it
will hold up as one of the best political films ever made and
certainly the most informative about how politics really work.''
 &HT;    Although Travolta has been a frequent visitor to the White
House--on one famous occasion he danced with Princess Diana--he
claims he personally never got any feedback from the current
occupant of the Oval Office.
 &HT;    ``I did hear from Roger Clinton (the president's brother) that
the president really did like it and thought I had a heartfelt
feeling about the interpretation. And that was nice.''
 &HT;    So from the first family on down Travolta is the flavor of the
year. Even today, he said, he marvels at the twists and turns his
career has taken.
 &HT;    First there was ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) and then there
came a time--a long time--when he couldn't get arrested in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid and confused in those days,'' he said, ``but I
wouldn't admit it. I tried to put on a brave face when really I was
having ulcers because of the pressure to make films that didn't
exploit my image.''
 &HT;    He started taking risks, pushing himself beyond the conventional
Travolta type roles and before long, after comeback films like
``Pulp Fiction'' (1994), ``Get Shorty'' (1995) and ``Broken Arrow''
(1996), he was pulling in the same kind of salary as Tom Cruise,
Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson. Today his price is $20 million a film.
 &HT;    He has magnificent homes in California, the East Coast and
Florida, and with his four jets and his love of flying, it's a
breeze to get from one to the other. He's also very proud of the
fact that in l998 he completed a training course that certifies him
to fly a Boeing 707.
 &HT;    And he keeps up a phenomenal work schedule. He's just finished
``The General's Daughter'' opposite Madeleine Stowe and this year
he will star opposite his actress wife in ``Shipping News,'' a
picture he calls ``a funny eccentric piece.''
 &HT;    The pair married in 1991. ``I think we have good chemistry on
film,'' he said.
 &HT;    Travolta's confidence in himself and the absolute inevitability
of his success comes, he is the first to tell you, from his
membership since 1975 in the controversial Church of Scientology.
 &HT;    In tribute to his religion, in l999 he also plans to star in the
science fiction film ``Battlefield Earth,'' written by the church's
founder, the late L. Ron Hubbard.
 &HT;    ``In the '70s it helped me avoid drugs and drinking--that's
where everybody in those days was leaning. Without them, '' he said
``I wouldn't have lived any longer than John Belushi. It gave me
the strength to survive all those years when no one wanted to work
with me, and it helped me overcome a lot of anguish in my personal
life.
 &HT;    ``I've always been so proud of what it's done for me and my
family. I learned the organizational skills that are the basis of
L. Ron Hubbard's beliefs. It's necessary to make sure that Kelly
and Jett and I can have an ordered proper happy life in a home
where both parents are out working almost nonstop.''

   &UR; FOCUS: MEXICO-POPE: (Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Jan. 15) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II will visit Mexico City for four days beginning
Fri., Jan. 22. With no clear agenda released yet by the Vatican,
Mexicans wonder if the pope will address human rights, poverty and
the economy, religious competition, abortion _ or even drug
trafficking _ during his visit. A Catholic Diocese in Mexico's
Southern Chiapas state is hoping the Pope will take on the Mexican
government and the long-simmering Chiapas conflict, which has led
to the expulsion and imprisonment of Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: ROCK EN ESPANOL (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Jan.
14) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Often ignored by radio and MTV and underplayed on the pop
charts, the ``rock en espanol'' movement _ rock bands from Latin
America and elsewhere that sing in the Spanish language _ is
becoming a force that could change the face of popular music in the
next decade.

   &UR; TRAVEL: STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, COLO. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing sophistication, this ski resort, just three
hours out of Denver, remains a friendly ``country town at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: Beginning this year, cruise ships will no
longer be allowed to dock at the Cayman Islands on Sundays,
Christmas Day and Good Friday, apparently because of complaints
from church officials.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MILLENNIUM CELEBRATION: How did you usher in 1999? Was it
just another New Year's Eve of lukewarm pink Champale, slightly
scorched Jiffy Pop and Dick Clark on the tube? Hey, that's OK. But
no way is that going to cut it come next New Year's Eve, when
people worldwide will be partying like it's, well, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: PYRAMID POWER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the ``basic four'' have been out for a while and
that the little pyramid that appears on so many food labels now is
in. But just how much do you know about that pyramid and how much
do you or should you follow it?
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES: Lemon, Tuna and White Bean Salad; Chicken
Brassica.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: The prospect of getting in shape may seem too
daunting for some. Groveling, sniveling and making excuses may seem
the easy way out. But before you succumb to this quagmire of shame
and despair, check out the Internet, which can be gentle and
forgiving even for the most recalcitrant among us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: CHEVROLET METRO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drive most anything on the road today, and it's easy to overlook
the Chevrolet Metro _ formerly the Geo-brand Metro. It's a
subcompact that is among the smallest, least obtrusive cars
marketed today. Low, too, is the price. Metro coupes and sedans
range from $8,993 to $10,402 with some surprising features _
including an impressive fit-and-finish quality.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PROFILE: Chevrolet Metro at a glance.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: My 1999 resolutions are all directed at
being a more aware, courteous and safer driver.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you have a camcorder, a VCR and a television, you have the
basic equipment you need to edit your home videos into something
you'll be proud to show your friends or mail to relatives. You can
add impressive professional touches with editing equipment that
adds titles, allows you to put narration or background music on the
tape and work in special effects such as ending scenes by fading to
black.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: The Web has done a lot for pig Latin. A slew
of sites offer text translators. You type in a line of text or, in
some cases, a Web address, and the application turns it into pig
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Y2K ISSUES: As the 20th century winds down, pollsters,
economists and other trend watchers say American optimism is
surging. One reason may be the promise of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Nowadays, to be among the high-tech elite,
you need a home on the Web. Having one is pretty easy; some
Internet accounts come with the provision for free Web space.
Creating your own Web page can be easy and _ best of all _ free.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: ``RAISED ON RADIO'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Nachman's highly personal book, ``Raised on Radio,''
reminds us how much a generation was conditioned by that ubiquitous
box of sounds, how radio shaped our language, conversation and
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Lorraine Johnson-Coleman, a nationally known
folklorist and storyteller, is celebrating the success of ``Just
Plain Folks,'' a compilation of humorous tales about the
extraordinary lives of ordinary black people in the rural South.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Bret Easton Ellis doesn't need the National
Lampoon to turn him into a parody _ with ``Glamorama,'' he's done
it himself.

   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: FATTITUDES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton, Ohio, psychologist says people develop patterns of
thinking _ ``fattitudes,'' he calls them _ that lead them to
sabotage their attempts to lose weight, or their partners'
attempts. ``No matter what approach you take,'' he says, ``if
you're prone to self-defeating behavior, nothing will help. Not
exercise. Not diet. Not even Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: FATTITUDES LIST: A list of ``fattitudes'' that may
indicate your diet is in peril.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: FAMILY FITNESS: One in four American children is
overweight. It's a sobering fact disproving the belief that kids
lead naturally active, healthy lives and that these habits only
begin to deteriorate in adulthood. Gym operators are recognizing
that one way to get kids to appreciate exercise is to get them
working out with mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BRIEFS: Four University of Texas graduate business
students are turning some heads after inventing an electronic
tongue.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A with new Texas Lieutenant Govenor Rick Perry
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 1999 legislative session starts Tuesday with
a familiar face at the head of the Senate. But come Jan. 19, former
Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry will take the gavel from Lt.
Gov. Bob Bullock, becoming the first Republican to lead the chamber
since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who did not seek re-election, leaves big shoes to be
filled. He served eight years as the state's No. 2 officer _ a
position many consider more powerful than governor _ more than a
dozen years as the state's chief tax collector and a total of four
decades in and around Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   Perry discussed his ascension into the office last week with the
Austin American-Statesman:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your transitioning wrapping up?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's going well and very smoothly. Bullock has been
absolutely the most gracious and helpful individual, not only in
words of advice. When we need anything from him, he has been very,
very good to work with. It's been a good transition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you talk about advice that Bullock has given you, what
stands out; what's the most key piece that he has given you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our conversations are private. But in general, he has 45
years worth of institutional memory of this town, this government;
eight years' intimate relationship with the senators. He's been
very open with all of that. We've talked about a host of issues,
from the mundane to the stark. He has been very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What have you discovered that's been most surprising in the
job?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've got a lot of new friends. No surprises. Having been a
House member for six years and an agency head for eight years, I
had a close working relationship with the Senate and the
Legislature as a whole. There's no shocking revelations for me from
that perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What have you learned since winning this office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mostly minutiae from the standpoint of the intricacies of how
this great body works. There are big important issues that still
face the state of Texas. It's always interesting to see how we get
sometimes mired in the minutiae that sometimes doesn't really make
that much difference but you have to deal with. . . . with 31
different personalities, very strong egos. Keeping all of that
focused on a particular direction will be an interesting part of
the session. Driving the train is going to be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whom would you name as your kitchen cabinet; whose advice are
you seeking out?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're in the process of talking to a host of people across
the state with a lot of different expertises and a lot of different
backgrounds. During the campaign, we had a number of educators that
we talked to. I expect to keep those folks closely attuned to what
we are doing and what they are doing. Some of them are right here
in Austin. . . . The principal at O Henry (Middle School), Nancy
EldridgeEtheridge, is one I talk to often and expect to continue
talking to often as we go through the session dealing with the
education issues. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We fairly-well know what those are going to be with our Master
Reader Teacher program, the elimination of social promotion, the
funding of public schools. Most of those education issues have been
vetted, they've been fleshed out very nicely. We will continue to
be talking to people in the education establishment about what's
going on.
</P>
<P>
   As we go through and talk about the economic side of what we are
doing, the high-tech side is going to be very important: people
like (Austin entrepreneurs) Steve Papermaster and Peter Zandan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there other specific people who you are turning to?
</P>
<P>
   A: There will be. I'd like to have somewhat of a business
roundtable. What I am finding is that the Senate and the senators,
as they are developing their legislation, it appears that this is
going to be very much a session oriented toward the economic
development of the state of Texas. I want to have a substantially
diverse group of men and women from across the state of Texas that
are giving us input on any of these pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready to announce any of those specific individuals. But
we will have a lot of input outside of the beltway, outside of the
lobby and the government as we see it in Austin, to make sure that
we're hearing from the real world out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are (Austin developer Gary Bradley and San Antonio
businessman James Leininger) people who you think will eventually
be part of a kitchen cabinet; are they close to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would not put either of those individuals into a kitchen
cabinet that I would have. They are folks that I know and have had
relationships with. Neither one of them have been particularly
close in terms of public policy to me. . . . Neither one of those
individuals has made great forays into me or the staff from the
standpoint that ``Here's what I want out of the session.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there something specific that you want the Legislature to
accomplish regarding annexation?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm sympathetic to Texans no matter where they live ... where
a local government entity tends to run over the private property
rights of citizens. I think we can work out a way to annex lands
that abut a city in some reasonable way. If that reasonable way
can't be accomplished, then I believe that people should have the
right to vote on whether they are annexed or not. That's my core
belief.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would satisfy your definition of a reasonable annexation
process?
</P>
<P>
   A: Until I've had a chance to look at the legislation; there may
be some innovative concepts for bringing these groups together that
we haven't thought of. I want to put everything on the table. We'll
wait and see what different pieces of legislation get filed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a particular piece of legislation that you want to
see done on (publicly paid private school) vouchers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Where I tend to see the Senate going is a very well-defined,
limited program that is for children in low-performing schools that
are economically disadvantaged. Sen. (Teel) Bivins I think has
introduced a bill that is only for the six largest school districts
in Texas. I would suggest that it might be even smaller than that.
. . . You cannot lose sight of what this is all about. This is
about children's opportunity to get an education and to better
themselves. Children that are forced to go to low-performing
schools, we are sentencing to a life of failure or mediocrity at
best. I cannot defend the current system that we've got.
</P>
<P>
   I not only want to give those children and their parents an
alternative to that. I want to give those low-performing schools an
impetus to get better through two ways. One is through this
parental choice program. The other is our Master Reader teach
program. Not only is there competitive impetus that comes with the
parental choice program, there is also some help.
</P>
<P>
   All of that strengthens our public schools. That's my real goal.
I've got a real stake in this. I've got a freshman at Austin High
and a sixth-grader at O'Henry. It is important to me as a parent
that we strengthen those schools.
</P>
<P>
   As we debate this issue of parental choice ... I hope people
will be honest about what we are talking about here: a very well
defined, limited program that is going to affect only low
performing, economically disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you support changes to make (the state's clemency
process) an open meetings; requiring the board to state why or why
they are not recommending clemency?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we'll probably see that occur by the board without
any legislative directive. For however many years we had this
process, it's just now bubbled up to the top that this is not an
open enough process. I think the board will respond to that in a
positive and proper way. I think if the will of the Senate and the
will of the Legislature will be to make it (more open), I've got no
problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What specifically would you like to see on access to
abortion?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think our whole message needs to be, whether your are a
pro-choice or pro-life individual, we've got too many abortions in
Texas. We should daily send a message of abstinence and adoption.
From the standpoint of legislative issues, I think you'll see two
(bills): parental notification and parental consent. Last session,
parental notification passed out of the Senate. The Senate
philosophically hasn't changed much. I would suggest that one or
both of those pieces of legislation will be debated. Chances are
that one or both will pass out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there one of those that you prefer over the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: Either one is suitable to me. I would not be surprised if
both don't pass out, and I can support either. In fact, I do
support both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What process are you going through to decide committee
chairmanships?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're going through a relatively lengthy and time-consuming
process of talking not only to the members but some of the
institutional knowledge of the Senate on how to craft a committee
structure that is effective, relative to the senators' time.
</P>
<P>
   Do we have enough committees? Are there too many committees? Do
we have the right number of senators on committees? All of that is
being debated right now. There were a number of members who had
concerns about conflicts between committees. I don't know whether
it is fixable, but we're trying. We can't name the committee
chairmanships until we decide on the structure.

 &HT;    Ohio city managers fight the battle of potholes
 &HT;    By Jim Babcock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just as sure as the rollercoaster of freezing
temperatures and a warming thaw is a part of winter, there's
another inevitability: potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the issue of pothole woes elicited this response from
New Carlisle City Manager James Caplinger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. That's what happens in the winter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Caplinger and several other area municipal officials could
attest to, there is early mischief already.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, for example, some street crews have found it
necessary to divert from street-cleaning chores to wrestle with
some particularly nasty spring busters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep your eyes open. With this kind of weather,
potholes just appear,'' said Larry Vanderpool, Dayton's street
maintenance operations administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderpool said that has been particularly true on I-75, where
crews had been forced to patch three sizable potholes inside the
city limits, using a blowtorch to melt snow and dry the pavement so
the asphalt patch would stick.
</P>
<P>
   While other officials had no similar horror stories yet to tell,
all agreed their turns is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, things have been cold enough and staying frozen that
we've had no problems yet,'' Vandalia city engineer and service
director Ted Rusen said. ``If we get an initial thaw, then it
refreezes, then we'll start problems. But I don't think we've had
to do even one patching yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Springer, Kettering assistant street maintenance director,
sounded a similar theme, saying things are going to get worse with
widely fluctuating temperatures predicted through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Springer also said his crews have already been busy, in fact,
with patching a few potholes that were opening up.
</P>
<P>
   Fairborn City Manager Mike Hammond said it was necessary last
Saturday and early Monday for crews to lay some cold asphalt mix
patching in potholes that suddenly appeared on Central Avenue, on
the city's main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sure that as the ice goes off and we get a lot more
moisture, then the freezing/thawing thing, we're going to see a lot
more pavement failures,'' Hammond predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County Engineer Steve Hubbell said each spring he sends
out road crews to search for potholes and fill them. The severity
of the road damaged depends on the type of winter, he said, adding
potholes haven't become troublesome in Shelby County yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they show up, it's due to the freezing and thawing
cycle,'' he said. ``If you go through a winter where it's warm and
cold, warm and cold, you tend to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoning up knowledge gained through many winters of coping
with the culprits, the city officials explained the cause and
effect:
</P>
<P>
   It rains or snows while temperatures aren't yet at deep freeze
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Water from the rain or melting snow seeps into cracks and
crevices that have opened up in aging pavements, some of it
draining all the way through into an aggregate base that always
underlies any street surface.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures drop and the water freezes and thus expands in
volume.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion causes cracks and crevices to widen, lengthen and
deepen, and any saturated aggregate bases to heave upward.
</P>
<P>
   A thaw comes, the expansion contracts, then comes another freeze
and renewed expansion, then another thaw and contraction, and so on
and so on until the result is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that movement causes and creates the potholes,'' said John
Mitchell, Huber Heights street department director. ``Right now,
we've got nothing out of the ordinary. But I'm sure that when all
of this snow and ice thaws and melts, the potholes will start
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with this kind of winter, I'm sure we'll get a little bit
more than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell noted as well that snowplow blades can be a secondary
cause of potholes if they happen to strike the raised edge of, say,
an old street patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit it and chip or gouge it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All officials said their cities are so certain of the need for
pothole repair that money is annually allocated expressly
purchasing large quantities of the hot and cold asphalt mixes
they'll need to do the patching.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said potholes are least likely to develop on
recently reconstructed roadways and most likely to develop on aging
and deteriorating streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to get the ice off the roads before we can find
where any of them might be,'' said Jim Percival, Xenia assistant
city manager. ``Probably in about two weeks, we will be fighting
with the postholes. But right now, we're just trying to get the ice
off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a mater of fighting the good fight right now . . .
and eventually getting to the next one.''

 &HT;    Asylum for Honduran refugees, not for Guatemalans
 &HT;    By David Hafetz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Santiago Sal Siquinajay sat leaning against the
wall of a living room with no furniture, eyeing a mute television
where a contestant was trying to fit his torso through an unstrung
tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   Sal, his son and his son-in-law left Guatemala to work in the
United States; and, they hoped, create a fund through local
churches to help people in their town, Chimaltenango.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to find help for our children, so they never have
to come to the United States,'' Sal said.
</P>
<P>
   That goal remains elusive, as their journey lurches between
disasters and lucky breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in August after crossing the Mexican border, the trio
spent 98 days in U.S. detention awaiting deportation until,
unexpectedly, they were paroled last month as part of a U.S. effort
to help nations hit by Hurricane Mitch. Since Dec. 1, more than
2,800 Central American detainees have been released _ most from
Texas detention centers _ including four Guatemalans and Hondurans
who now share a rented house with Sal's family.
</P>
<P>
   Now the residents of that Spartan home, like hundreds of
thousands of other Central Americans in the United States
illegally, are being split into haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150,000 Hondurans and Nicaraguans, whose countries
were devastated by Mitch, are eligible to work legally in the
United States for up to 18 months. But Guatemalans and Salvadorans,
whose countries were less severely affected, cannot work and may
stay only until March 8, when they are supposed to be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates are praising the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service for granting work authorization, but they
fault the agency for not extending it to the approximately 500,000
undocumented Guatemalans and El Salvadorans living in the United
States. And more than 1,500 recently released detainees from those
countries now face a choice: Play by the rules and wait for
deportation, or melt into the pool of undocumented workers as they
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the mystery of the INS,'' said Saul Solorzano,
executive director of the Central American Resource Center in
Washington. ``They're saying people should not work, but you can
stay here. What are they supposed to do _ just hang around?''
</P>
<P>
   Edin, a 21-year-old Guatemalan who asked to be identified only
by his first name, is one who may not work. Unable to find a job
that paid enough to live on, Edin left Guatemala last summer. It
took him three months to reach the border, hopping trains across
Mexico on a perilous journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came poor; we came to this country suffering. We need the
work permit,'' he said. ``I'm going to travel to Los Angeles or New
York and look for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they cannot seek employment, Guatemalans and El
Salvadorans are still being released from detention centers if they
meet certain criteria: they have a friend or relative willing to
shelter them, have not committed a serious criminal offense and
were in the United States before Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 2,300 of the 2,800 Central Americans released so far left
detention centers in Texas, including 411 in the San Antonio INS
district, which covers Austin. More than 3,000 people from the four
countries were still in INS detention nationwide last week,
including 2,100 Guatemalans and El Salvadorans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are simply not dumped in the street to become public
charges,'' said Andrew L. Lluberes, an INS spokesman. Lluberes said
the agency's response to Hurricane Mitch, particularly the decision
to allow some Central Americans to stay and work _ known as
Temporary Protected Status _ is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary status is seen as a kind of indirect foreign aid,
since many Hondurans and Nicaraguans working here probably will
send part of their wages home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a bit of aid that can go back and help,'' said
Kevin Appleby, director of Migration and Refugee Services for the
U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington. Catholic officials said the
money sent home by immigrants exceeds U.S. aid and disaster relief
to the region, and, unlike formal programs, the money goes directly
to residents.
</P>
<P>
   Though undocumented Guatemalans and El Salvadorans cannot
legally work, INS officials say the pause in deportations will give
their nations breathing room before receiving detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice opportunity for the INS to show its humanitarian
side,'' Lluberes said.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigration advocates say the policy is too limited, and
they criticize the INS for not treating residents of all four
countries equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it's PR more than anything else. It sounds good but
doesn't really do anything (for Guatemalans and El Salvadorans),''
said Oscar Chacon, president of the Salvadoran-American National
Network, a private advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute that Honduras and Nicaragua bore the brunt of
Mitch _ 90 percent of the deaths occurred in those two countries,
according to the INS. But advocates argue that El Salvador and
Guatemala are still in economic jeopardy. Vast amounts of livestock
and banana, corn and bean crops were destroyed, as well as homes,
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise strongly against the simplistic analysis that goes
by the number of people dead,'' Chacon said. ``Central America is a
very small, territorial region. Every single development in each
country affects the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of advocates are asking the U.S. government to extend
the employment authorization to El Salvadorans and Guatemalans.
Even without official approval, some INS officials acknowledge that
many released detainees will still work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their main reason for coming up here is to seek work,'' said
Grace Winfrey, assistant director of the INS office in San Antonio.
``If given an opportunity, they would obtain a job. . . . It's a
really hard situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Enrique Guerra-Machado, a 47-year-old Honduran who is
living with Sal, is one of the winners under the latest
regulations. Enrique, who left his country shortly after Mitch
struck, is pleased that he can apply to work but finds his new
status bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty sad for our brothers. Our countries face the
same problems,'' he said. Asked what he would do in the
Guatemalans' place, he said he would work without permission.
``Hunger forces you to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the released detainees have been fingerprinted and
processed, INS officials say they will not be targets of a special
search when the deportation stay is lifted. ``We will not go out
and round them up or hunt them down,'' said Tim Counts, a spokesman
for the INS Central regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, before Sal and his family were released in early
December, they were hoping for deportation. The trio spent more
than three months in a Laredo detention center and were resolved to
go home.
</P>
<P>
   Sal's family secured release through his brother-in-law, Lou
Eberle, who lives in Dripping Springs. Eberle also helped eight
other Hondurans and Guatemalans find places to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy. When are you ever going to get a
get-out-of-jail-free card for just supplying an address?'' Eberle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sal's family spent December in limbo, relieved not to be in jail
Christmas Day and confident of receiving work papers. The INS
decision was an unexpected blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illogical,'' Sal said. ``What can you do with two months?
Absolutely nothing.''

 &HT;    Pro basketball settlement slam-dunks our sensibilities
 &HT;    By Sharen Shaw Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crime and welfare rates still being too brisk for total comfort,
I tend to look leniently on any way someone can earn a living
that's legal and doesn't involve calling me during dinner to ask if
I'm truly happy with my long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   But while I consider tolerance a virtue, I've never claimed it
was infinite. I reached the end of mine this week upon being made
aware of details of the NBA agreement. There's a reason they say
the devil is in the details - in this case, in the paragraphs near
the end of the wire service reports. Buried past the obligatory
``Gee, now we just wanna give the fans a good time'' quotes was the
riveting news that NBA salaries would start at $275,000 for a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, who to be fair collectively rake in $2 billion per
year from all this, were being hailed for hanging tough. For the
first time in any pro sport, they got the players to agree to
salary caps - to $14 million for a 10-year veteran. True, this is
chump change next to the $34.7 million that mega-star Michael
Jordan could take home under this agreement. But in one of the
NBA's rare brushes with reality, Kevin Willis of the aptly named
Toronto Raptors said, ``That's a lot of money. If you can't live on
that, something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If an entire small town can't live on that and have enough left
over for long-distance service, something's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But why should we be surprised? This was the grinding labor
dispute that gave rise to the concept of ``picket-line Porsches.''
That forced one player to sell one of his eight cars for
``walking-around money.'' That saw owners, the brutes, win a
provision that these knights of the court would have to pass drug
tests - once a year. Forgive me if I don't feel their pain: For the
$175,000 per game a veteran will make, he could afford to buy a
whole rehab clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bread-and-circuses thing, I suppose: Pro sports are
entertainment. They're peculariarly American entertainment, because
America always has venerated competence and expertise - in short,
professionalism - and been willing, even eager, to pay for it. And
if Jim Carrey can snare seven-figure contracts for making the kind
of faces that get most kids sent to the principal's office, why
shouldn't Michael Jordan do likewise for letting sports fans watch
his magic week after week?
</P>
<P>
   But I can't help it: I keep remembering the homeless kids I
worked with in D.C. and L.A., spare-changing up the $25 every month
to rent self-storage stalls so they'd have secure places to sleep.
After they got themselves, their backpacks and their rough shelter
blankets in one of the 6-foot-by-8-foot spaces, there wasn't enough
room left to toss in one of Jordan's Nikes, much less his $33
million 1998 contract.
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking of all the young teachers - the ones to whom we
entrust so much of our children's future - subsisting on some NBA
guy's ``walking-around money.'' All the big-city rookie cops I've
met who risk their lives and are happy to do it because the pay -
$40,000 if they're lucky - still is their best shot out of the
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   All of the social service agencies - the battered women's and
suicide counselors, the food pantries, the runaway youth hot lines
- that scrimp so they can serve hundreds of clients per year on
budgets literally less than half what a rookie basketball player
takes home for 80 nights' work a year.
</P>
<P>
   I don't begrudge the players their contracts or even the owners
their profits. They're just beneficiaries of our supply-and-demand
capitalism, which still remains one of the world's best economic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   I do wonder if it's past time for the rest of us to reconsider
our own priorities, to realize that every time we buy an NBA or NFL
ticket instead of supporting a local high school or college team,
or instead of volunteering at a food kitchen, we're voting with our
checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   As votes go, they speak far more to our own values than they do
to the owners' and players' greed.

 &HT;    It's time to pay piper for your holiday spending
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beginning of the new year, when credit card bills reflecting
holiday spending start showing up in the mail, marks the finale of
the December holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For too many people, it's a crashing end to a season of riotous
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, we see fresh studies showing Americans have piled on
huge amounts of debt, that a high percentage will take months to
pay it off, and some don't even expect to pay it off by the next
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to get in over your head. Interest rates on
credit card debts average 14.1 percent. That's enough to have banks
and retailers elbowing each other to give you a card _ and the
opportunity to borrow a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   They call that opportunity a line of credit. But when you use
it, it becomes a debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with those consumer debts is a process of making a plan
and having the gumption to stick to it. The planning is fairly
simple. Execution is the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake: You are the one who must do the work. Sure,
there are loud ads on TV for debt consolidation loans and home
equity lines of credit. But those are ways to rejigger the problem,
not to solve it.
</P>
<P>
   You must take three steps to get your debts under control:
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out exactly how bad things are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure that you have a complete picture of your
situation,'' said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta. ``You need to get all your
bills together and make sure you know the total.''
</P>
<P>
   When you make your list, also write down the interest rates you
are paying on each card.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out what resources you have.
</P>
<P>
   This brings up the word a lot of people don't like to deal with
_ budget. Go through your checkbook for recent months and sort out
how much you are spending for housing, food, transportation and
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Also write down your income for that period. The difference
between income and spending for necessities should give you at
least a rough idea how much discretionary income you have to work
with.
</P>
<P>
   The counseling service's Web site (http://www.cccsatl.org) has
an excellent interactive calculator to help you do the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Build your recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a reasonable plan, one that you can stick to,''
said Boas. ``It's like weight loss. Saying I'm going to lose 50
pounds won't make it happen. You have to lay out a step-by-step
plan and make sure each step is manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways to go about it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off the cards with the highest interest rates first. Think
of the interest rates as penalties you are trying to mitigate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider transferring your balance to lower-interest-rate
cards. But shop carefully _ ultra-low rates often are teasers that
will change to a higher rate in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get rid of most or all of your existing credit cards. Some
people just lock them away. But you're better off cutting them up.
It's a commitment, in a way, and a recognition that cash or checks
will still work just fine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a debit card for purchases such as mail orders. It won't
add to your debt load, because the purchase is deducted directly
from your checking account.
</P>
<P>
   _ For emergencies, carry a few travelers checks rather than
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider using your savings to pay down debt. If you are
earning a few percentage points on a passbook savings account but
paying 14 percent on a debt, you come out ahead by eliminating the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put some bills on autopilot. Once you know how much you can
afford to pay each month, you can direct your bank to make an
automatic transfer to the credit card company each month. The big
advantage: You never get your hands on the money, so you're not
tempted to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your payments as soon as the bill comes.
</P>
<P>
   _ If all of this sounds overwhelming, look around for help from
experts. CCCS, for example, offers free counseling and will help
develop a plan for repaying your creditors.

 &HT;    Stop worrying already
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Once, during a confused period of my life (I
was 12 and plagued with fears of foot fungus if I failed to dry
twice between each toe), a wiser and older (she was 13) friend
offered sage advice: ``Stop worrying. You'll
</P>
<P>
   make yourself nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad I couldn't absorb the wisdom of her off-hand comment. I
would have
</P>
<P>
   saved myself somewhere in the neighborhood of 48 years of
worrying about stuff
</P>
<P>
   that never happened. But it does make for some interesting
stories along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's biggest worry was that she was going to outgrow her
Halloween costume.
</P>
<P>
   She so loved being a tiger, complete with whiskers and tail,
that she kept the
</P>
<P>
   outfit under her bed and tried it on often just to reassure
herself she hadn't
</P>
<P>
   outgrown it. Of course, the inevitable happened. One day she put
it on and
</P>
<P>
   discovered the only way she would still be able to wear it would
be to develop
</P>
<P>
   a pronounced stoop.
</P>
<P>
   Her nose, she says, was another cause for concern. It seems the
nuns at her school had told the kids that if they picked their
noses they would get cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gail says that was the reason the kids in the green uniforms
with ``SJC''
</P>
<P>
   monogrammed on their pockets had a reputation for the most
disgusting noses in
</P>
<P>
   town.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around her sixth birthday my friend Jeanne, in
addition to a nagging concern that the chewing gum she swallowed
was going to stick her stomach shut, began to worry about coming
home from the playground and finding a black spot on her front door
which would mean, according to the latest Charlie Chan movie, that
a Chinese tong had marked her for death. It was weeks before she
stopped scanning her surroundings for a telltale smudge.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie used to worry that her mom would give her to the rag man
when she was
</P>
<P>
   naughty. Gail's mom threatened her with the ``googly-eyed''
garbage man, telling
</P>
<P>
   her to shape up or prepare to ship out with the coffee grounds.
</P>
<P>
   I was about 10 when I developed a gut-wrenching fear of leprosy.
First thing each day I'd leap out of bed and run to the mirror to
check my eyelids and earlobes (I'd read those were the first places
the symptoms reveal themselves).
</P>
<P>
   One terrifying morning I found a definite flake on an eyelid and
ran to the kitchen in hysterics, advising my confused parents they
would never see me again because I would soon be discovered and
sent to the leper colony on Molokai.
</P>
<P>
   My son was afraid if he pulled the cat's tail it would come off
and he'd have a lot of explaining to do. His biggest worry though
was that his hair was going gray. The fear peaked one afternoon
when he asked me to come into the den for a serious talk and
informed me he wanted a bottle of Grecian Formula to bring his hair
back to its natural color. It wasn't easy explaining to a
3-year-old the difference between his towhead and granddaddy's
gray.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell, an old friend back in Georgia, spent years scared to
death of kudzu,
</P>
<P>
   a rapid-growing (about a foot a day), fuzzy-leafed vine brought
to the southeastern U.S. in 1876 as a ground cover to control
erosion. It's noted for
</P>
<P>
   climbing anything that gets in its way including slow-moving
humans. Wendell's
</P>
<P>
   mom used it as a threat to remind him that lazy boys were
quickly covered by kudzu and never found again. He took the warning
to heart and for years, even on the sultriest Georgia nights,
refused to sleep with an open window for fear the insidious climber
was going to break through the screen and get him.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight makes our fears look pretty silly. Gail and her nose
are alive and well on the Oregon coast, even without her tiger
suit. Jeanne escaped eradication by the Chinese Mafia to become a
grandmother of three living comfortably on the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Molokai now caters to tourists rather than lepers, and best of
all, kudzu is
</P>
<P>
   being touted as a cure for alcoholism (90 capsules for $17.95
and shipping).
</P>
<P>
   It's time to follow my old friend's advice: ``Stop worrying!
You'll make
</P>
<P>
   yourself nuts!''

 &HT;    Visitors reap dividends at Everglades Inn
 &HT;    (EDS: Weekend Getaway Info box at end of text.)
 &HT;    By Louis Hillary Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGLADES CITY, Fla. _ You can feel safe On The Banks of the
Everglades. In fact, you can have breakfast in one.
</P>
<P>
   Cantaloupe with cream. Quiches with tomato and cheese. Banana
bread and juice. Good coffee. Served to you inside what was the
vault of the Bank of Everglades, established in 1923 by the Barron
Collier family.
</P>
<P>
   Within a long cast of the Barron River or a short walk to
Chokoloskee Bay, the bank saw Collier County's first seat through
the Roaring '20s, the Depression '30s, the war years, the '50s and
into the 1960s before closing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Patty Flick Richards and her father, Bob Flick,
began renovating the structure to create an ambience that taps into
the location's business past while shaping a surprisingly homey
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A Java rice finch hops from perch to perch on an upstairs
landing. Chives, oregano and dill grow in table pots to keep the
air inside the metal breakfast room fragrant and fresh. A fan keeps
it moving. Overhead, play money bends on a crisscross of
clotheslines, part of the banking theme that is carried on
throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are called ``investors'' and can stay in such rooms as
Small Business Loans, The Checking Department, The Board Room, The
Mutual Funds Department or the Presidential Suite. The smaller
rooms are meant for single occupancy and share a bath, while large
rooms can accommodate up to four. The Board Room has its own
entrance while the Presidential Suite has a private bedroom, full
kitchen, private bath, living room and a full-size dining room. It
once was Barron Collier's office.
</P>
<P>
   But Flick-Richards balances the building's boxy exterior and the
inn's institutional names with a friendly attitude and a lot of
personal touches. In my second-floor corner room I found stenciled
ceiling borders and hand-written notes telling me about the
features of the Savings Department.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were a private bath and shower with the kind of hot
water I wish I had at my house. A wicker basket full of soft,
fluffy towels. A writing desk and a small breakfast table. The TV
worked well and there was a good-sized sofa that could be converted
for sleeping. My double bed was one of the most comfortable I've
ever slept on away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Forgot your blow dryer? No problem. The staff is glad to provide
one. Or an iron and ironing board.
</P>
<P>
   A guest book beside the bed reflected the international flavor
of the clientele with whom I shared breakfast. Home addresses
ranged from Germany to Japan and all points across the U.S. And
ages ranged from the sunburned 20s to a couple celebrating their
50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its hardwood floors and no two rooms the same, On
The Banks of the Everglades, and Everglades City itself, is not for
everyone - at least not for long. Unless you're a fisherman in
search of snook or tarpon, there's not much more than a weekend's
worth of stuff to do.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Museum of the Everglades right across the street
from The Banks, and just to the south on Chokoloskee Island is
Smallwood's Store. It re-creates a turn-of-the-century Everglades
trading post.
</P>
<P>
   The ranger station on the Chokoloskee Causeway is the western
entrance to Everglades National Park. Boat tours leave from there
several times a day, giving visitors a good overview of what makes
the Everglades a one-of-a-kind environment. On my Sunday morning
ride we saw manatees and dolphins, ospreys and eagles, and learned
about the mangrove marshes - the basic incubator for all natural
life in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of places offering air boat tours and canoe and
kayak rentals.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, dine on the porch of the Rod &AMP; Gun Club and watch the
fishermen cut white trails through the water as they return to the
docks around the bend. The surf and turf is excellent and the
ambience is old Florida elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Walk off the meal with a stroll down the middle of Riverside
Drive, where the sounds of jumping fish and night birds are more
frequent than that of passing cars. But don't forget the mosquito
repellent. You are on the banks of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Everglades City
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Take Florida's Turnpike or Interstate 95 to I-75
(Alligator Alley), go west to U.S. Highway 29, and south to
Everglades City; or for a more scenic route, take State Road 80
West through Belle Glade and Clewiston, at LaBelle take U.S. 29
South to Everglades City. Drive time is 2 1/2 to 3 hours depending
on the route.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: At On The Banks of the Everglades they range from $50 for
a single occupancy room to $105 for the Presidential Suite. Weekly
and monthly rates are available. But be warned, the inn has a
14-day cancellation policy and a $20 fee is deducted for all
cancellations; also, the first floor of The Banks is wheelchair
accessible, but there are no private bathrooms on that floor.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    A closet scrapbook of memories
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available from the Palm Beach Post.)
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Molly Pigadis, Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sweater that spoiled her.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Pigadis grew up on a Michigan farm in a family of 13 kids;
clothing-wise, just one in a long line of hand-me-downs. ``I'm
going to marry a rich man,'' she told herself, and couldn't wait to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   She left, but she did not marry a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie worked for an insurance company. They met in 1937 in New
York City, where Pigadis was visiting a friend. In the middle of a
house party Charlie left his date, walked over and asked her to
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He approached me. Those days women didn't dare,'' she says.
``We lost a lot of good times having to be ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   On their first date, she wore the best she had _ a black dress
with a full skirt and velvet on the neck, and a strand of cheap
pearls.
</P>
<P>
   When they married in 1941 she was 27, and he was 23. ``Very tiny
closets we had,'' she says. They shared one.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple learns to scrimp, so Pigadis made do with three
pairs of shoes, black and white and beige, and they went with
everything. She had a Sunday dress and a dressy dress and maybe one
or two suits. Her nylons had seams down the back of the legs _
sexy, she says, but if they weren't straight you just looked
bowlegged.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter arrived that first year, and things got even tighter.
But in time, Charlie got out of insurance and into the yacht
business in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to surprise her. For her 30th birthday, he bought her
the sweater with fur trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what every woman wanted,'' she says. ``I think it was
$90 or something. Ermine? It can't be ermine. Fox is longer hair,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   She had never worn furs, and not just because she couldn't
afford it. She was convinced that her hands were ugly, so she
didn't wear anything that would draw attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   But this fur felt so nice.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she dared to wear it (think of the spills!), it was
out of style. So what? She took it out every evening, and whether
she wore it or not, it was always on her shoulder or her arm. Every
night she would wrap the fur in tissue paper and put it carefully
in a drawer. Her two daughters weren't allowed to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   As Charlie earned more, he gave her a fur jacket, then a fur
suit, then a mink coat. Guess which one she loved the most?
</P>
<P>
   Charlie died in 1992, and a year later Pigadis moved into a
retirement community in Delray Beach. While unpacking, she found
the sweater, still wrapped in tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   She kisses it. ``I'm going to be buried with that,'' she says.
``It's in my will.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lutto, West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lutto dropped out of college to join the army, and the
army handed her a bologna sandwich and a pair of khaki bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the khaki just kept coming _ underwear, and a slip, not to
mention the skirts and jackets. The underwear was one size fits
all. Thank goodness Lutto could sew.
</P>
<P>
   The army just wasn't that good at dressing women, she figures.
It was 1943, and Lutto was barely 21 when she joined the Women's
Army Corps in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye pleated plaid skirt, crewneck sweater and bobby socks.
Hello lace-up, Cuban-heel oxfords. And khaki.
</P>
<P>
   Lutto joined the army for adventure and freedom. Why sit at a
desk? ``I could never afford to travel,'' she says. ``So I got to
go to North Dakota in the winter and Mississippi in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutto went to radio school in Newark, N.J., and learned to test
radios on airplanes. They called her group The Singing WACs,
because they sang when they marched.
</P>
<P>
   The army even gave them pants, kind of an adventure in itself.
The pants were only for climbing in and out of planes, though.
Everywhere else, even during calisthenics, it was fatigue dresses
or khaki suits.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she dyed her khaki wool suit black so she could
wear it to school. Skirts became longer, so she sewed a velveteen
border to lengthen the hem and put some on the collar to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had to be more conservative,'' says Lutto, now 76.
``Things had to match.'' Color, real color, came later.
</P>
<P>
   Lutto went back to college and found she had to wear a girdle,
because the school required it at Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She made sure she never wore one again. She liked independence
of mind, and of tummy, too. In the late '60s, she got rid of her
garter belt.
</P>
<P>
   Lutto saved this World War II cap for the memory of her first
adventure, her first real look at the world. She thought she would
wear it in parades. But by the '60s the army was in Vietnam, and
she couldn't understand it. Why are we there? she asked. Vietnam
had no Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, she marched in protest. And the cap remained at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Brown, Juno Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had many negligees, but Jane Brown kept only this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When mother died, she had more nightgowns than she had ever
worn,'' says Brown, 82. All were hand-made. ``She liked pretty
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one was around to see them. Her mother, Hazel, was a
widow for many years and lived alone.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Brown says, negligees were nearly as discreet and
personal as sex itself. Every bride had at least one white negligee
set in her trousseau, Brown says. One of her own daughters had
seven _ one for every night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother wore hers in her private quarters. Only after she
died did Brown really get a look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother bought this one in a Lebanese boutique named
Karella's in Massachusetts, she says. In winters the Karellas would
move their shop to Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still quite luxurious,'' Brown says. Sometimes, on a New
Year's Eve, she will slip it on.
</P>
<P>
   But she will not repeat what happened years ago, when she ran
out of her ground-floor apartment at The Waterford in the middle of
the day to shoo away some ducks. Wearing just the negligee. Oh
dear.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wears the negligee and matching nightgown on trips. That
is her romance. New Zealand, Australia, The Orient Express from
London to Venice, Bermuda, Boston, the Seine, Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't travel so much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matching nightie wore out,'' Brown says, ``and so did I.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Taffer, West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother never taught me to sew,'' Miriam Taffer says. ``But
I used to watch her.''
</P>
<P>
   She was still a kid when she bought some chartreuse fabric and
sewed a blouse on the machine at home. She trimmed it with a
flourish of sequins and, proudly, showed it to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother just said, ``Mmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it as perfect as I could,'' says Taffer, 75. ``That hurt
a little bit.'' And for a moment, decades later, it still does.
</P>
<P>
   Taffer's mother was an exacting one. She was born in Latvia and
studied dressmaking there, then came to the United States in 1914
and changed her name from Olga to Gussie.
</P>
<P>
   She did good work. Her American husband would read the English
instructions on a pattern and she could sew it. She also could look
at a piece of clothing in a store window, then go home and copy it,
Taffer says.
</P>
<P>
   Gussie worked in the garment district in Manhattan, where she
did fine stitching by hand. Each completed garment got a ticket,
and each ticket brought a commission. During World War II she could
make up to $300 a week for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Taffers says that until she was 16, her mother made everything
she wore except underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was so clean she dressed us three times a day,''
Taffer says. ``In the morning, after lunch and after dinner. She
was proud of her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gussie even made the two of them matching mother-daughter suits.
That one thing, in all the bits and pieces she remembers, makes
Taffer cry.
</P>
<P>
   She learned to sew by watching her mother's hands. With a smile,
she shows off a daisy sweater she knitted for herself at the age of
12. ``Once I start something I sit with it,'' she says. ``I even
made the pompoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Taffer taught her friends in the Bronx to crochet. Years later
she tried to teach her daughter to embroider, but it didn't stick.
``She maybe made one stitch a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Taffer saved them anyway, because she saves everything, even her
mother's needles. She kept the passport too.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ellis Island became a museum she put Gussie's name on
the Wall of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping old clothes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Control exposure to heat, light and humidity, especially with
silks. Humidity should be under 60 percent. Keep items out of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store clothes in acid-free boxes with acid-free tissue. Try
library supply companies such as Light Impressions (800-828-6216).
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not store clothes on hangers _ it puts stress on the
shoulders and does not give enough support.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dry cleaning is not usually recommended for museum-quality
clothes. There are no textile conservators in Florida. For help in
finding one, try the American Institute for Conservation
(202-452-9545). The group also has free brochures on keeping
clothes.
</P>

 &HT;    South Beach hotel was Capone haunt
 &HT;    By Louis Hillary Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At the Clay Hotel, in the middle of the
night, among a small labyrinth of courtyards, it's not hard to
close your eyes and hear the spin of a roulette wheel.
</P>
<P>
   A whisper among the banana trees _ ``I'll see your hundred and
raise you two more.'' Is that Al Capone striding toward you in a
narrow hall, his fedora cocked to one side? That wisp of tobacco
smoke you smelled - is it just a late-returning guest or
``Scarface'' returning to one of his old haunts? The Clay, you see,
at 1438 Washington Ave., was home to the mobsters '1920s-30s
gambling syndicate. With Espanola Way as the cross street, it was
part of Miami Beach's original ``Spanish Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a hostel geared to travelers who want a room just
two blocks from Ocean Drive and who would rather spend their money
on food and drink thana fancy place to stay. In the wood-accented
lobby, the staff has an international flavor, and it caters to an
international crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But The Clay isn't only for twentysomethings or overseas
visitors. Everyone is welcome, but it helps to bring the right
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   At $38-$42 a night for a private room or $13 for one of 220
dormitory-style beds, The Clay is not the Fontainebleau. There's no
pool or room service. But there's a nice, small restaurant off the
lobby - The Moonlite Cafe - with tables and chairs that spill onto
the shady sidewalk of Espanola Way. Next door on Washington Avenue
is Stephan's Groceria Italiano, alive with the scent of fresh bread
and vegetables, and deliciously robust garlic. Upstairs is a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more dining choices, walk over to Ocean Drive. At
night, almost every deco porch and lobby becomes a restaurant of
better or worse repute, and most take their business onto the
sidewalk. There's the collegiate crowd at the Clevelander, the
diners in suit coats at Pavarotti's and the leather-and-Levi's
crowd at Johnny Rocket's - a retro grill with red barstools, loads
of white tile and '50s chrome. You can dine under the palms and
moonlight, or at least in the rainbow glow of myriad neon hues.
</P>
<P>
   One block inland is Collins Avenue, which is just as loaded with
deco and neon, and nearly as many restaurants, though most manage
to stay contained within their own space. Joe's Stone Crab is at
the corner of Washington and South Pointe Drive, and if you've
never been, you should go, no matter how far the line stretches
down the street.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you really want to see Miami Beach glitz at its
shiniest, the place of the moment is The China Grill. You can
hardly miss it. It sits on the southwest corner of Washington and
Fifth, at the base of a 10-story neon silo.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is vaguely Oriental, with rice paper shades covering
the over headlights like inverted turtle backs, giving the whole
sprawling place a sepia glow. It's the sort of place where men
dress in all black and hold their cigarettes at the end of their
fingertips, gesturing with them with the same nonchalant ease with
which they manipulate the standard-issue chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   I sat at the long bar, ordered a Thai beef appetizer ($15) and
ate it with a fork next to a dead-ringer for Albert Einstein. The
shirt-sleeved older gentleman was with a woman in an evening gown
some years his junior. This brought to my mind all sorts of
questions about relativity, but I made conversation with a German
real-estate investor and successfully fought the urge to pry.
</P>
<P>
   But, for all its airs, and to my mind, overpriced food, the
staff was friendly and helpful, and the clientele affable. And
don't let the name mislead. While the menu has an Oriental twist,
the room definitely moves to a salsa beat.
</P>
<P>
   I slipped out through a row of waiting limousines and walked
north toward The Clay.
</P>
<P>
   My room was of adequate size for one who is not too
claustrophobic. Located above a shoe repair shop and a candle
store, it was clean, with an extra-firm double bed, bamboo dresser,
a small table and a refrigerator. Oddly, the closet was almost big
enough for someone to sleep in. The air conditioning worked well
with the aid of the ceiling fan, and the bathroom was no-frills
functional. The only disconcerting aspect was that the TV was
mounted high on a wall, hospital-style, and when you watched it, it
seemed to watch you.
</P>
<P>
   But making up for all of that was the small balcony overhanging
Espanola Way.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, I sat shirtless at the small table and
watched the sunset over Flamingo Park and what I knew was beyond:
Biscayne Bay, then Miami, then the Everglades, then ... and then .
. . and then it was dark, and strings of Christmas lights strung
across Espanola Way came alive and gave that one little stretch of
Miami Beach a New Orleans ambience. A restaurant across the street
opened its French doors, and a parade of in-line skaters glided by
with their ubiquitous headphones and backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to understand why the '80s TV show Miami Vice
often used the street as a backdrop, or why musical stars such as
Elton John have used it for their rock videos.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   What: The Clay Hotel is a member of Hosteling International with
dormitory-style accommodations available, starting at $13 (you can
rent lockers for your valuables). Private rooms start at $38 and
are equipped with air conditioning, ceiling fans, refrigerators and
telephone. Lounges, a TV room and a fully equipped kitchen and
dining area are available to guests. Cozy courtyards provide for
intimate spaces throughout the property. VIP rooms, $86.
</P>
<P>
   Where: 1438 Washington Ave., Miami Beach, 33139 (call
305-534-2988 or 800-379-CLAY). On the edge of the Deco District,
within an easy walk of Collins Avenue, Ocean Drive and the beaches.
From West Palm Beach take Florida's Turnpike or Interstate 95 south
to the Golden Glades interchange, continue south on I-95 to I-395
in downtown Miami, go east on the MacArthur Causeway to the 5th
Street in Miami Beach, take 5th to Washington Avenue and turn north
(left). Espanola Way is between 14th and 15th streets and The Clay
is on the left. Parking: The Clay has no on-site parking, but there
is a good, guarded municipal lot about two blocks away at the
northeast corner of Collins and 13th Street. Tip: Bring your own
pillows.

 &HT;    McDuffie's big day a downer
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - O.J. McDuffie had a big day against the Denver Broncos
Saturday, nine catches for 118 yards in the AFC semifinals, which
means the rest of the Miami Dolphins offense was infinitessimal.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the agony of being the only cast-iron link in a
paper-clip chain of Dan Marino options. When the eternal arm is
constantly searching the field for McDuffie, then the Dolphins must
always be in a third-and-long bind, which indicates the running
game has run dry, which pretty much assures that Miami is a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Warfield never had to work this hard in his Dolphins glory
days. He was a shiny accessory in a Miami attack that routinely
pounded its way into the Super Bowl, one Larry Csonka piledriver at
a time. Three or four catches a game would do it for Warfield, each
of them spectacularly showcased for maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie, on the other hand, rarely catches a pass without
catching some major grief, too, in the form of bruises and cuts and
loose teeth. His job is to meet a hard knot of defensive backs at
the first-down stick and wrestle there for Miami's honor.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, down 14-0 Saturday before Terrell Davis had even
wrinkled his jersey, had no first downs until O.J. caught a
23-yarder on the final play of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, Jimmy Johnson had conceded altogether, sending in
the scrubs to take a knee and voluntarily burn the final minute of
a 38-3 playoff rout. Sure, Denver is a tough place to pull off an
upset, but the Broncos won two road games last year on their
wild-card journey to the Super Bowl title. McDuffie would blend
well in a stubborn locker room like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he stands out in Miami, stands alongside Marino, his
hardheaded partner on an otherwise soft-shelled team.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone out there realize that McDuffie led the NFL in
receptions this season with 90. No other Dolphin ever did that. Not
Warfield, the Pro Football Hall of Famer. Not Nat Moore, the
smartest and most durable Miami receiver for more than a decade.
Not even the magnificent Marks, Clayton and Duper, who grew weary
trying to think of interesting variations on their end-zone
celebration dances during the free and easy days of Marino's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Who in the Miami locker room but McDuffie could say they
finished 1998 strongly?
</P>
<P>
   He had no touchdown catches in the season's first eight games
but seven in the second half. Look, too, to the only Dolphins'
scoring drive Saturday. Miami got 45 yards and two first downs from
O.J. on the 76-yard trudge to a second-quarter field goal. If not
for McDuffie, the Dolphins would have had a shutout to add to their
shame.
</P>
<P>
   There is no silly celebration, however, for McDuffie, not in the
way that Lamar Thomas might prance over a short catch on a long
afternoon. O.J. is deadly serious about winning. He even sparked,
uncharacteristically, at a South Florida reporter who chuckled
about something in the general neighborhood of his locker at Mile
High Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a man who played for Don Shula as long as he has Jimmy
Johnson, and for Joe Paterno longer than that. Should the Dolphins
decide to dump the hefty salary of offensive tackle Richmond Webb,
only Marino, Bernie Parmalee and Dwight Hollier will have been with
Miami longer than McDuffie's six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. has played in six postseason games and lost four. He has
never reached the AFC Championship Game. He knows what it takes to
get there, an obstinance that overpowers the annoyances of injuries
and odds and sudden-death games on the road, and can only wonder if
these young Dolphins will ever join him in that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets don't care where they go,'' said McDuffie, admitting
his admiration for a New York team that swept Miami in the regular
season and marches into Mile High on Sunday with legitimate Super
Bowl aspirations. ``The Jets are ornery like that. They'll play
anywhere and they'll play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami won't be that way until someone other than O.J. is the
leading receiver. The Dolphins still need, as ever, a deep threat
or two, and a monster running back, and a defense that makes
turnovers happen no matter the level of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   That would make McDuffie purely a possession receiver, the
perfect role for him on an ideal team. That would make Miami a
serious threat beyond January's opening salvoes.
</P>
<P>
   And that, more than leading the league in receptions, would
squeeze from O.J. a lasting, winning smile.

 &HT;    Trainer's `real deal' is change to Tyson
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tommy Brooks, who once suggested that no trainer could
make a significant difference in the deteriorating career of Mike
Tyson, seems to have bought himself some new perspective since
leaving Evander Holyfield's corner for a fatter paycheck with the
former heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson and Holyfield should meet for a third time in the ring,
``Tyson beats Holyfield,'' said Brooks, now training Tyson for
Saturday's comeback fight against Francois Botha in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike still has the speed and he still has the power. But the
difference is that he has a corner this time. He comes to the fight
with a plan. In the past two fights, the corner just told him to
knock Evander out. But they didn't tell him how; they thought
Evander was just a washed-up fighter with one arm and one eye.''
The comments stunned Holyfield, who employed Brooks as Don Turner's
assistant since making a comeback from a misdiagnosed heart ailment
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said that, it's just because he wants to take the
money,'' Holyfield said. ``But he told me the only reason he left
was because of the money, so it shows you it's all about the pay. I
don't know if he really believes (Tyson would win). But if that
fight ever comes about, he's in a no-lose situation. If Mike loses,
(Brooks) gets fired anyway. It's part of the game. You get beat up
by Holyfield, you get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was making reference to former Tyson trainers Jay
Bright and Richie Giachetti, each of whom was fired after Tyson
losses to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every trainer thinks they're the missing piece to the
puzzle,'' Holyfield said from Houston, where he is training for his
March 13 title unification bout with Lennox Lewis. ``Then if things
don't work out, the first thing the guy always says is, 'Well, the
fighter didn't listen to me.' Everybody has tried to tell him
stuff. But when the fight starts, you're the only guy in the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments echoed remarks Brooks made before the second
Holyfield-Tyson fight after Giachetti vowed that Tyson would throw
more combinations and be a less predictable and smarter boxer.
``How can Tyson change what he's been doing all his life?'' Brooks
said at the time. ``I know Mike's a special guy, but once he gets
hit, he's going to go back to what he's always done. . . He can
have Richie Giachetti, Eddie Futch, Angelo Dundee and Emanuel
Steward over there, and it won't matter because Tyson is the guy in
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who generally earned $250,000 per fight with Holyfield _
although he made $500,000 for the rematch _ signed a deal with
Tyson for three 10-round non-title fights at close to $1 million
per fight.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he thinks that he's had Tyson's attention in
training in the Phoenix area. ``This guy's been schizoid in the
ring, but the problem is he hasn't had anybody to help him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Tyson took Holyfield lightly in their first fight,
won by Holyfield on an 11th round TKO, and that he erred in rushing
into the rematch, in which Tyson was disqualified in the third
round for biting. Despite his new loyalty, Brooks does not buy
Tyson's contention that he bit Holyfield to retaliate for alleged
head-butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all bull,'' Brooks said. ``He hasn't asked me about it,
but I'll tell him that if he does. He was like a cornered mouse,
looking for a way out of the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Tyson was trying to get disqualified and, in effect,
quit, Brooks said, ``In essence, yes.''

 &HT;    Pros and cons of internet recruiting
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mack Brown was startled when he heard the news.
At this time last year, a story linking the first-year University
of Texas coach to an NFL job opening was making the rounds on Web
sites related to Longhorns football.
</P>
<P>
   The report appeared to be written by someone employed by the
Associated Press. It even had quotes from Brown, talking about how
a coach had to listen when an NFL team came calling.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the story was a fake, posted to start a
buzz in the middle of a highly intense and competitive recruiting
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a week before national signing day, and the story
looked authentic,'' Brown recalled. ``It was started probably by
somebody trying to be cute, somebody trying to be funny. For
recruits and coaches, the Internet is really one of those dangerous
tools because so many people can fool around with the information.
. . . And the information spreads so fast nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting fans can get an instant information fix these days
with a click of the mouse, rather than having to wait on a nightly
fax or dialing expensive 900 telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Credible recruiting services such as the National Recruiting
Advisor and SuperPrep, which in the past presented their
information in magazines and 900 numbers, now have their own Web
sites, some with interactive chat lines and bulletin boards where
people can post information using anonymous nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   There also are multitudes of Web pages maintained by fans who
report what was published in a newspaper or by a recruiting service
and what was talked about on the local radio talk show or on
someone else's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the line between fact and rumor starts to blur. As a
result, coaches are spending as much time dispelling rumors as they
are talking up their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our recruits to disregard anything they see on the
Internet,'' Brown said. ``What you find is recruits are constantly
asking questions, and you're constantly having to defend
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Disinformation campaign
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon last week, several rumors were discussed on UT Web
sites. Longhorns defensive coordinator Carl Reese was headed to
Florida. UT recruit Tyrone Richardson would end up going to
Oklahoma. And Chris Simms, the No. 1 quarterback in the country,
was backing off his commitment to Tennessee to sign with the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   None of the information was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Burton, managing editor of the National Recruiting Advisor
and its Web site, Recruitingnow.com, said the information actually
is getting more accurate as more news sources go on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, about 10 percent of what you read on the web
was accurate,'' Burton said. ``Last year, it was 35 to 40 percent.
This year, I'd say it's about 85 to 90 percent accurate. More
people are referring to credible sources rather than what
somebody's heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, incorrect information is getting out, and it's affecting
the recruiting process. And the problem isn't just reserved for
schools in Texas. Alberto Garcia, who edits the recruiting section
for Netbuffs.com, a web site for University of Colorado fans,
acknowledged that there is a problem with bad information.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our message boards, it gets kind of crazy,'' Garcia said.
``There's some good stuff on there posted from people who subscribe
to recruiting services. But there's just as much nonsense and stuff
that doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get comments from parents (of recruits) all the time. If
someone posts that a player is good, not great, then two hours
later we get an e-mail from a parent who thinks the coaches are
telling us that stuff so that's what the coaches must think of
their son.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinging comments
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Scarbrough, who publishes True Orange, a newsletter geared
to UT fans, said Chip Ambres, a top quarterback prospect last year,
cancelled a trip to Texas after reading negative comments posted
about him on a Longhorns-related bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the UT fans didn't like him,'' said Scarbrough, who
will launch a new Web site this spring. ``These people (posting the
criticism), who were purporting to be Texas fans, knew Chip read
stuff on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know college coaches are very concerned because purported
fans of different schools get on the Internet and badmouth the
recruits. I know the Mack Browns and the R.C. Slocums don't want
these purported fans of their schools badmouthing their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole Pittman, an All-American defensive end from Shreveport,
La., was stung by the interactive criticism leveled at him last
week on a Louisiana State-related Web site. The criticism came a
day after he committed to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team that gets you, you're pretty high in the eyes of
those fans,'' said Pittman, who recently was selected to the second
team on the USA Today All-America team. ``Then if you don't go to a
school, the fans are ripping you. I haven't done anything to those
people. They're after me, and all I did was tell their school no.
It really tells you the character of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution
</P>
<P>
   Some people who maintain Web sites are trying to limit the
criticism. Anthony Hooten _ who publishes the Aggie Websider, which
is geared toward Texas A&AMP;M fans _ said chat rooms and bulletin
boards are moderated for content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We project a concentrated, positive, but honest view of Aggie
recruiting efforts, while avoiding attacks on other schools and
preventing such flaming either way on the bulletin boards,'' said
Hooten, who lives in Australia and maintains the site along with
two associates living in Texas. ``As a result, we also have fans
from many other schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown would like for people who post information on the Web
sites to use their real names rather than nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be guidelines,'' Brown said. ``And when you
make the statement, we need to know who you are.''

 &HT;    Barnes becomes a man in full
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a cloudless Monday _ a ``righteous day,'' was how
Dr. Johnetta Cole described it _ Roy Barnes put his hand on the
Bible and became his own conception of a man in full.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ceremonial traffic-copter flyby to mark the
ascension of the state's first truly suburban governor. Barnes'
inaugural message rang with a rhetoric of racial harmony that is
becoming traditional for this occasion, but did not speak of road
rage or overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth noting that this former legislator, with his
good-ol'-boy drawl and lawyerly stoop, represents a demographic
point of departure from the row of former governors who watched him
take the oath of office Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is Georgian down to his middle name (Eugene), a
politician and businessman with ties to many parts of the state.
He's also the first Georgian elected governor whose career has been
shaped by the tidal wave of development that has shaped
Metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The area around his family's hardware store on Bankhead Highway
would be a great subject for one of those ``then-and-now'' photos
in the Monday Horizon section. His politics has been learned in a
shifting suburban world affected by white flight, northern
immigration and in recent years, increasing ethnic and racial
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when he was tagged as a suburban conservative and
finished third in the Democratic primary behind Zell Miller and
Andrew Young, it would have seemed farfetched that he would one day
be hailed by Cole, the past president of Spelman College, as
``Brother Governor Barnes'' and his wife Marie as ``First Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the politician and politics in general have adjusted over
the decade, a then-and-now work in progress. Just as the characters
in Tom Wolfe's novel must cross racial lines to make money, the
black and white Democrats who took statewide office Monday have
succeeded by discovering their mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything about the man himself, Barnes is the first
suburban governor because of what the suburbs expect of him. Any
governor would have to confront the complex environmental and
transportation problems which threatened to choke Metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But this governor was elected in part because of the expectation
that his background equipped him to tackle those problems, and
those expectations have been raised by the promise of an ambitious
transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the culmination of a career's effort when Barnes rose to
take the oath from his University of Georgia classmate, Chief
Justice Robert Benham, but the moment also marked a dangerous
political turn.
</P>
<P>
   As he has efficiently gone about the business of organizing his
administration, hiring experienced hands to help him manage things
and confidently plotting his legislative strategy, Barnes's
performance has mostly drawn comparison with what might have been
if Guy Millner were at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday onward, the comparison will be with the record of
the Miller administration, which raises the hurdle considerably.
But this son of Metro Atlanta has reached the place he wanted to
be, and on Monday he could bask in the glory of it.

a narrow hall, his fedora cocked to one side? That wisp of tobacco
smoke you smelled - is it just a late-returning guest or
``Scarface'' returning to one of his old haunts? The Clay, you see,

   BANKS-INN _ EVERGLADES CITY, Fla. _ You can feel safe On The
Banks of the Everglades. In fact, you can have breakfast in one.
Served to you inside what was the vault of the Bank of Everglades,
established in 1923 by the Barron Collier family. The bank saw
Collier County's first seat through the Roaring '20s, the
Depression '30s, the war years, the '50s and into the 1960s before
closing. Two years ago Patty Flick Richards and her father, Bob
Flick, began renovating the structure to create an ambience that
taps into the location's business past while shaping a surprisingly
homey atmosphere. Guests are called ``investors'' and can stay in
such rooms as Small Business Loans, The Checking Department, The
Board Room, The Mutual Funds Department or the Presidential Suite.

 &HT;    Those 'failing schools'?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't just a statistical conclusion. This is a rout.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time we're able to compare test scores between
students in Texas public schools and those in Texas charter
schools. The results are startling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm waiting today to hear from someone urging that children be
``rescued from these failing schools'' _ these charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth grade last spring, 57 percent of charter-school
students passed all portions of the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills. In public schools across Texas, 77 percent passed. In grade
7 it was 78 percent for public schools, 59 percent in charters. In
Grade 3, it was 75 percent to 63 percent. Only in fifth grade did
charters beat public schools in TAAS mastery, by 1 percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Most glaringly, of students taking the high school exit test,
only 34 percent of charter school students passed. Seventy percent
passed in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Help. Save the children. Break the glass on that ``burning
building'' analogy. Say something about ``competition making all
the difference.'' And don't forget deregulation. It works wonders.
See?
</P>
<P>
   Go easy on whom?
</P>
<P>
   Enough mock horror. Test scores from 16 of Texas' 19 independent
charter schools (results from three weren't available) shouldn't
necessarily be used to discredit them. First, they've have too
little time to make the difference they would wish. Second,
depending on the students who've shown up at their door, many with
serious academic problems, we risk making unfair comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   These are crucial points, particularly the latter. Free-market
reformers of education are stepping lively to caution that charter
schools not get a bum rap based on apples-to-tangerines
comparisons. Yessirs. Hear. Hear. We must reserve all of our bum
raps for those failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how quickly the free-market reformers pick up on
false comparisons. They should. They've been making them from Day 1
in their quest to convince us that public schools are rotten and
that vouchers are our redemption. They want to compare schools that
open their doors to every social variable we know with schools that
can sift.
</P>
<P>
   The real choice in this brand of ``school choice'' is that
exercised by private schools. So, they should knock the bejeebers
out of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, voucher proponents have almost no statistical means of
giving truth to their statements. Voucher programs in Cleveland and
Milwaukee have produced unconvincing results.
</P>
<P>
   In November a Harvard University study of New York students who
used scholarships to transfer into private and parochial schools
found very modest gains. Those students tested better than students
with comparable disadvantages and academic abilities, but only
barely: second-through fifth-graders 2 percent better in math and
reading, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   My question: Why aren't the achievement levels of students
choosing parochial temples blowing away those in public schools?
</P>
<P>
   Surely they should. Don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   They don't, and the main reason is this. The children in
question, when they transferred to the private school, had the same
parents they had when they were in that dismal, failing public
school.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents were the key delineators as to whether the
students did their best, or whether the best the schools could do
was enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't get the public schools off the hook. It's just the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   We can never be satisifed with our schools, not even with
statistics like the number of students passing the exit TAAS rising
from 52 percent to 70 percent in four years. That leaves 30
percent. What it means is that the power to improve is within the
public schools even with the demographics being against them.
</P>
<P>
   So pay attention next time you hear a free-market reformer shout
``fire.'' It may be his coattails aflame.

BURNS UPSET OVER ESPN REPORTER'S COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins coach Pat Burns was less than thrilled with the
way his club was portrayed on ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' last Thursday
night/Friday morning. The Bruins had beaten the Maple Leafs at the
FleetCenter, 2-1, on Thursday but Burns felt that anchor Linda
Cohn, who is an avid hockey fan, had dissed his squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says, `Well, what's wrong with the Leafs?' '' said Burns.
``I could've jumped through the screen and killed her. Not that we
played a good game and have injuries. It was, `What's wrong with
the Leafs?' That's insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn was incredulous at Burns's comments and said she was
focusing on the fact that Toronto was the highest-scoring team in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the coach, shouldn't he be more secure
about his team's accomplishments?'' said Cohn. ``I was just giving
viewers what I thought the story was, that a high-scoring team like
Toronto only got one goal against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one punch line you can have in the 15 seconds I'm
allowed to speak over a score panel. But hey, coach, I'm glad
you're watching.''

   Outdoor enthusiasts who relish the mountains may be more
vulnerable to skin cancer than sun- and sand-worshippers, according
to the findings of a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which runs in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Academy of Dermatology, showed that the higher the altitude, the
greater the intensity of the sun's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays.
Overexposure to UVB leads to sunburn and, over time, increases the
risk of skin cancer. (SUNBURN-ALTITUDE-MED)
</P>
<P>
   A food typically consumed by the health-conscious should be
considered a prime carrier of the food-contaminating bacterium
salmonella, government researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   From the field to the dinner table, alfalfa sprouts can supply a
breeding ground for salmonella bacteria and, therefore, put eaters
at risk for stomach-churning infections. The root of the problem,
according to researchers, is that the sprouting process contains no
``kill step'' to eliminate disease-causing bacteria.
(SALMONELLA-SPROUTS-MED)
</P>
<P>
   In news that will relieve some parents, a yearlong study has
found that a certain drug can reduce blood levels of harmful
cholesterol in children with an inherited condition, without
interfering with normal growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers caution that the effects of taking the drug over
the course of a lifetime remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors often prescribe drugs known as statins to adults
with high cholesterol, treatment decisions are more complicated in
the cases of children who have a hereditary condition that causes
them to have unusually high levels of LDL, or ``bad,'' cholesterol,
according to Dr. Evan A. Stein of the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis
Research Center in Cincinnati. (CHOLESTEROL-DRUG-MED)
</P>
<P>
   A federal advisory committee is expected to discuss the
effectiveness and safety of a new surgical technique for correcting
nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the device -- a ring designed to correct
nearsightedness (or myopia) by flattening the curvature of the
cornea _ would be the first non-laser surgical approach for
improving people's vision. (TREAT-VISION-MED)
</P>

   Dr. Eric Anderson answers health questions. This week:
</P>
<P>
   --My two teenagers attend middle and high school. Every day, I
have to help them to carry their 40- to 45-pound backpacks. Have
studies shown possible harm to adolescents from those heavy
backpacks? I understand even the Army has limits on what soldiers
carry in the field.
</P>
<P>
   --Over the summer I got one mosquito bite on the front of each
ankle, right on the tendon. Now, months later, I still have lumps
in these spots, and my ankles sometimes ache when I walk a lot.

HEARST NAMES DIRECTOR OF CROSS MEDIA BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eden Collinsworth has been named director of cross
media business development of The Hearst Corporation, a newly
created position.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment takes effect immediately, according to James M.
Asher, vice president and chief legal and development officer of
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Asher said Collinsworth would develop new business opportunities
``by building upon synergies among Hearst's operating properties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corporation is one of the nation's largest
diversified communications companies, with interests in magazine,
newspaper, book and business publishing; television and radio
stations; newspaper comics and features syndication; cable
television networks; television production and syndication; and new
media activities.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Collinsworth co-founded BUZZ, Inc. in 1990, serving
as president and CEO and launching the Los Angeles-based monthly
lifestyle magazine BUZZ. She also developed BUZZ TV, a one-hour,
prime-time magazine special, with the CBS-owned and -operated
station in Los Angeles. She launched BUZZ WEEKLY, an arts and
entertainment guide; established BUZZ ON-LINE, an expanded and
enhanced interactive version of the publication; and founded BUZZ
BOOKS, a St. Martin's Press imprint which in turn struck a
co-venture agreement with Fox Searchlight to produce books on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Collinsworth began her career in book publishing in 1975 at
Doubleday &AMP; Co.

SEXIST TITLES ARE NO COURTESY TO WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tucked away in the portentous swearing-in
ceremony of U.S. senators last week was a pointed little reminder
that those of us who call ourselves ``feminists'' can't even think
about retiring.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, each senator was called to say ``aye'' to rendering
impartial judgment and to sign a big impeachment trial book so the
vow would be official. In alphabetical order, ``Mr.'' after ``Mr.''
was summoned until the roll got to California's Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Boxer?'' came the query. Eight more ``Mrs.'' followed.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind for now that even though women make up at least 51
percent of the U.S. population, they hold but nine of 100 seats in
the country's premier governing body. The point today is that, here
in a sophisticated Western nation, a year shy of the 21st century,
we still identify women by their marital status.
</P>
<P>
   This is where I came in to this movie 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right, girls and boys, this is an old story. Long,
long ago, before VCRs, ATMs and DNA that solved criminal cases,
hundreds of thousands of women woke up at about the same time and
wondered: Why should the courtesy title before my name tell people
whether I am married or not? The male courtesy title, ``Mr.,''
reveals nothing of the sort. Why are females divided into married
``Mrs.'' and unmarried ``Miss''? Is this not a democracy where all
are created equal? Did not woman-as-chattel die out long ago?
</P>
<P>
   Although many people (mostly men) made fun of these questions
and cast aspersions on the XX-chromosome content of the women who
asked them, change was in the air. It took years (with lots of
aspersions being cast), but a marriage-neutral courtesy title for
women became a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, slowly, it began to appear on government documents and
job applications. Slowly, slowly, with the great gray New York
Times bringing up the rear, it made its way into the daily usage of
the nation's news media. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most newspapers and magazines use courtesy titles only in
obituaries. But the Times continues to use them along the lines
laid out in the Associated Press Stylebook. ``Ms.'' is used when a
woman has made it clear that she ``prefers Ms.'' If she hasn't
spoken up about it, she gets sorted and labeled by the old sexist
method, via marital status.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the AP makes the most concise argument for
jettisoning this very approach when it advises: ``MARITAL STATUS:
If a woman prefers Ms. or not title, do not include her marital
status in a story unless it is clearly pertinent.''
</P>
<P>
   If we'd just flip the rule, we'd ensure that a woman's marital
status would never get into a story unless it was clearly
pertinent. We'd relegate ``Mrs.'' and ``Miss'' to the
only-if-she-prefers-it shelf and make ``Ms.'' the nice, tidy,
non-discriminatory courtesy title of choice.
</P>
<P>
   That was the idea back in the olden days when ``Ms.'' was
created. It was supposed to make life easier (and fairer) for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   So much for revolution. Or even semi-noticeable evolution. No
big, governing authority _ a president or Congress, say _ or the
New York Times _ ever went the extra and logical step and
pronounced ``Ms.'' the preferred courtesy title for women. Thus we
limp along into the third millennium and still label only women by
marital status.
</P>
<P>
   During the swearing-in roll call, California's other senator was
summoned: ``Mrs. Feinstein?''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but if the whole point of ``Mrs.'' is to show that a
woman is the legal wife of some Mr. _ and if that isn't the point,
what is? _ Dianne Feinstein should have been called ``Mrs. Blum''
for her husband, Richard.

BRUSH UP ON VAN LOON'S SWEEPING SAGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cherished byline, as memorable as it is captivating, is that
of Hendrik Willem van Loon. And here's a tiding of great joy: His
classic 1921 entry, ``The Story of Mankind'' is newly republished,
brought up to date by John Merriman, whose concluding chapter
salutes ``A New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrik Willem van Loon. Perhaps most people assumed, as I once
did, that he was a foreigner, from the Netherlands or close by.
Sure enough, he was born in Holland (1882) but came to the United
States in his youth, graduated from Cornell, took American
citizenship, taught history in several Ivy League situations,
became editor of The Baltimore Sun, and in his last years was a
witty news commentator for NBC radio. He was also a frequent guest
on that medium's fabled ``Information Please'' quiz show.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a life it was; and I hold Hendrik Willem van Loon at least
partly responsible for giving me a reputation I often deplore.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes a know-it-all and I'm classified thusly, an
authentic parlor bore on the basis of an unusual gift for
retention. I'm often asked, ``How do you know that?'' or ``Where
did you find that out?'' My customary reply is that I read it
somewhere; but much of the factual information residing permanently
in my head was first absorbed in Van Loon's ``Story of Mankind'' _
which I discovered and read in 1944, the year of its author's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Mankind'' was a phenomenal bestseller in the '20s
and retained great visibility throughout the '30s, '40s and into
the '50s. It disappeared for a while because time had passed it by;
but it reappeared in 1972 and again in 1984, updated each time by
other hands. It vanished again; but now we're grateful to Merriman
for closing the gap with this third updating, although none of Van
Loon's later co-authors has been able to duplicate the engaging
personality of jolly Hendrik.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rather imposing title, yet the story of mankind is
precisely what this book is, in a kind of primer form. Will
Durant's phenomenal ``Story of Civilization'' eventually ran to 13
books _ six huge ones that fulfilled his original audacious design,
and several smaller ones touching on specific aspects of
civilization's progress. H.G. Wells crammed a lot of information
into the two hefty volumes of his ``Outline of History''; but Van
Loon shames every verbose historian by encapsulating the complete
life of our known world in 662 pages, articulate in an easy,
conversational style.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrik Willem van Loon is to Will Durant as Saki is to Charles
Dickens. The first nine chapter headings in ``The Story of
Mankind'' are: ``The Setting of the Stage,'' ``Our Earliest
Ancestors,'' ``Prehistoric Man,'' ``Hieroglyphics,'' ``The Nile
Valley,'' ``The Story of Egypt,'' ``Mesopotamia,'' ``The
Sumerians,'' and ``Moses'' (the story of the leader of the Jewish
people) _ and that takes us all the way to Page 42!
</P>
<P>
   Van Loon was a know-it-all above most others, and he liked to
draw, although certainly he was no artist. But from the first
edition onward, the text of ``The Story of Mankind'' has been
accompanied by the author's primitive drawings, as charming as they
are crude; and the new edition offers new drawings by Dirk van
Loon, the author's grandson.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Companion to American Literature cites ``A Short
History of Discovery'' (1918) as ``the first of the books that won
for Van Loon a reputation as a popularizer of encyclopedic
subjects.'' ``Ancient Man'' also preceded ``The Story of Mankind,''
and ``The Story of the Bible'' _ also a whopping bestseller _
followed it in 1923. There were several other artful entries of
this kind, plus more conventional works. Van Loon was the
biographer of both Peter Stuyvesant and Thomas Jefferson, and wrote
a biographical novel of Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   Van Loon and ``The Story of Mankind'' merit that coveted word
``inimitable.'' I would urge everyone, age 12 and up, to become
acquainted with both.

But when a cold he caught from his daughter kept him in bed, he
knew something was wrong. His feet and ankles began to swell, and
he couldn't get air. He spent an entire night bolt upright (since
he could no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing. Doctors
determined that Miguel was suffering from Chagas' disease, named
after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist to expose the secret life

HAVE FAITH: IT'S NOT THE FIRST MILLENNIAL CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ The new year is only a few days old but
already we've been saturated with scare stories about the year 2000
computer glitch, the so-called Y2K problem. If the millennial mania
keeps building like this for the rest of '99, the world really will
come to an end because we'll be crazed with fear and shooting at
anything that moves beyond our barricaded homesteads.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, folks, lighten up! The first lesson about history is that
those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it. If you'll put
down that 25-pound bag of rice and stop stacking firewood for a
minute, you might realize that we can get through this thing. At
the risk of pointing out the obvious, the human race has already
survived a millennial transition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of my colleagues in the news media, I've actually
done a bit of research on this topic. In a little-used library
packed with dusty medieval manuscripts, I unearthed the ultimate
guide to this mysterious change, the mother of all millennial
memos. Read on, ye timid time travelers:
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Re: Y1K crisis
</P>
<P>
   Greetings, commoners and kings alike, and may the blessings of
the Almighty be with you.
</P>
<P>
   As you know The Big Switch is coming up like a cloud of
pestilence rolling over the horizon, and many of you are concerned
about what will happen when years are recorded in four numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably because a lot of you can't count to four, but
even for those who can your fear is understandable. You think the
world is going to end before you have atoned for your sins _ and
before all those dazzling predictions by Merlin can be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me assure everyone in the civilized world from Rome to
London that you're about as silly as those village idiots who say
that people will fly someday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know the signs are worrisome. The Jousters League just
canceled its season for the first time in history in a dispute over
free agency and saddle subsidies. That romantic scandal with King
William and his comely servant Maid Monica threatens the throne
like never before. And saints preserve us, but the counters insist
their abacus beads will become jammed and the scribes swear we'll
run out of ink from writing all those extra numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzooks! Calm down, grab the goat and squeeze yourself a cup of
warm milk. I've never trusted those guys with pocket protectors on
their robes and I don't think you should either. With God's grace,
civilization has made so much progress in recent centuries that we
can slide into the new millennium like a tadpole wriggling across
the scummy surface of a stagnant pond. Just to recap a few
highlights: This new-fangled device called the candle has greatly
enhanced our ability to interface with manuscript data after the
western edge of the world has swallowed the sun.
</P>
<P>
   A man on horseback can now zip along from Paris to Berlin in
just two weeks _ a pace unheard of in primitive days.
</P>
<P>
   Our top scientists have just made a major discovery _ rotten
food will make you sick _ that could extend our life span all the
way to 30 or _ dare I say it? _ 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Why, there are even some exciting inventions on the drawing
table _ forks, belts, soap _ that could revolutionize our
lifestyles!
</P>
<P>
   So buck up and quit blathering about elves and fairies and the
end of the world. Just stay in shape by eating three healthy bowls
of gruel a day and use a little common sense _ never draw well
water on the night of a full moon, always smash a spider with your
left hand, keep your bodily humors in balance by swallowing a
handful of dirt every now and then, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, we got through the year 666 _ and all that it implies
_ and I really think the coming change in calendars will be a piece
of sweet bread. If we don't panic and act like a bunch of savages
by burning witches and slaying dragons, we'll set a fine example
for people facing this crisis in the next millennial transition _
if there are any left, which I seriously doubt.
</P>
<P>
   (And tell your kids to stop wasting all their time by staring at
the fire instead of doing something productive. Back in my day, all
we had for entertainment was the occasional meteor shower _ and we
were grateful for it.)
</P>
<P>
   Your faithful servant
</P>
<P>
   Pope Sylvester II
</P>
<P>
   P.S. One more thing: Could somebody out there please invent
shoes? My feet are killing me.

US CLEARS IRAN IN DRUG REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US officials who gathered last fall to review
classified satellite photos of Iran's drug production found a
surprise: nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No poppy plants. No laboratories. No stashes of chemicals for
converting the plants into heroin.
</P>
<P>
   After discussions that they described as ``agonizing,'' the
officials decided to take Iran off a list of major drug trafficking
countries. Next month, when President Clinton sends Congress
recommendations about which countries to penalize, Iran will not be
blacklisted for drug trafficking for the first time since the
annual reviews began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has infuriated Iranian exiles, who say the
administration is subverting drug policy in a desperate attempt to
give credibility to a new regime in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another step that the United States is taking to give
some kind of green light to the so-called moderates in Iran,'' said
Hedayat Mostowfi, a member of the foreign policy team of the
National Council of Resistance of Iran, a leading exile group based
in Paris. ``This is appeasement. . . . What has the Iranian regime
done in the last year? Absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Exile groups are still smarting from comments Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright made in a speech June 18, when she praised
Iran's president, President Mohammad Khatami, a man who ``deserves
respect because he is the choice of the Iranian people.'' Albright,
who had been an outspoken critic of Iran, invited the country to
join the United States in creating ``a road map leading to normal
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has described Iran as a pariah
nation that supports terrorism and egregiously violates human
rights. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since
the hostage crisis that began in November 1979. Albright's aides
maintain that Khatami is a moderate clashing with clerics who
resent modernization and outside influences.
</P>
<P>
   But those clerics have apparently cracked down on drug
production and the shipment of heroin from neighboring Afghanistan
and Pakistan through Iran. While Washington does not agree with the
means by which the clerics have made progress, which include
executions, it likes the results.
</P>
<P>
   In his report to Congress last year, as he had for several
years, Clinton relied on intelligence that found Iran had
cultivated about 8,750 acres of poppies, producing up to 70 tons of
heroin each year. This year's assessment, by contrast, says simply,
``A US government review found no evidence of any significant
amount of any poppy cultivation in the traditional growing areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The US determination echoes reports by the UN International Drug
Control Program, which has praised Iran's antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials familiar with the annual drug review
say that their decision to take Iran off the list was not
influenced by American desires to thaw relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this political hangup with Iran,'' noted Guive
Mirfendereski, an adjunct professor of law at Brandeis University.
``We're afraid if we take it off the list that going to be a signal
to people that we're going to start making a political overture to
Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is supposed to submit a list of major drug producers and
shippers to Congress by Nov. 1 every year. Officials said last
year's discussions about Iran took place in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of agonizing at the time because even though
the objective evidence showed that Iran is not growing poppies, it
would be seen as evidence by the Iranians'' or the Congress ``as
giving the Iranians a carrot,'' said one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who says there's politics in it is seeing things that
aren't there,'' added another. ``It gave us no pleasure to take
Iran off the list, and it gave us no pain. We were following the
law. We had satellite imagery showing the crop had been
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the list of 28 ``majors,'' as the drug producing countries
are called, belatedly went to Congress on Dec. 4, Iran was not on
it. As a result, its antidrug efforts will not even be evaluated
for certification this year. Countries that are certified to be
fighting drugs in good faith avoid US trade sanctions. Iran's new
status is largely symbolic, though, because it remains under US
sanctions for its alleged state-sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who follow the region are bracing for
angry reactions from Congress, where conservatives are suspicious
of any change that seems to be soft on Iran. Already,
Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey Republican, has said he has
doubts about about Iran's antidrug programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's government admits that there are 1 million drug users
within its borders. At the National Council of Resistance, Mostowfi
said the government consistently plays down the country's drug
problem. He said there are 4 million addicts in a country of 60
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran has reacted with little enthusiasm to the Clinton
administration's decision, which state-run Radio Tehran said ``will
not remove anything or add anything to the reality of Iran's
campaign against international drug smuggling.''

PRICE OF SENATE DISTRACTION MAY BE NIL, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In January 1859, they held a ceremony to bid
farewell to the Old Senate Chamber. In January 1881, they watched
the installation of the first Senate telephone service. Last year,
they devoted a day to changing the name of the local airport.
</P>
<P>
   And those were the productive days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing number of complaints from senators that the
impeachment trial of President Clinton is thwarting their efforts
to do ``the people's business,'' there is a fundamental axiom that
suggests the nation may not yet be suffering from any distraction _
namely, that little truly happens in the Senate in the first months
of the session.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, scattered meetings and orientations. The
agenda for both parties is hammered out, and some senators even
remain in Washington to begin laying groundwork for legislation _
groundwork that does indeed appear to be suffering from neglect
amid the preparations for a presidential trial, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But real paralysis, Senate aides say, may be farther down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nothing gets done until the president's State of the
Union address,'' said Richard A. Baker, who has been the Senate
historian for 24 years. ``Even something as fundamental as seat
assignments in the chamber usually doesn't get worked out entirely
until March. It's all part of a general coming together and sifting
out that takes place the first couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   If there had been no impeachment, the beginning of the 106th
Congress might have looked to the public like a quiet recess,
except for a few flashes of agenda-pushing and ribbon-cutting.
Behind the scenes, staffers would have been crafting strategies for
each party's legislation, waiting for the traditional signal bell:
the State of the Union scheduled for Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   After being sworn in last  &UR; week &LR; , many senators would have left
town. ``I was going to climb Mount Washington with my son,'' said
Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican of New Hampshire. ``I had to
cancel that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also forced to cancel an orientation retreat at
the Library of Congress last  &UR; week &LR; . But Republican leaders are
managing to craft an agenda nonetheless, focusing on broad themes
of ``security, responsibility, freedom and opportunity,'' with
specific goals ranging from pension reform to an antidrug
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, are mapping out an agenda, making priorities of
Social Security, managed health care, and an increase in the
minimum wage. And Democratic senators met with Clinton to discuss
his priorities as well, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still holding meetings,'' Norman Ornstein, a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute, said of both parties. But, he
added, noting the amount of staff support impeachment has required:
``Often times there's a significant amount of informal stuff that
is done, and that's where this becomes significant.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 106th Congress's real peril may not be delay but
disenchantment. If the impeachment trial brings months of acrimony,
subsequent battles over budget allocations, health care, and taxes
could be unusually divisive, potentially crippling senators just as
they need to prove their effectiveness to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The question, according to Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat
from Minnesota, becomes ``whether we come out of this with civility
or a poisonous climate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in the Senate, is more important than in the House,''
Wellstone said Monday. ``If this drags on and on, and clearly
you've got party divisions, I think that will make it much harder
for us to work than anything else. That's even more important than
the time we've lost.''

CANADA REACHES SOUTH FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For Alec Tallman of Lunenburg, Mass., it was a tossup
with Vassar College, and Vassar lost. For Ian Madeiros of
Pittsfield, Maine, the big lure was the caterwaul of bagpipes and
ratta-tat-tat of the Scottish side drum. For Meghan Brown of
Pembroke, Mass., it was the chance for a high-quality education at
a palatable price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost wasn't the big factor. The academic program was, by
far,'' said Brown, 23, who graduated from Nova Scotia's Dalhousie
University last year with a bachelor's in marine biology, and is
working on a master's degree. ``But the cost of studying in Canada
is certainly an important side bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   As tuition rates continue to climb in the United States,
increasing numbers of American students are heading north to attend
Canadian universities, seeking higher education from schools with
standards equivalent to those in the United States but with
less-punishing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada's institutions are for the first time
aggressively courting US high schoolers and other college-bound
Americans, with some success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our undergraduate applications from the US are up by 27
percent in the past year,'' said Anne Roussell, executive director
of recruitment and liaison at Montreal's McGill University, one of
Canada's most prestigious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's partly the result of our increased recruiting effort in
about 20 US states, with heavy focus on New England,'' she said.
``But it also reflects that we offer high academic standards,
degrees that are internationally recognized, and a university
system similar to the American system. Plus, a price cheaper than
offered in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   History's first intercollegiate football game pitted McGill
against Harvard in 1874. Although the two schools no longer tussle
over the pigskin, Quebec's preeminent English-language university
enjoys an academic ranking in a league with some of the best US
private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to costs, McGill and other top-flight Canadian
schools are in another league altogether. And for American
students, that difference is becoming an important attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition, room, and board for an American undergraduate student
at McGill, whose 178-year-old campus is in the heart of one of
North America's most cosmopolitan cities, runs about $10,000 a year
in US dollars. That's twice as much as a Canadian pays, but still a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A year at Dartmouth College, by comparison, costs roughly
$29,500, while a year of undergraduate study at New York's Vassar,
including room and board, runs to $28,000. Tuition alone at the
average private university in the United States is $14,508.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman, who graduated last year from Phillips Exeter Academy,
nearly chose Vassar, and also considered Cornell University, before
finally deciding on McGill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really close, and I weighed it hard,'' said the
18-year-old first-year student. ``But in the end, McGill just
seemed to offer a little bit more of what I wanted in terms of
academics and social atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Canadian schools is inexpensive by American standards
because all universities are public institutions, with most costs
for education borne by taxpayers, not student fees or alumni gifts.
The best tuition bargains are for undergraduates since many
Canadian graduate programs _ especially in business, engineering,
and medicine _ charge fees close to those of American graduate
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs associated with higher education _ from books to
housing to a night out at the pub _ are these days a better deal
for Americans, as the value of the Canadian dollar has dropped to
historic lows against US currency.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with American students studying at institutions from
Nova Scotia to British Columbia show that their reasons for
choosing Canada vary hugely.
</P>
<P>
   Madeiros, 19, was drawn to Dalhousie because it boasts one of
North America's best bagpipe bands. ``Canada, with its strong Scots
traditions, is really the place to play with some world-class pipe
bands while working for that diploma,'' said Madeiros, who plays
side drum. ``My family loved the cheaper tuition. I loved the pipe
bands. So here I am in Nova Scotia.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dalhousie, tuition for an American undergraduate is roughly
$4,600 a year, with room and board running to about $3,600. Out of
a student body of 12,763, only 98 are from the United States, but
that still represents a 20 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern is emerging across Canada. About 3,000
Americans are studying at Canadian universities, a 10 percent
increase from the 1997-98 academic year. Despite the extraordinary
economic, cultural, and blood ties between the two countries, it is
only in the past few years that the United States has supplanted
Hong Kong and France as the country of origin for the largest
number of foreign students in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the numbers of Americans studying here remain small
compared with the 23,000 Canadians attending colleges and
universities in the United States. The lopsided flow of students
south is part of an overall ``brain drain'' that Canada is
increasingly anxious to redress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old reality that Canadians know America more than
Americans know Canada, and that makes it difficult for Canadian
schools to attract the best and brightest students from the
states,'' said Robert J. Giroux, president of the Ottawa-based
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. ``But there is
a new emphasis on recruiting American students.''
</P>
<P>
   The big selling points of Canadian schools, he said, are high
academic standards, a safe campus environment in a nation with a
much lower crime rate than the United States, and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for some American students, there is the attraction of
attending school in a foreign country _ without venturing too far
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted the experience of living in another culture,''
said Shane Lacharite, 22, of Shelburne, Vt., who graduated last
year from Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Quebec, and who has
studied in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly the draw was my French-Canadian roots. I wanted some
sense of the culture where my ancestors came from,'' he said. ``A
lot of Americans dismiss Canada as just a snowbound, boring version
of the US. But it's foreign enough to feel different, and I found
it more exciting than just going to another state.''
</P>
<P>
   American guidance counselors nonetheless raise a few red flags
about Canada. Classes tend to be larger than in the United States,
and the ratio of faculty to students is often lower, which they say
can result in a less personalized education.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most serious is the name-recognition problem. Some
American employers, counselors warn, will be unfamiliar with
Canadian universities, even those schools rated by commonly used
American college guides.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears to be a non-issue for major US companies, such
as Goldman Sachs or Microsoft, which actively recruit on Canadian
campuses. And employers in New England tend to be familiar at least
with those schools in the neighboring provinces of Quebec, New
Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers mostly seemed interested by the fact I had
international exposure,'' said Lacharite, who found a job in the
Vermont-based financial division of a multinational corporation.
``If anything, it seemed a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   One big impediment to study in Canada, especially for
cash-strapped students, is that Americans will find it virtually
impossible to secure part-time jobs because of tough Canadian work
permit laws. Quebec is especially intransigent, while the Maritime
Provinces suffer from such high levels of unemployment that there
are few jobs to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Government budget cuts in Canada have put an end to some student
subsidies, squeezing most of the nation's 89 universities and
forcing them to look south for new students as never before.
</P>
<P>
   McGill has teamed with two other top Canadian schools, Queen's
University and the University of Toronto, both in Ontario, to make
marketing tours at US high schools and college fairs in major US
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Others are trying a more direct approach. Ontario's University
of Guelph recently started recruiting American high schoolers with
mass mailings of a brochure showing a snow-caked college student:
``So you think you know Canada, eh? Well . . . think again.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Windsor, in Ontario adjacent to Detroit, has
taken out advertisments in Michigan newspapers: ``You can study
here and be home for supper.'' The school also just slashed tuition
rates for Americans in half, to $3,500 a year, making its costs
competitive with the average ``in-state'' tuition for US public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed ridiculous that at a university minutes away from
this huge US city, we had fewer than a dozen American students,'
said John Carrington, spokesman for the University of Windsor,
which hopes to eventually enroll 300 Americans. ``It benefits both
our societies to have a two-way flow of young minds.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The air outside is a brisk 26 degrees when Douglas Atamian comes
in from the cold to grab a bit of summer at TanningEtc. in Kenmore
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old businessman drops his briefcase, sheds his
shirt, and basks in the ultraviolet light of the Turbo facial
tanner. This is his first season of indoor tanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first few sessions, my wife said, `You look darker.
I thought you went to a tanning salon, but you wouldn't do that.' I
said, `I'm almost 40. I'm doing a lot of things.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to slow down and take more time for myself. Working
out is a huge part of it. Tanning is a small part,'' he says. ``You
tan. You look at yourself in the mirror and you look good. My
muscles look good. I can't tell you how many people in the last few
months said, `You look good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A New England winter may be linked with pallor, but not everyone
who looks a little tawny for the weather has been somewhere with
outdoor heat. An estimated 28 million Americans sunbathe indoors at
least once a year, according to the industry's International Smart
Tan Network, up from 22 million in 1990. That is all to the chagrin
of the American Academy of Dermatology, which warns of increased
risk of skin cancer and wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   But to people who take their sun via light bulb, the allure of a
sheen of color and the look of leisure prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary from place to place. A tanner can pay, say, $4 to
stand up in a booth with conventional tanning bulbs for a few
minutes or $35 to lie in a bed with high-powered bulbs that deliver
more rays in less time, or go for packages that offer discounts for
frequent users.
</P>
<P>
   TanningEtc. is a 10-bed basement salon, with eight conventional
and two high-powered beds, plus a high-powered facial tanner, all
in private rooms with fans and headphones along with the heat and
the light. Eyes closed under protective goggles (or patches, to
avoid ``raccoon eyes''), patrons might imagine a windy day at the
beach sans sand. Or they might perfect what a 26-year-old graduate
student who gives his name only as Michelangelo calls the ``science
of tanning.'' He lifts his arms and rotates his body to ensure he's
not tan front and back and striped white down the sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to music,'' says Atamian. ``I like to relax.
It's part of my day. I come here. You feel the tremendous joy of
warmth and meditation. It takes you away from the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The way dermatologist Robert Stern of the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center sees it, occasional use of a well-maintained tanning
salon by adults is relatively safe. But he's seen patients with
fungal infections, body lice, and head lice picked up at unsanitary
salons. The risk of skin cancer, he says, varies with age, skin
type, and amount of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a middle-aged person who tans well and uses a
tanning salon occasionally, I think the health risks are very
low,'' he says. ``If you're a young person and don't tan easily
there's a reasonable risk. Do I think 10 tanning treatments a year
are harmful? No. For a 15-year-old who freckles easily and does it
50 times a year for some years, is that associated with some risk?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Cripe, a 31-year-old aerobics instructor, has tanned on
and off for eight years. Every week or two she catnaps under the
glow of ultraviolet light, enough to maintain some color without
looking as if she's just back from the Caribbean or spends too much
time in places like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to look fake,'' she says. ``In the dead of winter
it's nice to have a little bit of color. You look thinner. It keeps
my face from breaking out. I'm not interested in keeping my summer
tan. I'm interested in keeping a little tan so I don't have to wear
as much makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My nationality is Lebanese,'' says 19-year-old Rachel
Loulache, a former customer who now works part time at the salon.
``We're supposed to be dark, and I'm very white. It just matches my
hair color when I have a nice base.''
</P>
<P>
   The high season of indoor tanning, according to Smart Tan, comes
between February and May, and that's the case at TanningEtc. In
another month, says owner Brian Lentine, every bed will be booked
in advance for the peak evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   As for vital stats, Smart Tan reports 60 percent of indoor
tanners are female and half are women between the ages of 20 and
40. A little more than a fifth are men between 20 and 40. The
typical tanner sunbathes au artificial 25 to 30 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lentine's been in business for 15 years, which makes him an
old-timer in an industry that only dates back to the early 1980s in
this country. Tacked on the wall beside the box that automatically
times the lights on beds in use is a Caribbean Gold calendar with a
bare-chested man who has a great body and a great tan. Two
California Tan posters feature the bare backs of women with great
bodies and great tans advertising ``heliotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The moisturizing lotions on sale at the desk have names (and
price tags) like Climax ($50) and Hot Chocolate ($30) and Tropical
Sizzle ($27) and Rage ($15). Some come with ``self-bronzers,''
which promise to cosmetically enhance what's gained electrically,
enhancing what nature isn't offering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lentine's customers want to start a tan before soaking
up real rays someplace hot. They're people like 31-year-old Annette
Giuliana, who came at the beginning of the summer and is back for
three sessions before leaving for St. Thomas. ``I'm scared about
doing this,'' she says, ``but I feel like I'd do more harm if I
fried myself on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   There are regulars who come twice a week year-round and
irregulars who come for a few months, then disappear for months,
then return. There are people who can't seem to get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are obviously abusing it and overdoing it, we tell
them our opinion. We don't prevent them from doing it,'' Lentine
says. ``I think some people have a condition. Tanorexia. They think
they don't have a tan and they're really dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Josee Perez is no tanorexic. He knows he's tan. He points to his
face. ``It makes me look good, gives me a smile,'' he says. He's
tanned indoors since 1985 and comes daily or every other day, and
if he gets skin cancer, well, he recites the saying ``If you play,
youpay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, yes, I am vain,'' he says. ``But look at me.'' He
again brings fingers to face. ``Great skin. Do I look 35? Once I
get a wrinkle, forget it. Or I go to New York to get silicone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gino Taluchi, a 24-year-old used-car salesman, is so bronzed he
looks like he just came back from an island vacation. Sure, the
staff has cautioned him against tanning too much, but, he shrugs,
there's no law against it. Skin cancer? Another shrug. He's young.
``I went tanning for half an hour and I didn't use lotion and the
next day I went skiing and my face was cracked,'' he says. ``I was
too wired about life to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The thermometer has dropped another degree or two by the time
20-year-old Bo Wetzel, a student who lives in the Fenway, comes in
for a 12-minute facial blast. ``If I feel down, it lifts me right
up,'' Wetzel says. ``If I don't feel the sun, if it's cloudy, I
need to feel the light and the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to winter and, before long, onto the ski slopes,
where he will use sunscreen, SPF 15, which Taluchi cannot
understand. ``He wears sunscreen when he skis? I never heard of
that.''

FEUER IN LINE FOR A NET GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Feuer could be playing one of the most important games of
his career Wednesday. Feuer has joined an obscure English club,
Rushden and Diamonds, but if all goes well in an FA Cup match
against Leeds United, he could be on the way to England's Premier
League, where the average salary is $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, 27, earned approximately $100,000 with the Revolution
last year, starting 26 games in goal. When Walter Zenga decided to
become player-coach next season, though, Feuer was relegated to
backup status. So he took a chance with Rushden and Diamonds in the
Vauxhall Conference, the equivalent of the fifth division. The
team's starter had been injured, and Feuer was contacted by his
former Luton Town goalkeeper coach, Terry Westley, now an assistant
with the Diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three games, Feuer recorded shutouts, including a
0-0 tie against Leeds United in the first leg of their FA Cup
matchup. A victory over Leeds at Elland Road Wednesday would be a
huge upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams will be watching,'' Feuer said Monday. ``They
want to have another good look at me. A lot of teams need a
goalkeeper, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I can't name names,
but there are a good eight clubs with very big interest. The game
is sold out and it's going to be tough. Leeds is in the top five in
the Premier and we should get walloped, 4-0, but you never know. We
should actually have won the first game, and it would have been
nice to have finished it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer's monthlong loan agreement ends next week, and the
Revolution had expected him to return for the start of preseason
training Jan. 26. But he seems intent on remaining in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Zenga being player-coach, I would have moved to another
team, anyway,'' Feuer said. ``I don't think I would enjoy being a
backup. No disrespect, but I want to be playing at this point in my
career. If I was 22, it would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional and I understand Zenga brings a crowd in
and he did well at the club previously. I loved my time in New
England, but it's a shame no one got to see what I was capable of.
It was all the circumstances of the season. The team didn't jell,
for whatever reason. There are no sour grapes about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange season, with the racial things, Thomas Rongen
being sacked. We started the season like a house on fire, then
dipped a bit. As a goalkeeper, it was difficult because I had a
different back four in front of me every day. It was difficult for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, who closed the Revolution season with four shutouts in
five games, hoped to return to the national-team pool. But the
Revolution struggled and the defense never seemed organized until
Zenga replaced Rongen as coach in late August. By then, the
Revolution had been eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Thomas Rongen supporter, I liked him and his methods,
but it just didn't happen for him there,'' Feuer said. ``Coaching
is cutthroat. You can be the best coach in the world but if the
team is not playing well, you get sacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, unlike many US-born players, is more content in Europe.
He joined a club in Belgium at 16 and has lived in Europe except
for brief returns to the Los Angeles Salsa in 1991 and the
Revolution. Feuer's identity has been formed in Europe, he met his
wife in Belgium, and he began raising a family in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not leaving because the MLS isn't good enough,'' Feuer
said. ``I enjoyed the league and it's going to go places. But I
felt, familywise, I should be in England at this moment. I might
change my mind in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange, but I'm more known here than in the States. I
feel kind of like a foreigner in America. If you asked me who won
the Super Bowl three years ago, I wouldn't know.''

<P>
   Baba gets the call
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imad Baba became the seventh member of the Revolution to be
called into US national team training camp, in preparation for the
Jan. 24 visit to Bolivia. Baba will be with the team in Orlando,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Practice games are set against China's Olympic team and Glasgow
Rangers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Baba played for coach Bruce Arena on the 1996 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore is the only other Revolution player with the
national team. Previously, Mike Burns, Ted Chronopoulos, Brian
Dunseth, Alexi Lalas (now with the MetroStars), and Johnny Torres
had been called. Current roster players Dan Calichman and Feuer
also played for the national team before joining the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Baba, 24, has scored 14 goals in 70 games for the Revolution.

PUERTO RICO: CHARM, BEAUTY _ AND IGUANAS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The iguana is the symbol of the Rio Mar Country Club in Puerto
Rico. And it's no wonder: The gentle, green, goggle-eyed creatures
are a common sight at the club's two noteworthy golf courses. Why,
on the fourth hole of the Ocean Course alone, you might spot a
dozen or more of the lounging lizards, who, with their long tails,
can reach five feet in length.
</P>
<P>
   But the courses have more than iguanas (some might say ``Thank
goodness.''). The new River Course, designed by Greg Norman, is a
7,000-yard, par 72 layout, with the Mameyes River running through
it, and the El Yunque Mountains as a backdrop. The Ocean Course, by
Tom and George Fazio, is a 6,800-yard, par 72 course with bunkers
and water hazards and its signature 240-yard 16th hole, by the
beach. In addition, there is a clubhouse with a restaurant, a golf
shop, a spa, and locker rooms with saunas, whirlpools, and steam
baths. (There's a Massachusetts connection, too: The courses are
managed by an affiliate of Willowbend Development Corp. of
Mashpee.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Westin Rio Mar Beach resort has more than the golf
courses. The 481-acre resort in Palmer, Puerto Rico, rests on a
palm-lined beach. And though it is just 19 miles from San Juan's
international airport, it is surrounded by nature, making it a
tropical world unto itself. In addition to 600 luxe rooms, there
are 11 themed restaurants (the variety of cuisines even include
Maine lobster), lounges, and entertainment venues; a casino; a
13-court tennis complex; a spa and fitness center; shops and
boutiques; and water sports at its long beach. The resort also has
a children's activity center called _ what else? _ Club Iguana.
</P>
<P>
   And Puerto Rico has more than the beach resort. The ``new'' San
Juan moves to a salsa beat with its glittering hotels, sparkling
beaches, and lively night life. But Old San Juan, which calls
itself the oldest city under the US flag, has colonial fortresses,
elaborate churches, colorful and historic homes (including Ponce de
Leon's summer place), shopping, and dining. The island
commonwealth's natural attractions include the El Yunque Rain
Forest, well named because of 150 to 200 feet of rainfall each
year, and Rio Camuy Cave Park, where the caves have rivers running
through them. Fans of tropical drinks may want to try the Parrot
Club in Old San Juan, where the specialty is a Parrot Passion, made
with rum, triple sec, fresh orange juice, and tropical juices. A
few too many of those and you'll be seeing parrots _ and probably
iguanas _ everywhere!

CALIFORNIA FACES A HARVEST OF UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINDSAY, Calif. _ To anyone who grew up watching his parents and
grandparents pick oranges or pack them, or who just lived amid the
endless citrus groves of the San Joaquin Valley, the chain of
events was clear.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature dropped low and held low, and within a week,
Larry Larson, a packing house sales manager, decided to let his
gardener go. The gardener, recognizing hard times, insisted on
staying on without pay for now.
</P>
<P>
   Waking to another morning of frost, Ruben Gonzalez prepared
himself for fewer customers at his family's 55-year-old restaurant,
one of Lindsay's most popular. At the same time, Arturo Alafa began
bracing for an overflow of hungry at the social service agency he
runs, and soon enough, laid-off field hands were lining up outside
for bags of rice and beans and baby food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't even hit us hard yet, but it will,'' said Ray
Estrada, who works at a downtown hardware store. ``Give it a month
or so, and people will stop coming in. It's going to be a long
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Lindsay revolves around the orange. It pays the picker's
rent and the merchant's mortgage. The crop helps keep the city
coffers full. Even with the new jobs created by companies recruited
after a far more devastating freeze in 1990, virtually everyone in
town expects to feel the leftover chill.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the 3,600 or so residents who work depend directly
on citrus for their paychecks, and the other half depend on much of
that money being spent locally on food and gas, car parts, and
clothing. A freeze, even a brief one, can crush the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Tulare County Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft put it,
``Emotionally it's a big drain on the growers. Financially it's a
drain on just about everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated $200 million or more in crops lost countywide
_ including almost the entire lemon crop _ agricultural economists
have estimated the trickle down impact at about $1 billion.
California declared a state of emergency, waiving the one-week wait
for unemployment benefits in six counties. Growers who normally
harvest thick-skinned oranges for eating are debating whether to
grab what they can and send it to be juiced.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was as hard hit as anywhere, although the full effect of
the freeze won't be known for some months or until the weather
warms and the damage starts showing on the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've picked stuff that looked really clean and stuff that was
a mess,'' said Joseph LoBue, marketing director at LoBue Bros., a
packing house that is Lindsay's largest employer. ``The middle is
the big question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   While orange prices in the grocery stores double and triple, the
8,900 people who live in Lindsay can only wait. Unemployment was
already 10 percent before the pre-Christmas cold snap, the lowest
in Tulare County but still too high for city officials. No one
knows how high it will go now.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,800 people identified as working in the city's 10 packing
houses does not even include the hundreds and hundreds of people
who pick the valencia and navel oranges identified with the region.
Oranges, lemons, and olives provide almost year-round work, and the
mostly Mexican workers here are not migratory at all: They live in
and around Lindsay. Now, with some 75 percent of the citrus crop
wiped out, many of them have been idled indefinitely. LoBue Bros.
put about 400 of its 500 employees on what Joseph LoBue called
``will call'' _ not exactly a layoff but not a job either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid I won't be able to eat,'' said Maria Pena, 20, who
earned $150 to $200 for a six-day work week in the groves before
she was sent home on Dec. 23. ``But I am more afraid I won't be
able to care for my daughter now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Marie Seaman, 39, a Lindsay native and mother of four who
counted boxes of oranges for a local packing house for $6.55 an
hour and whose husband has so far held onto his job as an assistant
supervisor there, ``We don't know how we're going to make it. I
just don't want to end up on welfare like I know I'm going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with three dozen or more laid-off pickers and packers,
Pena and Seaman were at the Lindsay-Strathmore Coordinating Council
to sign up for unemployment benefits and rental assistance and to
receive a free bag of groceries. On Monday of last week, the first
day the services were available, the agency aided 126 people. More
showed up on Tuesday, and the council briefly ran out of food until
700 pounds of beans arrived. Soon executive director Arturo Alafa
was on the telephone to suppliers, ordering 15 cases of tuna, 20
cases of macaroni and cheese, and crates of powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hurting right now,'' Alafa told one supplier. ``I need
to make a big purchase. Can you do one-day turnaround time?''
Afterward, he added that the council typically provides $20,000 a
year in rental assistance to about 85 families; the freeze should
easily triple that in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, said he was planning to pack up and leave
Lindsay, as Shann Blue, director of grower services at the trade
group California Citrus Mutual in nearby Exeter, said some of his
friends did after the 1990 freeze that killed the entire crop and
some trees along with it. Lindsay, for all its cold-induced
troubles, is far better prepared to deal with the aftermath now
than it was then.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, Lindsay was almost 100 percent
citrus-reliant. The previous freeze, coupled with the closings of
two major employers, almost ruined the town. Nearly 60 percent of
its residents were out of work. The situation was so dire that
Lindsay actually buried the past; during a mock funeral, locals
filled a coffin with spoiled fruit off the trees and mementos of
their lost manufacturing jobs and buried it in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Then city officials, church leaders and regular residents got to
work. ``We said no more doom and gloom; we're going to rebuild
right,'' said Carolyn Callison, executive director of the Lindsay
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps was to centralize services for its
victims. Now people know to go to Alafa's office. Growers also
began investing in frost insurance for the first time, and today
many are covered for at least some of their losses. For its part,
Lindsay began recruiting businesses, hoping diversity would be a
buffer against the inevitable cold. Hundreds of jobs unrelated to
citrus were created.
</P>
<P>
   They came to Lindsay in large part because the city successfully
vied to become one of two California communities designated a rural
enterprise zone _ entitling new employers and expanding existing
companies to state tax brakes, interest-free loans and other
cost-cutting benefits. One new company, Console Foods, is expected
to surpass LoBue as Lindsay's largest employer within several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One positive result of the 1990 freeze was that people came
together,'' said Scot Townsend, the city's community development
director. ``When you suffer one blow after another, you have to
learn to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the freeze, Lindsay has other problems to solve. The city
has been held responsible for millions of dollars in liability for
sewage and past waste-water problems. With the cold expected to cut
deep into Lindsay's sales tax revenue _ and property tax hikes out
of the question _ Mayor Valeriano Saucedo said he doesn't know
where Lindsay will get the money to pay the judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything we could in the last eight years, but
there's still a lot of pressure on us,'' said Saucedo, a lawyer
whose parents picked oranges and who worked the groves himself
until his sophomore year in college. ``Our future is uncertain. But
we will find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lindsay Fruit Association, that means weathering a lousy
season that also happens to be the company's first. Today the
packing house is running a skeleton crew of eight, down from 45.
General manager Jim Williams plans to take his house off the
market, since a sale at a decent price is unlikely now. ``You
definitely cut back on things you had planned to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams, Craig Holworthy has been around oranges long
enough to expect a freeze at least once a decade. He bought
insurance after the last one hit, but some of the money to plant
next year's crop could come out of his own pocket. That's money he
won't be able to spend in Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, everybody will tighten their belt a bit,'' said
Holworthy. ``I guess that's the way it is in a town like Lindsay.''

WHISTLE-BLOWERS QUESTION BROWN SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the waning days of 1998, Brown University agreed to
return $300,170 it had collected from the state of Massachusetts
for psychiatric research that state officials say Brown never
performed.
</P>
<P>
   The civil settlement, reached after a three-year criminal
investigation by the attorney general's office, gratifies Donna
Howard and other former Brown employees who blew the whistle on the
funding irregularities more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard finds it ironic that almost all the key players who
approved the contracts are still in place, their jobs intact, while
the people who exposed the abuses all have left the university or
lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the Commonwealth stuck in there against Brown's
formidable efforts to deny and cover the matter up,'' Howard, who
now is assistant director of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill in
Rhode Island, said in an interview last week. ``But all the major
players are still at Brown and that's a shame. Brown should do
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard left three years ago, shortly before the Globe reported
that the university's psychiatry department had received more than
$200,000 from the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health by
submitting partially fabricated invoices for research it did not
do.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dr. Martin Keller, chairman of Brown's psychiatry
department, insisted the work had been done properly and by the
people listed as participants. Keller and other Brown School of
Medicine officials last week declined to discuss the case and
referred calls to the public relations office.
</P>
<P>
   The January 1996 Globe report prompted an investigation by
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's office. Brown employees were
among those subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, and the case
dragged into its third year as Brown's attorneys tried to prevent a
criminal indictment and Massachusetts' attorneys fought to recoup
money they felt was owed the state.
</P>
<P>
   Late on the afternoon of Dec. 29, shortly after the attorney
general's office filed a civil lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court,
the university agreed to return $300,170, the full amount of
Brown's research contract with the Massachusetts mental health
department for fiscal years 1992, '93, and '94. The funding was
supposed to have supported research and training into schizophrenia
and other mental illnesses at the state-run Corrigan Mental Health
Center in Fall River.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed in court charged that Brown ``breached the
terms'' of its contracts by ``preparing and submitting invoices and
payment vouchers which inaccurately listed the services and
supplies provided, including listing services and supplies that
(Brown) did not provide at Corrigan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, Brown acknowledged that its School of
Medicine, which includes the psychiatry department, had submitted
inaccurate invoices and collected funding it was not entitled to.
It did not admit to any other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A Brown spokesman said the university settled because it didn't
want to continue litigating the matter. ``Brown returned the money
because the university wanted to bring an end to the issue,'' said
spokesman Mark Nickel.
</P>
<P>
   But as news of the settlement spread, some former Brown
employees wondered what, if anything, had changed, besides a newly
cut check for $300,170.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a small measure of justice,'' said Diane Hanks,
one of the former employees who had complained about the Corrigan
contract and other alleged irregularities. Hanks left Brown for
another job in the summer of 1996. After being laid off from that
job and then unemployed for much of last year, she recently landed
a job as a manager program analyst for the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Keller is still the chairman of the psychiatry
department at Brown, but all these other talented, hard-working
people were put out of their jobs,'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee who had gone to Rhode Island law enforcement
officials with allegations of previous billing irregularities by
Keller was subsequently fired by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say they fired the employee because he had
been charged with fraud in a car insurance scam. The employee says
he was fired because he had blown the whistle on Keller and other
university officials. (The employee ended up pleading guilty to the
fraud charges, he says, because he was unemployed and couldn't
afford an attorney to fight the case.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown plans to take no action against Keller or other officials
in the School of Medicine, the spokesman said last week. According
to university documents obtained by the Globe, Keller, a
psychiatrist who lives in Newton and at one point was bringing
Brown nearly $11 million annually in research grants, supervised
the preparation of erroneous invoices.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents and interviews with Brown employees,
the dean of the medical school, the assistant dean, and Brown's
vice president for finance and administration knew of alleged
accounting irregularities in the psychiatry department as far back
as 1994. But Hanks, Howard, and the employee who was fired, who
asked not to be identified, said that instead of holding Keller
accountable, Brown officials tried to pin the blame on the
employees who had blown the whistle. Brown officials declined to be
interviewed about these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, no personnel changes are planned at the state
Department of Mental Health, where, records show, top officials in
the southeast regional offices drafted the research contracts in
consultation with Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Amigone, then superintendent of Corrigan Mental Health
Center, worked closely with Keller to obtain funding for the
research contracts, according to people familiar with the project
and documents obtained by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the attorney general's office began its
investigation, Amigone, who previously had been demoted and
suspended for falsifying patient records, was demoted again; he was
removed from Corrigan and temporarily made acting director of the
Brockton Multi-Service Center. Amigone has been at Brockton for the
past 2 1/2 years, and a DMH spokesman said last week he will
continue in that capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Amigone's boss, John Sullivan, who approved the faulty research
contracts without seeking the required signoff by the agency's
central office, is still director of the southeast area office.
Neither Amigone nor Sullivan could be reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   John Widdison, spokesman for DMH, said the episode has prompted
the department to revamp its entire system for funding contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put in a new system that isn't tied to any one
individual and allows us to spot problems with invoices a lot
quicker,'' Widdison said.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard and others aren't so sure the state agency has
learned its lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hold management at all levels accountable for
reimbursement problems,'' Howard said. ``My motivation for coming
forward in the first place was that with money going to Brown for
services that were not being performed, that was money not being
provided to the neediest people in the system. They are the losers
in all of this.''

KENNEDY'S DEFT MANEUVER CHANGES THE IMPEACHMENT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With a little space and time, it is now clear that
the last thing Senator Phil Gramm had in mind last week was to
dance with Senator Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Republican dropped his hanky, and Kennedy _ who
had been waiting for just such a moment, and who has spent 35 years
becoming the champ at recognizing the gesture _ scooped it up, and
the next thing Gramm knew the Austin-Boston axis of another time
was back for at least a critical day in 1999's impeachment winter.
</P>
<P>
   With that space and time, there is no question who is furious
(House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde and his allies) and
who isn't (everybody else), always a reliable clue to what has
really happened.
</P>
<P>
   And when impeachment goes public again later this week, the
country will be able to understand why Hyde is so angry, and why
what Kennedy helped the Senate do is so important.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gramm made his now-famous observation that on procedure
Republicans and Democrats were not as far apart as their most
zealous spokesmen made it seem, it was somewhere between likely and
probable that a case by the House would automatically proceed to
full trial in the Senate for the sole reason that the Impeachment
Party had the votes.
</P>
<P>
   It may still spiral out of control, but now those 55 Republican
votes will have to be cast after the country has seen the House
case for what it is, and after it has become clear that the demand
for ``witnesses'' is in fact code for a demand that the Senate
legitimize the hideous job the House did in assembling a case that
is a joke as well as being constitutionally contemptible.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, we thank Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the senator got up to follow Gramm last week, the
``trial'' was likely to be pro forma at its commencement _ a
summary statement by House managers and presidential lawyers, some
motions and arguments _ and then testimony without limit and
regardless of demonstrated value.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of that day, a major series of high hurdles was
in place that will make the proceeding far different than it
otherwise would have been.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason is that not counting legal arguments, the two
sides can talk about the case for and against perjury and
obstruction of justice for a grand total of 64 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 60,000-page record that Hyde and his henchmen
insisted last month was enough to justify removal from office, we
now get to see if two 24-hour presentations, pro and con, followed
by 16 hours of questions, can disclose any significant gaps in the
House's record.
</P>
<P>
   But much more than that, there are two large hurdles in front of
subjecting us to more torture, for whom we also have Kennedy
primarily to thank.
</P>
<P>
   The first requires a Senate vote on an actual list of witnesses
that Hyde and his henchmen plan to depose in advance of trial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of this Kennedy notion is that it keeps Hyde from
loading his list up with wild turkeys not relevant to the two
pending articles, any one of which could lead to the list's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kennedy's notion was so brilliant that Hyde's allies are
already plotting to welsh on their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The second requires additional votes, post-deposition, for each
witness the House managers propose actually calling to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be the equivalent of a pre-trial trial of the
House case, something far from guaranteed before last week's
surprise developments.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 hours, for example, there is time to go through all 10
of Monica Lewinsky's distinct and differing statement to the FBI,
prosecutors, and grand jury about the silly gifts issue, none of
which implicates President Clinton in an attempt to conceal them.
And there is time for Hyde to tell us what we would learn from an
11th statement.
</P>
<P>
   There is time also to hear what the Hyde henchmen believe White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal can possibly say to justify their
obsession with smearing him as the co-planner of a get-Monica
campaign with Clinton in the face of already explicit denials.
There is now time for manager Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to
diclose that his only ``evidence'' consists of two hyperbolic
newspaper columns and an anonymously sourced Associated Press
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   In short, thanks largely to Kennedy, there is time to let the
hot air gradually seep out of a balloon that doesn't belong in the
Senate. Fifty-five Republicans can keep it there only if they
ignore the putrid case that the rules now require the Hyde henchmen
to explain in detail.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. _ Sitting in the dining room of his home, Jimmy
Martorano chuckles at the black and white photograph in his hands
of two angelic-looking little boys.
</P>
<P>
   The years since that snapshot of the Martorano brothers was
taken have brought them notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Martorano, 57, is said by the FBI to be a Mafia captain,
an accusation he denies. John Martorano, 58, has allegedly admitted
he was a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Martorano is serving a 57-month prison term for
racketeering in a case involving James ``Whitey'' Bulger and
Stephen ``the Rifleman'' Flemmi, gangsters and longtime FBI
informants.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, John, remains at an undisclosed location, trying to
cut a deal with authorities to cooperate against the fugitive
Bulger, 69, and Flemmi, 64.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Jimmy Martorano, dressed
casually in a sweater and sporting an electronic bracelet while
under house arrest, talked about his brother's decision to
cooperate; their relationship with Bulger and Flemmi, and the
government's racketeering case against the organized crime figures
that has been unraveling at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support my brother's efforts 1 million percent,'' said
Martorano, an articulate man with gray hair and brown eyes who has
a bachelor's degree in business from Boston College and a lengthy
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny is not an informant. He never was an informant. His
purpose is to stop what's going on, to stop these informants,
Whitey and Stevie, who are blaming others for what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipping coffee and poring over a legal pad filled neatly with
notes of what he wanted to say, Martorano waxed philosophical as he
talked about principles such as honor, integrity, and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in this case is contending they were an
angel,'' said Martorano, who has already spent 51 months in prison
on related racketeering charges. ``I've done lots of things in my
life I wish I could change. But we weren't informants and we didn't
do things and blame other people for them. Stevie and Whitey were
the biggest criminals of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano pleaded guilty more than a year ago to a 1995
indictment that alleges he and his brother plotted with Bulger,
Flemmi, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank''
Salemme, and reputed Rhode Island mobster Robert DeLuca to shake
down bookmakers and drug dealers and control other illegal
activities. It also charges Salemme and Flemmi with murders.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, according to sources, John Martorano broke ranks
with the others and confessed to killing more than a dozen people
in Massachusetts, Florida, and Oklahoma _ some with the help of
Bulger and Flemmi and others under orders from them. He has offered
to cooperate with State Police and Drug Enforcement Administration
agents who are trying to build a new case, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, he is hoping for a deal that will eventually give
him his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge is considering dismissing the 1995 indictment,
partly based on Flemmi's claim that the FBI gave him and Bulger
immunity from prosecution in exchange for information about the
activities of local mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   When Flemmi finally admitted in 1997 that he had been an
informant since 1965, and Bulger since a decade later, Martorano
said he already knew it.
</P>
<P>
   The realization came in 1994 while Martorano and Patrick Nee, a
longtime Bulger associate from South Boston, were cellmates at a
federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to walk around the track and talk about how we were
getting tired of defending Stevie and Whitey because a lot of guys
had suspicions that they were rats,'' James Martorano said. ``We
came to the conclusion that every time someone from Southie had to
go away, it was him. Every time someone from Somerville went away,
it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano said Flemmi and Bulger made a career out of feeding
the FBI false information. It was a deliberate strategy, Martorano
said, that allowed Bulger and Flemmi to blame others for their own
crimes and advance in the underworld by eliminating their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie and Whitey were the vanguard of a whole new industry of
informants,'' Martorano said, getting agitated as he scornfully
described a law enforcement culture that has evolved since the
World War II era that is creating a nation of ``sniveling
informants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about the casual informant who gets pinched
and tries to get out of it,'' Martorano said. ``I'm talking about
the industry they've created of professional informants like Whitey
and Stevie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized early on, we can get away with all of our
crimes, we can set people up. . . . This was their life's work.
These guys chose to live their lives without honor or integrity and
in doing that they were cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, US District Judge Mark L. Wolf conducted exhaustive
hearings that exposed a corrupt and cozy relationship between
Bulger and Flemmi and their FBI handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Even federal prosecutors now concede that Bulger and Flemmi were
protected for years. But, they say, it was by rogue agents acting
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   One former supervisor, John Morris, testified that he pocketed
bribes totalling $7,000 from the pair and tipped them to
investigations. Flemmi testified that Morris told them they could
do whatever they wanted, as long as they didn't kill anyone. Morris
denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearings, John Martorano, Salemme, and DeLuca sat
grim-faced next to Flemmi in the jury box. Salemme, DeLuca and
Flemmi are all being held at the Plymouth County jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have more sympathy for anyone than I have for
Frankie and Bobby, having to look at Stevie every day and know what
he did to them,'' Jimmy Martorano said. ``It must be like looking
across the room at Judas every day. He doesn't think he was wrong
to do it. He still thinks he's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has credited Bulger and Flemmi with helping the bureau
decimate the New England Mafia, by providing information that led
to convictions throughout the 1980s and into 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Martorano insists the FBI's files are filled with a
mythical, utterly inaccurate view of life in the underworld created
by Bulger and Flemmi. One myth, he said, was that the Winter Hill
Gang and the Mafia were once on the brink of a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Irish against the Italians,'' Martorano said.
``That was Stevie and Whitey trying to create diversionary tactics.
It was them against the Irish and Italians. They created that. They
were rats.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Wolf last month, Martorano applauded the judge
for holding hearings that forced former agents to the stand and
opened the Bulger and Flemmi informant files to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat is off to you for your unwavering courage and
integrity,'' Martorano wrote to Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano said he hopes Wolf dismisses the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were to bring the proper indictment here, it would be
against Whitey and Stevie and their handlers. It was Stevie and
Whitey who started this reign of terror, shaking down bookmakers
and drug dealers, all with the help of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born a year apart, John and James were the only children of a
father who emigrated from Sicily and a mother of Irish and English
descent who grew up in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo and Elizabeth Martorano owned and operated a restaurant
and a nightclub in the South End while raising their boys in
Milton.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers graduated together in 1959 from Milton High School,
where they co-captained the football team. Jimmy Martorano dropped
out of Boston College after a year to join the Army, but later went
back to school nights to earn his business degree.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers met Flemmi in the early 1960s at the nightclub
owned by their father, then met Bulger around 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitey was one of those guys you don't warm up to,'' Jimmy
Martorano said, recalling him as demeaning to women and easily
agitated. ``I don't think many guys liked him. He wasn't
personable. I never considered Whitey a friend. I had a distrust of
him. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi was a close friend, said Martorano, adding, ``I would
have gone to war for Stevie.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s, the Martorano brothers, Bulger, and Flemmi
were reputed members of Somerville's Winter Hill Gang, led by Howie
Winter.
</P>
<P>
   The death blow for the gang was a 1979 federal race-fixing
indictment against Winter, the Martoranos, and 18 others. James
Martorano spent five years in prison in that case, while his
brother fled to evade charges. He remained a fugitive until his
arrest in Boca Raton, Fla., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi were spared indictment and it was revealed
last year that federal prosecutors deliberately removed them from
the case because they were informants.
</P>
<P>
   James Martorano now suspects that Bulger and Flemmi played a
role in implicating him in a 1975 extortion case that sent him to
prison for 10 years. Retired FBI Agent John Connolly, who was
Bulger and Flemmi's handler, played a role in the case. Martorano
professes his innocence and is appealing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I found out that Stevie, who I thought
was a friend of mine all those years, was an informant,'' James
Martorano said.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano won't talk about the people his brother has killed or
the details of his behind-the-scenes negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make an angel out of him. He's not,'' Martorano said.
``But he's willing to pay for that.''
</P>
<P>
   And although he defends his brother, James Martorano said he
will not cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in our family has ever been an informant, nor will I be
a witness for them,'' James Martorano said. ``But I support Johnny
in his efforts to stop these people. Whatever he is doing, he's
doing in good conscience.''

PANTYHOSE WOES: COSTLY, CONFINING AND WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're too tight. Too itchy. Too short. They run. They sag.
They snag. They rip. They're just not comfortable. Why can't
hosiery makers get it right?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the sartorial challenges women face, finding comfortable
pantyhose tops most lists. What else in fashion requires you to
bend, pull, twist, kick, jump, and stretch just to get it on? (OK,
maybe skin-tight jeans but society doesn't demand you wear those).
And so often, the aerobic workout leads to exasperation: a run or
worse, a giant hole. There goes five bucks (at least).
</P>
<P>
   If we can send a probe to Mars, why can't we invent pantyhose we
like? Do hosiery manufacturers hate women? Or are they just
creating styles based on models' pencil-thin legs rather than real
people? Are the charts displayed on packages accurate or are
consumers supposed to wink and automatically skip to the next size?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate them. They're modern-day girdles,'' says Mary Glynn.
```Tall' is usually made in another country where `tall' in that
country is 5-foot-2. But when they're your last pair, you wear them
anyway and you have to walk like your feet have been bound. Or you
do deep-knee-bends in the ladies room throughout the evening to
keep them on. Pantyhose were definitely invented by men.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that women's biology must share part of the blame in
this industry failing. After all, how can any manufacturer
accommodate all those shapes out there, asks Daniel Faucher, a
senior professor of pattern making at the School of Fashion Design
in Boston. ``It's the varied differences in women's bodies. In the
waist-to-crotch and crotch-to-knee,'' says Faucher. ``Any
dressmaker will tell you, pants are the hardest thing to fit. Once
the curves are cut _ the hip and crotch _ it's very hard to alter
those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Boria, executive director of design and merchandising at
Hanes Hosiery (which makes Hanes, Donna Karan, DKNY, and L'eggs
hose), says her company does an ``incredible amount of research and
study to make sure the sizing grids are accurate,'' including
trying every style on more than 50 women of varying shapes.
</P>
<P>
   In her work group of six, Boria says, the sizing inspections get
especially intense. ``You have to shed your inhibitions. Wear nice
underwear. Shave your legs and have your toes done. We check _
`Does this really feel like a control top? Is it sucking it in?' .
. . I will walk up to people and pinch their leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Still she says, ``It's challenging. . . . Some people like
higher waists, others lower waists. Some like control top. Some
don't. Some like thigh shapers, others don't. There are really so
many preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Like finding colors that match one's legs. A huge problem for
many African-American women is finding ``natural'' colored hose
that match their skin tone. ``Suntan'' and ``coffee'' are typically
too orange or too brown. ``I have not put on brown stockings my
color in years,'' says Stephanie Aguillard. ``If you find a color
that actually matches, you'd better buy it out. You'll never find
it again. . . . They're just not available.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of women debate about price. Is it worth it to pay $15 or
$8 a pair? Or will a $1 drugstore brand suffice? Won't they all run
in the end? (There's even a $36-to-$42-a-pair brand called Wolford
available at Saks Fifth Avenue).
</P>
<P>
   It's a personal decision of course. But our own informal
analysis found $13 Donna Karan Just Sheer hosiery (from Lord &AMP;
Taylor) to be soft in texture and very forgiving in the waist and
crotch. L'eggs's $5 opaque style (from Stop &AMP; Shop) is coarser but
acceptable with one caveat: the sizing chart is way off; consumers
should buy the next size up. And Wolford's velvet de luxe? It's
outstanding, but the price eliminates most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   These days a lot of women wear pants and avoid the pantyhose
fiasco completely. Others have embraced tights, which last longer
and are generally more comfortable (although for some occasions
their opaqueness is too informal).
</P>
<P>
   Nylon was invented in 1937 and displayed at the 1939 New York
World's Fair, according to the National Association of Hosiery
Manufacturers. But until the 1960s, women still used garter belts
and other apparatus to hold up their stockings. With the advent of
the miniskirt, suddenly ``stockings were longer than the skirts
were,'' says Sid Smith, president and chief executive of the
hosiery association in Charlotte, N.C. And thus manufacturers
invented pantyhose, an industry with $2.6 billion in sales of
women's sheer hosiery in 1997, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Image consultants like Mary Lou Andre, president of Organization
by Design in Needham, Mass., actually have strategies to help their
clients deal with hosiery, a wardrobe component that can cost women
hundreds of dollars each year. ``You have to get brand loyal,''
says Andre, who prefers Donna Karan and Hanes. ``Look at the fiber
content and make sure some percentage is lycra and spandex. One
hundred percent nylons are not comfortable. Lycra lasts longer,

   No matter what brand you buy, runs and holes seem an inevitable

nail polish is your best friend.''

COMPARATIVELY SUPERLATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cautiously worded front-page headline on the New Year's Day
Globe _ ``Boston baby is one of the first of 1999'' _ reminded me
of a letter that came last fall chastising me for a similarly
hedged superlative. My reference to one of the most famous
quotations in newspaper history was nonsense, wrote the reader;
only one quotation could be the most famous.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is unassailable: If you're the top, I'm not. If she's
the best, she has no peers. But in real life and real language, we
need more than bare-naked logic to say what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   The New Year's baby race could, of course, be made a strict
competition, with clocks synchonized and rules agreed upon _ though
one hopes the people involved would rather concentrate on other
things in the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   In many other realms, though, absolute ranking is simply out of
reach. Whether it's the best books of the year, the most
entertaining movies, or the worst political blunders, there are
likely to be differences of opinion. (Well, maybe not on that last
one.) Remember last year's list of the century's 100 best works of
fiction? Everyone agreed on that, all right _ agreed that it was a
ridiculous failure.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best, worst, first, least _ these are standard
English because we very rarely agree on one best or worst of
anything, though we may agree, roughly, on the group of contenders.
In fact, the usage is so uncontroversial that it's hard to find in
the guidebooks; usually, it comes up in entries on the difficulties
of the construction One of the best, if not the best, magician(s),
and why it's so awkward in English. The solution offered by one
adviser? Stick with one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   You could, of course, say one of the better movies of the year,
but to the hyperbole-acclimated American ear, there's something
grudging about the usage _ and it has its own logical problems,
too. We like the biggest, smallest, fastest, first, whether the
superlative is necessary or not. Witness the difference between the
American and British reporting on the current Washington trial: The
BBC announcers tend to call it ``only the second presidential
impeachment in US history,'' while Americans often say ``the first
impeachment in 130 years.'' Could be anti-Clintonism, but I suspect
it comes from a combination of historical myopia and love of
overstatement. Hey, it's happening to us for the first time, and
that's what really matters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a tail
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a tiny mistake, Sen. John Kerry's declaration that he was
bothered by Republicans ``who seem to cower other senators and
their colleagues into submission.'' Sure, he meant cow _ to
intimidate, browbeat _ but cower is what people do when they're
cowed, right? As TV bloopers go, this was strictly small time.
</P>
<P>
   Within that small slip, though, lie concealed a few of our
language's many surprises. Cow, the verb, does not have the same
root as cower, it turns out _ though both may have Old Norse
antecedents. Coward isn't related to either of them; it comes, via
Old French, from the Latin cauda, tail; hence, a coward is one who
turns tail and runs. Cowards are cowering in English by the 13th
century, but cow doesn't show up till 1605, in ``Macbeth'':
``Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cow'd my
better part of man.'' And while cows may look docile, it's not
because they're cowed; their name is a very old Germanic word,
unrelated to the others. And just to close the circle here, there's
even a breed called Kerry cows _ but whether that influnced our
senator to choose the verb cower is probably beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The spin they're in &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something vertiginous was in the air when the current Newsweek
(Jan. 11) was in the works. In three successive arts section
stories, writers chose the same image to describe the subject's
rough times:
</P>
<P>
   Page 62: ``A heart attack and bypass surgery in 1991 spiraled
McMurtry into a depression for almost four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Page 64: ``And then there was the court battle _ a triumph for
no one and, for Schlichtmann, a harrowing downward spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Page 65: ``As long as he can stay focused on the crime, he
doesn't have to look at the wreckage of his own life, which is
spiraling out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how you feel about spiral as a transitive verb; let's
just hope this image hit the ground with a thud and was carried off
for what will be a long, quiet recovery period.

ONE DISGRACE AFTER ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The first blow to Michael Cox's head, the hardest, was the
only one even remotely understandable _ a case of mistaken identity
in a collective surge of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Blue police lights pulsed through the cold night air, sirens
wailed in the distance, radios crackled with word of murder and a
manhunt. And Cox lay on the ground, at the feet of several Boston
police officers, looking as much like the suspect as the highly
decorated plainclothes police sergeant that he was.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened next was inexcusable, criminal: Officers,
thinking they had captured a killer, kicked him in the face, in the
kidneys, in the back. Cox curled into a ball. When someone
recognized him, the attackers made a flash decision breathtaking
for its raw cowardice. They scattered into the January night,
leaving a brother cop on the frozen ground, bleeding,
semi-conscious, and alone.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the worst life would offer Michael Cox,
the dark before the morning light. But in the four years since, the
injustice has spread from the scene of the crime to the corridors
of power all across this city, where the police commissioner, the
mayor, and various state and federal prosecutors have proven
themselves either inept at reining in the Police Department or
indifferent toward the brutality that sometimes comes out of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are precious few investigations by which the measure of a
city and a system is made, and this was distinctly one of them.
Look at the results: Cox was beaten, then abandoned by the
department he serves, left on his own to try to break through the
proverbial blue wall of silence, identify his attackers and pursue
them in court. Now the city _ Mayor Thomas Menino and Commissioner
Paul Evans _ is about to do battle with the decorated cop it failed
to help, in a civil trial scheduled to begin next month. All that
is left in this case is shame.
</P>
<P>
   Three suspects _ Officers James Burgio, David Williams, and Ian
Daley _ face no charges, though they were found liable for either
the beating or coverup last month in a federal civil suit brought
by Cox. A fourth, Ken Conley, has been convicted of perjury in
federal court _ his defense funded by brethren on the force.
</P>
<P>
   This fact is beyond dispute: Sometime after 2:40 a.m. on Jan.
25, 1995, Cox was savagely beaten by other police officers at the
end of Woodruff Way, a dead-end road in Mattapan. The beating
occurred after Cox had responded to a radio alert of a slaying in
Roxbury, led the chase of a getaway car, and was about to climb a
chain-link fence in pursuit of a suspect when he was taken down
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was one disgrace after another. None of the
approximately 20 Boston police officers at the scene, each a
meticulously trained witness, would admit seeing anything relevant.
Some denied seeing Cox at all. Others filed reports saying he
slipped on a patch of ice and smashed his head against a parked
cruiser. The senior patrol supervisor filed an absurd report saying
he saw only two police officers at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Evans then moved cautiously, saying that if police officers
pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to cooperate with an
internal probe, in Massachusetts that did not provide grounds to
dismiss them. He did not suspend four officers until 2 1/2 months
ago, nearly four years after the beating. Privately, Evans, the
architect of Boston's plunging crime rate, has appeared anguished
over the case. But his public inaction and bloodless comments send
a message through the department that brutality and lies can go
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph Martin, followed by
US Attorney Donald Stern, both of whom have failed in their pursuit
of sanctions. The federal case continues, but even those involved
seem uncertain of future indictments.
</P>
<P>
   And now Menino comes along to reject a settlement offer put
forth by Cox, who is now 33. In November, the detective sought just
under $1 million, as well as the equivalent of a lifetime
disability pension and attorneys' fees, which could be $500,000. In
his suit against the city, Cox seeks $3.8 million _ the amount
awarded to Rodney King in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the city to settle. It is time to settle not just
for Cox, but for the honest, hard-working cops who make up the vast
majority of the force, each one of whom has been disgraced by the
officers who saw nothing on Woodruff Way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the city believes it can win in court, and perhaps it
can, given that Cox's lawyers must prove a pattern of tolerance to
brutality. But in victory, what would it get? Boston could abandon
Cox, then defeat him. And every day hence would be another day of
shame.

THE EMPERORS OF CHOCOLATE 
Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars 
By Joel Glenn Brenner 
Random House, 366 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you think of great business rivalries, a handful of warring
pairs come to mind: Coke vs. Pepsi, McDonald's vs. Burger King,
Ford vs. General Motors. Joel Glenn Brenner has spent much of the
past decade exploring a competition as fierce as any of those _ the
fight between candy giants Hershey and Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1920s these two have battled to feed the nation's
sweet tooth. They have fought over supermarket shelf space,
movie-counter displays, and even over the right to supply US troops
in the Gulf War. ``Snickers bars are just as necessary as
weaponry,'' one Mars executive told the Pentagon in pitching his
wares. In all cases, they have fought outside the public's view.
Candy makers could give the CIA lessons in how to keep a secret.
Thanks to Brenner's sleuthing, and her lively book, ``The Emperors
of Chocolate,'' the rest of us can get some idea of what's been
going on all these years.
</P>
<P>
   The two rivals could not be more different. If the Mars company
were a candy, it would be a piece of bitter chocolate with
something hard inside. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who built the
company, was one tough nut. He fought with his father and his
employees. When his children were small, he refused to give them
any M &AMP; M's, Mars's best-selling product: He said there weren't any
to spare. When his sons followed him into the family business he
regularly threatened to deprive them of their inheritance if they
screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But if Forrest Mars Sr. was a sourpuss, he was a brilliant one.
Long before such ideas were fashionable in management circles, he
invested heavily in technology and quality control, tied paychecks
(including his own) to the success of the company, and recognized
the importance of the global marketplace. He also appreciated the
value of advertising. How do you top the famous M &AMP; M's slogan,
``Melts in your mouth, not in your hand''? Forrest's efforts, as
well as the work of his two sons, have made the Mars family among
the richest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Milton Hershey were a candy, he would be sweet with a mushy
center. The man who brought milk chocolate to America was basically
a tinkerer with limited interest in business. After he became rich
at an early age, he announced, ``I have more money than I know what
to do with.'' (Are you listening, Mr. Gates?) The rest of his life
was dedicated largely to philanthropy. He built the town of
Hershey, Pa., and in 1918 donated his fortune to a school for
orphans. One of his successors was a graduate of the school.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the candy world talks much about the business for a
simple reason: They don't want to let the competition know what
they are up to. When a candy becomes a hit, it stays a hit forever.
Many of the top-selling candies _ the Hershey bar, Hershey's
Kisses, Snickers, Three Musketeers _ have been around for more than
60 years. The last thing a candy maker wants is for a rival to
steal an idea before it hits the market. Not surprisingly, the Mars
people take secrecy to paranoid extremes. When outside contractors
are brought into one of their factories, the outsiders must wear
blindfolds until they reach the spot where their services are
required. Once the job is done they are blindfolded again and led
out.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter for The Washington Post, Brenner was granted a
rare audience with the Mars family, and her revelations about the
company are the strength of her book. But Brenner's heart clearly
lies with the folks at Hershey's. She writes about them
sympathetically, perhaps too sympathetically at times. In truth,
the company is run by likable bumblers. Time and time again
Hershey's has missed golden opportunities to expand both here and
abroad. A Mars executive who went to work for Hershey's said of his
new colleagues, ``They thought marketing was something their wives
did on Saturday.'' The company made some good moves _ its
acquisitions of Reese's and Peter Paul, the maker of Almond Joy,
have worked out well. More often than not, however, Hershey's has
had to play catch-up with Mars.
</P>
<P>
   What lessons can we learn from this tale? Two come to mind. In
business, nice guys finish second. And the candy business is no
place for softies.

PANEL URGES MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TENURED PROFESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to demands for greater faculty accountability, a
national report is urging universities and colleges to enforce high
standards for tenured professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenure was created to protect academic freedom, not to
guarantee continuing employment for chronically poor-performing
faculty,'' according to the report issued Monday by a panel of
eight university administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Faculty Policy Review Project, sponsored by the Washington,
D.C.-based American Association of State Colleges and Universities,
advocated measures that on the surface seem mild, but are
nonetheless radical for most institutions of higher learning. They
include rigorous post-tenure review that may lead to stripping some
professors of their protected status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of those things is that common,'' said
panel member Gary Reichard, associate vice president for academic
affairs at the California State University at Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   During the anti-communism of the McCarthy era and the campus
unrest over the Vietnam War, tenure was credited as a shield that
protected the free speech of faculty with unpopular views. But in
recent years, with the publication of conservative critiques like
``Profscam'' and ``The Closing of the American Mind,'' tenure has
increasingly come under fire as a free ride for unaccountable
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Karen R. Hitchcock, president of the State University of New
York at Albany and a member of the panel, downplayed the report's
conclusions on tenure and instead emphasized the need for greater
communication about faculty responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very clear with the public about what faculty
do,'' she said. ``Tenure isn't just a sinecure. It's not like,
after seven years, it's a prize and you have a job for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is somewhat different in New York, where the state
university system has annual post-tenure performance evaluations.
Hitchcock added that the misconceptions about tenure decrease as
faculty interact with community and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, familiarity breeds understanding, not contempt,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the group that represents 450 of the nation's
public campuses was released one month after State University of
New York trustees debated two measures with the theme of
accountability. In December, they approved a core curriculum and
this month are slated to look at instituting performance
evaluations for campus presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In other recommendations, the new report advocates the
elimination of tenure based primarily on length of service _ a
practice in place at a handful of institutions, mostly community
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes greater monitoring of faculty sabbaticals _
paid leave to conduct scholarly work and enhance creative growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a public concern that the sabbatical project
coincides with the faculty member's interest, not necessarily
university priorities,'' the report said. ``While there is
oversight of sabbaticals, consistency in accountability across
higher education institutions is debatable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Their new book was due out shortly, a critical study of speech
and conduct codes at US college campuses, and with that coauthors
Harvey Silverglate and Alan Kors eagerly anticipated word from
their publisher about its plans to promote ``The Shadow
University.''
</P>
<P>
   But in short order their hearts sank when they learned the
publisher had little promotion in mind for a work that had taken
its authors, one a Boston attorney, the other a college professor,
years to research and write. Basically, says Silverglate, the
publisher planned to send out a batch of review copies to the
media, take out a couple of small, print advertisements, and had
lined up a three-city book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Three-city? Silverglate worked in one of the cities, Boston,
Kors in the other, Philadelphia. The simple math and simple reality
of the so-called book tour their publisher had put together
amounted to a single appearance in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was it,'' says Silverglate, recalling recently the dismay
he and Kors felt once they realized their book was not slated as
one of The Free Press's big books for the fall season just ended.
Making matters worse, Silverglate tracked the mailing of review
copies to potential reviewers at newspapers and other media and
discovered that, for a variety of reasons, ``20 percent of the
people never even got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the book would sink like a rock,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has since turned.
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of authors, Silverglate and Kors
combined the hiring of a private publicist with their own
on-the-run public relations scramble. For the most part, critics
embraced the work, but the authors did not know if the book-buying
public would; now, three months after its release in late
September, the two have traveled to more than 30 cities to push
their book at lectures, talks, and book signings. The authors
created a Web site. They've done more than 40 print interviews. The
private publicist they hired targeted radio, and, says Silverglate,
``We've easily done more than 250 shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what we've done,'' Silverglate says about all
the hustle. ``We've sold out the first printing (13,000 books) and
the publisher clearly wasn't expecting that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the US alone, about 50,000 new books are published each year,
according to industry observers. That's a lot of noise, with a lot
of authors competing to have their works noticed by the book-buying
public. Likewise, these observers note, unless you're a celebrity
author or have written one of the firm's big books, there's been a
falloff in the promotional efforts publishers give to the rest of
the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a common practice for New York publishers to do
very little publicity for other than their `A-list' titles, which
means, essentially they throw books out there and see what
happens,'' says John Kremer, a guru of sorts in the world of book
promotion. The Iowa-based Kremer is a one-man clearinghouse of
information. He manages a Web site, puts out a monthly newsletter,
and is the author of ``1001 Ways to Market Your Books.'' Kremer
says when he first wrote his guide in 1986 it sold mostly to public
relations professionals, but, ``now it's mainly, I would say, the
majority of sales are to authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want your book to do well in today's market you have to
be actively involved in the marketing of the book.'' That's become
a publishing fact of life, Kremer says, a matter of caseloads and
manpower. ``The major publishers in New York put out between 300
and 1,000 books a year, and their publicity staffs range from 3 to
20. There's no way they can publicize all those books adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virtually unheard of a decade ago, a growing number of authors
are now dipping into their back pockets to hire a freelance
publicist. It's a trend with enough vigor to fuel the emergence of
a new subset of publicists in the field of public relations _ those
who work exclusively on author promotion. In Boston, for example,
there is a handful of publicists who specialize in promoting
authors and their books, and all of them set up shop in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The best known locally, and probably the most expensive, is
Sandra Goroff-Mailly, who worked for years in publicity at Houghton
Mifflin before setting out on her own in 1994. Goroff-Mailly is
hired directly by authors as well as by publishing houses, and
she's handled the publicity for a range of local and nationally
known writers, such as Tracy Kidder, James Carroll, Clive Cussler,
Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick and William M. Bulger, currently
the president of the University of Massachusetts, who wrote a
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Gail Leondar-Wright, who dropped out of her PhD
program in the early 1990s after helping a friend promote her new
book, and found the work ``enormously empowering, satisfying, and
fun.'' Based in Arlington, Mass., Leondar-Wright has carved out her
own niche. ``I mostly just promote progressive books, something
with a left-of-center agenda.'' In Newton, Mass., there's Victor
Gulotta, who also had worked in the publicity departments at
various publishing houses before forming his own firm in 1993. His
client list tilts heavily in favor of authors of self-help books.
There are others, including ultra-specialists like Lisa Ekus of
Hatfield, Mass., known nationally as the go-to publicist for food
writers launching a new cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   In hands-on fashion, the personal publicist works with the
author to devise a campaign either to complement the promotional
effort their publisher has in mind or to pick up after the
publisher's ``launch campaign'' has ended. They look to set up book
tours that, at best, will include book signings, lectures, and
radio, TV, and print interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The fees range widely. The publicists interviewed locally all
said they prefer a minimum of a three months of work, with the cost
ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 a month depending on the proposed
campaign. In New York, the fees run even higher. ``It's a real
investment,'' says Kremer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many cash-strapped authors face spending more for a
private publicist than what they got paid to write their book. But
each of the Boston-area publicists all talked about a certain kind
of case-by-case flexibility. ``I don't want any author to be
bankrupt because they are paying for my services,'' says
Leondar-Wright about her sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Alicia Ostriker is one beneficiary of Leondar-Wright's
approach. Twice Ostriker turned to Leondar-Wright to help promote
her poetry. Rutgers University Press, she says, had ``really
nothing'' planned in 1994 for promoting the publication of her book
of poems, ``Nakedness of the Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leondar-Wright, she says, set up interviews for her in the
cities she was already traveling to for other work-related reasons,
such as Los Angeles and the Bay area. There was no time limit to
their deal, just a modest fee whenever she pitched in. ``I didn't
have the contacts, and Gail got my name out there in places it
wouldn't have gotten otherwise,'' says the poet, who lives in
Princeton, N.J. ``It's nice for any author who works on something
serious to have a publicist who understands what you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do the in-house publicists at the major publishing houses
make of all this? ``I almost always think it's a good idea,'' says
Barb Burg, the Director of Publicity and a vice president at Bantam
Books, which publishes more than 300 titles a year. ``Think about
it, we live in a world now where it seems everyone has a publicist,
and publicity is an infinite world. It's never done. There's always
another phone call you can make, another radio show you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of our jobs is that we only have a certain amount
of time we can devote to each project.'' Burg has eight in-house
publicists working for her. Upon publication, she says, they
oversee three months of ``launch publicity, and after that, we have
to move on to the next books.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Burg says it makes the most sense for an author to
hire their own publicist, ``if an author wants to keep things
going.'' There are times during the launch, she concedes, when
authors might want to hire private publicists to supplement the
house's efforts, ``when the author doesn't think the book is
getting enough attention initially.'' But she also cautions against
authors rushing out and hiring a publicist from the get-go. ``I
hate to see authors waste their money. Some books just are not
publicize-able.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg also refutes the widely held notion that only the house's
big books get the backing of the publicity department. ``That's a
great misconception by authors. We bought the book. We care. We
want to publicize our books.''
</P>
<P>
   Try convincing biographer Susan Quinn of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was essentially orphaned,'' she recalls about the
publication four years ago of her biography, ``Marie Curie,'' by
Simon and Schuster. ``I had a wonderful editor, and then he got
fired, and I got passed on to someone who had very little interest
in my book, who's main claim to fame was that he'd edited a
Princess Di book that had done very well. It was very clear from
the first lunch with him that he didn't have any kind of plan to
market my book.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a meeting with the sales staff at which she learned
the publisher was not even going to take out radio spots on
National Public Radio to promote the book. ``That was the turning
point for me. It showed me they had no commitment at all to doing
anything for the book.'' Quinn, who lives in Brookline, Mass. and
is president of the writers' group PEN/New England, began asking
around, and was referred to Goroff-Mailly. The book was reviewed
favorably and widely, and even though her publisher, she says, had
no book tour scheduled for her, Goroff-Mailly ``arranged for a huge
number of public radio interviews all over the country.'' She says
she paid $3,000 for the extra help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I sell enough books to cover the cost of hiring Sandy?
There is no way of knowing. But I do know it helped sell more
books, and I'd spent seven years working on it, and I thought,
after putting so much effort into this, I'd blame myself if I
didn't give it my best shot marketing the book. If I hadn't done
that, I'd live with that regret, because really good books do get
lost. I knew that.''

THE UNLIKELY SUCCESS OF ABC'S `PRACTICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``The Practice'' is one of those improbable
television success stories that can restore one's faith in the
medium.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy viewers knew the Boston-based legal drama was one of the
most compelling hours on TV long before it won the Emmy for best
drama last fall, long before Camryn Manheim was able to clutch her
Best Supporting Actress statuette and exult: ``This is for all the
fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, ABC didn't treat ``The Practice'' like a prized
commodity at first. First the network buried the show in a dismal
Saturday night time slot, then bounced it to Monday before finally
giving it a home on Sundays at 10 p.m. Consequently, said series
star Dylan McDermott, ``When we won (the Emmy), it was such
validation for all of us because of the obstacles that we had in
the beginning of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel it,'' added McDermott, while other cast members
of ``The Practice'' nodded in agreement during an interview session
with TV critics here. ``We still feel that validation. . . . That's
a huge feat, coming from where we did in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   From its humble origins in March 1997 as a midseason
replacement, ``The Practice'' has acquired such cachet as a
dramatic showcase that a guest shot can reshape an actor's image,
as it did for Tony Danza when he shone in a guest stint as a
barracuda of a lawyer this season, or John Larroquette, who won an
Emmy for his role as a fiendishly clever killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all seen what's happened to Tony Danza,'' remarked
Jeffrey Kramer, an executive producer of ``The Practice.'' ``There
was a real jump to his career, and the perception of him as a
talent. . . . It's attractive to a lot of actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama of ``The Practice'' takes place in an ethically gray
world where attorneys exploit every loophole and technicality to
get their clients off, even the most loathesome murderers. ``That's
the essence of the show . . . that you're in a moral dilemma
constantly,'' said McDermott. ``As a defense attorney, you have to
defend your client to the best of your ability and knowledge, and
that pretty much means doing anything you can to get the client
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding their dubious tactics, the show's higher ratings
this season suggest that viewers have developed a fondness for the
show's characters _ with the possible exception of Lucy Hatcher,
the meddlesome young secretary played by 18-year-old Marla
Sokoloff. Series creator David E. Kelley said he introduced the
character of Lucy to ``provoke/antagonize'' the partners in the law
firm, adding that some letters to the show indicate that she has
had the same effect on viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley compared Lucy to the character of Rosalind Shays on ``L.
A. Law,'' the classic mid-'80s lawyer show for which he was a
writer. In a famous episode, Kelley killed off the arrogant Shays
character by having her step into an empty elevator shaft,
prompting one critic to ask Sokoloff on Saturday whether there are
any elevators on the set of ``The Practice.'' The cast broke up in
laughter while the 18-year-old Sokoloff looked puzzled. ``That's an
`L.A. Law' reference,'' co-executive producer Robert Breech
explained to Sokoloff, who replied, ``OK, I was like, `I really
don't get that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A onetime lawyer in Boston, Kelley said he patterned the
formidable Judge Zoe Hiller on ``The Practice'' after US District
Judge Rya W. Zobel, before whom he once tried a case.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is one of several well-known writer/producers developing
shows for ABC. Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC Entertainment, said
Monday that the network is planning to air Kelley's ``Snoops,'' a
show about high-tech detectives, plus ``Mulholland Drive,''
developed by David Lynch of ``Twin Peaks'' fame, and ``Once
Again,'' by the ``thirtysomething'' team of Ed Zwick and Marshall
Herskovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Again'' is a drama that revolves around the blended
family life of a pair of divorcees who meet and marry. Details were
scarce about ``Mulholland Drive,'' except that it is set in Los
Angeles. Asked about perceptions that ``Twin Peaks'' went downhill
after its much-heralded first season, ABC Entertainment president
Jamie Tarses quoted Lynch as saying ``I want to correct the
mistakes I made.''
</P>
<P>
   One major talent who will not be on ABC's schedule is Mary Tyler
Moore. Tarses said the long-discussed series starring Moore is no
longer in development. ``The stars didn't line up correctly,'' she
said. Both Tarses and Bloomberg were evasive when asked whether
``Home Improvement'' will return to ABC next year. ``At this point,
we have no idea whether the actors want to come back,'' said
Bloomberg.

CANADA REACHES SOUTH FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For Alec Tallman of Lunenburg, Mass., it was a tossup
with Vassar College, and Vassar lost. For Ian Madeiros of
Pittsfield, Maine, the big lure was the caterwaul of bagpipes and
ratta-tat-tat of the Scottish side drum. For Meghan Brown of
Pembroke, Mass., it was the chance for a high-quality education at
a palatable price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost wasn't the big factor. The academic program was, by
far,'' said Brown, 23, who graduated from Nova Scotia's Dalhousie
University last year with a bachelor's in marine biology, and is
working on a master's degree. ``But the cost of studying in Canada
is certainly an important side bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   As tuition rates continue to climb in the United States,
increasing numbers of American students are heading north to attend
Canadian universities, seeking higher education from schools with
standards equivalent to those in the United States but with
less-punishing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada's institutions are for the first time
aggressively courting US high schoolers and other college-bound
Americans, with some success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our undergraduate applications from the US are up by 27
percent in the past year,'' said Anne Roussell, executive director
of recruitment and liaison at Montreal's McGill University, one of
Canada's most prestigious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's partly the result of our increased recruiting effort in
about 20 US states, with heavy focus on New England,'' she said.
``But it also reflects that we offer high academic standards,
degrees that are internationally recognized, and a university
system similar to the American system. Plus, a price cheaper than
offered in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   History's first intercollegiate football game pitted McGill
against Harvard in 1874. Although the two schools no longer tussle
over the pigskin, Quebec's preeminent English-language university
enjoys an academic ranking in a league with some of the best US
private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to costs, McGill and other top-flight Canadian
schools are in another league altogether. And for American
students, that difference is becoming an important attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition, room, and board for an American undergraduate student
at McGill, whose 178-year-old campus is in the heart of one of
North America's most cosmopolitan cities, runs about $10,000 a year
in US dollars. That's twice as much as a Canadian pays, but still a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A year at Dartmouth College, by comparison, costs roughly
$29,500, while a year of undergraduate study at New York's Vassar,
including room and board, runs to $28,000. Tuition alone at the
average private university in the United States is $14,508.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman, who graduated last year from Phillips Exeter Academy,
nearly chose Vassar, and also considered Cornell University, before
finally deciding on McGill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really close, and I weighed it hard,'' said the
18-year-old first-year student. ``But in the end, McGill just
seemed to offer a little bit more of what I wanted in terms of
academics and social atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Canadian schools is inexpensive by American standards
because all universities are public institutions, with most costs
for education borne by taxpayers, not student fees or alumni gifts.
The best tuition bargains are for undergraduates since many
Canadian graduate programs _ especially in business, engineering,
and medicine _ charge fees close to those of American graduate
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs associated with higher education _ from books to
housing to a night out at the pub _ are these days a better deal
for Americans, as the value of the Canadian dollar has dropped to
historic lows against US currency.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with American students studying at institutions from
Nova Scotia to British Columbia show that their reasons for
choosing Canada vary hugely.
</P>
<P>
   Madeiros, 19, was drawn to Dalhousie because it boasts one of
North America's best bagpipe bands. ``Canada, with its strong Scots
traditions, is really the place to play with some world-class pipe
bands while working for that diploma,'' said Madeiros, who plays
side drum. ``My family loved the cheaper tuition. I loved the pipe
bands. So here I am in Nova Scotia.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dalhousie, tuition for an American undergraduate is roughly
$4,600 a year, with room and board running to about $3,600. Out of
a student body of 12,763, only 98 are from the United States, but
that still represents a 20 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern is emerging across Canada. About 3,000
Americans are studying at Canadian universities, a 10 percent
increase from the 1997-98 academic year. Despite the extraordinary
economic, cultural, and blood ties between the two countries, it is
only in the past few years that the United States has supplanted
Hong Kong and France as the country of origin for the largest
number of foreign students in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the numbers of Americans studying here remain small
compared with the 23,000 Canadians attending colleges and
universities in the United States. The lopsided flow of students
south is part of an overall ``brain drain'' that Canada is
increasingly anxious to redress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old reality that Canadians know America more than
Americans know Canada, and that makes it difficult for Canadian
schools to attract the best and brightest students from the
states,'' said Robert J. Giroux, president of the Ottawa-based
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. ``But there is
a new emphasis on recruiting American students.''
</P>
<P>
   The big selling points of Canadian schools, he said, are high
academic standards, a safe campus environment in a nation with a
much lower crime rate than the United States, and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for some American students, there is the attraction of
attending school in a foreign country _ without venturing too far
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted the experience of living in another culture,''
said Shane Lacharite, 22, of Shelburne, Vt., who graduated last
year from Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Quebec, and who has
studied in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly the draw was my French-Canadian roots. I wanted some
sense of the culture where my ancestors came from,'' he said. ``A
lot of Americans dismiss Canada as just a snowbound, boring version
of the US. But it's foreign enough to feel different, and I found
it more exciting than just going to another state.''
</P>
<P>
   American guidance counselors nonetheless raise a few red flags
about Canada. Classes tend to be larger than in the United States,
and the ratio of faculty to students is often lower, which they say
can result in a less personalized education.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most serious is the name-recognition problem. Some
American employers, counselors warn, will be unfamiliar with
Canadian universities, even those schools rated by commonly used
American college guides.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears to be a non-issue for major US companies, such
as Goldman Sachs or Microsoft, which actively recruit on Canadian
campuses. And employers in New England tend to be familiar at least
with those schools in the neighboring provinces of Quebec, New
Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers mostly seemed interested by the fact I had
international exposure,'' said Lacharite, who found a job in the
Vermont-based financial division of a multinational corporation.
``If anything, it seemed a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   One big impediment to study in Canada, especially for
cash-strapped students, is that Americans will find it virtually
impossible to secure part-time jobs because of tough Canadian work
permit laws. Quebec is especially intransigent, while the Maritime
Provinces suffer from such high levels of unemployment that there
are few jobs to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Government budget cuts in Canada have put an end to some student
subsidies, squeezing most of the nation's 89 universities and
forcing them to look south for new students as never before.
</P>
<P>
   McGill has teamed with two other top Canadian schools, Queen's
University and the University of Toronto, both in Ontario, to make
marketing tours at US high schools and college fairs in major US
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Others are trying a more direct approach. Ontario's University
of Guelph recently started recruiting American high schoolers with
mass mailings of a brochure showing a snow-caked college student:
``So you think you know Canada, eh? Well . . . think again.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Windsor, in Ontario adjacent to Detroit, has
taken out advertisments in Michigan newspapers: ``You can study
here and be home for supper.'' The school also just slashed tuition
rates for Americans in half, to $3,500 a year, making its costs
competitive with the average ``in-state'' tuition for US public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed ridiculous that at a university minutes away from
this huge US city, we had fewer than a dozen American students,'
said John Carrington, spokesman for the University of Windsor,
which hopes to eventually enroll 300 Americans. ``It benefits both
our societies to have a two-way flow of young minds.''

KENNEDY'S DEFT MANEUVER CHANGES THE IMPEACHMENT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- With a little space and time, it is now clear that
the last thing Senator Phil Gramm had in mind last week was to
dance with Senator Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Republican dropped his hanky, and Kennedy _ who
had been waiting for just such a moment, and who has spent 35 years
becoming the champ at recognizing the gesture _ scooped it up, and
the next thing Gramm knew the Austin-Boston axis of another time
was back for at least a critical day in 1999's impeachment winter.
</P>
<P>
   With that space and time, there is no question who is furious
(House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde and his allies) and
who isn't (everybody else), always a reliable clue to what has
really happened.
</P>
<P>
   And when impeachment goes public again later this week, the
country will be able to understand why Hyde is so angry, and why
what Kennedy helped the Senate do is so important.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gramm made his now-famous observation that on procedure
Republicans and Democrats were not as far apart as their most
zealous spokesmen made it seem, it was somewhere between likely and
probable that a case by the House would automatically proceed to
full trial in the Senate for the sole reason that the Impeachment
Party had the votes.
</P>
<P>
   It may still spiral out of control, but now those 55 Republican
votes will have to be cast after the country has seen the House
case for what it is, and after it has become clear that the demand
for ``witnesses'' is in fact code for a demand that the Senate
legitimize the hideous job the House did in assembling a case that
is a joke as well as being constitutionally contemptible.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, we thank Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the senator got up to follow Gramm last week, the
``trial'' was likely to be pro forma at its commencement _ a
summary statement by House managers and presidential lawyers, some
motions and arguments _ and then testimony without limit and
regardless of demonstrated value.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of that day, a major series of high hurdles was
in place that will make the proceeding far different than it
otherwise would have been.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason is that not counting legal arguments, the two
sides can talk about the case for and against perjury and
obstruction of justice for a grand total of 64 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 60,000-page record that Hyde and his henchmen
insisted last month was enough to justify removal from office, we
now get to see if two 24-hour presentations, pro and con, followed
by 16 hours of questions, can disclose any significant gaps in the
House's record.
</P>
<P>
   But much more than that, there are two large hurdles in front of
subjecting us to more torture, for whom we also have Kennedy
primarily to thank.
</P>
<P>
   The first requires a Senate vote on an actual list of witnesses
that Hyde and his henchmen plan to depose in advance of trial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of this Kennedy notion is that it keeps Hyde from
loading his list up with wild turkeys not relevant to the two
pending articles, any one of which could lead to the list's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kennedy's notion was so brilliant that Hyde's allies are
already plotting to welsh on their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The second requires additional votes, post-deposition, for each
witness the House managers propose actually calling to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be the equivalent of a pre-trial trial of the
House case, something far from guaranteed before last week's
surprise developments.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 hours, for example, there is time to go through all 10
of Monica Lewinsky's distinct and differing statement to the FBI,
prosecutors, and grand jury about the silly gifts issue, none of
which implicates President Clinton in an attempt to conceal them.
And there is time for Hyde to tell us what we would learn from an
11th statement.
</P>
<P>
   There is time also to hear what the Hyde henchmen believe White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal can possibly say to justify their
obsession with smearing him as the co-planner of a get-Monica
campaign with Clinton in the face of already explicit denials.
There is now time for manager Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to
diclose that his only ``evidence'' consists of two hyperbolic
newspaper columns and an anonymously sourced Associated Press
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   In short, thanks largely to Kennedy, there is time to let the
hot air gradually seep out of a balloon that doesn't belong in the
Senate. Fifty-five Republicans can keep it there only if they
ignore the putrid case that the rules now require the Hyde henchmen
to explain in detail.

<P>
   January through March may be dull months in many places, but not
in Boston. This is a time to feast on food, wine, jazz, and
cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
   To take in the activities, you'll need at least two days. While
we can highlight some of the events, the best way to take in all
the happenings is to obtain the ``Boston Overnight, Just for the
fun of it'' brochure from the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau: Call 888-SEE BOSTON or check out the events on the Web at
www.bostonusa.com. Out-of-towners who go to the Web can register
for a $99 American Airlines companion ticket to Boston, good with
another identical itinerary ticket costing at least $358 from
anywhere in the 48 continental states. Travel must be completed by
May 15.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 events are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the tastiest happenings is ``Boston Cooks,'' a
10-day festival that includes a kitchen and culinary expo at the
World Trade Center Jan. 15-17 (call 617-439-7700). Everything from
kitchen design to meeting celebrity chefs is on the menu. Also,
Jan. 19-21, the city holds a great dine-around at 35 Greater Boston
restaurants, all featuring top chefs from around the country. A
special treat will be at Le Meridien Boston, which will offer an
evening with Marc Haeberlin Jan. 18 and 19. Haeberlin has gained
international recognition as chef of the Guide Michelin three-star
restaurant, L'Auberge de L'ill, in Alsace. He'll be teamed with the
hotel's Julien's chef Alain Raye, the former chef/owner of three
one-star Michelin restaurants in France. The five- course meal with
wine is $95 a person; call 617-451-1900.
</P>
<P>
   Boston also has a foodline telephone restaurant guide: Call
617-588-MENU for Zagat reviews, menus, and more on area

Plaza, there's ``HomeFest: A Celebration of Dining, Design &AMP;
Decor'' Saturday afternoons (call 888-225-2008).
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the eighth annual Boston Wine Festival at the Boston
Harbor Hotel featuring outstanding wine tastings and the culinary
expertise of chef Daniel Bruce (call 800-752-7077). From Jan.
23-24, the eighth annual Boston Wine Expo takes place at the World
Trade Center where more than 400 wineries will be featured (call

the Arts, a celebration that includes pre-and post-performance
packages (call 800-332-3442).
</P>
<P>

there's a lavish chocolate bar (call 617-451-1900). And Saturdays
and Sundays, there's the Boston Chocolate Trolley Tour, a two-hour
tour for chocoholics, including tastings at the Meridien and other
sites (call 617-269-7150).
</P>
<P>
   On stage, there is great theater, including ``Victor, Victoria''
at the Colonial, `A Midsummer's Night Dream'' at the Huntington,
``Ragtime'' at the Colonial, ``Romeo et Juliette'' at the Shubert,
and ``The Wizard of Oz'' at the Wang. At Symphony Hall, the Boston
Symphony is performing, and in February will present Seiji Ozawa
conducting ``Madame Butterfly.'' The Regattabar Jazz Festival is
back at the Charles Hotel from February through May.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the Boston Overnight guide for a lot more happenings.
Why, there's even a James Bond festival on the big screen at the
Wang Center, and for cat lovers, ``Cats! Wild to Mild'' takes over
the Museum of Science Feb. 2 to May 2 (you'll be able to test your
skills against your feline friends).
</P>
<P>
   And finally, since Boston is known for its beans, the Back Bay
Hilton will offer the first annual Boston Baked Bean Challenge,
Feb. 15, when Bostonians can share their recipe with others (call
617-236-1100).

   In France, Nice is again offering a Carnaval package combining
all the attractions of this French Riviera city with the
festivities of Carnaval from Feb. 13-28. Hotel packages begin at
$260 a person and include five nights' accommodations, a daily
breakfast, parade tickets, entrance to the Verdure Theatre Carnaval
Show, a welcome gift, and taxes. Air fare is extra. For

   Carnival is especially popular in Germany, where it begins in
January and lasts several weeks through Ash Wednesday, signaling
the start of Lent. The last three days of Carnival are often
referred to as ``die Drei Trollen Tage'' (``Three Crazy Days'') and
are marked by parades, dancing, costumed street revelers, and
celebrations. A favorite saying in Germany is ``Anyone who is not a
fool at Carnival is foolish for the rest of the year.'' While
Dusseldorf, Mainz, and Cologne are the best-known Carnival sites,
traditional ones can also be found in the southern Germany area of
Baden-Wurttemberg. For celebration information, call the German
National Tourist Office in New York City at 212-661-7200, fax
212-661-7174, or on the Web, visit www. &QC;

   Arizona is rapidly becoming the center of ``astronomical
tourism,'' according to the December issue of Smithsonian magazine.
The reasons, according to author David DeVoss, are simple: The
elevation is high, the nights are dark, the weather is dry, and the
observatories and visitor centers are plentiful, if packed. And
amateur astronomers are making contributions to the stargazing
field. The comet Hale-Bopp was discovered by astronomer Alan Hale,
and Tom Bopp, a parts supply manager and part-time stargazer.
Astronomy, the article says, holds something for everyone. One
back-yard observer noted, ``The only mistake you can make is to not
take the lens cap off the telescope.''

<P>
   MARRAKECH, Morocco _ Each evening at dusk, three magical things
happen here.
</P>
<P>
   As the rays of the sinking sun strike the crenelated medieval
walls of the old city, the mud brick ramparts suddenly change color
from subdued ocher to rosy red. At the same time, the lights that
illuminate the minaret of the great Koutoubia mosque switch on and
the 210-foot-high tower hangs glowingly over Marrakech like a
guardian angel. And, as daylight dies, the Djemaa el-Fna _ the
fabled square where an eclectic mix of performers and entertainers
from snake handlers and sword swallowers to storytellers and dance
troupes competes for public favor _ begins to come exuberantly
alive.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moment like no other in a city that seems to occupy a
dimension all its own. A place where the fantastical world of
``Tales of the Arabian Nights'' and the workaday modern one
comfortably coexist.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on a fertile plain, Marrakech was founded almost 1,000
years ago at the intersection of two major caravan routes. From the
beginning, it has been both an oasis _ it is still surrounded by
groves of olive and palm trees _ and a marketplace. It also remains
a hospitable and cosmopolitan city welcoming travelers from the
Atlas Mountains, the Sahara, the Mahgreb, Equatorial Africa,
Western Europe, North America, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The major city of southern Morocco, Marrakech was also the
country's capital in the Middle Ages and again in the 16th and 17th
centuries. Some palaces and mosques survive to attest to past
imperial glories, but people, not buildings, are what really make
Marrakech so special.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more evident than in the Djemaa el-Fna, the soul
of the city and its chief attraction. Physically, it isn't much: a
large, dusty, irregular space rimmed by nondescript buildings. But,
when filled with people, it's hard to imagine a more vital or
vibrant place.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of drums and the rhythmic wailing of Arab singing
echoes and reechoes across the square. So, too, do the clapping,
exclamations of admiration, and roars of laughter from the knots of
spectators gathered around the performers. Acrobats create
alarmingly unstable human pyramids, storytellers relate exciting
(and often ribald) tales from the city's history, snake handlers
defy death, sinuous dancers sway hypnotically, and on and on. It's
a show that continues for hours every night with something
happening in every corner of the square just about all the time.
</P>
<P>
   There are open-air food stalls in the Djemaa el-Fna, too,
offering Moroccan cuisine at its most authentic. (Non-Moroccans
generally find it a bit too authentic and usually opt for indoor
restaurants.) Clouds of smoke rise from the outdoor kitchens, and
the air is scented with the smells of charcoal, grilled meat,
cooking vegetables, and all the pungent spices of North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists flock to the square, of course, with cameras at the
ready. Entertainers pose willingly and smile broadly _ provided
they're tipped. So also do the most colorful denizens of the
square: the watersellers, who are dressed in red, festooned with
copper drinking cups of different sizes, and, to attract attention,
wear broad-brimmed hats trimmed with small bells.
</P>
<P>
   The Djemaa el-Fna belongs to Moroccans, however, and foreign
visitors are vastly outnumbered. The variety in dress and physical
appearance to be seen in a typical Djemaa el-Fna crowd is
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Young women in the latest Paris fashions walk arm in arm with
veiled matrons completely covered from head to foot, only their
eyes exposed. Men in smart business suits stroll beside companions
wearing skull caps and ``djelabas,'' the ankle-length robes that
are the Moroccan national costume. There are tall blacks from the
southern Sahara, fair-haired Berbers from the High Atlas Mountains
to the east, and Arabs from the north of the country. All Moroccans
and all contributing to the savory stew of humanity that is the
Djemaa el-Fna.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Djemaa el-Fna is the Marrakech experience and not
to be missed. It can be a bit wearying, however, as any foreigner
is assumed to be rich and so is constantly importuned by beggars
and those who will let you take their picture _ for a fee. Also
common, although less so since a government crackdown, are
unlicensed guides who befriend unwary visitors and lead them deep
into the medina or old town and to high-priced shops where touts
get a commission on each customer they bring.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are several terrace restaurants on the Djemma
el-Fna, such as Cafe Argana, where you can take a hassle-free break
and enjoy a refreshing glass of mint tea (the most popular
pick-me-up in Muslim Morocco) while looking out on the Djemaa
el-Fna. These terraces are also the best places from which to take
overview photographs of the square, shots that include both the
frenetic populace below and the majestic Koutoubia tower looming
serenely above it all.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the square, at the heart of the old walled town, are the
souks, or markets. A labyrinth of covered streets, alleyways, and
courtyards, the souks date from the Middle Ages but offer
convenient one-stop shopping, just like a modern mall.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much that you can't buy in the souks. But the very
best deals are in Moroccan-made handicrafts such as leather goods,
woodcarving, jewelry, ceramics, and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling is the name of the game in the souks. Typically, a
merchant will start by asking an outrageous price, but if the
customer hangs tough _ threatening to walk out and go the store
across the street, for example _ will usually settle for a much
lower price, often a third or more less than the original one.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, each trade and craft was confined to its own souk.
This is no longer the case, but some streets are still dominated by
certain crafts. A famous one is the dyers market, where raw cloth
and yarn are dipped in vats of dye and hung up on poles and racks
to dry. The effect is colorful and eminently photographable.
</P>
<P>
   The souks look intimidating but are perfectly safe. They are
confusing, however. But, if you keep to the main streets, you'll
eventually emerge in the Djemaa el-Fna or one of the city's main
thoroughfares. One way to keep from getting lost in the medina _
day or night _ is to be on the lookout for glimpses of the
Koutoubia, the landmark of Marrakech.

   TAKE-BOS  
 MARRAKECH, Morocco: ... of Marrakech.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Built in the late 12th century by the Almohad sultans, who made
Marrakech the capital of Morocco, the Koutoubia is the cathedral
mosque of the city and regarded as one of the gems of Islamic
architecture. Beautifully proportioned, the Koutoubia minaret is
the tallest building in the city _ and by law always will be _ and
visible for miles around.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few exceptions, non-Muslims are not allowed into
mosques or Muslim shrines in Morocco. The Koutoubia, alas, is not
one of the exceptions, and can only be viewed from the outside.
However, it can be admired from many angles and is impressive from
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when France administered Morocco as a
``protectorate'' _ that is, as a colony in everything but name _ a
new town was built on the elegantly logical model of Paris just
outside the walls of the medina. With a Gallic appreciation of
perspective, the town planners laid out the new town so that all
the main avenues radiate from the Koutoubia and offer splendid
views of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Koutoubia is the acknowledged jewel in Marrakech's
architectural crown, but there are a number of notable nonreligious
buildings in the city that can be visited.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds gloomy, but one of the most beautiful spots in the
city is the Saadian Necropolis, the tombs of the sultans of the
Saadian dynasty, along with those of their wives and other family
members. Set in a lovely garden adjacent to a mosque and surrounded
by a high wall, the necropolis was established in the late 1500s.
During the French protectorate, a narrow passageway was cut through
to the main mausoleum so non-Muslims could visit the tombs without
going through the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women of the royal family, more than 60 in all, are
buried in separate buildings, their retainers outside in the
gardens. The mausoleum buildings are richly decorated in the ornate
style perfected in Andalusia, the Moorish kingdom that flourished
in southern Spain in the 14th and 15th centuries. The gilded
cedarwood ceilings are superbly carved to resemble stalactites, and
exquisite tiles cover the walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, it has traditionally been considered both in poor
taste and unwise to flaunt wealth. There are a number of palaces
and grand homes in the medina, but you usually can't tell it by
looking at them from the outside. The interiors, however, are
something else again.
</P>
<P>
   One such palace, built in the 19th century for a high court
official, is now the Museum of Moroccan Arts. The building is in
the classic Arab style with a central courtyard and cool,
high-ceilinged rooms. The former audience chamber on the second
floor is magnificently decorated with painted stucco and beautiful
tiles and has a superb cedarwood ceiling with stalactite carvings,
much like those in the Saadian tombs. The collection is splendid,
too, with galleries filled with hand-crafted jewelry, rugs,
pottery, woodcarving, and leather work from all over Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Also interesting to visit is La Bahia Palace, which was built
for a sultan's grand vizier and is still used by the Moroccan royal
family. It's an impressive and rambling structure with many rooms
and secluded gardens and courtyards. The rooms off one courtyard
were reserved for the vizier's four official wives, and the smaller
ones around another, for his far more numerous concubines. The
master of the house, however, had two sets of sleeping quarters _
one for nights and another for afternoon naps.
</P>
<P>
   A number of old palatial homes in the medina have been bought by
wealthy foreigners and restored, usually at considerable expense.
Several are now restaurants specializing in Moroccan haute cuisine.
Two elegant examples are Yacout on Rue Sidi Ahmed Soussi and Stylia
on Rue Ksour.
</P>
<P>
   Yacout occupies an 18th-century palace redesigned by American
architect Bill Willis. The result is an extraordinary blend of
classical Moroccan and high-fashion modern. The building has a
beautiful central courtyard with an illuminated pool and fountain
and a roof terrace with a marvelous view over the medina. The
restaurant seats about 100 people, but meals are served in various
small rooms around the courtyard, and the effect is almost that of
dining in a private home.
</P>
<P>
   Stylia is so deep into the maze of the old town that it can only
reached by foot. Diners are advised to have a taxi drop them off at
the top of a narrow street where a doorman in a ``djelaba'' waits
to guide them through twisting alleyways to the restaurant. The
tiled-walled dining room is a former audience chamber with a
splendid carved ceiling and a tinkling fountain in the center.
Musicians sitting cross-legged on cushions play and sing haunting
Arab music all through dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Although not very old by Marrakech standards, one of the city's
most beloved landmark buildings is La Mamounia, a hotel ranked
among the best in the world. A happy melange of Moorish and classic
Art Deco styles, La Mamounia was built in the 1920s but stands in a
magnificent 20-acre garden created in the 18th century by Sultan
Sidi Mohammed as a wedding present to his son Prince Moulay Mamoun;
hence the name.
</P>
<P>
   As in the sultan's day, an army of gardeners still tends the
flowers, shrubs, and ancient trees. The hotel lobby and public
rooms are filled daily with more than 1,000 fresh roses, and rose
petals float in the many pools and fountains. The hotel's Moroccan
restaurant is considered one of the best in the city. The
international restaurant, L'imperiale, replicates the exquisite Art
Deco decor of the first-class dining room of the famously luxurious
French ocean liner, the Normandie.
</P>
<P>
   La Mamounia was Winston Churchill's favorite hotel, and he
visited it almost annually for many years. An enthusiastic amateur
painter, he often set up his easel and painted in the garden. On
one memorable occasion during World War II, he and Franklin
Roosevelt even found time to admire the sunset from the hotel roof.
</P>
<P>
   To honor his memory, La Mamounia has a themed Churchill suite
furnished in English country-house style and displaying original
photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. Churchill's rolled
umbrella is in its stand, for instance, and his old hat hangs from
a hook. On an easel by a window overlooking the garden is a copy of
one his unfinished Marrakech paintings.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if it were still 1944 and at any moment the great man
could walk through the door. In time-defying Marrakech, that
somehow seems almost possible.

SHIFTING THE `CONN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was 125 years ago that Walter Bagehot explained clearly how
it was that central bankers at the Bank of England were able to
mitigate the frequency and severity of the financial crises that
periodically afflicted the country. Practical men since early in
the 17th century had evolved through trial and error various
techniques for stemming panic _ mostly by reaching into
government's pockets to prevent bankers suddenly caught short from
going broke. And it would be another 40 years before the United
States created a central bank of its own; until 1913, J.P. Morgan
would serve as the American lender of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market,''
the great editor of London's Economist magazine put the objective
of the central bank in a crisis about as clearly as it could be
stated: Lend freely, at a penalty rate, on good collateral, and in
that way maintain the solvency in a panic of otherwise stable
banks. A hundred years later, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor Charles P. Kindleberger set out to review the lesson, and
came to the same conclusion in his 1977 classic, ``Manias, Panics
and Crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, however, the scale and scope of the world
economy has changed _ as much as at any time since the 1840s, when
global capitalism was born. The rise of newly industrializing
nations of Asia; the demise of the Iron Curtain; the integration of
China, Latin America, and South Asia into the world trading system;
the consolidation of European currencies into a single new unit of
account: All serve to underscore a pair of facts. It is no longer
possible to conduct monetary policy at the national level. And a
crisis in any one part of the world probably will affect all
others.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise last week in New York when Stanley
Fischer, first deputy director of the International Monetary Fund,
broached a major proposal: turn the IMF into an officially
recognized international lender of last resort. ``While volatility
and contagion will always be with us, we can surely do better in
reducing the frequency and intensity of emerging market financial
crises, and the extent of contagion, than we have in the past five
years,'' he told a joint luncheon of the American Economic and
Finance Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows better than Fischer that the IMF served as banker
to countries facing crisis in the last few years. He joined the top
echelon of the fund in 1994 (after nearly 20 years as a leading
textbook author and professor at MIT) and immediately helped to
design the ``supplemental reserve facility'' with which it made big
loans to South Korea, Russia, and Brazil. When Fischer says that
``the role can be made more effective'' in a reformed international
financial system, he receives the close attention of world markets.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't say was that a certain portion of the world
central banking function already has been performed for many years
by Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland _ at
least at the level of referee and crisis coordinator. That splendid
antique, called into existence by the treaty that ended World War
I, long has served as emergency lender to central banks around the
world on the infrequent occasions that they they found themselves
in jams _ all the while enjoying its sleek obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   It will take five years or more to shift the ``conn'' from Basel
to Washington _ the naval term describes the moment when command of
a ship is said to change from one location to another. Bigger sums
will be required. Mechanisms must be designed. There will be much
political maneuvering among nations and within them.
</P>
<P>
   But with his call for an international lender of last resort
whose role is formally recognized by national governments and
financial markets, Fischer signaled the start of one of the great
undertakings of the 21st century.

EARNINGS PREVIEW FOR FOURTH REVEALS WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These aren't numbers to write home about.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will begin to issue their fourth-quarter financial
results in earnest this week and comparisons to the same period of
1997 are expected to reflect weak improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter earnings preview for Massachusetts' 100
largest companies, based on market value, shows that about 44
percent of those firms are expected to report lower profits or
steeper losses. The results are based on consensus brokerage
analyst forecasts tracked by First Call Corp., a Boston financial
data firm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 are
expected to report slightly higher quarterly profits compared to a
year ago, but several unusual items have spiked the forecasts and
have made them look unrealistically impressive, according to
Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings are closely followed because they, along with
interest rates, are considered the main engines of the stock
market. Though stock prices have continued to climb in the face of
mediocre earnings reports, it is not a trend that can extend
indefinitely. Earnings trends also have an obvious impact on
employment levels and other corporate spending.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hill expected fourth-quarter profits of S&AMP;P 500 companies
to improve by about 4 percent in the fourth quarter after a decline
of 3.1 percent the previous quarter, he said it is no sign of real
growth: ``People might jump on that and say earnings are getting
better. Untrue. We don't think it's indicative at all of an
earnings turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the special items spicing S&AMP;P 500 earnings: the deletion
of several weak-earning companies that were replaced with the likes
of America Online Inc. during the quarter. Hill also said the
General Motors strike hurt third-quarter earnings but gave an
exceptional boost to profits in the final three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Currency translation also worked in the favor of S&AMP;P 500
companies during the quarter. Not only were some exchange rates
more favorable, but also the year-ago comparisons now include
figures hurt by 1997 currency headaches and present a lower bar to
hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, four of the five largest public firms are
expected to report higher profits. Gillette Co. shares soared 6 1/2
to 52 3/8 Monday after the company confirmed forecasts of
fouth-quarter profits that will grow about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among other large local companies, Staples Inc., State Street
Corp., Allmerica Financial Corp., and Boston Scientific Corp. were
expected to report higher quarterly profits. BankBoston Corp. and
Analog Devices Inc. were forecast to post lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate profits yardstick doesn't usually apply to
Internet-related companies because most are considered developing
businesses. Local entries such as CMGI Inc. of Andover and Lycos
Inc. of Waltham certainly have followed that rule. Though both have
enjoyed soaring stock prices recently, they are expected to record
losses in fiscal quarters ending this month.
</P>
<P>
   And where do we go from here? Most stock market strategists and
researchers believe profits will remain under the gun for the first
six months of 1999. After that, forecasts get fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focal point continues to be the lack of profit momentum
that's taking place now,'' said Edward G. Riley, chief investment
officer at BankBoston Corp. ``We don't see anything to alter that
picture for the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill at First Call is equally pessimistic about the first half
of the year. He points to a series of expected events that should
increase the cost of labor, make it more difficult to raise prices,
and eventually cut into demand for products.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic problems are unlikely to improve in the short
term and could continue to affect developing economies in Asia,
South America, and elsewhere. Lower capital spending trends, tight
labor markets, and price pressure from around the world are making
earnings growth an uphill climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more bad (earnings) news to come,'' said Hill. ``But
the second half is a real question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rising stock values continue to jack up prices in
relation to expected corporate profits. Even using the more muted
earnings growth forecasts circulating among analysts, stocks in the
S&AMP;P 500 are trading at a very rich 27 times 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly advise caution here in terms of putting new
money in the market,'' Hill said.

W.R. GRACE TAKES ON `A CIVIL ACTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; `Grace cares.'' That phrase, uttered by chemical giant W.R.
Grace's lead attorney when he addressed a Boston jury in one of the
nation's most famous toxic dumping lawsuits, took more than 10
years for the company to live down.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of those words, spoken after Grace had spent years
disposing of solvents in a ditch behind its plant in Woburn,
enraged residents who believed the chemicals had contaminated town
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Vilified for its strident denials during the trial, the company
refused to talk about the case publicly, preferring instead to work
behind the scenes to clean the Woburn, Mass. site and make amends
with the community. Grace also began cleaning up polluted sites at
other US plants and instituted new company controls to help
minimize contamination from its operations. A decade after the
Woburn trial ended in 1986, the company believed it had come a long
way in reforming its image.
</P>
<P>
   But with the release of the movie ``A Civil Action,'' the Woburn
case _ and the negative publicity that went with it _ have come
back to life. And Grace is once again being forced to take the
offensive, hoping to avoid what corporate crisis managers called a
dreaded fate: an image indelibly defined by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk for 10 years,'' said Mark Stoler, Grace's
director of environment, health and safety, who said he is so
incensed by the film's portrayal of the company that ``I cannot
possibly comment about it objectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these circumstances, we felt like we had to stand up and
say something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's earliest stages, Grace officials tried to
influence the film's content by lobbying studio executives. Last
November, Grace launched an Internet Web site titled ``Be-
</P>
<P>
   yond a Civil Action: Woburn issues and answers.'' It contains
documents and studies Grace says support its contention that the
chemicals dumped at its Woburn plant could not have reached the
town's water supply. When the movie opened in Los Angeles and New
York last month, the company distributed press kits and dispatched
representatives to talk shows and newsrooms with the message that
Grace has reformed many of its practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we had made a lot of mistakes in handling the
community and the media and that it was best to go about our
business quietly,'' Stoler said. ``But with the film coming out, we
wanted to make sure that the Grace of today is not confused with
the Grace of 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace isn't the first to deal with the publicity nightmare a
popular film can bring. The Army was furious at director Ed Zwick's
1996 film ``Courage Under Fire,'' which portrayed friendly fire in
the Persion Gulf War and a resulting coverup. General Public
Utilities had to deal with the ``The China Syndrome,'' loosely
based on the nuclear accident at the company's Three Mile Island
power plant. And Exxon contended with a made-for-TV movie reliving
the environmental disaster caused when its tanker, the Exxon
Valdez, went aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Civil Action'' is unusual in that screenwriter and
director Steven Zaillian, who won an Academy Award for his
adaptation of ``Schindler's List,'' didn't alter the names of Grace
or Beatrice Foods, the other company named in the case, a common
Hollywood practice when bringing fact to film.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the seminal moments early in the movie,
personal-injury lawyer Jan Schlichtmann, played by Travolta, walks
pensively across a piece of ground littered with garbage and
industrial waste, wondering who should be sued for the poisoning of
Woburn's drinking water. Just then a freight train rolls by with
Grace's name emblazoned across the side of box cars.
</P>
<P>
   It was just that sort of scene juxtaposing the Grace name with
images of horrifying industrial pollution that company officials
most wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Robert Redford had bought the rights to
Jonathon Harr's best-selling book documenting the case, Grace began
to lobby executives at Touchstone Pictures, the Disney-owned studio
that produced the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure they understood that a lot has happened
since 1986, and that the book isn't necessarily the whole story,''
said Jane McGuiness, Grace's director of communication.
</P>
<P>
   The company asked to read the script and view the film early.
The studio denied the requests. In an effort to communicate more
effectively, Grace consulted ``people knowledgeable of the film
industry,'' McGuiness said, declining to elaborate. She said that
early on in the process the company also ``volunteered
information'' to studio executives, including studies by MIT and
the Environmental Protection Agency defending Grace's position that
it didn't pollute the wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never heard back from them,'' McGuiness said.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the company's efforts did not result in any
substantive changes in the movie, corporate consultants say Grace
had little choice but to mount an offensive. A movie starring John
Travolta and Robert Duvall has more power to shape public opinion
than the trial ever did, they say. In the first week after its
release, ``A Civil Action'' shot to number one at the box office
and took in an estimated $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A poor corporate image on the screen is nothing less than a
crisis, the consultants say, the flip side of the positive exposure
that companies seek by having their products ``placed'' in popular
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is Hollywood defining your image for you,
and under no circumstances do you want that,'' said Rowan Ford of
Rowan &AMP; Blewitt, a Washington crisis-management firm that counsels
corporate clients. ``It's like any other crisis a major corporation
might face. The trick is to redefine the image they're putting out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the movie's release not only has revived news stories
and TV footage that had been buried for more than a decade but left
Grace facing a more widespread publicity problem than it did during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, you have much more coverage, many
more angles, many more reporters, and much higher stakes,'' said
Karen Schwartzman, a former BankBoston spokeswoman who is now a
crisis manager at Fleischman-Hillard, a Boston public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Grace says it anticipated all this and has tried to stress its
more recent environmental record and the efforts it has made to
correct its past problems. The company acknowledges it was a
corporate polluter, though it continues to insist that chemicals
dumped at the Woburn site never reached the town's public wells G
and H. In the 1985 lawsuit, Grace paid $8 million to the eight
Woburn families who brought the suit, claiming chemicals in the
water caused serious illnesses, including leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are no set of circumstances where this
comes out to be a positive experience for us,'' said Stoler, the
company's environmental director. ``We're trying not to fight those
battles all over again, even though many people here feel very
strong that we should.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite Grace's belief that the movie unfairly
maligns its reputation, some say the company is overreacting.
``They're really almost an afterthought in the film,'' said Dan
Kennedy, The Boston Phoenix's media critic, who covered the trial
and the events leading up to it for the Woburn Daily Times
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Grace's McGuiness, with some understatement: ``It's
not every day your company is featured in a film.''

NOW WE CAN HEAR GLASS'S FULL SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The merging of music and technology has become a cornerstone of
Philip Glass's career. But 15 years ago, the two reached an
unhappy, and oddly ironic, impasse. The avant-garde composer had
written the score for Godfrey Reggio's 1983 film ``Koyaanisqatsi,''
a wordless meditation on technology's domination of Western
society. In preparation for the film's release, Glass was forced to
cut 30 minutes of the score so that it would fit on an LP, which
could hold only 25 minutes on each side. The album was released on
Nonesuch Records less than a year before compact discs usurped
vinyl as the popular medium. ``It was a big problem,'' Glass
recalls during a phone conversation from his home in New York City.
``The original album only had 42 minutes. But we thought it was
important to release it, and of course we didn't realize that CDs
were a year away.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass has at last rectified that problem with a new recording
for ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' produced by Kurt Munkacsi. Apart from some
sound effects and transitional cues, which were left out ``for the
sake of brevity'' according to Glass, the complete soundtrack has
been resurrected. In celebration of the new release, Philip Glass
and the Philip Glass Ensemble will perform live accompaniment to
screenings of ``Koyaanisqatsi'' in London, Belfast, New York, Los
Angeles, and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's a misconception that Glass dedicated seven years to
composing the score. ``No, no. I spent a lot of time thinking about
the music, but not actually writing it,'' Glass explains. ``We kept
running out of money.'' It was Reggio who _ long before independent
films became the bountiful lifeline of cinematic artistry they are
today _ spent seven years rounding up funds to chronicle the
dueling forces of the natural and man-made worlds. For Glass,
however, those uncertain years were anything but fruitless. ``I
knew what that film was about, and how to work with the images _
the images and the music became very organic. We had a lot of time
to experiment. When it came time to write, I knew exactly what I
wanted to write.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Koyaanisqatsi'' is a Hopi word that translates to ``life out
of balance.'' Interspersing magnificent panoramas of natural
splendor with barrages of dense, accelerating cityscapes, the film
surges with a visual pulse that flows _ flashing and simmering with
remarkable texture and motion _ through the American landscape. The
whole swarm of life is rendered with apocalyptic grace, using
slow-motion and time-lapse film techniques. But with no dialogue or
narrative structure, the film had to find its emotional undertow,
its ebb and flow of energy and ideas, in music. Glass's minimalist
vocabulary captures, with striking synergy, the majesty of
billowing clouds, the relentless buzz and hum of urban motion, and
the righteous chant of the filmmaker's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no story in the normal sense, but there is a whole
dramaturgical structure, a whole argument, made through the music
and images,'' says Glass. ``I had pages of text that Godfrey had
written, theories of civilization and technology. He had a very
complete idea, a whole point of view. It just never took the form
of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   For a composer who insists he has no theories about music, who
describes himself as a theater music composer who relies on
collaborative interaction for inspiration and subject matter for
direction, such a project presented a unique challenge. ``It's
amazing how specific the requirements for the music were,'' Glass
says, ``because there were no words. What is the right emotion for
a picture? Sometimes it goes against expectation; for instance, the
images that start with planes and end with bombs have lyrical,
beautiful music. The relationship is very complicated; it can be
near or far. And if you overstate it, it becomes cliched.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his wont, Glass allowed the collaborative spark, which
he's found with artists as diverse as Doris Lessing, Ravi Shankar,
Allen Ginsberg, and David Byrne, to guide him. ``That source of
inspiration is the most interesting, the most democratic,
quality,'' Glass states emphatically. ``Godfrey and I worked with
assemblages of images. I'd write music, then we'd cut images, then
write more music, then cut images. That we had the time _ that was
a blessing in disguise. This really was the classic independent
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Glass believes the film and the music,
which encapsulates the repetitive motifs and spare tonality that
have become his trademark, stand the test of time. ``It sounds very
good, very strong. I thought it might sound dated, but I was
impressed,'' Glass says, with characteristically unabashed
self-regard. ``The subject matter isn't dated, just the ties people
wear. I found Godfrey's premise a little too New Agey at the time,
but our views have become closer. He never talks about technology
as negative, but rather inescapable. It's even more true now. The
natural, organic world is not the world we live in, especially in
New York or Boston where you and I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical world Glass inhabits is, as usual, full to bursting.
Among his current projects are an international tour for ``Monsters
of Grace,'' a digitally animated opera with longtime collaborator
Robert Wilson; finishing a symphony for orchestra, choir,
children's choir, and five soloists to premiere Aug. 28 at the
Salzburg Festival in Austria; completing a short opera based on
``The Penal Colony'' by Franz Kafka; and finishing a piano concerto
for Dennis Russell Davies to commemorate the millennium. At 61,
Glass looks to the future with the same enthusiasm for creative
interaction that has defined a remarkable 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky,'' Glass reflects. ``I've worked hard, but
I've had a lot of help. Whether it's Twyla (Tharp) or Bob Wilson or
Michael Stipe _ talent shows up anywhere. You'll meet someone and
find it. It has nothing to do with what you expect. So I just
wander around.''

TAKING THE EARLY LEAD

<P>
   It didn't take Silver Charm long to go straight to the head of
the class. With the handicap ranks severely thinned by the
retirements of Skip Away, Awesome Again, Swain, Touch Gold, and
Coronado's Quest, the 5-year-old Silver Charm looked terrific
winning the $200,000 San Pasqual at Santa Anita Sunday. The year
has just begun, but it already appears that Silver Charm may be
able to dominate his foes and take a run at becoming the first
horse to earn $10 million in purses. Cigar, who made $9,999,815,
holds the record.
</P>
<P>
   Off at 3-10 ($2.60 to win), Silver Charm sat third, off a speed
duel between Crafty Friend and Dramatic Gold. Down the backstretch,
Silver Charm was 9 lengths behind the front-runners and rider Gary
Stevens was a bit concerned. But when Stevens asked Silver Charm to
go turning for home, the big gray took off and zipped right to the
front, winning by 1 1/4 lengths. Malek, who had been even farther
back in the five-horse field, closed well to be second, while
Crafty Friend held on for the show. The time for the mile and
one-16th was 1:41 3/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the leaders picked it up, I thought this might be Del Mar
all over again,'' said Stevens, referring to Silver Charm's only
poor effort, a last-place finish in the San Diego Handicap. ``But,
man, I mean he just inhaled those horses. This is actually as easy
as he has ever won a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm has now made $6,633,006 and sports a record of
19-11-7-0. Trainer Bob Baffert and owner Bob Lewis plan to run him
in the $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Jan. 31, the first race
of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's new series for
handicap horses, and then send him to Dubai to defend his
championship in the $4 million World Cup. Silver Charm's main
opponent in the Donn may be Sir Bear, and in Dubai the 4-year-old
Victory Gallop. Both are nice horses, but they're not Skip Away or
Awesome Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Silver Charm did was hopefully a sign of what he's going
to do the rest of the year,'' said Baffert. ``He's a great horse
and I just thank God he ended up in my barn.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Bear' roars back
</P>
<P>
   Sir Bear, a 6-year-old gelding, came to prominence last year
when he won the Broward Handicap at Gulfstream at 26-1, and he went
on to cap an outstanding season with a victory in the Grade I Cigar
Mile at Aqueduct. Sir Bear was back to defend his Broward crown
Saturday, but this time, he was sent away the 6-5 favorite, and he
did not disappoint his backers, scoring by three-quarters of a
length. Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Sir Bear survived a stretch battle
with Behrens to claim the victory in 1:43 3/5 for the mile and
one-16th. The veteran campaigner has run 40 times, with 14 wins,
nine seconds, and five thirds. ``He's come a long way since last
year,'' said trainer Ralph Ziadie. ``He keeps getting better with
age. He'll definitely make his next start in the Donn.'' . . . The
Groom Is Red, owned by Rick Pitino's Celtics Pride Stable, worked 5
furlongs in 1:00 2/5 at Gulfstream last Saturday. The Groom Is Red
won the Champagne Stakes at Belmont last year but was a
disappointing sixth in the Breeders' Cup. Trainer Nick Zito has yet
to say when The Groom Is Red will make his 1999 bow . . . Event of
the Year, the promising son of Seattle Slew, went 5 furlongs in
1:00 3/5 at Santa Anita Sunday in preparation for Saturday's San
Fernando Stakes. The 4-year-old suffered his first defeat when
third in the Malibu Dec. 26 following a long layoff, but he's ready
to show his best. ``He's had his race,'' said trainer Richard
Mandella. ``He ought to be real tough now.'' . . . Trainer D. Wayne
Lukas is back in the Kentucky Derby picture with a top 3-year-old
named Cape Canaveral. The royally bred son of Mr. Prospector, out
of the top race mare Seaside Attraction, ran his career mark to 2
for 2 with a wire-to-wire victory in the $100,000 San Miguel at
Santa Anita last Saturday. Off at 1-5, Cape Canaveral tallied by a
length under David Flores in the rapid time of 1:09 for 6 furlongs.
``For a maiden to run as hard as he did the first time (6 1/2
furlongs in 1:15) and come back in two  &UR; week &LR; s is a test,'' said
Lukas. ``I felt we had to get started. We have the luxury of
spacing his races now and I'm going to try to send him two turns.
Everybody always speculates on a Mr. Prospector if they run in
1:09. They think the horse is a sprinter. He's got great efficiency
of motion and he's got a good mind. I have to think that, if it's
in his gene pool, he'll be able to stretch out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new arrangement
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive five-year agreement between trainer Pat Byrne and
owner Frank Stronach lasted 13 months. When Stronach hired Byrne to
be his private trainer last December, it was big news in the racing
industry. Byrne gave up his public stable, which included Horse of
the Year and 2-year-old champion Favorite Trick and champion
2-year-old filly Countess Diana, to go to work for Stronach. The
pair did well, with Stronach's Awesome Again going 6 for 6 and
winning the $5.12 million Breeders' Cup Classsic, the world's
richest race. However, Stronach recently purchased Santa Anita for
$126 million and wants to concentrate his operation on the West
Coast, while Byrne wants to continue to train in the East. The two
had an amicable parting, announced Friday, and Stronach will leave
12-15 head with Byrne. However, they won't be the cream of
Stronach's stable. ``I'll go back to having a public stable,'' said
Byrne. ``Since Mr. Stronach bought Santa Anita, he told me he wants
his better horses on the West Coast, and I can't blame him. So I'm
looking at carrying 30 or 40 horses again. I want to stay on the
Kentucky-Florida circuit. I'll ship into Saratoga if I have horses
I think can compete.'' . . . Dave DeLisle of Bedford, N.H., is
spearheading an attempt to organize a New Hampshire breeders
program. A meeting will be held in the Belmont Room at Rockingham
Park Friday at 7 p.m. Interested parties can call 603-224-7021 or
603-623-9474 for more information. Since Rock conducts only 75 days
of racing, a state breeding program doesn't seem like a big deal.
But should the Salem, N.H., track be granted slot machines in order
to help fund education in the state, a breeders program could
become viable considering the big boost in purses that would follow
. . . The Ipswich Equine Adoption Network, which places
thoroughbreds with caring homes after their racing days are
finished, will honor Ron Dandy with its first annual Trainer of the
Year Award. Dandy, who has been the top conditioner at Suffolk six
times, will be feted in the winner's circle Jan. 30. Dandy, who
runs a big stable, has worked with the network since its inception
in 1994 . . . The special committee that selects breeders for
Eclipse Awards has announced that John Franks, John and Betty
Mabee, and Overbrook Farm are the three finalists. The winner will
be announced at the awards dinner Feb. 16 in Miami.

BILLICK KEEPS VIKINGS' OFFENSE MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Once a visitor from the East steps onto this
tundra (there may be tundra in Green Bay, but the tundra here is
the real deal), gives himself 24 hours or so to thaw out and is
able to glance around, eyes are opened widely at the intertesting
football bodies and football minds and football stories here.
</P>
<P>
   Start out at the top, as the Vikings organization was in true
ownership turmoil 11 months ago, internal fighting wracking the
franchise. Toss in coach Dennis Green trying to be an owner of the
team one moment, then not sure he was coaching the team the next;
yet, Green has put together a football machine whose purring engine
does not need antifreeze. Not even here, where wind chills of
minus-48 have been the norm on recent mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention quarterback Randall Cunningham, tossed onto
football's dust heap two years ago, booed out of Philadelphia, but
now the calm, cool, and perfect master of an offense unequaled in
the NFL, not even in Denver. Ah, but there is one other football
mind, hardly even noticed back in the provincial East.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Billick is his name and his job is offensive coordinator
of the Minnesota Vikings. Robert Smith, his running back, calls
Billick a mad scientist of football formations, and Smith is never
sure what will emerge from Billick's beakers when all the X's and
O's have been boiled down and combined as they seldom, if ever,
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Hoard, another of Billick's running backs, said it
wouldn't surprise him ``if we have the ball on the 1-foot line
sometime and we line up with an empty backfield, with no backs back
there. You never know what Brian will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Billick talk for more than a few moments and one
perception emerges: Billick is an offensive coordinator for the
fans, willing to try anything, and always with the goal that other
coaches mouth _ scoring points _ but often do not practice as they
run their obligatory first-down plays off tackle. Jimmy Johnson in
Miami comes to mind immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disappointment, a frustration when we don't score
every time we have the ball,'' said Billick, ``because we've set
the bar so high. When we get down inside the Red Zone, particularly
inside the 10-yard line, and we don't score a touchdown, there is
that frustration. That's because we expect to do that every time _
and that's a good expectation to have.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems fundamental. As Cunningham perceptively noted, ``You
notice that the four teams left _ Denver, the Jets, Atlanta, and us
_ all try to make things happen on offense.'' And Billick does more
than try.
</P>
<P>
   The key to his philosophy, said Billick ``is that you're always
looking for matchups,'' or, rather, mis-matchups. This also seems
fundamental, but Patriot fans know it doesn't always work out:
Recall the first Jets game in Foxboro Stadium, when journeyman
cornerback Otis Smith lined up opposite Terry Glenn and fans began
drooling in expectation, only to see nothing happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a rookie out there or someone not up to the level
of your player, then that is the matchup you're looking for,'' said
Billick.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's playoff victory over Arizona, rookie cornerback
Corey Chavous was Billick's designated target, as he let the other
corner, the superb Aeneas Williams, battle Minnesota's superb
receiver Randy Moss in private, Cunningham barely even looking
toward Moss for the entire first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly,'' said Billick, ``to go after a guy of Williams's
ability'' when there is rookie on the other side. ``You can't be
afraid to go after (Williams) but it's silly to seek him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings ran their first 15 plays out of 15 different
formations. One of those formations had former Alabama quarterback
Dave Palmer, now a scatback, take a direct snap from center as
Cunningam was lined up as a receiver far to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't something particularly exotic,'' said Billick.
``The only exotic thing about it is that we snapped the ball to
David, instead of handing it off to him, and the numbers were to
our advantage on that play (which gained 9 yards and a first down).
And the quarterback in the running game, quite frankly, is a wasted
number, so we just put (Cunningham) outside and let David Palmer
run up in there. It's just one more thing a defense has to think
about, maybe spend a little extra time in practice getting ready
for. That's one less moment they're not spending on something more
basic.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems fundamental, too _ giving the opposing defensive
coordinator much to ponder, but Billick truly practices it. As well
he should, since he has all the offensive tools needed, a deep
threat in Moss, sure receivers in Cris Carter and Jake Reed, a
nimble tight end in Andrew Glover, a strong-armed QB in Cunningham,
an excellent runner in Smith, and a good offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmer play, said Billick, ``makes people deal with it in
the next game.'' You just can't dismiss it and say, `Oh, they're
going to come out in this formation and do this or that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of all the varied formations the Vikings use.
Billick said they may look unusual, but ``we run a lot of the same
plays, only we run them out of different formations. The defense
can't just sit back and say they've seen this formation on film,
and we're going to run a certain play from it. Once again, it gives
them something to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick, to no one's surprise, is a hot name on the list of head
coaching candidates. He takes this in stride, too, because nothing
can match the uncertainty he felt just 11 months ago when no one
knew for sure who would own, or even coach, the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no ownership, I had no head coach, and another team
offered me a job at twice my salary,'' said Billick. ``Until
Denny's situation was cleared up, there was a lot of uncertainty.
Once I knew Denny was coming back, I was coming back. It was a moot
point then. I wasn't going anywhere as long as Denny was coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Billick is truly enjoying himself, as are Viking fans,
and all fans of football who love to see talent utilized to its
utmost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident,'' said Billick, ``that we can move the
football on anyone.''

PIERCE FINALLY GETS WHAT HE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were times, many times, when Paul Pierce
wondered. He would see his former teammates playing ball, having
fun, and he knew he could have been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the point. He had been there and done that. But he
had broken the mold at Kansas, leaving before his time, a junior
bypassing his senior year, something that Kansas guys just don't
do.
</P>
<P>
   And then, absolutely nothing good happened. He slid in the
draft, going from a projected No. 2 or No. 3 to No. 10, although
that slide is now being reworked as something good. Then there was
a lockout that went a lot longer than many thought it would. There
were no fans and no teammates and no money and no games and, well,
not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to happen the year I come out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He watched the Jayhawks play twice, once at their home opener
and again when they ventured west to Malibu to play Pepperdine. (He
will miss this weekend's game with UMass because he has to be in
Virginia for the annual rookie transition program.) He saw Kansas
and other college teams on television and kept seeing all the
things he missed. He couldn't help but think, did I do the right
thing, or was this the Jayhawk Jinx?
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I felt like I wasn't even in the NBA,'' he said.
``There were times watching my school play and, coming down to the
wire in January, thinking we weren't going to have a season, and I
was thinking maybe I should have stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting around, working out, playing pickup games. No
crowd, no fans. It was a little frustrating. I want to be out there
playing in front of a crowd, showing everyone what I can do. You'd
rather be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He toyed with the prospect of playing overseas as the NBA's
drop-dead date approached with no settlement in sight. It wasn't
what he wanted, but he saw Michael Olowokandi do it and ``after
that happened,'' he said, ``I thought about doing it, too.'' His
agent said there were offers from two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was over. One day he's checking the exchange rate on
Italian lira and the next day he's in New York City, getting kidded
by Dee Brown about what's in store, and in possession of a
guaranteed contract with the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to the last minute and you wondered if there
would be a season,'' he said. ``I'm glad it all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was one of seven Celtics to show up Monday at Brandeis
University in Waltham for the first day of ``voluntary'' workouts.
He got a quick intro to Pitino 101 with the maniacal Shaun Brown,
the strength and conditioning czar, running through several drills
as well as doing weight and treadmill work.
</P>
<P>
   As he met the media, Pierce coughed. A lot. ``I've got a little
burning in my chest,'' courtesy of his first day as a Celtic. He
knows it will be worse, much worse, next week.
</P>
<P>
   But he feels now that it was all worth it. He's long since
forgotten the unforeseen slide on draft night, when he slipped into
Pitino's welcoming hands. He may even have forgotten his first
workout for Pitino in California, days before the lockout, when he
went around the gym, shouting the names of players taken before
him, then making each shot. Pitino liked that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it now as a blessing in disguise,'' Pierce said. ``I
think God probably wanted me to be here. As I look at the top 10
teams, I think this is probably the best place for me. We've got a
young, up-and-coming squad. In the near future, we're going to be a
team to be reckoned with in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce stayed in California for most of the lockout, playing
pickup games at UCLA with, among others, Kenny Anderson. He worked
hard on his ball-handling, supposedly a shortcoming, although we
heard the same thing about Ron Mercer last year and he seemed to do
all right. Pierce also appeared in a few ``celebrity'' games.
</P>
<P>
   He looked lost Monday trying to find his way around Brandeis. He
had a friend with him and later, after the drills and weights, he
played in a shirts-and-skins game with his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There still was no crowd, or cheering, but this was a lot more
fun. Suddenly, those nights in Lawrence, Kan., seemed a long way
away and, maybe, not as good as what lies ahead.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: An old bully breaks into my
thoughts
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was half watching, half listening to a weekend
football game on TV, munching snacks while reading a book, when all
of a sudden, half hearing what I thought I heard on TV, I nearly
choked on a cheese ball.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have sworn the announcer said, ``And at halftime we'll be
visiting with J.D. Terry ...''
</P>
<P>
   My first inclination was to hide. My second inclination was to
run. Then I remembered I wasn't in elementary school anymore. Still
his memory had that effect on me.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Terry was the toughest kid I ever knew. As far as I know,
he never knew me, thank goodness. That's because I hid whenever I
saw him coming.
</P>
<P>
   My Cousin Bubba had his own defense mechanism that I much
admired.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba ran _ not in fear, but in fun.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba could outrun J.D., and I can still picture Bubba taunting
him, looking back over his shoulder and laughing at him, as Bubba
zig-zagged across the school grounds with J.D. stumbling after him,
puffing and cussing and grabbing at the air.
</P>
<P>
   It was some of the greatest broken-field running I've ever
witnessed. But Bubba was much inspired. If J.D. had caught him, he
likely would have broken his legs.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. already had a barrel chest in elementary school. Maybe he'd
been held back a grade or two. But while the rest of us were still
little shavers, he was already shaving, probably twice a day, and
coming to school with a pack of Camels in his shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. and I had this much in common. My grandmother was a nurse,
his grandmother was a nurse, and they were friends.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother was always asking me if I knew J.D. I was scared
to death that his grandmother might be asking him if he knew me. I
didn't want my cover blown.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. passed out of my life soon after grade school. Not long
into junior high, he quit school and joined the Marines. I can't
think of a more perfect pairing.
</P>
<P>
   I remember seeing J.D. only once after I was a teenager. I was
crossing a street, not looking where I was going, and caused an
oncoming car to screech to a stop to keep from hitting me.
</P>
<P>
   There behind the wheel sat J.D. Terry glaring at me, his barrel
chest all but busting the buttons on his Marine uniform. I froze,
the very picture of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   An eternity of a half-dozen seconds ticked by. Finally, J.D.
leaned out of the car window and growled, ``Are you going to move
out of the way or do I have to run over you?''
</P>
<P>
   I moved, faster than a speeding Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   Some years later, working as a kid reporter on my hometown
newspaper, I heard of J.D. one last time. The news came in the form
of an obit.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Terry had been shot dead in a bar in Houston. I was
assigned to do the story.
</P>
<P>
   J.D., the former Marine, had been working as a Texas prison
guard, not a bad pairing either. An ex-convict recognized him in
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston police spokesman I talked with on the phone said
that words had been exchanged between them immediately before the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Being a good reporter, I asked what the words were.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer repeated what he'd been told:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still think I'm a p----?'' the ex-con asked J.D.
</P>
<P>
   (I couldn't print that word then, and I can't print it now.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do,'' J.D. growled.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the ex-con pulled a .45 automatic and shot J.D. three
times in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   And J.D., dying as he did it, grabbed the pistol from his killer
and shot him to death.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Terry was the toughest guy I ever knew. I wish now I had
gotten to know him.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. It took me a minute to figure it out, but what the TV
announcer actually said was that at halftime we'd be visiting with
the network's team of game analysts, ``J.B. (not D), Terry, Howie
and Cris.''

INTERNET OFFERS NEW PATH TO HIGHER EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hundreds of students here are taking college
courses without leaving home and earning degrees from universities
they have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   It's called distance learning, and though it has been around for
years in the form of correspondence courses, the concept has
exploded with the advent of the Internet. Now the time and distance
once necessary for a four-year degree have vanished with the click
of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the rising influence of Internet education, Vice
President Al Gore is promoting retraining adult workers, and
distance learning plays a central role.
</P>
<P>
   Created simultaneously in the early 1970s, Empire State College
and Regents College were in the distance business long before it
was trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Albany was the cradle of distance learning,''
Regents College President Wayne Williams said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was simple: Give people who work and have families, or
who are retired and looking for fulfillment, the chance to earn a
degree on their own time.
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue with that? But the blitzkrieg pace of
technological change has many academics asking soul-searching
questions that go to the heart of what higher education is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by millions of dollars in private and federal funds,
distance learning has gone from academic oddity to an essential
component of modern learning. Few institutions in the nation do not
have at least a semblance of a distance-learning program.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Phoenix, the distance-learning powerhouse, has
branches in 11 states and is applying to open in more. Western
Governor's University in Salt Lake City recently opened as an
on-line cooperative between 25 universities in 17 Western states
and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a $2.8 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation of New York City helped create the Learning Network of
the State University of New York in 1995. The network currently
serves 2,300 students and offers 200 complete courses on line.
</P>
<P>
   The move came with some controversy, detailed in an April report
by SUNY's University Distance Learning Panel.
</P>
<P>
   There were turf issues: When a course is beamed over the
Internet, who owns it, the professor or the university? There were
money issues. Under the SUNY trustees' new budget process, funding
is intricately linked to enrollment. But if a Buffalo student takes
a course over the Web given by a New Paltz professor _ who gets
credit for the student? On the whole, the panel embraced distance
learning _ with reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the trustees are on to the idea that you can get
somebody who's a great scholar in Shakespeare and beam the class
all over the state,'' said SUNY Faculty Senate President Vincent
Aceto, who served on the panel. ``To me, that's a prostitution of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams of Regents College, the key to distance learning is
``access,'' getting education to those who need it _ whether it's a
submarine captain under a polar ice cap or a blue-collar worker
threatened by corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain jobs use pieces of paper _ degrees _ as proof of
competency,'' Williams said. ``There are people who have been doing
work for most of their adult lives, but their jobs are threatened
because some kid 20 years their junior has a piece of paper they
don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regents College is unique even among distance-learning
institutions. It has no courses or faculty of its own. Rather, it
offers a series of nationally recognized exams in order to credit
students for life experience. If further schooling is necessary,
the sky _ or at least the map of the United States _ is the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hoffman, 33, of Albany is currently taking a psychology
course at home from Indiana University. It's part of the Grow Your
Own program sponsored by Regents and the College of Saint Rose, a
four-year school in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Through two jobs and a maternity leave, Hoffman has been
studying to be a teacher since 1989. She said the program was her
only chance of advancement without quitting her job as a teacher's
aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could do it full time,'' she said recently. ``Going
to a four-year college would certainly be quicker. But this is much
more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the critics of Internet education are led by David
Noble, who has written three papers on what he calls ``Digital
Diploma Mills.'' Ironically, much of the discussion is occurring in
Internet chat rooms and faculty electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   At York University in Toronto, Noble helped lead a 55-day
faculty strike that won professors a unique provision in their
contract: None can be forced to use technology in classrooms or
deliver courses over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the spread of distance education is undermining the
one-on-one interchanges that have inspired students for centuries.
He cited the best-selling success of ``Tuesdays with Morrie,'' a
book about a writer's conversations with his professor, as proof
that people still long for such educational relationships in the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get that on line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some accuse Noble of being sentimental for a kind of higher
education that no longer exists. Isn't this, after all, a time of
cattle-call lectures, where class sizes can grow larger than the
population of a small town?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not education, either,'' Noble said. ``The temptation
is to say, `Let's replace it with the panacea of distance
learning.' I say, `Let's hire and pay for more teachers.'''

MIGRAINE SUFFERERS SEE HOPE IN NEW TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barbara Conboy initially thought she had sinus
trouble or maybe even a brain tumor. When doctors told her about
migraines, she had no idea that headaches could hurt so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get them, I just feel like there's a knife in my
head and they go forever, usually three days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight or so years since her first migraine, Conboy, now
41, has tried everything: over-the-counter remedies, ice packs and
diet changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would help,'' said Conboy, a graphic artist who lives
in Niskayuna, N.Y. ``They were bad enough that I'd feel horrible
but not so bad I had to stay out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Conboy's most recent migraine struck Christmas Eve. This time,
instead of retreating into a dark room, she took sumatriptan, also
known as Imitrex, which is produced by GlaxoWellcome of Britain. It
is one of a newer classes of drugs helping to revolutionize the way
millions of migraine sufferers approach their problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more people are asking to be treated,'' said Dr. Mark P.
Detinger, a professor of neurology at Albany Medical College. ``In
the past, two out of three people with migraines didn't seek
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many people opted to live with what can often be
debilitating pain. Migraines are just one class of severe headaches
estimated to affect 23 million Americans. Women experience them at
least three times more often than men, perhaps because of hormonal
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Although migraines are as individual as the people they strike,
there are some common symptoms. According to the National Headache
Foundation in Chicago, often they begin as a dull ache that
develops into a constant, throbbing and pulsating pain at the
temples or on one side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   While most people experience vision problems during migraine,
some may experience a neurological symptom five to 35 minutes
before the actual onset of the headache, a condition known as
migraine with aura.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Goodwin-DiPietro, a registered nurse outside Albany who
has never been able to figure out why she gets migraines. But she
always knows when one is about to strike because her vision becomes
wavy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a television with a bad picture, and you'll have some
idea of what happens. Other people may see dots or flashing lights,
or develop temporary blindness in one eye. ``For me a lot of the
visual neural effects are harder to deal with than the headache
itself,'' said Goodwin-DiPietro, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Migraine is derived from the Greek hemikrania, which means half
of the head. And for some 70 percent of sufferers, the headache
strikes only the side of the head. Most migraines last at least
four hours, although very severe ones may last a week.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have yet to pinpoint the exact cause of migraines.
But they do know the headaches are symptomatic of biochemical
changes in the brain, related to blood flow and the
neurotransmitter known as serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   The newer drugs, known as triptan medications, halt some
migraines by apparently working on receptors in the brain that are
sensitive to serotonin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people can figure out what triggers their migraine,
including stress, nitrites in some processed foods, caffeine and
weather changes. Yes, weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for sure but it may be related to changes in the
atmospheric pressure,'' said Dr. Arthur Elkind, director of the
Elkind Headache Center outside of New York City and vice president
of the National Headache Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin-DiPietro is reluctant to take the newest drugs because
of potential side effects, including tingling or discomfort in the
chest. Instead, Goodwin-DiPietro relies on herbal remedies. Daily,
she takes ``feverfew,'' a supplement derived from a bushy plant
that's been used for decades to ward off migraines. She believes it
has helped cut down the frequency of her attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other research suggests that riboflavin and magnesium
supplements may also be helpful in preventing migraines.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists, however, advise that migraine sufferers talk to
their doctors about alternative remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of nonsense out there, especially when you're
dealing with a problem that's so common,'' Elkind said.
</P>
<P>
   For Conboy, the latest advance in treating migraines with
triptan medications has helped restore her peace of mind. ``For a
long time, I think there weren't any good treatments,'' she said.
``It's given me back my life.''

BAPTIST CHURCHES CLOAKING IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The designation ``Baptist'' is being removed
from some church names because it scares away potential members,
leaders of an innovative ministry workshop contended at the Texas
Baptist Evangelism Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people mistakenly associate the Baptist name with an
angry, judgmental kind of fundamentalism,'' said the Rev. Roddy
Clyde, leader of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 Texas Baptists attended the conference, which
continued through Tuesday night at the Fort Worth Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Most Southern Baptist churches proudly bear the name
``Baptist,'' but many nontraditional churches in Texas and across
the nation are removing the denomination's name to help attract
younger members and people who have not been churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, speakers included internationally known
evangelist Luis Palau and the Rev. Ed Young Jr., pastor of The
Fellowship Church in Grapevine, a fast-growing Southern Baptist
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed to be a Baptist, but a brand name can be a
hindrance,'' Clyde said. The senior pastor at Fellowship of Forest
Creek in Round Rock, near Austin, Clyde said his church has grown
rapidly since changing its name last year from Trinity Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dan Southerland of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a featured
speaker at the innovative ministries workshop, said the name
``Baptist'' does not convey a positive meaning to people in south
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They associate it with fire and brimstone,'' said Southerland,
senior pastor of the Flamingo Road Church in Fort Lauderdale.
Leaders there removed ``Baptist'' from the church's name three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend toward excising denominational affiliations from
church names is more complex than just an effort to address
hostility toward the Baptist name, said Ebby Smith, professor of
Christian ethics and missions at Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Churches of many denominations tend to leave out the
denominational name because it sometimes puts off baby boomers and
younger people who do not want to be labeled as a member of any
denomination, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they are just turned off by Baptists; they are
turned off by all denominations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Churches are not being tricky by leaving the word Baptist out of
their name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a technique to get a hearing,'' he said. ``Once they
are in church, they find out it is Baptist. Most of these churches
are closely tied with Baptist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde's congregation, which omits the Baptist name, is part of a
new wave of churches that have broken away from the old pulpit
preaching style of worship. Some often feature dramatic
presentations and have full bands that play contemporary Christian
music geared to a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dress code has changed to a more casual style,'' he said.
``I preach in my golf clothes. Some people think all Baptist
preachers have to wear a dark suit and a red tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the changes were begun in 1992, the average worship
attendance at Fellowship of Forest Creek has grown from 65 to 650,
Clyde said. His church had been averaging 140 new members a year,
but after taking ``Baptist'' out of the name early last year, the
annual growth increased to 240 members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde said he believes that infighting between conservatives and
moderates in the Southern Baptist Convention has also hurt the
Baptist name in the eyes of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some think we Baptists are more concerned with the power
struggle in our denomination than we are in helping people,'' Clyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Southwestern faculty member, Robert DeVargas, said he
doesn't believe that the denomination controversy has much to do
with churches leaving out the Baptist name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening in many denominations,'' said DeVargas, an
assistant professor of communication arts and foundations of
education. ``It's just a way of catering to young people who want
some kind of spirituality in their life, but they don't want to be
labeled Baptist, Methodist or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several churches in the Fort Worth area have adopted the new
style of church worship with successful results. The NorthWood
Church for the Communities in Keller, led by the Rev. Bob Roberts,
and the Celebration Baptist Church in east Fort Worth, led by the
Rev. James Reeves, are two examples.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who led one of the workshops on Monday, said his
congregation has grown from 150 members to almost 1,000. The church
still includes ``Baptist'' in its official name, but a huge banner
displayed outside the building merely proclaims ``Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play up our Baptist name,'' he said. ``One of my
members told me the other day that if he had known we were a
Baptist church, he would not have joined.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptist leaders are not disturbed by churches that remove the
denomination's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need all kinds of churches,'' said the Rev. H. Bailey
Stone, director of the evangelism division of the Baptist General
Convention of Texas, a leader of a Texas 2000 effort to reach all
of the state's approximately 10 million people who claim no
allegiance to a church.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the Baptist name itself can also attract people to a
church because they associate it with sincere, Bible-believing
Christians.

BORDER PATROL GETS NEW FLEET OF HELICOPTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The U.S. Border Patrol is flexing its muscle by
replacing battle-weary, Vietnam-era helicopters with nine quiet,
fast and pricey choppers outfitted to see through the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (helicopter) would be almost overhead and pass you before
you'd hear it or see it,'' said James King, head of air operations
for the patrol's McAllen sector in South Texas. He described it as
``a new helicopter with new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the helicopters, manufactured by the Boeing Co., have
been deployed along the U.S.-Mexico border. That includes three in
San Diego, three in the Rio Grande Valley and the three around
Laredo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the $1.3 million MD600N helicopters seats eight people
and will be outfitted with infrared cameras that sense body heat to
help agents hunt drug smugglers and undocumented immigrants. The
patrol's workhorse of the sky has long been the noisy OH-6, a
two-seater that looks like a fishbowl on skids and was popular as
an Army scout helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The pointy-nosed MD600N has heating and air conditioning and
weighs almost twice as much as the OH-6. According to Boeing, the
helicopters perform especially well in hot climates and at high
altitudes.

how many stores they shop in, will always find the same high prices
for most of the company's styles. Regardless of whether the pricing
practices are legal, the details that the three store owners have
discovered offer a rare glimpse into just how far some retailers
and department stores will go to keep shoppers from finding better
prices elsewhere. By Melody Peterson.
</P>

HALLELUJAH DIET PARES FOOD TO BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND VILLAGE, Texas _ For many, the Bible offers a place to
seek comfort, understanding and spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee Holtzman, it also offers a menu for a healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that is put together has a manual,'' Holtzman said.
``Your car has a manual. Our bodies came with a manual, and that is
the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the Bible as a blueprint for good nutrition, Holtzman has
started the Pristine Health Ministry, which he said is a biblical
approach to food and good health.
</P>
<P>
   The principles of his approach come from a diet developed by
Hallelujah Acres, a Shelby, N.C., ministry that requires adherents
to steer clear of meat and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   On the second Tuesday of every month, Holtzman offers a two-hour
seminar at the Highland Village Police Department in Highland
Village, a community in southern Denton County north of Dallas-Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is explain to the Christian and
non-Christian world that you have to separate the spiritual from
the physical when it comes to healing and understand that God gave
us the ability to heal ourselves, but we have to give ourselves the
proper building blocks to do that,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hallelujah diet _ though perhaps extreme in its aversion to
meat _ presents an important approach for Christians who may be
used to leaning entirely on faith for healing ailments, said
Patrick Quillin, a nutritionist and author of ``Healing Secrets
From the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians _ and others _ are called on to be responsible for
their bodies, he said. One need look no further than the Bible to
see that God also presented guidelines for good nutrition _ and
they don't include the deep-fryer or the Twinkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't eat food the way God intended it, and when we get
sick we look to the heavens and say, `God, why did you do this to
me?''' Quillin said.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of the Hallelujah diet can be found in the book of
Genesis:
</P>
<P>
   ``And God said, `Behold, I have given you every plant yielding
seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree with
seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Holtzman, this passage is a call for humans to stay away
from meat and to rely on fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go back to that and eat fruits and vegetables, everyone
would become a lot healthier,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the typical food choices Americans make _ which
Holtzman calls S.A.D., the Standard American Diet _ the Hallelujah
diet advises people to avoid processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Hallelujah diet requires that people eat 85
percent of their food raw and 15 percent cooked, and to add barley
powder as a nutritional supplement. In addition, Holtzman tells
people to stay away from dairy products and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman is convinced that following such a diet will decrease
risks for many major diseases and even minor afflictions, such as
the common cold, acne and diaper rash _ although he adds the caveat
that the diet is not a prescription for curing any disease. It
simply leads to a healthier body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is a lifestyle,'' said Chris Huskey, a customer
service representative for Hallelujah Acres. ``... If you put the
right different properties into your body, you will feel better and
God will bless you with better health.''
</P>
<P>
   Quillin describes his approach as an attempt to fuse modern
medicine with the ``obvious ability of God's pharmacy to heal us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Quillin, that means eating the food that God created in its
most natural state possible and to stay away from the chips. By
following these basics, people have a better chance for good
health, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding that the solutions to these very complex
diseases are simple, and they are found in ancient wisdom, and
there is no more ancient or wise book than the Bible,'' Quillin
said.

hit by Hurricane Mitch. Since Dec. 1, more than 2,800 Central
American detainees have been released _ most from Texas detention
centers _ including four Guatemalans and Hondurans who now share a

RETIRING CHIEF SEES NEED FOR NEW BLOOD AT STRUGGLING LEVI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Peter Jacobi announced his intention to
retire as president and chief operating officer of Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., he insisted his replacement come from outside the ranks of the
San Francisco jeans maker.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, 54, said Monday he would retire after two years as
president, saying Levi needs fresh blood to lead a battle for the
competitive youth market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about real change, you need different
perspectives. The best thing we could do for the company is to
bring in some new leadership and challenge the old ways of
working,'' Jacobi said.
</P>
<P>
   The company admits those old ways have cost the manufacturer a
fair chunk of the marketplace, primarily among 15- to 24-year-olds.
In recent years, this segment has steered away from Levi's classic
styles, favoring instead baggy styles and other designer labels.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly bullet-proof company saw its sales drop from a
high of $7.1 billion in 1996 to $6.9 billion in 1997 and it
responded with a round of painful cost-cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company cut 1,000 jobs and last year slashed 6,400
jobs, or a third of its U.S. workforce, by closing 11 of its 27
domestic manufacturing plants. From Dec. 1 through Jan. 31, Levi
has halted production of its five-pocket jeans at seven plants,
affecting more than 4,000 workers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Levi had to make the tough cuts to curb such problems as excess
manufacturing, bloated overhead and underperforming segments of the
business, Jacobi said. ``We got sleepy because we were so
successful and lost touch with a changing marketplace,'' he said.
``The brand aged and the market changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi said the results of those efforts may not be seen for
several months after his departure, but he believes the company is
moving in the right direction. He said he was most proud of the
changes he made recently, including creating three new positions
heading brand development and plucking Bill Chiasson from Kraft
Foods to be the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense the company is kind of moving and grooving a
bit,'' he said. ``We're starting to see the results of this new
leadership and new aggressiveness in challenging the structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Haas, the company's chairman and chief executive, said
in a statement that he accepted Jacobi's resignation with
reluctance. ``His accomplishments have made an indelible mark on
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi has agreed to stay on with the company until a
replacement is selected. He said it was too early to speculate on
possible successors, but he expects the company will look for
candidates with a strong marketing background, not necessarily in
the apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi joined Levi Strauss in 1970 as a production assistant.
Prior to his selection as president and chief operating officer in
1996, Jacobi held a series of executive positions, including head
of Levi Strauss Europe and president of the company's international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel industry analysts applauded Jacobi's ability to
recognize that the company needs someone new to challenge Levi's
way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm breathing a sigh of relief. It's forcing certain issues,''
said Harry Bernard, partner and chief marketing officer of Colton
Bernard Inc., a San Francisco marketing firm. ``They're going to
have to bring a whole new point of view with a fresh perspective
into the company. I think Pete recognizes that. His stepping down
is good for him, good for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard said his relief was no reflection on Jacobi's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe took off like a big bird under his stewardship. But
he's had his time and he doesn't have to fight the new battle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new challenge will be increasing sales. Helen Bulwik of
Andersen Consulting said leadership from the outside would be best
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question his contribution to the company has been
significant, but it is a company in crisis,'' she said. ``They
cannot cut any more expenses. They have cut as deeply as they can.
They must now focus on growing their revenue base.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levi has suffered from a recent series of missteps in an attempt
to update its image.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of ``hard jeans'' has been disappointing and some of
its advertising campaigns have fallen flat. For example, its new
``What's True'' television spots, which feature urban teen-agers
talking about conformity and prejudice, have met with mixed
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Bulwik said Levi also needed to improve its relations with its
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to buy a pair of Levi jeans today, you have to hunt
for it,'' she noted, saying distribution is too limited.
</P>
<P>
   Levi is hoping to refresh its image with a series of new
products including ``Original Spin,'' custom-fit jeans aimed at
young people. In March, the company will launch a '70s-inspired
line of jeans, tops and jackets as a tie-in with the debut of ``The
Mod Squad' movie starring Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   Also in March, Levi will release Dockers K-1 Cramerton Cloth
pants, a line of khakis cut from 1932 twill made by Cramerton, the
company that produced khakis for the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest apparel manufacturer, Levi owns the Dockers
and Slates brands and employs about 30,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, a native of San Francisco with two children in college
and one in high school, said he was not sure what his next step
would be. He said he would consider working with a smaller company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to retire to the golf course,'' he said.

FUNGUS CAN DO CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO LAWNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Would you please explain take-all patch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Take-all patch is a fungus that can do considerable damage to
lawns. Take-all is seemingly most active fall-spring when there are
abundant rains and the temperatures are on the moderate side. Yet
symptoms may be most obvious in spring and summer when lawns are
under the stress of higher temperatures and drier conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The first symptom of the disease is yellowing grass blades.
These leaves then die. A circular or irregular-shaped area of
discolored and dying leaves may spread to several feet across.
Grass will thin within this area as all plant parts become infected
and decline. The stolons may be discolored, and the roots may be
brown or black and so rotted the stolons can be pulled up easily.
Regrowth is slow, or there may be no regrowth.
</P>
<P>
   Take-all survives on infested thatch and on infected living
plant parts. Do not allow thatch to accumulate in the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   This disease is not easily controlled, but good culture is
always the first means of attack. Good drainage is important. Avoid
overwatering. Water infrequently but deeply so that moisture seeps
at least 6 inches down.
</P>
<P>
   Aerate the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disease agent cannot thrive in acid soils, use an
acidifying nitrogen fertilizer and elemental sulfur. Apply
fungicides in the fall for preventative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Due to home remodeling, I need to transplant some 6-year-old,
5-foot-tall sago palms; a 4 1/2-year-old, 8-foot-tall magnolia; and
2-year-old, 3-foot red tip photinias. I would like some advice on
how to do this.
</P>
<P>
   A: The dormant season is the best time to move these plants.
Since the red tips are younger and smaller, they may prove easiest
to move. Sagos often can survive rough transplanting. Woody shrubs
or trees that have been planted more than four or five years can be
difficult to move successfully.
</P>
<P>
   If you need to move the red tips and magnolia soon, carry a
large soil ball and a generous amount of each root system. Dig
around and under each shrub and the tree. Wiggle a large piece of
heavy material, such as burlap, under the soil ball, then wrap the
ball with the material to help minimize damage as you move it to
another spot in the garden. A little root stimulator won't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   If you will not be transplanting immediately, you might
root-prune to ease the shock of transplanting. This will be
especially helpful in moving the magnolia. Ideally, the magnolia
should be root-pruned in the spring, then moved in winter.
</P>
<P>
   To root prune: Use a sharpshooter (sharp spade) to cut around
each plant. Make the circular cut about 2 feet away from the trunk
and at a depth of about 8 inches. Then move the shrubs in several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal time to move mature sagos is July-October, according
to Horticultural Consultants, a local wholesale nursery that
specializes in palms, cycads and bamboos. You just may get away
with transplanting now, but moving a sago while the plant is
putting on new leaves or producing cones is not advisable.
</P>
<P>
   A mature sago can have a large, tuberous root system, and it is
difficult to remove this without damage; however, the plants can
recover. Remove as much of the tuber as possible. The more damage
to the roots and tuber, the longer the recuperation period. Remove
some leaves to reduce transpiration while the plant is
reestablishing in its new spot. Make sure you replant in a
well-draining soil. Plant at the same depth as the original
location. Keep the soil moist, but don't overwater.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm sure I'm not the only one that needs help. I have two
poinsettias. A friend says she plants hers in her garden. Do they
need special care? Another friends says she repots them. What care
do these need?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can nurture poinsettias through the months ahead for a
repeat performance next season. Follow these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Maintain your plants as you would most potted plants: Water and
apply a balanced fertilizer. When the plant has dropped its leaves
in spring, repot and prune the plant back to 6 to 8 inches to
achieve a full, rounded canopy. New growth will appear. Pinch to
maintain a bushy appearance. Keep the plant outdoors in a sunny
spot during the summer. Water well while it grows, and fertilize
regularly with a balanced formula.
</P>
<P>
   To trigger the coloring process, begin a light-dark rotation in
October. Bring the plant indoors each afternoon and keep it in a
completely dark spot for 14 to 15 hours. Take it back outside each
morning.
</P>
<P>
   A night temperature of 65 degrees is optimum; much below that
will delay the coloring process. Day temperature is not as
critical, but try to avoid temperatures higher than 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible to grow the poinsettia outdoors if it is
protected. The safest spot is often the south side of the house in
sunny warmth. A fertile, well-draining soil will ensure best
growth. Due to the mild winter last year, our neighbor's poinsettia
nearly reached the eave of her one-story house. It came into color
around the holidays, but suffered some tip burn when the
temperature dropped below 32 degrees.

NEW TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a powerful and respected
politician, is passing the torch to Rick Perry, who will become the
first Republican lieutenant governor to lead the Texas Senate since
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can fill Bob Bullock's shoes. They're unfillable. He is
a legend,'' Perry said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The halfback that fills (Heisman trophy winner) Ricky
Williams' spot on the University of Texas football team next year
will get compared to Ricky Williams,'' he said. ``I don't envy that
young man,'' said Perry, who will be sworn in to replace Bullock on
Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself somewhat in that same unenviable position
following a person like Bob Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Texas Senate, the lieutenant governor makes
committee assignments and controls the flow of legislation,
deciding which bills go before the full chamber for a vote. Perry,
the former Texas agriculture commissioner, won a hard-fought
campaign against Democrat John Sharp, the former state comptroller,
to succeed Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Perry had the support of Republican Gov. George W. Bush in the
November election. Though mud was slung between the two candidates,
Perry, a former Democrat himself, pledged a bipartisan approach in
the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim 16-15 majority. In the
House, Democrats have a 78-72 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is over,'' Perry said. ``The time for policy was
from November 4 on. We're focused on working in a bipartisan, fair
way and doing what's best for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he would focus on education in this legislative
session. His priorities include ending social promotions, the
practice of passing failing students. He also supports Bush
proposals to use part of the estimated $5.6 billion budget surplus
to cut school property taxes and some sales and business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One of his chief responsibilities as lieutenant governor will be
appointing committee members and leaders. He has been meeting with
senators about their aspirations, and he plans to announce
committee assignments shortly after his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perry's actions will be watched under the political
microscope, Republicans and Democrats seem to be taking a
wait-and-see, give-him-a-chance attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Perry has to be given the opportunity to lead,'' said
Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio. But Madla, like many others,
doesn't expect dramatic changes in a chamber where cooperation is
necessary, given the slim Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very, very surprised if you saw major changes in
the Senate,'' Madla said, adding that the body will continue to be
seen as moderate-to-conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Perry insists he isn't worried about his new role, he's
giving himself a break about following in Bullock's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll be compared to Bob Bullock. But I'll tell people
upfront, at the beginning, right now I can't fill Bob Bullock's
shoes,'' he said. ``I will do the best that I can. I stay very
focused. I make decisions day in and day out that will make Texas
better. I don't worry about it.''

   TINSELTOWN-THEMEPARK (Anaheim, Calif.) _ One of the strangest
and most revealing spectacles the entertainment business has ever
created is Tinseltown, a new theme park and dinner theater complex
near Disneyland. Customers and guests are the wrong words to
describe those who buy $45 tickets. Once inside the $15 million
complex, they are referred to by employees as stars. Even the
tickets are designed to look like exclusive gala invitations.

   HAWAII-MACADAMIAS (Hilo) _ The coast of Hawaii's Big Island is
dotted with groves of stately trees. But these trees give off much
more than shade and fragrance: from July to January they yield
macadamias, the world's richest tasting, most expensive nuts and a
food as closely associated with Hawaii as the pineapple. The
discovery that the trees were more than just ornamentals had to be
sheer happenstance, because the luxury they produce is one hard nut
to crack. Still, once the secret was out, every effort was made to
turn the trees into tidy profit centers. It took a long, long time.
And today the growers are facing a new problem. By Marian Burros.

   SOUP-DUMPLINGS (Undated) _ They go by more than a few names on
Chinese menus: Steamed tiny buns, juicy dumplings and
crabmeat-and-pork soupy buns are just some of the terms for what
the Chinese call xiao long bao, and for what Americans know as soup
dumplings. The soup dumpling is a Shanghai specialty, a flowery
little packet of delicate dough twisted up at the top. It usually
contains some combination of minced pork, shrimp or crab, and a
final touch that gives this dumpling its identity, a spoonful of
hot broth. It is hard to eat a soup dumpling without leaving a
trace on your shirt. Nonetheless, New Yorkers have fallen in love
with the soup dumpling, willingly sacrificing their garments in
pursuit of a mouthful of pleasure. By Eric Asimov.

   RETRO-STYLED-TOASTERS (Undated) _ It's big, it's chrome and it's

evenly browned and crisp on both sides, still soft in the center
and warm throughout. Butter melts on contact. But there must be
something more about this retro-styled Dualit toaster, sold by
Williams Sonoma, that draws people to it. What that something was,
would reveal itself by testing it against other retro-styled

</P>
<P>
   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York _ a crowded concrete landscape _ has never
been easy. But for most of this century, the idea of high school
sports at least had a firm place in the roster of what public
schools were meant to do. Financing was sufficient, if not lavish.
Some schools were nationally recognized powerhouses and vibrant,
vital local institutions. But over the last quarter century, public
school sports in the city, and the physical education programs that
helped underpin them, have been devalued and cast adrift.
Interviews with more than 200 current and former coaches, teachers,
administrators and students, lay bare what happened: at a time when
medicine and sociology were establishing as never before the
benefits of physical activity for young people and as an obsession
with sports was growing across much of the rest of America, the
nation's largest public school system all but walked off the field.

</P>
<P>
   BKN-KNICKS-JORDAN (Purchase, N.Y.) _ The Knicks, including Coach
Jeff Van Gundy, talk about Jordan's pending retirement. On one
hand, they now have a better chance at winning their first title
since 1973. But at the same time, they no doubt feel frustrated
that they will never have beaten Jordan in the playoffs, that he

   HAWAII-MACADAMIAS (Hilo) _ The coast of Hawaii's Big Island is
dotted with groves of stately trees. But these trees give off much
more than shade and fragrance: from July to January they yield
macadamias, the world's richest tasting, most expensive nuts and a
food as closely associated with Hawaii as the pineapple. The
discovery that the trees were more than just ornamentals had to be
sheer happenstance, because the luxury they produce is one hard nut
to crack. Still, once the secret was out, every effort was made to
turn the trees into tidy profit centers. It took a long, long time.
And today the growers are facing a new problem. By Marian Burros.

   SOUP-DUMPLINGS (Undated) _ They go by more than a few names on
Chinese menus: Steamed tiny buns, juicy dumplings and
crabmeat-and-pork soupy buns are just some of the terms for what
the Chinese call xiao long bao, and for what Americans know as soup
dumplings. The soup dumpling is a Shanghai specialty, a flowery
little packet of delicate dough twisted up at the top. It usually
contains some combination of minced pork, shrimp or crab, and a
final touch that gives this dumpling its identity, a spoonful of
hot broth. It is hard to eat a soup dumpling without leaving a
trace on your shirt. Nonetheless, New Yorkers have fallen in love
with the soup dumpling, willingly sacrificing their garments in
pursuit of a mouthful of pleasure. By Eric Asimov.

<P>
   RETRO-STYLED-TOASTERS (Undated) _ It's big, it's chrome and it's
a beaut. It lights up, sports a lever, and has a timer. And for
just $369, it makes toast. Good toast. That is, bread that is
evenly browned and crisp on both sides, still soft in the center
and warm throughout. Butter melts on contact. But there must be
something more about this retro-styled Dualit toaster, sold by
Williams Sonoma, that draws people to it. What that something was,
would reveal itself by testing it against other retro-styled
toasters: a DeLonghi Classica, a Russell Hobbs Classic Coolwall, a
Cuisinart Classic and an original 1950s vintage Toastmaster. By

   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York _ a crowded concrete landscape _ has never
been easy. But for most of this century, the idea of high school
sports at least had a firm place in the roster of what public
schools were meant to do. Financing was sufficient, if not lavish.
Some schools were nationally recognized powerhouses and vibrant,
vital local institutions. But over the last quarter century, public
school sports in the city, and the physical education programs that
helped underpin them, have been devalued and cast adrift.
Interviews with more than 200 current and former coaches, teachers,
administrators and students, lay bare what happened: at a time when
medicine and sociology were establishing as never before the
benefits of physical activity for young people and as an obsession
with sports was growing across much of the rest of America, the
nation's largest public school system all but walked off the field.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ice. Snow. Cold. Since shortly before Christmas, a belated and
harsh winter has bedeviled much of the country.
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, my husband and I moved from Santa Barbara
to Memphis. Driving home from shopping last week and dodging ice
patches, I remembered a local telling us, ``We don't get real
winter in the South.'' Ha!
 &HT;    While I was sliding down the freeway, the oldies station on the
car radio began to play ``California Dreamin''' by the Mamas and
the Papas. Yes, all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. The
whole dismal mess glazed with a thin coat of ice. I pulled over and
sobbed, ``What am I doing here?''
 &HT;    Unlike Joan Didion, the eloquent essayist of contemporary
California, I am not a ``native daughter.'' Thirty years ago, as a
10-year-old, I saw California for the first time. My family, rooted
in numberless generations of Baltimore, went west to fulfill a
promise -- to scatter my grandfather's ashes over the Grand Canyon.
 &HT;    Having never been west of the Appalachian Mountains, my parents
made a vacation of the sad event. We flew to Phoenix, drove north
to the canyon, further north to Las Vegas, and finally, back south
to Interstate 10 and west across the desert to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    In 1969, that desert was a vast emptiness. For a child from
Maryland, where even in rural areas town followed town, it seemed
an endless nothingness. I had never seen so much space. I imagined
we were a pioneer family crossing the wilderness in a Ford station
wagon.
 &HT;    When we finally crested the hills and saw Palm Springs in the
valley below, the city's verdant loveliness made me gasp. From that
moment, I became a Californian in my heart. Eight years later,
California became my home.
 &HT;    Since then, I have lived in several states but have always
returned to California. I have often wondered why this was so;
nearly every time I leave I swear never to return. High prices,
glitz and glamour, body-worship, traffic, and intellectual ennui
all conspire to drive me away. I long for the sanity of some
settled place with a sense of history and real neighborhoods with
big, affordable houses.
 &HT;    Memphis is like that. People in these parts still argue over
political battles 25 or 125 years old. History takes on its own
life. A regular middle-class family can buy a huge house on a
street where neighbors swap cups of sugar and sit on porch swings
at night. Life is decent.
 &HT;    But I feel restless. It is the Californian in me.
 &HT;    California's state motto, ``Eureka,'' means ``I found it!'' and
has always struck me as ironic. Every time one ``finds'' California
it changes again. In 1968, Joan Didion noted this: ``Going back to
California is not like going back to Vermont, or Chicago; Vermont
and Chicago are relative constants, against which one measures
one's own change. All that is constant about California is the rate
at which it disappears.''
 &HT;    Over the years, I have become convinced that California
epitomizes a certain kind of spirituality. For those of us with
restless hearts who, in the words of the Psalmist, ``pant after
God,'' California -- and the west in general -- frees us from the
constraints of family and tradition to pursue God and the soul with
creativity and imagination and passion. Any time we think we have
found the answers, the questions change. In California, one finds
and finds and finds again. We like it that way. Faith is never
boring.
 &HT;    Every Sunday in Memphis, I attend church with many people who
have never lived elsewhere. Their great-grandparents built the
church; their grandparents are commemorated in the windows; their
parents married there; they and their children baptized. Such
stability is rare and lovely; traditions shaping and shaped by
generations.
 &HT;    While I honor stained-glass windows, and am myself an
Episcopalian, I find religious traditionalism stifling. And
although here in Memphis many of my co-religionists do not
recognize this, such generational religion is becoming a thing of
the past.
 &HT;    Increasingly, the spirituality of the nation resembles that of
California -- a restless, searching people. Sorry, Joan. In the 30
years since you wrote -- and the 30 years since I first saw
California -- Vermont, Chicago, and even Memphis have changed.
 &HT;    Americans no longer measure our internal changes against an
unchanging backdrop. Rather, we change with an always-changing
world. What we find, we lose; only to search and find again.
 &HT;    Trembling at the edge of a new millennium, those seeking
stability may lament such changes and embrace fundamentalism,
traditionalism and moralism.
 &HT;    But the truth of the matter is that everything changes all the
time. Faith is a journey into change. And Californians knew that
all along.

to Memphis. Driving home from shopping last week and dodging ice
patches, I remembered a local telling us, ``We don't get real
winter in the South.'' Ha!
 &HT;    While I was sliding down the freeway, the oldies station on the
car radio began to play ``California Dreamin''' by the Mamas and
the Papas. Yes, all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. The
whole dismal mess glazed with a thin coat of ice. I pulled over and
sobbed, ``What am I doing here?''
 &HT;    Unlike Joan Didion, the eloquent essayist of contemporary
California, I am not a ``native daughter.'' Thirty years ago, as a
10-year-old, I saw California for the first time. My family, rooted
in numberless generations of Baltimore, went west to fulfill a
promise -- to scatter my grandfather's ashes over the Grand Canyon.
 &HT;    Having never been west of the Appalachian Mountains, my parents
made a vacation of the sad event. We flew to Phoenix, drove north
to the canyon, further north to Las Vegas, and finally, back south
to Interstate 10 and west across the desert to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    In 1969, that desert was a vast emptiness. For a child from
Maryland, where even in rural areas town followed town, it seemed
an endless nothingness. I had never seen so much space. I imagined
we were a pioneer family crossing the wilderness in a Ford station
wagon.
 &HT;    When we finally crested the hills and saw Palm Springs in the
valley below, the city's verdant loveliness made me gasp. From that
moment, I became a Californian in my heart. Eight years later,
California became my home.
 &HT;    Since then, I have lived in several states but have always
returned to California. I have often wondered why this was so;
nearly every time I leave I swear never to return. High prices,
glitz and glamour, body-worship, traffic, and intellectual ennui
all conspire to drive me away. I long for the sanity of some
settled place with a sense of history and real neighborhoods with
big, affordable houses.
 &HT;    Memphis is like that. People in these parts still argue over
political battles 25 or 125 years old. History takes on its own
life. A regular middle-class family can buy a huge house on a
street where neighbors swap cups of sugar and sit on porch swings
at night. Life is decent.
 &HT;    But I feel restless. It is the Californian in me.
 &HT;    California's state motto, ``Eureka,'' means ``I found it!'' and
has always struck me as ironic. Every time one ``finds'' California
it changes again. In 1968, Joan Didion noted this: ``Going back to
California is not like going back to Vermont, or Chicago; Vermont
and Chicago are relative constants, against which one measures
one's own change. All that is constant about California is the rate
at which it disappears.''
 &HT;    Over the years, I have become convinced that California
epitomizes a certain kind of spirituality. For those of us with
restless hearts who, in the words of the Psalmist, ``pant after
God,'' California -- and the west in general -- frees us from the
constraints of family and tradition to pursue God and the soul with
creativity and imagination and passion. Any time we think we have
found the answers, the questions change. In California, one finds
and finds and finds again. We like it that way. Faith is never
boring.
 &HT;    Every Sunday in Memphis, I attend church with many people who
have never lived elsewhere. Their great-grandparents built the
church; their grandparents are commemorated in the windows; their
parents married there; they and their children baptized. Such
stability is rare and lovely; traditions shaping and shaped by
generations.
 &HT;    While I honor stained-glass windows, and am myself an
Episcopalian, I find religious traditionalism stifling. And
although here in Memphis many of my co-religionists do not
recognize this, such generational religion is becoming a thing of
the past.
 &HT;    Increasingly, the spirituality of the nation resembles that of
California -- a restless, searching people. Sorry, Joan. In the 30
years since you wrote -- and the 30 years since I first saw
California -- Vermont, Chicago, and even Memphis have changed.
 &HT;    Americans no longer measure our internal changes against an
unchanging backdrop. Rather, we change with an always-changing
world. What we find, we lose; only to search and find again.
 &HT;    Trembling at the edge of a new millennium, those seeking
stability may lament such changes and embrace fundamentalism,
traditionalism and moralism.
 &HT;    But the truth of the matter is that everything changes all the
time. Faith is a journey into change. And Californians knew that
all along.

PORTRAIT OF A PAINTER: MATISSE'S BATTLE GIVEN LIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
``The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse: The Early Years,
1869-1908''; By Hilary Spurling (Knopf, $40) By CELIA MORRIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fierce competition between Henri Matisse and Pablo
Picasso that smoldered from the time they met in 1906, the Spaniard
had an unfair advantage: He was the center of every group _ madcap,
showoff and sexy. If he had been a Hollywood star, he'd have been
Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Matisse, who was 11 years older, could easily
have been taken for a stuffy burgher; he wore three-piece suits and
surrounded himself with all the trappings of respectability _ a
wife, three children, a suitable address in Paris and a summer
retreat at Collioure in the south of France. Naturally reticent, he
could seem cold and unapproachable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this should count in evaluating their work,
but critics are at least as human as other people, and Picasso's
seductive ways won over more than a few.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Spurling intends to redress this imbalance by rescuing
Matisse from the unforgiving weight of propriety and exploring his
struggle. Unlike Picasso, for instance, who was acknowledged to be
a child genius rather like Mozart and could draw better at 11 than
most adults, Matisse didn't start painting until his 20s and did so
then to howls of disapproval from virtually everyone who mattered
to him.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with his father to be taken seriously as a man and an
artist was far more traumatic than anything Picasso faced. His digs
were fully as bare as his rival's when he was young and his
poverty, if anything, more nearly crushing.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize his eventual success to be all the more remarkable
because in Spurling's pages we meet the friends with whom he began
but who died early or fell short in various ways happily less dire.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's parents were principals in one of the biggest
scandals in 19th-century France, having acted as agents for a
couple called the Humberts who fleeced hundreds of their countrymen
in a scam as outrageous and nearly as damaging as the savings and
loan debacle in this country almost 100 years later. According to
Spurling, therefore, Matisse could seem aloof as a natural
consequence of the family's drawing inward after a sustained public
outcry and the irretrievable collapse of their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   An indifferent student, Matisse was ``a champion mimic'' _
irreverent, stubborn, and bold to the point of recklessness. But he
was nearly defeated by his own self-doubt, along with his father's
disdain for painting as an occupation worthy of his son, until he
saw some paintings by Goya and Chardin in Lille.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when I understood that painting could be a
language,'' he wrote long after he had also discovered the light of
the south and triumphed in the task he'd set himself: ``I thought
that I could become a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   A key member of a generation that broke the hold of the
classicism that had prevailed since the early Renaissance, he was
at least as revolutionary as Picasso _ both in the way he saw and
the way he painted. And in the inevitable re-evaluations that mark
aesthetic history, Matisse is now considered by many to be the more
significant artist.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``The Unknown Matisse'' lies in its wealth of
information _ in Spurling's account, for instance, of the dramatic
changes industrialism had brought and was still bringing to
late-19th-century France, with the rise in one generation of an
urban bourgeoisie from whose narrow strictures and authoritarianism
Matisse would fight so intently to extricate himself. Of ``the
poisonous atmosphere of failure and humiliation'' he inherited from
the northern plains where he was raised _ an emotion that sprang
from the fact that Germans had repeatedly vanquished the French in
battle. (Bohain, his hometown _ ``as Flemish as a Breughel
painting'' _ was occupied by German soldiers three times during his
lifetime.) Of the ``fierce aesthetic satisfaction the weavers of
Bohain got from their luxury fabrics'' and the abiding influence
their luminous, brilliantly colored textiles and the aesthetic that
inspired them would come to have on Matisse's work. (The weavers
tended to be radical and egalitarian, sure that beauty should be
within everybody's reach.)
</P>
<P>
   And Spurling is particularly good when describing France's
artistic establishment, its brutal infighting and the convulsive
grip it exercised to discourage innovation in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   In this densely textured book, she deals with a formidable cast
of characters _ Matisse's relatives, teachers, fellow students,
friends, lovers, drinking companions, some of whom tend to fade
into one another, as well as members of the various establishments
he encountered in the long struggle to make something of himself.
</P>
<P>
   She is invariably good at explaining people by way of economics
and sociology. About Matisse's first important lover, Caroline
Joblaud, known as Camille, she writes, for instance: ``She belonged
to the new breed of shopgirls: stylish, well-turned-out young
Parisiennes who staffed the modern department stores that were
rapidly evolving a new consumer culture and the lifestyles to go
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   She is less convincing in her psychological insights, for in
these pages women like Madame Matisse and the painter's daughter
Marguerite seem improbably heroic and self-sacrificing, as though
their patience with an exasperating spouse or father could not be
explained, at least in part, by their dependence and the absence of
real social and economic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Spurling is weakest at organizing her material. Her focus blurs
with alarming frequency; the detail overwhelms; the narrative not
only stops too often but now and again goes into reverse. If her
paragraphs were a closet, one might find there, mixed in with the
usual paraphernalia, one green high-heeled pump, a half-empty pint
of brandy, a chemise that went out of style 60 years ago, the
carcass of a water beetle.
</P>
<P>
   But we learn a great deal from ``The Unknown Matisse'' about one
of the most vital periods in the history of Western art as well as
the artists that explored and defined it, about rebellion and
reconciliation, about teaching and learning, about city life and
village life, about the propriety that diminished and the order
that saves.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the author keeps faith with her subject, and so
we learn how hard and relentlessly Matisse worked to become and to
remain a real artist. Spurling's first volume will always be a
handy reference, and her second will be eagerly awaited by Matisse
fans and art lovers on both sides of the Atlantic.

JETS' JOHNSON COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just give the man the credit he
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson has evolved into a higher life form than he was
during the regrettable ``Just Give Me The Damn Ball'' phase of his
literary and National Football League careers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is older now, and wise to the give-and-take nature of
his profession. Sunday afternoon at the Meadowlands, Johnson
gratefully took whatever business the New York Jets were willing to
throw his way. He took whatever the Jacksonville Jaguars' defense
gave him. In the end, Johnson even took from the Jaguars' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have an invitation to Denver for the AFC title game to
show for Johnson's handiwork. Examine a 34-24 Divisional Playoff
victory against Jaguars from any angle, and it's impossible to miss
his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   As 78,817 members of the ever-swelling ranks of Gang Green are
his witnesses, Johnson caught nine passes for 121 yards and a
touchdown in his playoff debut. He carried the ball twice for 28
yards and another touchdown. He was an official's judgment call
away from scoring a third touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and then there was Johnson's momentum-turning recovery of a
Jacksonville fumble that set up a Jets touchdown. Johnson didn't
call it a day until he had intercepted a pass from Mark Brunell to
stop the Jaguars' final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed you what he's all about,'' said Jets fullback Keith
Byars, a veteran of 13 NFL seasons. ``He's a big-time player.
Keyshawn wants someday to be one of the best players in this
league. He's definitely on that path, if he's not already at that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells wasn't even born the last time anybody
came up big so many ways in a playoff game. Jack Manders
contributed touchdowns by land and air, recovered a fumble and
picked off a pass in the 1937 NFL title game. Still, Manders
couldn't save the Chicago Bears from a 28-21 defeat against the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the possibilities for Johnson once he gets the hang of
this playoff thing. Remember, Johnson was a rookie on a 1-15 team
when he put in writing the ways the world would be a better place
if the Jets would make him the center of their universe. Talk about
trash talk. Now he's a Pro Bowl receiver for a franchise that has
spent the better part of its existence lost in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to play big in all games,'' said Johnson, who was born
three years after the Jets' one and only Super Bowl appearance in
1969. ``You're not going to always come away pleasing people. As
long as my coaching staff and the guys I play with respect my play
and enjoy me on the field, that's pretty much all I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted to do is be involved. In whatever. I've
always felt I could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasted little time making an indelible impression on the
Jaguars. Barely four minutes into the game, Johnson broke clear on
a slant pattern for a 21-yard touchdown and 7-0 lead. So much for
the prospect of a bye week giving the Jets time to accumulate an
unsightly buildup of rust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three different game plans, depending on the weather,''
Byars said. ``But all of them had Keyshawn in mind. We knew we had
to get him the ball early and often.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Jets weren't trying to get the ball to Johnson, he
managed to impose his will on the game. The Jets had a 10-0
second-quarter lead when Testaverde and Curtis Martin missed
connections on a second-down handoff from the Jacksonville 22.
Jaguars safety Chris Hudson picked up the ball on the dead run and
headed for the other goal line, only to encounter Testaverde around
midfield. Something possessed Hudson to lateral the ball in the
general direction of Jaguars cornerback Dave Thomas. Johnson
arrived on the scene just in time to fall on the ball at the Jets'
35.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from hustling,'' Johnson said. ``If you don't
hustle, you never know. They may have the ball, and the game is a
whole other situation.''
</P>
<P>
   One moment, the Jaguars were looking at cutting the lead to
10-7. The next, Johnson is shrugging off a vicious blow from safety
Donovin Darius to snag a pass for an 18-yard gain to the
Jacksonville 12. On third down, the Jaguars' defense bit on a fake
sweep to Martin around right end. Why wouldn't they? Martin carried
the ball 36 times and caught six passes. Johnson had a clear path
to the end zone for the 10-yard run that made the score 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy,'' Parcells said. ``I think he's really
improving as a player every week. This was a big game for him and
big game for us. He showed up big, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The next meaningful Johnson sighting came in the third quarter,
with the Jets' lead down to 17-7. On second-and-10 from the
Jacksonville 24, Johnson slipped open on a seam route for a gain of
about 23 yards and 30 inches. This time, Martin fed off Johnson for
a 1-yard touchdown run. The Jets had the sort of breathing room a
team that hasn't won a playoff game since 1986 needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn is a great example of a guy who prepares well every
week, is excited about playing football, loves to play the game,''
Testaverde said. ``He's a kid at heart. And he makes big plays on
Sundays, which is the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars got an early indication Sunday that Johnson was ready to
give more than receive. When Byars arrived at the Meadowlands, it
was 9:15 a.m. The game would not start in nearly 3 1/2 hours, and
Johnson was already there. In uniform. Dressed to kill off the
Jaguars. With Johnson moonlighting as a defensive back and Brunell
throwing Hail Mary passes in the final seconds, the Jaguars didn't
have a prayer of pulling off a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to play with him,'' Byars said. ``I can't wait 'til
next week, because I know he's going to do something even better.''

VAN ZANDT TRIES GIG ON HBO SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Were he not real, Miami Steve Van Zandt could've been
one of the oddball Jersey Shore characters who populated Bruce
Springsteen's early songs. As his head wear evolved from fedoras to
berets to ever-present bandanas (worn gypsy-style for every type of
social occasion), Van Zandt's role in the Springsteen legend grew
ever larger.
</P>
<P>
   Playing impeccable guitar and yowling harmony vocals, Van Zandt
was a key member of the E Street Band, the mythic musical ensemble
that accompanied Springsteen to superstardom. However, over the
past decade or so, after ``Born in the U.S.A.'s ''huge success and
global stadium tour, Springsteen carefully downsized his own
career, and his buddy Van Zandt all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   An E Street reunion tour is in the works for later this year,
and Van Zandt will be on board. But he's also participating in what
is sure to be one of 1999's entertainment highlights. In the
brilliant new 13-hour HBO miniseries, ``The Sopranos,'' Van Zandt
plays Silvio Dante, a lesser mobster who aspires to be more than
the colorful manager of a Jersey girlie joint.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a greasy rug, Van Zandt, who's never acted outside of
rock videos, holds his own as a member of a powerful ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   How did such a thing happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I got a phone call at the office,'' said Van Zandt,
in a recent telephone interview. ``We get calls now and then,
usually music, occasionally for something like acting. I never even
considered acting. Someone called the office. We said, `Send the
script.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally prepared to ignore it, like we usually do. But
I read it and I said, Jesus, this is good. I went down for the hell
of it and read for them and they liked it and they had me read for
HBO on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was that. No, actually, that was not that. It never is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' script found its way to Van Zandt because David
Chase, the series' creator and executive producer, had followed Van
Zandt's music career since the E Street days, and he was charmed by
a speech Van Zandt gave during the 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
induction ceremonies, which were televised on a cable-TV network.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the band The Young Rascals, Van Zandt all but stole
the show with a colorful riff on New Jersey, Italians and blue-eyed
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them get very solemn, as it should be,'' Van Zandt
said of speeches by Hall of Fame presenters. ``But I knew there was
room for some humor, and I put together five minutes, a humorous
take on the whole Rascals thing, on the New Jersey thing and all
that. It was actually quite funny, I must say.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: The speech is at
rockhall.com/97induction/6th/audio on the Hall of Fame's World Wide
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it put him over the edge,'' Van Zandt said of Chase.
``Somehow, he connected that up with being an actor, which is quite
a stretch. He somehow saw something.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Chase confirmed the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to see his picture in those band photos all the time,''
Chase said. ``I always thought to myself, `Oh, this guy looks real
interesting.' He always reminded me of Al Pacino in those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fan, and then I stumbled across him doing this speech
about The Rascals. Obviously, he has a presence. He was very funny.
He was very Jersey. I'm from Jersey, and I responded very strongly
to the whole statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Van Zandt left the E Street Band just as ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' reached peak popularity, he was never far from the Jersey
Shore musically. He wrote and produced charming R&AMP;B records by
another Jersey export, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, whose
records sated Springsteen fans during the long years between Boss
albums.
</P>
<P>
   During his solo career, leading a band called Little Steven and
the Disciples of Soul, he dropped even a little more out of sight.
His band veered toward global-vision political anthems, not exactly
a path toward commercial gold. So, it was a bit of pretty symmetry
that The Rascals induction speech _ another thread of Jersey-based
music _ was what ultimately brought Van Zandt to his new role in
``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chase, Van Zandt actually created Silvio Dante,
whom Chase then wrote into the story. The rocker-turned-actor (who
said he's never had an acting class) found that changing his
appearance helped him get into character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was the hair thing,'' said Van Zandt.
``That's also part of the fun. It's so different, most people would
not recognize me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once cast, he began to further prepare for the role. Just
studying E Street Band photos from ``The River'' era would've been
a good start. Instead, Van Zandt ``went back and watched every mob
movie, from ``The Public Enemy'' on,'' he said. ``I read every mob
book again. I found out where those guys shop and got the clothes
right, and the jewelry and the hair and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I looked in the mirror and saw the guy. There
he is. So, it's physically different, and that really helps me.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm joking when I say I'm not good enough to go
to acting class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure out who the guy is and just be him. That's the only
method I can come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime of dealing with nightclub owners and entertainment
industry figures also prepared Van Zandt for portraying a wise guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Italian-American and you grow up in New Jersey, and
you know people in the entertainment business, there's always
somebody who knows somebody'' who could be a model for this
particular character type, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Van Zandt said, is a guy who, despite his flaws, has
redeeming qualities. (Ambition, for one, and an appreciation for
the arts, especially ``Godfather'' movies.) But is his character a
guy Steve Van Zandt might hang out with?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about hanging out with him,'' Van Zandt said.
``He's different from me. He's much more orderly. He's got a bit of
Frank Costello and Bugsy Siegel in him. He wants to rise above the
gangster stuff. He has one pinkie in the entertainment world. It's
the lowest possible level _ he runs a strip club _ but he has
fantasies about running a Copacabana, and that's where he's
heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, he's a tough guy who does all the other
stuff he has to do. Even though he does some strong-arm stuff,
that's not what he enjoys.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Van Zandt may have to do this year is juggle
shooting ``The Sopranos''' second season with his duties in the
reunited E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   HBO has already ordered a half-season's worth of scripts, and,
given the quality of the series so far, it would be nuts not to go
forward. Shooting would start in midsummer, by which time the
Springsteen tour will presumably be well down Thunder Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in this country during the filming of my second
season, hopefully I won't miss any of those episodes,'' Van Zandt
said. ``I think that the tour schedule will probably be revealed in
the next week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the band's lineup, he said, ``I'm in for sure, and it
looks like everybody's going to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, he believes, drummer Max Weinberg, who leads the
``Late Night'' band for Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max and Conan are still working their thing out, which is
complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Zandt's life may be, should the acting thing work out.
His experience with ``The Sopranos'' was ``nothing but good,'' he
said. ``There were no bad vibes, there were no (jerks) in the cast,
and I'm told that's really rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely enjoyable experience. So much so that if
something else comes along, I'll look at it. But I don't really
care if I do anything else. Plus, now, with the E Street reunion
thing going on, I'm not going to have a lot of time anyway.'' &QL;

POLAR PERIL FOR YOUNG, OLDER ADULTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
``The Endurance'' by Caroline Alexander (Knopf $29.95) 
 
``Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The Extraordinary True
Story of Shackleton and the Endurance'' by Jennifer Armstrong
(Crown $18) By MARVIN HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days of my budding romance with books, young-adult
novels did not exist. The likes of Gary Paulsen or Will Hobbs were
not around to nourish timid, bespectacled boys like me with tales
of adventure and daring. Movies were a more likely source of the
vicarious thrills that could transport me in time or space to
places where I could conquer the elements or the forces of evil.
</P>
<P>
   What did exist in print were nonfiction works, part of a long
adult tradition of accounts by explorers and amateur archaeologists
and anthropologists of expeditions into parts of the world as yet
unknown in Europe and the United States _ Africa, the jungles of
South America, remote islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   I recently found my sixth-grade yearbook, in which I reported
that my favorite book was ``Kon-Tiki.'' Does anyone out there
remember Thor Heyerdahl's rousing account of his raft journey
across the Pacific to prove that the early settlers of the South
Sea Islands could have made that journey all the way from South
America?
</P>
<P>
   I rode out those monumental storms with the author in my cramped
Brooklyn apartment, watched with amazement as flying fish landed on
the deck of that precarious collection of lashed logs which
eventually crashed triumphantly onto a rocky Melanesian beach.
Until recently a tattered copy of the paperback edition of
``Kon-Tiki'' sat on the shelf of my class library, but over the
years it attracted fewer and fewer takers.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we make of the simultaneous appearance of two books
about the justly famous Shackleton Antarctic Expedition? The first,
``The Endurance'' by Caroline Alexander (Knopf $29.95), who is also
curating a show of photographs from the expedition at the American
Museum of Natural History this spring, is intended for an adult
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The second, ``Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The
Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance'' by
Jennifer Armstrong (Crown $18), is a young-adult book.
</P>
<P>
   I want to compare the treatment of the same material for the two
audiences after I've acquainted you with the outlines of this
extraordinary tale, but first it's worth pointing out that the
authors of both books are women, which is in itself _ if you will
excuse the expression _ a sea change in the genre of adventure
literature.
</P>
<P>
   With some notable exceptions, such as the Victorian Mary
Kingsley, who wrote of her travels in West Africa, and the aviator
Beryl Markham, reading and writing about danger has been a guy
thing. Now if we can only make the crossover two-way and engage men
and boys in reading the quieter works of relationship and
introspection that have long appealed to women, we will really be
getting somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the 20th century, the Antarctic remained
unconquered and unexplored. Enormous public attention was focused
on several expeditions to reach the South Pole. One headed by a
young Irishman, Ernest Shackleton, in 1908, fell just a hundred
miles short of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton had participated in a previous try in 1901 with Capt.
Robert Scott, who successfully reached the pole on a second try in
1910, but, alas, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had preceded
him by a few days. Scott and his team died on the return trip from
the pole and achieved the elevated status of heroes and martyrs
back home in England, forever overshadowing Shackleton.
</P>
<P>
   The polar fever never left Shackleton, and although the great
prize had already been won by others, Shackleton conceived of an
expedition in 1914 that would be the first to cross the entire land
mass of the Antarctic continent on foot. The plan was to sail south
before the pack ice made sea travel impossible, then land, traverse
the continent by a combination of dog sleds and motorized sledges
and be picked up at the other end by a relief ship for the
triumphant journey home. Shackleton, an astute businessman, managed
to finance the entire venture through the sale of a film, a book
and photo rights to the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 crew members he signed on included scientists, surgeons,
ordinary sailors and tested veterans of earlier voyages to the
region, but none was more crucial than the photographer, Frank
Hurley, to whom we owe thanks for the vivid record he left of the
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Both books make generous use of Hurley's images, although the
quality of the reproductions in the Alexander book and the paper
they are printed on really show the photographer's work to best
advantage. Shackleton also encouraged the crew members to keep
journals, and both books draw heavily on these cross-cutting
accounts of what must have been one of the most self-conscious
struggles against imminent death ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Shackleton story so unique is that the Endurance
never reached land. He had chosen an unusually bad year for pack
ice, which eventually surrounded the ship and locked it in no more
than a day short of landfall.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had no means of communication with a world that had in
any case turned its attention away from exploratory feats of
heroism toward the horror of World War I, which had engulfed the
European continent since the Endurance set out. The sailors
essentially dropped off the face of the earth for almost two years,
during which time the ship was ground to splinters by the
incredible force of the ice pressing against its timbers.
</P>
<P>
   The crew and their numerous sled dogs were forced to abandon
ship and camp on the ice floes in the hope of being carried toward
the open sea. There they could launch the lifeboats they had
salvaged from the Endurance, along with sufficient food to sustain
them so long as it was supplemented by the fresh seal and penguin
meat that was in abundant supply. The fresh meat enabled Shackleton
and his men to avoid the debilitating scurvy that had crippled
earlier expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally reached water open enough to launch their
boats, they entered into another hellish chapter, facing the most
inhospitable seas on the planet. The unsung hero of the voyage,
Frank Worsley, navigated them safely to Elephant Island with
amazing accuracy, aided by a sextant and a chronometer. Readers of
Dava Sobel's recent best seller ``Longitude'' will appreciate the
ways in which the invention of the latter instrument revolutionized
sea travel.
</P>
<P>
   Before Shackleton abandoned the Endurance he tore from the
ship's Bible the pages from the Book of Job. Nothing could have
been more premonitory. The ordeals never ended. Elephant Island was
a death trap. Shackleton had to organize a six-man crew to sail
another 600 miles to the nearest human habitation, the whaling
station on South Georgia Island, from which they had embarked
almost two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Again they succeeded against impossible odds, thanks to Worsley
and to Shackleton's blind determination. Even when they reached
land they had to cross an alpine terrain to arrive at the whaling
station, and then there was still the return voyage to rescue the
22 men stranded on Elephant Island for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   It was a never-ending ordeal. Most amazing of all, every single
crew member survived. This was an unparalleled feat of physical
endurance, but it is also a tribute to Shackleton's extraordinary
human relations skills. He managed to maintain morale and
discipline and to quell the one brief rebellion against his
authority that could have undermined the unity essential to the
group's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Both books do an effective job of carrying the reader along on
this mad, heroic journey, with the aid of Hurley's photographs. Not
surprisingly, the adult volume draws in more detail from the crew's
journals. The most striking difference between the two is
Alexander's willingness to explore some of the darker sides of the
strained relationships among the crew members, including the class
differences between the sailors and the more elite professionals on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexander focuses more attention on the tragedies and
sometimes seamier aftermaths of the voyage, even she does not
explore in sufficient depth the peculiar psychology of men like
Shackleton, who were unfit for normal life and continually sought
the stimulation of these horrendous physical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton himself died on yet another arctic adventure in 1921
at the age of 47. He left behind a wife and a mistress, into whose
lives he barely touched down. A number of his original crew
members, afflicted by the same malaise, accompanied him on this
final voyage.
</P>
<P>
   There are novels to be written about some of the individual crew
members, especially the abrasive carpenter, McNish, who never
forgave Shackleton for being forced to kill his beloved cat, Mrs.
Chippy, when the Endurance was destroyed. Shackleton, in turn, in
an uncharacteristic act of mean-spiritedness, refused to award
McNish the Polar Medal that was bestowed on all but a few of the
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story for young readers and adults to relish. How
about one of those parent-child book discussions, in which each
reads the version appropriate to his or her age group so they can
reflect together on the question of what motivates people to place
themselves in such danger, when living even the quiet, cautious
life is already fraught with such peril?

WHAT'S THAT SMELL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Remember that expensive Bordeaux you sent back last year
because it tasted a bit like wet cardboard? The waiter was not
happy about your complaint, but after he smelled and tasted the
wine, he had to agree; it was ``corky,'' that is, tainted by a bad
cork. He brought you another bottle.
</P>
<P>
   You may both have been wrong. The cork may not have been the
cause of the odd taste at all.
</P>
<P>
   Your bottle and thousands of others may have been contaminated
by an insecticide that used to be applied to the wood in wine
storage buildings all over France. What's more, French winemakers
may have discovered the problem as long ago as 1982, but they never
disclosed it to the public. The problem affected only French wines.
</P>
<P>
   Corkiness, a moldy, dank smell and taste, is usually attributed
to corks improperly sanitized by the producers, mostly in Spain and
Portugal. As the demand for cork-finished wine bottles has risen _
the makers of even cheap wines like the look of them _ cork
producers have been hard pressed to continually make first-quality
corks.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers in France have discovered that insecticides once
used to treat new wood used in construction may be equally at fault
for bad-tasting wine. The French weekly news magazine L'Express
first reported the findings two weeks ago in an article that had
been prepared in collaboration with a monthly consumer publication,
Que Choisir (What to Buy), which is similar to Consumer Reports
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The article said that trace quantities of the pesticide
chlorophenol had found their way into wines from Bordeaux,
Burgundy, Beaujolais, the Loire Valley, the Rhone Valley and
Champagne in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In those boom years, many winemakers built new storage buildings
and cellars. Some of the wood used in construction had been treated
with chlorophenol, and its fumes had seeped into wooden barrels and
eventually into the wine itself, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   While the pesticide can spoil a wine's bouquet and taste, its
presence in the wood poses no health hazard to the consumer,
according to not only the researchers who discovered the problem
but also the French government, which in 1994 banned the use of
substances that contain high concentrations of chlorophenol.
</P>
<P>
   After the article was published, Sophie Gerard, a spokeswoman
for the Bordeaux trade organization, the Interprofessional
Committee of the Wines of Bordeaux, announced that her organization
had not disclosed the problem to the public because it preferred to
help resolve the issue, rather than to ``alarm the public about a
relatively minor matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bruno Borie, who heads the Union of Grand Crus, an
organization representing Bordeaux's most prestiguous chateaus,
said in an interview that his group chose not to communicate with
the public ``collectively but to let each member act according to
his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem first surfaced, according to L'Express, in 1982 in a
batch of Roederer Cristal, one of the most expensive Champagnes.
But it wasn't until 1991 that Pascal Chatonnet, a research chemist
at the University of Bordeaux and an employee of Seguin &AMP; Moreau, a
well-known barrel-making firm, discovered the cause.
</P>
<P>
   He realized that cork could not be the source of the problem
when he found the telltale smell of corkiness in a batch of wine in
a stainless-steel fermentation tank. It had not yet been touched by
a cork, so he concluded that it must have been contaminated earlier
in the production process. He announced his findings in 1993 in
Paris at a professional conference that apparently was not covered
by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction by winemakers was immediate. Cellars were destroyed
and rebuilt, and pallettes for carrying wine in bottles and barrels
were destroyed. In 1996, half of the Seguin &AMP; Moreau barrels that
were already in the hands of winemakers were found to be
contaminated and had to be destroyed, Chatonnet said. Now,
purchasers get certificates of noncontamination with every barrel
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   L'Express noted that the American wine critic Robert M. Parker
Jr. reported in his book ``Bordeaux,'' which was published last
year by Simon &AMP; Schuster, that he had found odors of must and damp
cardboard in bottles from 1986 and 1990 from Chateau
Ducru-Beaucaillou, a prominent property in the commune of
St.-Julien, suggesting that Parker had known the cause of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It also quoted him as saying the problem was ``ancient history''
because Ducru-Beaucaillou had completely replaced its winemaking
and barrel-aging cellars since then.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Parker said he had been reporting on the problem
``since I first came across it, because it affected the quality of
the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said nothing about what caused it because at the time no one
knew,'' he said. ``Had I offered any suggestions, without the
scientific backup, I might have been sued. Anyway, it's pretty much
a dead issue now.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgundy winemakers have been reluctant to talk about the
problem, and say only that it has been solved. In Bordeaux, John
Kolassa, the English-born director of Chateau Canon, in
St.-Emilion, said that Canon had built new cellars in 1987 and that
several vintages between 1991 and 1995 had been affected by the
pesticide in treated wood there.
</P>
<P>
   After the chateau was purchased by the Chanel Group in 1996,
cellar walls were sanded down, barrels burned and all suspected
wood replaced, Kolassa said, at a cost of about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chatonnet estimated that many other Bordeaux chateaus had spent
similar amounts. He observed that the situation could have been
worse; many barrels escaped being tainted simply due to where they
were placed in the storage building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some properties had to redo their cellars entirely,'' he said,
``but at others, all they had to do was close a door to modify the
air circulation.''

A BIG SOLID BLEND WORTH THE HUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marietta Cellars Old Vine Red, Lot 22, California. About $10.
</P>
<P>
   Any wine enthusiast looking for a worthy project for 1999 may
consider finding and buying some of this remarkable non-vintage red
from Marietta Cellars. Lot 22 combines wines mostly from 1996 and
1997, a blend that includes gamay, cabernet sauvignon, carignan
(which some old-time growers still call kerrigan), zinfandel and
petite sirah.
</P>
<P>
   Previous issues of the wine have had a Sonoma appellation but
Chris Bilbro, the winemaker, apparently bought these grapes from
growers all over the northern counties. Hence the California
appellation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 cases of this country-style red were produced, but
if past releases are any indication, it will not be easy to find;
smart buyers snap it up as soon as it appears on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   This is no refined, polished cabernet; it's a big solid wine
with plenty of fruit flavors. It seems tannic at first, but that
can be attributed to the intense flavors. There are tannins in this
wine, but they are soft.
</P>
<P>
   It probably could be laid down for five years or so, but it's
basically a wine to be enjoyed right now or over the next couple of
years. &QL;

SHRIMP WITH LEMONGRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shrimp is a perfect weeknight food, not only because it cooks in
less than five minutes, but also because it marries well with so
many flavors. A perfect but not well-known partner is lemon grass,
so named because of its unmistakable citrus flavor and long slender
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered exotic, lemon grass is increasingly easy to
find. It is sold in almost every Asian market, including many
Korean grocers, and even in many supermarkets. Cooks unfamiliar
with it should be encouraged to find it, as it is easy to cook
with. It does, however, require a somewhat unusual preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Like a scallion, which it resembles slightly, lemon grass has an
outer sheath that must be removed before chopping. Unlike a
scallion, however, this papery sheath makes up the bulk of the
herb. After trimming the top and bottom of the stalk, you must make
a lengthwise slit and peel off layer after layer until you get to
the tender core. That core is usually less than one-quarter inch
thick and only two or three inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon grass does not really tenderize with cooking, so if the
core is on the tough side, you must take care to mince it very,
very finely. One stalk will produce about a tablespoon or less of
minced lemon grass.
</P>
<P>
   You can stir minced lemon grass into any stir-fry, but its
essence is most pronounced if you add it at the last minute. Teamed
with lime zest or lime leaves (also available at most Asian
markets) and fish sauce (called nam pla in Thailand and nuoc mam in
Vietnam), it will give a distinctively Southeast Asian flavor to
the dish. Used with soy sauce, the stir-fry will have a more
familiar Chinese feel but will still contain the wonderful aroma
and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If it is fresh and quite tender, you can use minced lemon grass
as a condiment, sprinkling it with minced fresh ginger on top of
sauteed or steamed fish, for example. Fresh lemon grass is green
rather than brown, and its exterior sheath is moist and
fresh-looking rather than dry. But since most lemon grass has to
travel from Southeast Asia, truly fresh specimens are rare here.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to grow it yourself. If you pop an unpeeled
stalk, unceremoniously, into a pot of soil, it will multiply, even
in an apartment; a stalk planted outdoors in the spring will
produce 50 or more by autumn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHRIMP WITH LEMON GRASS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds shrimp, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced lime zest or lime leaves
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken, fish or shrimp stock, or water (if necessary)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce or fish sauce (nam pla)
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1. Put oil in 10- or 12-inch skillet, and turn heat to
medium-high; a minute later, add shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook, undisturbed, until bottoms turn pink, about 2 minutes.
Stir in the lemon grass, garlic and lime. If mixture is dry, add
stock or water. Add soy sauce or fish sauce and plenty of black
pepper, and cook for about 30 seconds more. Serve immediately,
preferably with white rice. &QL;

 &HT;    DENNY'S TOUTS TURN-AROUND ON DISCRIMINATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Denny's _ whose restaurants were known as much for
bias as for breakfasts not long ago _ will begin airing TV
commercials Wednesday aimed at sparking a national discussion on
``the importance of America's racial diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million campaign featuring three 30-second spots is the
latest manifestation of a dramatic turnaround of a chain once
widely considered a corporate poster child for racial
discrimination. In August, Fortune magazine named Advantica
Restaurant Group _ Denny's parent company _ as No. 2 on its list of
the nation's ``50 Best Companies for Asians, Blacks &AMP; Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Advantica made our list because members of minority groups are
no longer waiting to be seated at the head table,'' Fortune
concluded. ``Nearly one in three of its officers and managers are
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny's has learned some very difficult lessons,'' said James
B. Adamson, CEO of Advantica, which is based in Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons also have been costly. Five years ago, Denny's paid
$54.4 million to settle two class action suits brought by six black
Secret Service agents and thousands of other African-American
customers who charged that some restaurants had refused to seat or
serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Denny's will become perhaps the first national advertiser
to focus a TV campaign on the issue of race. The spots each feature
a young minority spokesperson and end with the words ``Diversity.
It's about all of us.'' Only the Denny's logo identifies the
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, a young African-American man says, ``I want to let
you in on a little secret. I'm black. There are some people who
never notice another person's color. But most of us do. And that's
OK. Don't feel guilty. Noticing a person's color doesn't make you a
racist. Acting like it matters does.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots begin airing on ABC on Wednesday night and will be
shown later in the week on NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson said he doesn't ``look at this as advertising'' but
rather hopes that the spots inspire discussion on race.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Advantica from Burger King, Adamson took over the year
after the settlement of the class action discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, he recalled immediately
instituting a new policy: ``If you discriminate, I'll fire you.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also entered a ``Fair Share'' agreement with the
NAACP to provide more employment and business opportunities for
African-Americans. A similar arrangement for Hispanics was reached
with the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. One
result is that 48 percent of Advantica's more than 50,000 employees
are minorities. This includes 33 percent of the chain's restaurant
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the members of Advantica's board of directors are
women or people of color, Adamson said. In 1993, only one Denny's
franchise was owned by an African-American. Now, African-Americans
own 123 Denny's restaurants and minorities own about 35 percent of
the company's 825 franchise restaurants. There are 1,721 Denny's
restaurants nationwide _ with slightly over half owned by the
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Advantica spent $125 million on purchases from minority
contractors last year. In 1992, the company had no minority
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny's has come a long way. There's no doubt,'' said Adamson.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first requirements was for training on racial
sensitivity, the 50-year-old CEO said. Martin Luther King Day was
proclaimed a company-wide holiday. There was some resistance to the
sweeping changes. Some employees left. Adamson said his message
was: ``This train is going one way. If you don't like it, get
off.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some setbacks. Recent years have seen a few
lingering charges of racial discrimination and some customers filed
lawsuits as recently as 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still hire America. Discrimination is going to still occur
in our restaurants,'' said Adamson. But every effort will be made
to eradicate it, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the earlier cases, he said Denny's may be ``like a
lightning rod'' for lawsuits and will litigate any they believe are
filed frivolously. And the company is striving to overcome any
reputation for racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that a number of African-Americans still believes
that Denny's discriminates,'' Adamson conceded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Denny's was named ``Corporation of the Year'' by the
Anne Arundel Branch of the NAACP in Annapolis, Md., in 1996.
Annapolis is where the black Secret Service agents filed their suit
against the restaurant. In 1997, the national office of the NAACP
gave Advantica its Fair Share Corporate Award for Minority Business
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson said the anti-discrimination policies are good business.
When treated fairly and courteously, minority customers tend to be
more loyal than white patrons, he noted, citing company surveys.

REVOLUTIONARY WAR MONUMENT TO OPEN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHUYLERVILLE, N.Y. _ One plaque shows women of the American
Revolution valiantly defending hearth and home, the other shows
primping British ladies and states that to support their indolent
ways, they demanded taxation of the Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The virulent, anti-British fervor was thought so politically
incorrect that one federal official opposed including them when in
1980 the National Park Service took over the Saratoga Monument,
which overlooks Schuylerville and houses the plaques.
</P>
<P>
   He was overruled, but the ghost voices of American history
whispering from decorations and stone and tile craftsmanship of the
19th-century monument to the Revolutionary War battle had been
muffled nonetheless. In 1987, seven years after taking custody of
the 154-foot obelisk from the state of New York, the federal
government closed it for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it appears, Patriot tales of Indian raids and the exploits
of British Gen. John Burgoyne, and American Gens. Philip Schuyler
and Horatio Gates, will soon sound again, along with footfalls of
the public inside the winding wrought-iron staircase of the
154-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government expects to pick a contractor to renovate
the long-shuttered facility before the month is over, said Doug
Lindsay, Saratoga National Historical Park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, he added, the Saratoga Monument could be open
to the public within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the monument was closed, it was still attracting a
tremendous amount of visitors,'' said Schuylerville Mayor Kim
Gamache. ``There's no doubt in my mind that once they open, it's
going to be a tremendous drawing card.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gothic and Egyptian-style edifice was conceived in 1859 by a
group of residents. Its construction was delayed by the Civil War,
but it was completed just before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It boasts an exterior with four niches to house lifesize bronze
statues of heroes of the battle. The south niche remains empty. It
symbolizes the place reserved for Benedict Arnold, a hero of the
Revolution until his name became synonymous with ``traitor.'' Other
highlights are ornamental ceramic tile and the bronze plaques on
the lower levels of the interior, and stunning views on the top
levels of a panorama that includes the Green Mountains to the east
and the Adirondacks to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But where the British gave up the fight, New England weather
picked up the cudgel. From the beginning, the monument was plagued
by problems, notably water infiltration and lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There were patchwork efforts to shore up weak points and a
lightning protection system was installed.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1986, safety inspectors recommended it be closed until a
complete analysis and repair could be undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive preservation effort was spearheaded by
then-Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., who helped get $3 million
for the Park Service, which operates the monument, as well as
nearby Schuyler House and the Saratoga Battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, an architectural and engineering study was begun. It
found the building was structurally sound, but had suffered
significant deterioration of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Finan, facility manager of Saratoga National Historical
Park, said the architects and engineers plan repairs in three
phases.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase will include stabilizing interior arches, and
restoring the stairway. A second phase will focus on removing and
conserving the decorative wall and floor features, including tiles,
statues and the bronze plaques. The final phase, he said, includes
reinstallation of the decorative items and upgrading such
infrastructure features as electricity, lighting and lightning
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really taking the monument back to its condition in the
1920s,'' Lindsay explained. ``When we open it, there will be a
ranger there at the lower floor to talk about the monument, and the
visitors will be allowed to go through and see the decorative
plaques and markers and the wonderful view.''

   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York _ a crowded concrete landscape _ has never
been easy. But for most of this century, the idea of high school
sports at least had a firm place in the roster of what public
schools were meant to do. Financing was sufficient, if not lavish.
Some schools were nationally recognized powerhouses and vibrant,
vital local institutions. But in the last quarter century, public
school sports in the city, and the physical education programs that
helped underpin them, have been devalued and cast adrift.
Interviews with more than 200 current and former coaches, teachers,
administrators and students, lay bare what happened: at a time when
medicine and sociology were establishing as never before the
benefits of physical activity for young people and as an obsession
with sports was growing across much of the rest of America, the
nation's largest public school system all but walked off the field.

that led to Jordan's decision. By Mike Wise.

 &HT;    GORE UNVEILS PROGRAMS TO HELP AMERICANS FIND HIGH-TECH JOBS
 &HT;    380&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the first-ever National Summit on Skills for the
21st Century, Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday unveiled a sweeping
agenda aimed at helping mid-career U.S. workers make the transition
into high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The program, to be included in President Clinton's fiscal 2000
budget presented in February, makes good on earlier pledges by the
Clinton team to help U.S. citizens compete with foreign workers for
technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing at the edge of the next great economy,'' Gore
said. ``Once it was land and capital, now it is knowledge. ... And
the lack of training and skills is holding back our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   To jump-start high-tech training, Gore announced the following
programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Regional skills alliances: A $60 million program to expand
efforts under the Workforce Investment Act for training of
unemployed workers. The plan would be funded partially through a
new $500 fee on companies petitioning for so-called H1-B visas for
foreign-born high-tech workers to fill vacant jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax-free education: An expansion of the Section 127 tax code
that lets employees to receive tax-free educational benefits from
employers. The tax break would extend to both undergraduate and
graduate courses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Literacy tax credits: A new tax credit for companies providing
literacy and training in English as a second language. Companies
could qualify for a 10 percent income tax credit for programs with
a maximum credit of $525 per participating employee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corporate training partnerships: As an example, Cisco Systems
Inc., a San Jose, Calif., technology giant, pledged to offer
outgoing military personnel certified computer and network training
through a joint venture with the Labor Department and
Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Web-based training directories: A novel ``America's Learning
eXchange'' (ALX) would act as an electronic Yellow Pages to give
citizens instant access to courses, training seminars and workshops
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the announcement to a packed audience at George
Washington University. The summit was broadcast by satellite to 800
communities participating in the cyber-summit across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   John Morgridge, chairman of the Cisco Systems, said the
expansion of the military program will help qualified workers make
the transition to the high-tech private sector. It's an expansion
of the company's $20 million Network Academy effort to train high
school and community college students in computer networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one level, it's self-serving because the lack of trained
technical workers to install and maintain computer networks is one
of the limiting factors on our business,'' admitted Morgridge.
``But it's one of those areas where our corporate interests meet
the community needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Military workers can get more information about the program at
the Department of Labor or the Communications Workers of America,
which is coordinating the new effort.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders such as National Association of Manufacturers
President Jerry Jasinowski praised the Clinton administration
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing the education level of our workers by one year
raises the manufacturing productivity by 8.5 percent,'' said
Jasinowski in a prepared statement. ``Each additional year of
post-high school education is worth 5 to 15 percent in increased
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The tech-worker shortage caused a political firestorm late last
year when companies pressured Congress to raise the number of H1-B
visas for foreign high-tech workers from 65,000 to 95,000 last
year, and up to 115,000 a year by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supported the increase, in part to
maintain its relationship with the wealthy high-tech community of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's summit took the form of a familiar Clinton-style town
hall meeting, complete with vignettes about people successfully
jumping from low-tech to high-tech success.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Davis, a Bellevue, Wash. resident, said he was able to
leave behind a dead-end retail job to start his own computer
business after qualifying for a two-year community college course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know how to turn on a computer,'' Davis said.
``Now my company is building them.''

MUSHROOM PASTA AND GOAT CHEESE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My restaurant's refrigerator is as well stocked as
the best Greenmarket in town, the pantry is filled with everything
from tuna to truffles, and there is never a shortage of chopped
onions, minced garlic, stemmed parsley and freshly made broths, to
say nothing of meat and fish, poultry and game.
</P>
<P>
   When inspiration strikes, chances are the raw ingredients are at
my fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Having so much available at work has spoiled me. When I'm at
home, like every other home cook, I'm faced with the prospect of
coming up with dinner based on whatever happens to be in the
fridge. I created this pasta dish, spaghetti in a very creamy goat
cheese sauce, a few weeks ago on one of my rare nights out of the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled an armful of ingredients out of the refrigerator, gave
them the once over and came up with this recipe. In the end, I
liked it so much that I refined it at my restaurant the following
day and have made it many times since, both there and at home.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is quick to make _ you can prepare it in the time it
takes to cook the pasta _ and most of the ingredients can be
varied. The pasta is dried spaghetti, but penne or farfalle works
well, too. While the pasta is boiling, I saute the cremini
mushrooms. Cremini are as easy to find as plain white mushrooms,
but they have more taste. (The dish would be even better with
shiitakes or exotic mushrooms, like chanterelles. Another choice
for another day.)
</P>
<P>
   When the pasta is al dente, I toss it with the rest of the
ingredients: those mushrooms, plus arugula, which can just as
deliciously be radicchio or watercress; soft goat cheese, which can
be replaced by half as much grated aged goat cheese for a more
intense taste; great extra virgin olive oil (essentially, it's the
sauce so it should be the best that you can get), and some of the
pasta's cooking water, which, just as in pesto, thins the sauce
without diluting the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is as satisfying as any I have planned down to the last
pinch of salt and, with all its opportunities for variation, it is
one I can probably make from my home-fridge supplies any night of
the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CREMINI MUSHROOM PASTA WITH WILTED ARUGULA, GOAT CHEESE AND
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes, plus preparation time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cremini mushrooms, trimmed and very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (tightly packed) arugula, washed, dried and cut into thin
strands
</P>
<P>
   } pound soft fresh goat cheese, crumbled, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chopped flatleaf parsley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a large pot of salted water over high heat, and bring
to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until it is al dente, about 10
minutes. While pasta is cooking, prepare remaining ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large nonstick saute pan over high heat, warm 1
tablespoon olive oil. Add half the mushrooms, and season to taste
with salt and white pepper. Saute, stirring often, about 3 minutes.
Add half the garlic and continue to cook, stirring, until garlic is
fragrant and mushrooms softened, another 3 minutes. Transfer
mushrooms and garlic to a bowl, cover to keep warm, and repeat,
cooking remaining mushrooms and garlic in another tablespoon of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. When spaghetti is cooked, reserve about { cup of the cooking
water before draining the pasta. Return pasta to cooking pot, and
add sauteed mushrooms, arugula, goat cheese, remaining 8
tablespoons olive oil, the reserved pasta water and parsley. Toss
gently until the arugula wilts and the goat cheese melts into a
creamy sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of kitchen appliances, retro is the design du jour.
Blenders are rounded and edged in chrome, pressure cookers are back
in force and coffee machines are bulky and bright, in cotton candy
colors like peach and mint.
</P>
<P>
   But none are as eye-catching as the retro-style toasters whose
sleek curves gleam like a 1950s Buick from the shelves of cookware
stores. They are beautiful specimens, almost too cool to touch.
</P>
<P>
   And in their own way, a bit frightening. The prices vary widely,
from $44.95 to a stunning $369. Does the most expensive perform
marvelous tricks that the least expensive can't? How much of this
is about looks, and how much of this is about toast?
</P>
<P>
   If you imagined that there might be some secret technological
way to make toast, you'd be wrong. It doesn't exist, not even at
$369. It's still done pretty much the same way that the cave men
did: apply heat to bread until it dries and browns.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is that the workaday toaster, the simple,
sturdy browner of bread, has entered the realm of the vanity
purchase. Silly maybe. Beautiful maybe. But ultimately, still just
a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   I tested four of the new retro-style toasters _ a Dualit, a
DeLonghi Classica, a Russell Hobbs Classic Coolwall and a Cuisinart
Classic _ along with an original 1950s Toastmaster, bought at a
used-kitchenware shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dualit, sold by Williams-Sonoma, is the most expensive _
$279 for a two-slice toaster and $369 for a four-slice _ and it has
the fewest features. It has a hand-operated lever (not set on a
spring like those on most toasters) for raising and lowering the
bread, and a windup timer that ticks ever so urgently. The Dualit
was first made in 1948 for restaurant kitchens, and it maintains
the sturdy, industrial feel of one made at that time, but with a
high polish.
</P>
<P>
   The Dualit toaster can do anything _ thin toast to sliced bagels
_ but even if it never gets used, it is a gorgeous object. It can
be ordered from Williams-Sonoma at (800) 541-2233.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dualit, prices plummet about $200. The DeLonghi
Classica is certainly not as flashy as the Dualit, but it is still
a handsome, highly stylized appliance. A simple two-slice toaster
with a lever on the side, it's tall and rounded like a loaf of
American white bread and is as shiny as a chrome fender. Just a
glance, though, is all it takes to detect the differences with the
Dualit: it is lighter, the chrome is tinny and the plastic buttons
and knobs dilute its feeling of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   But it toasts just as well: the slots are long and wide, so they
accept both long slices of country bread and thick bagel halves. As
you push down the lever, metal racks inside the slots grip the
slices, holding them in place between the heating elements so they
don't toast unevenly. And its price is a little easier to swallow _
$54.99 at Gracious Home, 1220 Third Ave. (70th Street), New York
City; (212) 517-6300.
</P>
<P>
   Almost identical in both form and functions to the DeLonghi is
the Russell Hobbs toaster. It's $44.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477
Broome St. (Wooster Street), New York City; (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuisinart Classic, by contrast, can barely be passed off as
retro. A little flatter, flimsier and less like a pumped-up tire,
it looks as if the designers went for a retro style, then chickened
out halfway.
</P>
<P>
   It has one extra feature: a reheat button. Its usefulness is
debatable, but it does actually work. If you place a slice of cold
toast in the toaster and press the reheat button, it will heat the
slice without browning it further. Its slots, however, are small
and narrow. Half a bagel will fit, but there is no way to squeeze
in a long slab of country bread. It's $49.99 at the Vinegar
Factory, 431 E. 91st Street, New York City; (212) 987-0885.
</P>
<P>
   The vintage Toastmaster, of course, is the real thing, rounded
on one side, squared on the other. Its chrome has speckled with age
but it is still shiny, solid enough to double as an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   To find it, I called used-kitchenware stores around New York
City. Vintage toasters are available now and then, many managers
said. If you look hard enough, you can track down everything from
old industrial ones to home versions. And many are reasonably
priced. The one I bought was just $20 at Kitschen, 380 Bleecker St.
(Charles Street); (212) 727-0430. It would have been $30, if not
for the slight fraying of its cord; it seemed to need nothing more
than a little polishing.
</P>
<P>
   It promised what all the others did: to make toast. Being so
old, though, it was not made to accommodate bagels and certainly
not large pieces of bread. Sandwich bread is more its speed.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged it in. Its timer ticked, but not a lick of heat
emerged from its coils. And I learned my first lesson about
shopping for vintage appliances: be sure it works before you pay
for it.

 PARTISAN POLITICS LEADS TO ABUSE OF IMPEACHMENT CLAUSES  (EDITOR'S
NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the Casper
(Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First Amendment
commentary. His e-mail address is levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<P>
   The impeachment process which has entangled President Clinton
and the Congress is full of quirks and oddities that point to the
fierce partisanship that is driving this spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has been sworn in as jurors for the president's
impeachment trial. However, three newly elected senators will have
the privilege of voting twice on the impeachment of the president _
they were representatives in the 105th Congress. The double-vote is
comparable to the member of a grand jury voting to indict a person
and then in a trial voting on his guilt or innocence. They have
become both accusers and jury. This is one reason that the 106th
Congress should have begun the process all over again from the
start and dropped the articles of impeachment as passed by the U.S.
House in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three new senators voted to impeach Clinton when they
were in the House: Jim Bunning, R-Ky., and Michael Crapo, R-Idaho.
The other freshman senator, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., voted against
impeachment. To be fair _ if the Senate were actually seeking
fairness, these senators should not be allowed to vote on whether
the president is guilty of the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If only 97 members of the Senate can vote, it would take 65
votes to bring the president down. It would still require 12
Democrats to vote guilty on one of the two articles of impeachment
_ nevertheless, the process would preserve some notion of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   When President Nixon was facing possible impeachment, the
Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee appointed an
impeachment inquiry staff to define the nature of an impeachable
offense. The staff, which ironically included attorney Hillary
Rodham before she was married to Bill Clinton, placed impeachable
offenses for a president at a high threshold _ as envisioned by the
framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The staff submitted a memo to the committee that stated in part:
</P>
<P>
   `Because impeachment of a President is a grave step for the
nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously
incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of
our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties
of the presidential office.` To be impeached, a president must have
acted to subvert the structure of our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that some of Nixon's actions surpassed the threshold
of impeachable offenses and were, indeed, `seriously incompatible
with the constitutional form and principles of our government.` The
break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters as an
act of political espionage and subsequent attempts to cover up this
and other covert activities did jeopardize our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee in the 105th Congress, however,
sought no standard for an impeachable offense. They flew into
impeachment by the seat of their partisan pants. The
Republican-controlled committee knew an impeachable offense when
they saw one _ whether they could define it or not.
</P>
<P>
   During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, James Madison
spoke to the issue of impeaching a president. According to his
notes on the convention, Madison said that impeachment should be
used when a president embezzles money or oppresses the people or
`might betray his trust to foreign powers.`
</P>
<P>
   In `The Federalist Papers,` No. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained
and defended the Constitution's provisions on impeachment. He
considered impeachment appropriate when a president violates the
public trust or damages society. Nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution were worried about Congress
abusing its impeachment powers, so they set the impeachment
standard for presidents at a high level. The standard they set for
the impeachment of a president is much higher than the two articles
of impeachment facing Clinton. The real culprit here is partisan
politics.
</P>
<P>
   When former special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski
conducted their investigations of then-President Nixon, they
avoided partisan politics. And when they presented the House
Judiciary Committee with their report, they simply provided the
results of their investigations. They did not lobby for
impeachment. In stark contrast, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr,
whose office leaked grand jury testimony that was damaging to the
president, was a shameless advocate of impeachment when he
testified before the judiciary committee. His actions caused
Starr's ethics adviser Sam Dash to resign in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The standard for the impeachment of judges is not as high as the
constitutional standard set for the impeachment of presidents. The
impeachment clause in the Constitution that pertains to judges
states that judges `shall hold their offices during good behavior.`
The constitutional standard for the impeachment of a president is
`treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.`
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for the difference. Judges are appointed,
but presidents hold office after winning a national election, after
a majority of American citizens across the country have voted for
the candidate. Only the gravest betrayal on the part of a president
can be an excuse to nullify an election.
</P>
<P>
   Judges can be and have been removed for committing perjury. Even
if Clinton committed perjury in his testimony to the grand jury
about sex with Monica Lewinsky, that action alone does not
jeopardize our nation. Lying about a sexual liaison does not
violate the public trust. The affair itself violated a marital
trust --- important to the family, but not a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The high standard of impeachment for a president does not put a
president above the law, as some claim. If, indeed, Clinton lied,
he can be prosecuted when his term of office is over.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Paula Jones did not receive justice because
of Clinton's alleged false testimony. Nonsense. Jones had her day
in court. Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed her lawsuit, saying
that even if her allegations were true, there weren't grounds to
sue. The judge also ruled that Clinton's testimony in regard to
Monica Lewinsky was irrelevant to the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate convicts Clinton on either of the two articles of
impeachment, Congress will have toppled a president by the abuse of
its powers. And Americans will have a lot more to worry about than
sex in the White House.

COURT WRESTLES WITH STUDENT-TO-STUDENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struggled Tuesday to draw the
line between schoolyard teasing and sexual harassment and
questioned whether schools should be held accountable when a
student's behavior crosses that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little boys and girls tease each other all the time,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor said during arguments on a Georgia case
involving threatening and sexually explicit conduct by a
fifth-grade boy toward a girl in his class. ``Is every one of these
incidents going to lead to a lawsuit?''
</P>
<P>
   The court must decide whether teachers and school administrators
are violating a federal law, known as Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, which protects students from sex
discrimination, when they fail to stop pupils from sexually
harassing other youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The case centers around LaShonda Davis, now 16, who was a
fifth-grader at Hubbard Elementary School in Forsyth, Ga., in the
1992-1993 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Over five months, a classmate, known only as G.F., made her life
unbearable. Whenever the chance arose, he tried to grab her
breasts, rub against her in the hallway or say sexually explicit
remarks, such as he wanted ``get in bed'' with her. One day, G.F.,
whose desk was next to LaShonda, put a doorstop in his pants and
gestured suggestively.
</P>
<P>
   LaShonda and her mother, Aurelia Davis, repeatedly told her
teacher about G.F.'s behavior. They were assured that the principal
had been informed and that G.F.'s threatening behavior would stop.
But nothing was done, and he continued to taunt and grope.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, LaShonda's mother went to the principal, who said he
would look into the matter. Again, nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Aurelia Davis sued the Monroe County School Board,
claiming that teachers and school administrators had not done
enough to protect her child from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, a U.S. District Court ruled against Mrs. Davis,
saying, ``The sexually harassing behavior of a fellow fifth-grader
is not part of a school program or activity'' and that therefore
the school was not responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 11th Circuit Court upheld the decision, saying that
while Title IX authorizes suits for sexual harassment, its coverage
does not extend to peer harassment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the appeals court's decision in the Davis case appeared
vulnerable when the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, last June that
monetary damages could be available if a school official who had
authority to do something about harassment ``has actual notice of
or is deliberately indifferent'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The June decision involved a Texas teacher's sexual harassment
of a high school student.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the Supreme Court Tuesday, Verna Williams, the
lawyer for Aurelia Davis, urged the justices to overturn the
appeals court's decision, saying schools should be held accountable
if teachers or others deliberately ignore harassment that prevents
a student from learning. In effect, Williams argued, educators are
discriminating against that child because they are allowing an
atmosphere to exist that stops the student from participating fully
in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it knows about (harassment) ... (a school) must take
reasonable steps to address and remedy it,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But W. Warren Plowden, Jr., lawyer for the Monroe County School
Board, argued that holding schools accountable for every student's
behavior would place an unfair burden on teachers and
administrators and let lawyers take part in running schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential here for litigation is enormous,'' he said,
adding that Congress never intended Title IX to be used in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX bans sexual discrimination in any educational
institution that receives federal money. The Supreme Court long has
treated sexual harassment as a form of illegal bias.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to have trouble with each side's argument, the
justices grilled both Plowden and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor asked Plowden if a school should not be held
accountable if male students block female students from entering a
classroom, thus denying them an educational opportunity. ``No, not
under Title IX,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you want to be sanctioning that,'' Justice
Antonin Scalia told Plowden.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy asked Williams why the courts should
make the schools accountable for a child's behavior. ``It's an odd,
unusual scheme when we place responsibility on the school's
principal and not the person committing the act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She replied that the high court should ``just follow the law'' _
that is, Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter said ruling in favor of Aurelia Davis would
mean that teachers and administrators would be forced to constantly
determine when teasing crosses the line and becomes sexual
harassment. He added that educators would have to make these
decisions for students of every age.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first grade, boys tease girls because they are girls,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to decide the case by July.

   INS-REFUGEES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Santiago Sal Siquinajay sat

to work in the United States; and, they hoped, create a fund
through local churches to help people in their town, Chimaltenango.
Their journey lurches between disasters and lucky breaks. Arrested
in August after crossing the Mexican border, the trio spent 98 days
in U.S. detention awaiting deportation until, unexpectedly, they
were paroled last month as part of a U.S. effort to help nations
hit by Hurricane Mitch. Since Dec. 1, more than 2,800 Central
American detainees have been released _ most from Texas detention
centers _ including four Guatemalans and Hondurans who now share a
rented house with Sal's family. Now the residents of that Spartan
home, like hundreds of thousands of other Central Americans in the
United States illegally, are being split into haves and have-nots.

CBS CHECKING IN WITH `FAWLTY TOWERS' REMAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Larroquette will be jazzed if critics think his return to
series television is a farce.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans native, a multiple Emmy winner for his work on
``Night Court'' and most recently as a brilliantly wacko killer on
``The Practice,'' is remaking ``Fawlty Towers,'' John Cleese's
slamming-door comedy of manners, as a midseason entry for CBS.
Retitled ``Payne,'' the half-hour comedy has Larroquette playing a
contemptuous and contemptible hotelier named Royal Payne,
proprietor of Whispering Pines on the California coast. JoBeth
Williams reprises the spousal role that Prunella Scales created
opposite Cleese in the British original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fawlty Towers'' is considered a cult classic, partly because
Cleese made only 12 episodes of the zany series _ six in 1975 and
six about five years later. The pilot episode of ``Payne'' is far
less manic than Cleese's work, but Larroquette says that's of
necessity. He said he has watched all 12 episodes of ``Fawlty
Towers'' in one sitting and has needed a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we try and do 22 of those,'' he said, ``we'd be
dead by the end of the season. And I think most viewers would be
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for most refreshing quote of the winter press tour
goes to Ted Harbert, former chairman of ABC Entertainment and now a
producer with DreamWorks SKG. Harbert is an executive producer of
``It's Like, You Know ...,'' a comedy premiering on ABC March 24.
He said appearing before critics in the role of producer is way
less stressful than as a network cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' he said, ``is I actually don't have to lie
here. ... The job of the network person is to say that they love
every show, and that's not the case. The network person doesn't
love every show that they put on, (but) when they stand before you
they're not going to say, `Well, we paid for it so we're putting it
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Robert Halmi Sr., king of the classics (``Gulliver's
Travels,'' ``Moby Dick,'' ``Merlin,'' ``The Odyssey''), will bring
``Cleopatra'' to the small screen next.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Margaret George's enormous 1997 novel, ``The Memoirs of
Cleopatra,'' the four-hour ABC miniseries is slated for May, with
Leonor Varela (``The Man in the Iron Mask'') as Cleopatra, Billy
Zane as Marc Antony and Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Halmi is undaunted by last fall's poor ratings for his
production of ``Crime and Punishment'' on NBC. And, though he said
``Cleopatra'' will be more honest than previous treatments, that
doesn't mean it won't be sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to show here is not particularly for sex's
sake,'' Halmi said. ``It is the involvement of this wonderful woman
with two incredible men. ... If it's sensuous, it's sensuous, but
that was not the object of the game at all.''
</P>
<P>
   This just in: ABC has abandoned plans for a new project with
Mary Tyler Moore. It is proceeding with plans for a new drama
created by ``Twin Peaks'' auteur David Lynch. ``Mulholland Drive,''
according to ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses, is a drama
about a large group of people ``and their relationships, their
dreams and their turmoils.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arctic air will clash with warm, moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico on Wednesday and Wednesday night, setting the stage for
rain. Rain will be moderate to locally heavy in some areas along a
stationary front stretching from east Texas and Louisiana to the
upper Ohio Valley. In the mild, moist air mass south of the front,
scattered clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop across
the Gulf Coast states as far east as the northwest corner of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of freezing rain, sleet and snow are likely just north
of the stationary front from the middle Mississippi Valley to the
eastern Great Lakes as cold air flowing southwestward from a strong
high pressure system over Ontario wedges under and lifts moist air.
Snow and ice accumulations, where they occur, will be generally
light to moderate because much of the moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico will be intercepted at the front.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of dense morning fog will shroud parts of the northern
Middle Atlantic and southern New England states Wednesday morning,
particularly in areas where moist air lingered over chilly
snow-covered ground Tuesday night. Meanwhile, arctic air flowing
south from the Ontario high will press slowly into the Northeast,
causing areas of rain or drizzle to change to snow across southern
New England. As ocean winds from the northeast increase along the
New England coast, bands of ocean-effect snow will develop on Cape
Cod on Wednesday or Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to heavy rain will douse the Coastal Range and Olympic
Mountains of Washington as moist Pacific air races inland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Snowbound
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an intense snow squall dumped 7 inches of snow on
Buffalo, N.Y. This snowfall, in combination with the 40 inches that
has recently fallen, has forced the city to declare a state of
emergency. In most areas, snow occurs from low pressure systems
that derive their energy from high-altitude jet stream
disturbances. While Buffalo has received much snow from these
``regular'' lows, much of the city's snow has come courtesy of
upstream Lake Erie as cold winds gather moisture from the lake and
deposit it downwind as snow. The recent spat of arctic chill has
forced the lake-snow machine into over-drive.

WHY THEY ARE LOYAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's antagonists don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot figure out why the president they find so odious
continues to inspire devotion in friends and allies who refuse to
betray him to independent counsel Kenneth Starr as well as the
majority of ordinary voters who tell the pollsters they don't want
him dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative New York Times columnist William Safire expressed
this frustration recently, musing about ``the loyalty mystery'' and
speculating that there must be some hidden secret to explain what
he considers the ``incredible attachment of this great nation to
this ungreat man.''
</P>
<P>
   Safire is a thoughtful fellow. Some guys on the right use their
noggins just fine. My husband, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   And Safire's bewilderment is understandable. It is indeed
passing strange that Clinton's job approval ratings have remained
high throughout the worst year of his or practically any
presidency. The polls repeatedly show that a majority of voters are
determined to support him, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   But the loyalty of intimates and administration officials
willing to be indicted, scorned by their peers or publicly
humiliated rather than let down their chum Bill Clinton is more
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency up close can be intoxicating, the instinct to
protect its important occupant irresistible. This phenomenon is
even more compelling when compounded by the whiff of political gun
powder from an impeachment battle. In any them-versus-us showdown,
responsible souls will side with ``us'' every time.
</P>
<P>
   There are many theories about Clinton's improbable popularity,
including a strong economy, a Baby Boomer reaction to the
generational culture wars and a pro-privacy backlash against the
heavy-handed, intrusive tactics of his persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Safire suggests that complicated theories don't really explain
it. He reluctantly concludes that ``widespread affection'' is the
answer, although he finds this a deplorable sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   My own thesis is different. It is not Clinton's winsome
personality but his public policies and deeds that sustain him,
bolstered by the absence of a widely acceptable political
alternative. He is not so much loved as appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Americans admire a gutsy performance. Anyone with eyes and ears
knows Clinton carries on with his head held high, constantly
signaling that whatever his internal moral weakness, he possesses
the requisite intestinal fortitude to lead the nation in crisis.
That's what we put him in the White House to do, and he's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll, taken last weekend as
the Senate prepared for his trial, 67 percent of those surveyed
said they approved of the way he is handling his job. His ratings
were higher throughout last year than any previous year of his
presidency. Of the 63 percent who said he should not be convicted,
87 percent said he is doing a good job running the country and 73
percent said they support his policies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half said they did not respect the
president as a person.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters are judging Clinton not on his private
behavior but on his public life. They like the direction he is
taking the country better than the ideas of the congressional
Republicans, who get a favorability rating of only 40 percent. The
GOP is increasingly seen as overtly obstructionist and partisan,
its basic message of wholesale tax cuts hasn't caught on and it has
developed no hot new issues for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Women in particular make this point. Conservatives complain that
women are hypocritical since a majority of them continue to back
the president despite his alleged predatory sexual habits that
women's groups abhor. But many women appreciate Clinton policies
that they view as family-friendly and are uncomfortable with
Republican positions against abortion, affirmative action, day care
subsidies and other programs aimed at helping women to cope. To
them, Clinton beats the alternative.

NEW YORKERS EMBRACE A LITTLE SHANGHAI SPECIALTY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They go by more than a few names on Chinese menus:
steamed tiny buns, juicy dumplings and crab-meat-and-pork soupy
buns are just some of the terms for what the Chinese call xiao long
bao, and for what Americans know as soup dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   The soup dumpling is a Shanghai specialty, a flowery little
packet of delicate dough twisted up at the top. It usually contains
some combination of minced pork, shrimp or crab, and for a final
touch, a spoonful of hot broth. Together, the flavors explode in
the mouth, though even when nibbled expertly, it is hard to eat a
soup dumpling without leaving a trace on your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, New Yorkers have fallen in love with the soup
dumpling, which has led to the opening of dozens of Shanghai
restaurants all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The embrace of the soup dumpling has been so overwhelming that
some say it is distracting New Yorkers from truly appreciating the
extent of the richly varied Shanghai cuisine, with its wonderful
marinated cold appetizers and exceptional seafood dishes. But it
has been good for the Chinese restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long, we stuff, stuff, stuff,'' said Joe Si, an owner
of Joe's Shanghai, speaking of his soup dumplings. ``In Chinatown,
so many American people come here. The American favorite is soupy
buns.''
</P>
<P>
   Si, who with his brother Peter Lam, opened the first Joe's
Shanghai in Flushing, Queens, in 1995, has parlayed the soup
dumpling into a thriving minichain, with branches in Chinatown and
Elmhurst, Queens, and with a branch to open in February on West
56th Street in Manhattan. Joe's is not the only restaurant
capitalizing on the craze.
</P>
<P>
   Goody's, a long-established restaurant co-owned by Si's sister,
Susan Chan, in Rego Park, Queens, recently opened another branch in
Chinatown. Shanghai Tang opened last May in Flushing and is
planning to open in midtown Manhattan this year. Evergreen opened
in Chinatown last summer and is planning to open an upscale
Shanghai seafood restaurant on East 38th Street in Manhattan in the
coming months. Helen Hsu, whose husband owned Say Eng Look, perhaps
the most famous of the old Chinese restaurants before it closed in
1996, recently opened a Shanghai restaurant, New Green Bo, on
Bayard Street in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, at least half a dozen other Shanghai restaurants
opened in Chinatown in 1998, and many Chinese restaurants are
adding Shanghai specialties like the soup dumpling to their menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of American people like xiao long bao very much,'' said
Wing Nin Chan, the owner of Shanghai Tang, marveling at this
unexpected attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, this is not the first exposure that Americans have
had to Shanghai cooking, not by a long shot. The first
non-Cantonese Chinese restaurant in New York, says Michael Tong,
the owner of Shun Lee Palace and Shun Lee West, both in Manhattan,
was a Shanghai restaurant that opened in 1949. Many more opened on
Broadway above 100th Street. ``In those days, if you were not from
Canton, you couldn't find a space in Chinatown,'' Tong said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Shanghai restaurants opened in the Chinatown area, mostly
east of Chatham Square. ``There've been Shanghai restaurants all
along,'' said Leonard Lopate, the host of ``New York and Company''
on WNYC-AM, who has lived in the Chinatown area for 30 years.
``They just weren't brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as the soup dumpling has been for business, its success
hasn't made every Chinese restaurateur entirely happy. Tong, for
one, fears that the focus on the dumpling, a common breakfast food
in Shanghai, causes people to ignore other Shanghai specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into some of these restaurants in Chinatown, you can
have the juicy dumplings, but the rest of the food is not so
great,'' he said. ``Many Caucasian people don't really understand
what Shanghai cooking is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai, a center of style and
commerce that draws its population from all over China, the cooking
of Shanghai is a distinctive blend of Chinese regional cuisines. As
one of the first Chinese cities to open to the Western world in the
mid-19th century, Shanghai was also heavily influenced by Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai is the only city in China where wheat flour has
always been a very important component in people's diets,'' said
Wangshang Li, who was born in Hangzhou, outside Shanghai, and is
the director of legal services at the New York Association for New
Americans. ``One would think it's very odd, but it's the Western
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated in a region of plenty, Shanghai is blessed with a
wonderful climate and vast fertile fields full of rice, vegetables
and fruit. The surrounding lakes, rivers and sea are rich with all
manner of fresh and saltwater seafood, and the region is known for
the exceptional quality of its soy sauce, vinegar and rice wine.
Shanghai chefs typically add a touch of sweetness to their dishes
and are gentle with spices and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern China is nicknamed the Land of Fish and Rice,'' said
Nina Simonds, a cookbook author and an authority on Chinese
cooking. ``You find that the seasonings are rather light, and they
accentuate the flavor of the ingredient. The emphasis is really on
the ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai restaurants make wonderful cold appetizers, like smoked
fish, which is not smoked at all but coated in caramelized sugar
and flavored with star anise. Drunken crabs, which are simply
marinated in rice wine and served cracked and raw, have a
gelatinous consistency and a wonderful, gingery flavor. Shanghai
chefs make fabulous dishes with eel, like tiny slivers of sauteed
eel bathed in a sweet ginger sauce, and sumptuous show stoppers
like a whole pork shoulder in a sauce of soy and ginger. Yellowfish
is prepared in many ways, from whole steamed fishes as beautiful as
they are delicious to little cylinders of fish that are wrapped in
seaweed and deep fried.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most Shanghai restaurants, particularly those in Chinatown, are
modest, bright and inexpensive. Their specialities include cold
appetizers like drunken crabs, wined chicken, aromatic beef and
spicy cabbage, and main courses like braised pork shoulder, eel in
brown sauce, and just about anything with yellowfish. If these
dishes are on the menu, it is probably a true Shanghai restaurant,
rather than one that has just added a few Shanghai dishes.

<P>
   EVERGREEN SHANGHAI 63 Mott St., between Canal and Bayard

 &HT;    BABY BOOM AGING NOT A CRISIS, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The aging of the Baby Boomer generation, which has
spurred calls for reforming Social Security and Medicare, should
not be cause for panic, says a report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aging of society is a manageable challenge,'' said Robert
B. Friedland, director of the National Academy on an Aging Society,
an institute of the non-profit Gerontological Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   Policy experts have warned of dire consequences to the economy
and programs such as Social Security and Medicare when the roughly
76 million baby boomers _ those born between 1946 and 1964 _ reach
retirement age beginning in 12 years. Medicare is expected to go
broke within a decade and the best guess for Social Security is
that it won't be able to pay all expenses by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   But the academy report argues the impact will be far less
burdensome than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of elderly is expected to double to about 70
million by 2040, the report notes that the elderly population _
those 65 and over _ doubled three times during the past century.
</P>
<P>
   The last doubling occurred since 1960, but during that time the
nation's economy _ adjusted for inflation _ more than tripled, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The term baby boom applies to all 76 million people born during
the post-World War II generation, but the report notes that if
births had remained at pre-war levels, 64 million children would
have been born during those years. Thus the ``boom'' was 12 million
spread out over 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the number of babies born during the last 18
years has almost equalled the number born after WWII.
</P>
<P>
   Because of varying birth and death rates and immigration, it's
difficult to predict how many people will live in the United States
in the next century. The report notes that the Census Bureau has
issued population predictions for 2040 that vary by 170 million
people _ more than half the current U.S. population of 271 million.
Estimates for the elderly population vary by more than 33 million.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also disagree about how fast the economy will grow
during the next half century. The Clinton administration predicts
average rates of 2.3 percent a year; the Congressional Budget
Office predicts 1.5 percent a year. Since 1950, the rate of
economic growth has been 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy grows at 1 percent a year until 2030, the gross
domestic product will be over $10 trillion. If it grows 3 percent a
year, it will be over $19 trillion, measured in constant dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Friedland said the nation will not grow its way out of future
problems, but the impact may be less severe than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, one of the public trustees for the Medicare and
Social Security trust funds which issues the annual predictions
about the program's health, served as co-chair of an expert working
group which helped produce the report.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Moon said the prudent course of
action would be to use the trustee's report as a starting point for
reform despite the likelihood that it might be inaccurate over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   The academy report was not intended ``as a justification for
doing nothing,'' she said.

`MUMMIES OF URUMCHI': SILENT GIANTS AS GUIDES ON AN ANCIENT
THOROUGHFARE
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: publication notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wayland Barber, who teaches archaeology at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, begins this fascinating excursion into
prehistory with the eponymous mummies of her title. There is, for
example, the Cherchen Man of about 1000 B.C., a 6-foot-6-inch giant
with Caucasian features found wrapped in colorful textiles in a
tomb in the sandy, salty Tarim Basin of far western China. Then
there is the Beauty of Loulan, a thousand years older then the
Cherchen man; she also has Caucasian features, and is dressed in
woolen clothing and provided with a winnowing tray that is placed
on her chest with some grains of domesticated wheat.
</P>
<P>
   There is something both horrible and endearing about mummies,
with their hollow eyes and shrunken skins, their defiance of
fleshly disintegration and their status as mute witnesses of
ancient times. It is the mute witness aspect of them that interests
Ms. Barber, whose ``Mummies of Urumchi'' is an ingenious and
far-reaching exposition of the meaning of Cherchen Man, the Beauty
of Loulan and various other archaeological finds to which she makes
reference.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Barber's volume, impressively erudite and yet easy
to read (a rare combination), begins with mummies now kept in the
Urumchi Museum and expands her work into a kind of prehistorical
Theory of Everything. At the very least, the reader will learn a
great deal from her book, which provides a global view of the
movements of ancient peoples through a police-detective-like
interpretation of the artifacts they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barber shows essentially that Central Asia was the greatest
thoroughfare in the world for early peoples and the spread of their
languages and technology, and she uses these Tarim Basin mummies to
make her persuasive case.
</P>
<P>
   The question she sets out to answer is: Where did these large
Caucasians come from? In providing an answer, she pulls together an
enormous amount of research by herself and others. Ms. Barber is an
expert on ancient textiles, whose techniques of manufacture she
carefully explains and then cleverly uses as clues to the nature of
cultural and technological interaction.
</P>
<P>
   An almost bewildering array of other scholarly evidence also
comes into the picture as she builds her thesis, which is this: The
prehistoric civilizations of Europe and Asia expanded from common
places of origin, most likely the grasslands of western Central
Asia, and did not originate independently in, say, the Tarim Basin
and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   To make her point (which includes the startling news that there
is a connection between the Tarim Basin and Ireland) Ms. Barber
follows the spread of such things as weaving techniques and
domestication of plants and animals, showing a general movement
from West to East. She combines her examination of technology with
historical accounts, with information about weather patterns, the
spread of language groups and, most recently, DNA evidence to show
the origins of the likes of Cherchen Man and the Beauty of Loulan
and to demonstrate the complicated interactions of Bronze and Iron
Age peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of grains of wheat and woolen clothing in the
4,000-year-old tomb of the Beauty of Loulan illustrates Ms.
Barber's method. The Beauty of Loulan and the other mummies that
Ms. Barber discusses are in a museum in Urumchi, the capital of
Xinjiang, the autonomous region of western China through which the
fabled Silk Road once made its way toward the West. The wheat and
the wool that were found with the mummies could not have come from
China itself, Ms. Barber concludes, because neither of them existed
there in 2,000 B.C. Nor were they indigenous to the Tarim Basin,
the huge, former inland lake that lies within a vast circle formed
by the highest mountains in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The domestication of wheat and the creation of woolly sheep came
from the Fertile Crescent (the arc running from Turkey to
Mesopotamia that we all learned about in elementary school), Ms.
Barber continues. The migration of the people who were the
ancestors of the Urumchi mummies had to come after 4,000 B.C.,
which was the earliest that wheat and wool could have reached the
places where they lived. Some clothing found on mummies in the
Xinjiang oasis of Hami, Ms. Barber notes, shows ``an uncanny
resemblance to a series of textiles of the same age from Central
Europe, woven by ancestors of the Celts _ fellow Indo-Europeans
from the other end of Eurasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barber also cites evidence indicating that the people of the
Tarim Basin spoke a language called Tokharian that is closely
related to Celtic. Both belong to the great family of languages
known as Indo-European. Tracing the origin of plaid cloth to
Anatolia and the Caucasus, the steppe area north of the Black Sea,
her conclusion is: ``Starting from the general vicinity of the
Caucasus, one group went west, the other east.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barber explores basic questions, like what prompted the
steppe nomads of the Caucasus to pick up and leave for points both
east and west? To answer, she provides summaries of many elements
in the archaeological and historical puzzle, from the history of
the domestication of the horse and the development of spoked
chariot wheels to changes in climate.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of her book, Ms. Barber completes the history of the
people to which at least some of the mummies of the Tarim Basin
belong. They arrived from the Central Asian steppe in the first and
second millenniums B.C. They were eventually pushed out of the
Tarim Basin and went to present-day Afghanistan and northern India.
There they became Buddhists and were also affected by the Greeks
who came to the areas with Alexander the Great in the fourth
century B.C. Eventually, they returned along the Silk Road to
Xinjiang, bringing Buddhism and Greco-Roman art with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barber's story, in other words, goes far beyond Cherchen Man
and the Beauty of Loulan to explain much of the early history of
the world. And she accomplishes this considerable feat in a
carefully and helpfully illustrated book that is not only full of
information but also a pleasure to read.

COLOMBIAN DEATH SQUADS ENDANGERING PEACE TALKS, SAY ANALYSTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note change in slugline) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ After a three-day rampage by paramilitary
death squads that killed at least 139 people, Colombians are
demanding that their government either negotiate with the outlawed
militias or fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The massacres began just a day after peace talks opened last
week between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Colombia's largest Marxist guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warned that the talks could unravel if President Andres
Pastrana's administration fails to deal with the far-right
paramilitaries _ who target guerrillas and their civilian
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are organized groups that have demonstrated a capacity,
an evil ability, to create havoc. We would be naive and stupid if
we didn't take them into account in the peace process,'' said Juan
Manuel Santos, a member of a government-appointed peace commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana is in a very delicate situation,'' added Robin Kirk,
who monitors Colombia for Human Rights Watch, an independent
organization, in Washington. ``I think the talks will survive this,
but they may not survive the fourth or the fifth (paramilitary)
offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, heavily armed gunmen began sweeping through towns and
villages in six of Colombia's 32 states. The paramilitaries robbed
and burned houses and rounded up men, women and children. The
attackers shot, beheaded or slit the throats of the civilians,
according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in shooting and knocking down doors and grabbed
people indiscriminately,'' said one distraught survivor in the
village of El Tigre in southern Putumayo state where 26 people were
slain. ``Children and students who had nothing to do with the war
were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll is likely to climb because scores of people
remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Teodoro Diaz, mayor of the northern city of Apartado, announced
that the paramilitaries had circulated a ``hit list'' with 100
names.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commission for Human Rights accused the
paramilitaries of ``systematic attacks against the civilian
population'' and expressed ``dismay`` over the failure of the
Colombian army and police to protect people from the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday &UR; ,  &LR; President Pastrana promised a crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to reinforce (the army),'' Pastrana said. ``They
are going to embark on operations to control this escalation by the
paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Through massacres and selective assassinations, the
paramilitaries, who have 5,000 fighters in 29 fronts, have managed
to roll back some of the recent military gains by the FARC and the
National Liberation Army, or ELN, a smaller rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 120,000-man Colombian army appears to be losing
ground.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, some 20,000 FARC and ELN fighters
have battered the army and the police in a series of attacks,
capturing more than 300 troops in the process. Government forces
also have been ambushed by the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep 15 or 20 police in a municipality, and then 100,
150, or 200 rebels or paramilitaries arrive and it's impossible to
control the situation,'' said Alberto Builes Ortega, the governor
of Antioquia state, which was the hardest hit in the offensive.
``There needs to be a much better use of military intelligence,
better training and more troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries sprang up in the 1980s in response to
guerrilla attacks. They are financed by cattle ranchers and other
large landowners _ many of whom were victims of rebel kidnappings
and extortion. Some of the groups, however, provide protection for
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Human Rights Watch, the paramilitaries are
responsible for the majority of human rights abuses committed in
Colombia and have carried out hundreds of massacres. Authorities
claim that their raids have displaced more than 300,000 peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they enjoy the backing of many upper-class Colombians, who
credit them with preventing a rebel triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have a separate command structure and source of
weapons, the paramilitaries operate ``frequently and in direct
coordination with Colombian security forces,'' according to a
report released last year by Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that there is little enthusiasm by either the army
or the police to go after the paramilitaries because they are often
viewed as allies rather than enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramilitaries have an important base of support from
ranchers, farmers and businessmen,'' said Alfredo Molano, a
sociologist and author. ``It's not easy to break these ties, or the
ties between the army and the paramilitaries. Why? Because they are
useful. ... They are the ones who can undertake illegal
operations.``
</P>
<P>
   The government has arrested more than 100 paramilitaries in the
past year, and has offered a $1 million bounty for the capture of
Carlos Castano, the commander of the paramilitary umbrella
organization known as the United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kirk, of Human Rights Watch, said the list of detained
paramilitaries includes only a few high-ranking members and that
the government has ignored the groups' financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any evidence that there is a plan on the
ground or working'' to round up important paramilitary leaders,
Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the government has to decide: either they
attack the paramilitaries with the possibility that it divides the
army, or they accept that the paramilitaries continue and break off
the talks with the FARC,'' Molano said.
</P>
<P>
   Castano was rumored to have been killed in a rebel raid on his
headquarters in northern Colombia last month. But he escaped, and
the paramilitary offensive may have been a response to the
guerrilla attack.

NEW STUDIES CAUSE WORRY ABOUT PLASTIC WRAP SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plastic wrap seals so many everyday foods in the supermarket,
from cheese to meat, that it's easy to take it for granted. But now
there is a new worry about exactly how safe this ubiquitous
convenience product may be.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that some plastic wraps contain endocrine
disrupters, which can mimic or interfere with hormones in the body.
The Environmental Protection Agency has begun to screen thousands
of chemicals to see which ones may be endocrine disrupters and need
further study.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have suggested that hormone disrupters can cause
breast cancer, birth defects, low sperm count and mental problems.
While evidence continues to accumulate that disrupters have an
effect on animals, scientists are in heated debate about its
meaning for humans. In the meantime, some consumers are acting on
their own to to minimize exposure.
</P>
<P>
   As hormones travel though the bloodstream, they affect
metabolism, growth, reproduction and other bodily functions. The
disrupters can throw a monkey wrench into that finely tuned
endocrine system. The best known of the suspected endocrine
disrupters are dioxin, DDT and PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Some data suggest that a plasticizer in some forms of the wrap,
known in the industry as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cling wrap, is an
endocrine disrupter. The chemical name for this plasticizer, a
component that adds clinginess to the wrap, is
di-(2-ethylhexyl)adipate, or DEHA. This plasticizer is in the
plastic film grocery stores use to wrap wedges of cheese and meat
and also in at least one brand of household wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Because research has shown that plasticizers can leach into food
on contact, especially food with a high fat content, Consumers
Union recently tested prewrapped cheese. Nineteen pieces of cheese
were analyzed, and the seven that were wrapped in the PVC cling
wrap used by supermarkets contained consistently high levels of
DEHA. The levels ranged from 51 to 270 parts per million, with an
average of 153.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very large amounts,'' said Edward Groth, an
environmental scientist and food safety specialist with Consumers
Union, though he acknowledged that no one knows if the levels are
harmful. The European Community has set a provisional limit of 18
parts per million for DEHA migration from plastic wraps to food.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study, Consumers Union tested seven national and
store brands of consumer plastic wrap for plasticizers: Glad
Crystal Clear Polyethylene, Duane Reade, Foodtown, Dowbrands Saran
Wrap, America's Choice, White Rose and Reynolds Plastic Wrap. Only
Reynolds Wrap was found to be made with DEHA. There is no way to
tell by looking at the box if a wrap contains DEHA.
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds Metals Co. issued a statement saying it was in full
compliance with all regulatory agencies: ``DEHA is used in Reynolds
Plastic Wrap,'' it said. ``However, there has never been a study
that Reynolds is aware of that connects this material with
endocrine disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Society of the Plastics Industry, an industry group, says
that the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental
Protection Agency have both given DEHA a clean bill of health.
``There is no reason to believe DEHA is an endocrine disrupter,''
Dr. George Pauli, the director of the division of product policy in
the FDA's office of premarket approval, said in an interview last
week. In 1996, the agency had said there was ``insufficient
evidence at this time'' to demonstrate that DEHA causes hormone
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of sufficient evidence was due to the absence of
studies, said Dr. Gina Solomon, a physician and senior scientist
with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental
group, in San Francisco. A number of studies done since 1996
indicate that ``DEHA is almost certainly an endocrine disrupter,''
she said last week. ``DEHA has been studied in a number of species
of rodents, where it has been shown to interfere with male
reproductive function in all species,'' she said. ``The question
is, what does that mean for humans? It is still unclear what the
risks are.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the European Community's Scientific Committee for
Food, the estimated safe daily DEHA dose for a 40-pound child would
be exceeded by merely eating one and a half ounces of the seven
high-scoring cheese samples in the Consumers Union study. For a
130-pound adult, four ounces would be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union wants the United States to require manufacturers
to replace DEHA with a safer plasticizer, as British manufacturers
did 10 years ago. In a letter to the FDA, Groth said DEHA had not
been adequately evaluated for its possible endocrine effects. ``It
is a risk we consider potentially more significant than
carcinogenicity for this chemical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods Markets, a chain of 87 natural food supermarkets
across the country, is not waiting for government action. It is
asking manufacturers of the cling wrap used in their stores
directly whether the products contain DEHA, said Margaret
Wittenberg, the quality assurance director.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, consumers can take steps now to reduce exposure to
DEHA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove cling wrap immediately from cheese or meat, and store
the product in a plastic bag or container.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove most DEHA, at least from hard cheeses, by using a
cheese slicer to take off a millimeter of the surface. You can also
scrape off a very fine layer of meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Purchase meat from a butcher, and ask for it to be wrapped in
paper. Purchase cheese from a wheel, and ask to have it wrapped in
paper or put in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep food in a ceramic bowl covered with plastic, without
letting it touch the food.
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances should you permit plastic wrap to touch
food when it is cooked in a microwave oven. Even the plastics
industry agrees on that.

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF NINERS 
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Re-sign Jerry Rice? Sure, fine, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Let him go? OK by us.
</P>
<P>
   Stand staring slack-jawed into space, petrified by the choices
and the lack of people empowered to make them? Well, that's the
plan that's worked so far.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing yet, it looks like the plan for the foreseeable
future. The San Francisco 49ers are brain-locked, quite possibly in
retreat, and looking tired and confused _ a really bad look with
the new millennium only 16 games away.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new message. There is a cottage industry out there
guessing the date, time and weight of the 49ers' plummet from
grace, and it has operated for most of the last decade. It has been
consistently wrong, through Bill Walsh's first retirement, Joe
Montana's trade, Deion Sanders' departure, Charles Haley's exile,
George Seifert's dismissal, Carmen Policy's flight and Eddie
DeBartolo's copped plea.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the happy news in their current situation, though, takes
more than blind optimism, alcohol-fortified loyalty or obstinate
ancestor worship. Everywhere you look, there is the taste of recent
failure, and the best you can say is that the future looks really,
really weird. Either Walsh has one more miracle up his cerebrum, or
the dance is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   But since you don't believe such dire notices, let's break it
down:
</P>
<P>
   EDDIE DEBARTOLO: He has not yet been cleared to reclaim his team
by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and though nobody knows when
that clearance will come, nobody expects it before the owners'
meetings in March. So he sits and stews, kept at arm's length from
his raison d'etre, the latest irritant being the possibility that
he will never have the new football-megamall-zillionplex movie
emporium he worked so hard two years ago to win at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he has to remodel and beautify Candlestick Park largely on
his own dime (or more precisely, 2 billion dimes. He has to repair
a reputation shredded by his guilty plea on federal bribery
charges, his clumsy and unnecessary feud with Policy, and his
humiliating spat with his sister Denise York. And he has to compete
with the idealized version of himself from the days when money was
no object and he had the only Bill Walsh offense in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling flaming meat cleavers with one's feet is easier.
</P>
<P>
   BILL WALSH: Despite the daily reports that he is coming to
re-employ his brain in service to the franchise, he hasn't arrived
yet, leaving a sensible person to wonder what the holdup might be.
Plus, Walsh comes to draw not on the empty slate that was the 49ers
of the late '70s, but a 49ers team aging but not yet decrepit,
vulnerable but not yet mediocre, and very expensive but not close
to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   He is supposed to be the player personnel genius, but
identifying and signing talent was a much easier matter when there
was no such thing as a salary cap, let alone one that is overfilled
by more than $24 million, as this one is. He has to undo quickly
the damage done by the Dwight Clark-Vinny Cerrato talent
administration, whose underwhelming drafts have left the 49ers old
and creaky in too many positions.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE MARIUCCI: Still doesn't have the contract extension he was
told he would have in November by the ethereal ex-interim President
Larry Thrailkill and has come to expect as his due for winning 27
games in two years. Rumors continue that he wants the deal done
quickly or he will ask to be released from the three years left on
his present contract, all the better to rejoin Policy in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, his reputation here has taken the same hits that Seifert's
did in each of the six years Seifert didn't reach the Super Bowl _
that he doesn't understand game planning, he doesn't adjust, he
hasn't paid proper homage to the Walsh playbook, and mostly that he
isn't Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROSTER: Old, and getting older. Expensive, to the point of
salary cap strangulation. Thin on defense, a Walsh staple through
the glory days. Slow in many skill positions, an outrage under
Walsh. No longer among the top two teams in the NFC, where they
have been all but a few times in the last 18 years. Most people
agree the team must be rebuilt, although they argue on re-signing
specific players like Rice, wide receiver J.J. Stokes and safety
Tim McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   THE CONCEPT: This is the strangest thing of all. When the 49ers
get into a bind, they invariably look inward for help, a sensible
idea when used in moderation but damp dynamite when substituted for
dynamic decision-making. Walsh's hiring in 1979 was a bold,
aggressive and indisputably wise move ... drafting Montana despite
his allegedly so-so arm to fly in the face of the prevailing wisdom
of the day ... trading up to draft Rice in 1985 when they were
loaded at wide receiver ... trading for Young in 1987 when Montana
was at the height of his powers ... signing Deion Sanders in 1994
to reinvent their defense ... these were all acts of a purposeful
organization, one that knew what it wanted and understood how to
achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   This new 49ers empire is, well, deeply steeped in its past, for
good and ill. Walsh may be able to return to the organization its
direction and purpose, but then again, he may not. It's been 20
years, after all, and the Bill Walsh of 1979 had nowhere to take
the 49ers but up. This time, he has nowhere to take them but down _
unless it's to continue the organization's dizzying spiral to
nowhere in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the longest shot of all, that he can outdo himself in this
new and bizarre environment. At least he'll know one thing:
Whatever he accomplishes in his new job, he'll do it at Candlestick
Park _ the most enduring part of the empire.

FRESH PEANUT BUTTER TO SPREAD AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Someday, Lee Zalben may be a full-fledged grown-up.
For now, he is directing his entrepreneurial energy to indulging
his inner child. He has opened Peanut Butter &AMP; Co. in Manhattan, a
homey throwback whose fare is built mostly on the namesake spread.
</P>
<P>
   Fluffernutters? Yes. PB&AMP;J.? Of course. For more sophisticated
tastes there is a peanut butter and Nutella sandwich. But the
crowd-pleaser is the Elvis: a fried peanut butter and banana
sandwich with honey.
</P>
<P>
   All the peanut butter, made fresh from Zalben's blend of
roasted, salted Virginia peanuts, is slathered on Orwasher's bread
and served on Fiestaware. Sandwiches are $5 to $5.50, and if you
don't want peanut butter, there are also tuna fish, cream cheese
and jelly and grilled cheese. A Mary Jane candy comes with the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Zalben also offers assorted varieties of milk, including Lactaid
and soy milk, along with desserts like peanut butter cookies,
peanut butter tiramisu and a peanut butter banana split. Smooth or
crunchy peanut butter can be had with cinnamon and raisins, white
or dark chocolate chips and a spicy flavor that is still being
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter to go is $4 for a 16-ounce jar plain, $5 flavored.
Unlike the natural commercial brands made without hydrogenated fat,
it does not separate in a hurry because of its freshness. ``It
takes a long time for the oil to work its way out,'' Zalben said.
Still, he has a Skippy presence: a framed vintage advertisement
featuring Basil Rathbone making a face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winter has barely set up shop in New York, and already there are
bunches of spring, or salad, onions in the markets. These small,
mild-tasting, long-stemmed onions could once be found only in late
spring in the Greenmarkets, but like asparagus, they've started
ignoring the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Baby onions are even coming from Vidalia, Ga., home of the sweet
onion once available only in spring and early summer but now sold
much of the year, thanks to the kind of nitrogen-enriched storage
used for apples.
</P>
<P>
   Growers say the baby Vidalias are an early variety. Others, like
Oso Sweet onions from Chile, are also sold in shops like Manhattan
Fruit Exchange in the Chelsea Market. All sell for $2 to $2.50 a
bunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Whole Heaven Catalog, by Marcia and Jack Kelly (Bell
Tower/One Spirit, $18) is not a takeoff on the old counterculture
directory but a guide to programs, goods and services offered by
250 religious, spiritual and cooperative communities. Some, like
Black Oak Ranch in Laytonville, Calif., are outgrowths of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items listed are baked goods, wines, preserves,
cheeses, candies and other foods, including molasses and tempeh
from Sandhill Farm, a communal farm in Rutledge, Mo., and gift food
baskets from the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Chicago. The
communities are listed by state; California has the most, but there
are also some in Canada, Mexico and France.

was talked about on the local radio talk show or on someone else's

Holyfield should meet for a third time in the ring, ``Tyson beats
Holyfield,'' said Brooks, now training Tyson for next Saturday's
comeback fight against Francois Botha in Las Vegas. ``Mike still
has the speed and he still has the power. But the difference is
that he has a corner this time. He comes to the fight with a plan.

   INTERNET-RECRUITING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Recruiting fans can get an

own Web sites, some with interactive chat lines and bulletin boards
where people can post information using anonymous nicknames. There
also are multitudes of Web pages maintained by fans who report what
was published in a newspaper or by a recruiting service and what
was talked about on the local radio talk show or on someone else's
Web site. That's when the line between fact and rumor starts to
blur. As a result, coaches are spending as much time dispelling
rumors as they are talking up their schools. (Halliburton, Austin

Holyfield should meet for a third time in the ring, ``Tyson beats
Holyfield,'' said Brooks, now training Tyson for next Saturday's
comeback fight against Francois Botha in Las Vegas. ``Mike still
has the speed and he still has the power. But the difference is
that he has a corner this time. He comes to the fight with a plan.

HOLDING THE HACKER AS A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen the TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   A young man sits at a desk in a cluttered, poorly lighted
apartment, his face bathed in the shine of a computer screen.
Working at his home PC, he has just managed to gain access to his
employer's personnel files, including the payroll information.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend looks on, amazed, as he calls up numbers on the
screen. She notices how much less one employee is paid than a
colleague with the same job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet he doesn't know that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man touches a computer key, sending the payroll data
over the phone line to the computers of all the other employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just e-mailed everyone in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man is a hacker, and the TV commercial offers a system
or service whose purpose is to prevent wretches like him _
disturbers of corporate good order _ from tapping into a firm's
computer system and learning things better not known.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, compensation is a subject about which
bosses strive to keep their salaried hirelings in the dark. If
everyone in the company knew what everyone else was paid, nothing
but trouble could come of it.
</P>
<P>
   The incompetent might be found to be better-rewarded than the
capable. Blundering managers might get fatter checks than the
cleverer workers in their charge. Insurrections could result.
</P>
<P>
   So such information is a closely guarded secret, though from
time to time there are slips and leakages. Someone has a friend in
the accounting department who has access to the books. Or someone
accidentally leaves a page of the budget on the office copy
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, there was a major housecleaning in the
company warehouse, and employees were invited to prowl the place
for old furniture or anything else of interest. Among the tons of
detritus being hauled away, I noticed a great stack of
important-looking ledgers. I snatched one from the heap and brushed
off the dust.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN ITAL HERE Office Payroll Journal, END ITAL HERE it said on
the cover. It happened to be for the first half of 1959 _ just
months after I'd come back to the paper from military service.
</P>
<P>
   That journal, many of its entries written in ink with a careful
hand, was like a window back in time.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were for two-week pay periods. My class of young
reporters received from $135 to $182.50 for their fortnight's
labors. The newsroom veterans, the best and most experienced, got
as much as $300.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, there were some illogicalities _ youngsters who
showed early promise and were paid more than they were worth, then
never amounted to much. By and large, though, the newsroom wage
hierarchy was remarkably fair.
</P>
<P>
   What galled at the time was the lack of any comparative measure
of one's worth. Surely others BEGIN ITAL HERE must END ITAL HERE be
earning more _ perhaps a great deal more. For how could any
reasonable enterprise survive while paying its ablest people so
little?
</P>
<P>
   I came by that ledger more than 30 years after the fact _ too
late to be of much interest, except as an artifact.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when I watch that young fellow in the TV commercial,
peeling away a layer of company secrecy, I know I'm supposed to
regard him as wicked and malicious, doing the devil's work.
</P>
<P>
   But, instead, I'm afraid I see him as a modern hero. Where's the
great wrong in what he's doing? The BEGIN ITAL HERE moral END ITAL
HERE wrong, that is, as distinct from the strictly legal wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He's only putting some useful information in the hands of his
fellow workers. And as anyone knows, information is power.

BROWSING THROUGH FAVORITE BREAD RECIPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: recipe at end of review) 
(bl) 
By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a market crowded with specialized bread books that promote
everything from traditional French breads to those made in
machines, Beth Hensperger has gone her own way. In her latest book,
``The Bread Bible'' (Chronicle Books, $32.50), the subtitle, ``300
Favorite Recipes,'' tells the real story.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hensperger, the author of five other books on bread, invites
readers to take a peek into her recipe file and try the ones she
likes best. She presents no innovative techniques, nor recipes from
a mountain village in Switzerland. In fact, many of her recipes
sound familiar: anadama bread, seven grain and pain de campagne are
in countless cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Many others are homey. Rosemary raisin bread, made with (gasp!)
dried rosemary, was surprisingly fragrant and pleasantly yeasty. It
had a fairly fragile texture because of its rather elementary
technique: it is mixed in a food processor, not by hand, and takes
only one rising. My first reaction, as a fan of today's chewy,
slowly developed country breads, was to turn up my nose. But then
objectivity set in: for the effort involved, this really is a good
bread.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for traditional English muffins, which I've eaten my
whole life but have never made, was enlightening. It is actually a
yeast dough that is treated like a biscuit dough. You roll out the
dough on cornmeal, cut it with a biscuit cutter, and fry it in a
lightly greased skillet. It never nears the oven.
</P>
<P>
   A page that will get sticky and dusty over the years in my
kitchen is the one containing a recipe for farm-style white bread
with cardamom. The recipe makes four beautiful, shiny sandwich
loaves. Though there is a relatively large amount of sugar in the
dough, it balances perfectly with the cardamom. As you eat it, the
cardamom flavor builds in intensity and yet is never so strong that
you would hesitate to pair the bread with other foods. (It was
delicious spread with goat cheese.)
</P>
<P>
   Publishing a collection of favorite recipes is actually the old
way of cookbook writing. ``The Bread Bible'' is a sound and
pleasant revival of that approach. This book is also old-fashioned
in the sense that it expects the reader to read instructions like
``shape into rectangular loaves'' and know that this takes
considerable skill.
</P>
<P>
   There are sections describing fundamental bread ingredients and
their function in bread dough, and others telling how to mix and
knead bread. But without illustrations, I doubt these will inspire
nonbakers to whip out their bowls. The truth is, the book is for
experienced bakers who will want to thumb through, trying plain
white bread one day, hot cross buns another.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FARM-STYLE WHITE BREAD WITH CARDAMOM
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Bread Bible'' by Beth Hensperger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, plus rising time  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12/3 cups instant nonfat dried milk
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   10 cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   12 cups (approximately) unbleached all-purpose flour or bread
flour
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   Butter for greasing pans.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a pot of water to boil. In a very large bowl whisk
together 4 cups boiling water, the dried milk, 4 tablespoons
butter, salt and 1 cup sugar. Continue whisking until butter melts;
let stand until lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour { cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) into a small bowl.
Sprinkle the yeast and the pinch of sugar over surface. Stir to
dissolve, and let stand at room temperature until foamy, about 10
minutes. Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods, and crush with a
rolling pin on a piece of wax paper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add 4 cups of the flour, the cardamom and the yeast mixture
to the milk and butter mixture. Beat hard with a whisk until smooth
and creamy. Switch to a wooden spoon, and add the remaining flour,
{ cup at a time, until a soft, shaggy dough forms, one that clears
the sides of the bowl is formed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and
knead until the dough is smooth and resilient to the touch but not
dry, 5 to 8 minutes, dusting with flour 1 tablespoon at a time as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place the dough in a greased deep bowl. Turn once, and cover
with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in
bulk, about 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   6. Gently deflate the dough by pressing it with your fist. Turn
it out onto a floured work surface. Grease four 9-by-5-inch loaf
pans. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Shape each portions
into rectangular loaves and place in pans. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap, and let rise until 1 inch above the rim of the pans,
about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350
degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and milk.
With a serrated knife, slash the tops of the loaves decoratively
(but no more than \ inch deep.) Brush the tops with the egg and
milk mixture. Place the pans on the center rack of oven, and bake
40 to 45 minutes, or until loaves are brown and sound hollow when
tapped with your finger. Transfer the loaves immediately to a
cooling rack.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 loaves.

WAITING FOR GRIM ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOURI _ Kelvin Malone today sits in a holding cell next door
to the execution chamber at the Potosi Correctional Center in
eastern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He waits as the last desperate attempts to spare his life swirl
through courts and the governor's office. And as he waits, the
family of a nearly forgotten victim now asks for help finding
closure in an 18-year-old nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Malone went on a killing spree through Missouri and
California. Among his victims was the St. Louis cabdriver, for whom
he currently awaits his Missouri death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old takes hope from the fact that Monday a federal
judge in California overturned a second death sentence, citing
questionable information from a jailhouse informant. Malone's
attorney says the California ruling might result in a postponement
of the Missouri case. There was no indication Monday in Missouri of
what might be the ruling's effect.
</P>
<P>
   But also Monday, the Missouri attorney general and the widow of
a Kansas City man thought to be a fourth Malone victim called upon
the thrice-convicted killer to confess to the fourth slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge in one of the California murders let me testify that
the car they were using was my husband's, so I was able to get
closure on this a long time ago,'' Beverley Rankin said Monday from
her Texas home.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, James Rankin, vanished March 19, 1981, after a late
meal at a downtown Denny's Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my children...I have four children who lost their daddy
back then, and who need to hear that he won't be walking through
their door someday.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rankin, then 39, had recently moved to Kansas City to head
up the local office of a national engineering company. At the time
of his death, his family was still living in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The widow said her children, who were 5, 8, 13 and 15 years old
in 1981, when the killings occurred, now know intellectually that
their father is dead. But she said the only evidence of his death
is the sketchy testimony of Michael Crenshaw, convicted of being
Malone's accomplice in two California killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they've had to go on is his statement: `We stopped in the
desert somewhere, maybe California, maybe Arizona, maybe Mexico,
and Malone took him out of the trunk and marched him into the
desert. I heard four shots, and Malone returned alone.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon said Malone had one last day
in which to ease some small part of the suffering he caused to the
Rankin family.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he added, Malone has refused to take that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago Malone embarked on a cross-country killing
spree. It began with the murder of William Parr, a cabdriver who
had agreed to take Malone from a downtown St. Louis bus station out
to Crenshaw's suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping briefly in Kansas City, where authorities believe
Crenshaw and Malone kidnapped Rankin, the two continued to
California. There, they beat to death Myrtle Dee Benham, a
55-year-old attendant at a remote gas station, and shot to death
Minnie Ola White, 51, who had stopped to rest along a rural
highway. And, police and prosecutors believe, they killed Rankin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rankin murder case _ because there was no body, and
because there were three other convictions _ never went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said Monday that Rankin long had been presumed to be
Malone's fourth murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a significant amount of circumstantial evidence that
points to Malone being involved in the death of Jim Rankin,'' Nixon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon said it's now time for Malone to close the Rankin
file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family and friends of that promising young engineer
deserve closure,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The only way for that to happen, he added, is for Malone to
confess to the crime in his last hours.
</P>
<P>
   For the St. Louis murder, Malone in 1984 was sentenced to death.
He has spent most of his time since then fighting the convictions.
Gov. Mel Carnahan will consider an appeal for clemency today.
</P>
<P>
   Malone refused to comment when contacted Monday at the Potosi
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's attorney, Peter Giannini, told The Associated Press on
Monday that if the execution took place, it would be a miscarriage
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if Missouri goes through with this, it is about to
execute a man who never killed anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who used every delay tactic for his sentence
possible, times two,'' Nixon said. ``And this is a person who has
proven time and again he doesn't value human life, other than his
own.'' .MDNM/

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILO, Hawaii _ The coast of Hawaii's Big Island is dotted with
groves of stately trees, their shiny, dark green leaves forming
shady canopies over the rich volcanic soil. They stand in lush
contrast to the white-capped blue waters of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   From late fall to early winter these trees, descendants of a
species imported from Australia in the 1870s as an ornamental,
produce graceful sprays of white blossoms that have a gentle
perfume, like privet hedges in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But the trees give off much more than shade and fragrance: from
July through January they yield macadamias, the world's richest
tasting, most expensive nut, as closely associated with Hawaii as
the pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that the trees were more than just ornamental had
to be sheer happenstance, because the luxury they produce is one
hard nut to crack. Still, once the secret was out, every effort was
made to turn the trees into tidy profit centers.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long, long time. And now growers are worried that
macadamia farms, like sugar cane and pineapple plantations before
them, are facing demise. Until the early 1990s macadamia acreage
was expanding into farmland that had once grown those earlier
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Today the acreage, much of it between Kona and Hilo, is either
static or in slight decline, depending on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Macadamia nuts _ macnuts to Hawaiians _ do not share the
American culinary tradition of walnuts or pecans. It was not until
the 1920s that anyone tried to raise them commercially in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland America didn't really hear about them until the 1970s,
and that was mostly by word of mouth, after visitors to Hawaii
discovered the macadamias' charms and brought them home as gifts.
Their cachet reached its peak in the 1980s when John Hillerman, who
acted in the television series ``Magnum P.I.,'' became a spokesman
for Mauna Loa, the state's largest grower and processor: ``Mauna
Loa macadamia nuts _ almost too good to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe chefs took that motto to heart; they are not as
freewheeling with macadamias as they are with other nuts. What
appeals to them about macadamias is not so much the subtle flavor,
which is at its best when the nuts are not lost in a tangle of
competing ingredients, but the texture, the crunchiness, the
butteriness.
</P>
<P>
   At his restaurants in Honolulu, Sam Choy uses crushed macadamias
in dozens of dishes, including baked Brie and as breading for
chicken. Michel Richard of Citronelle in Washington likes them in
pies.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef at Gramercy
Tavern, serves a macadamia nut tartlet with roasted pineapple and
vanilla rum ice cream, while Florian Bellanger of Le Bernardin
combines them with pistachios and pecans in a pineapple crumble.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, macadamia nuts are eaten as an extravagant snack _
on their own, in cookies, coated with milk or dark chocolate, in
nut brittle and truffles, honey roasted and flavored with Maui
onion or garlic. Yet they remain a relatively exotic ingredient.
Outside Hawaii, few Americans would even recognize a macadamia in
its shell _ the nut resembles a rock-hard malted-milk ball.
</P>
<P>
   Today Hawaii, with 700 farms on 20,200 acres, produces 99
percent of the macadamia nuts grown in the United States outside
California last year 65 million pounds were harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Macadamias can be found in almost any large supermarket, but
they are usually a special-occasion purchase because they have two
strikes against them: their price and their richness. Richard
Vidgen, the president of MacFarms of Hawaii, the second-largest
grower and processor (after Mauna Loa), is well aware of that
problem. ``After enough people said, `They are my favorite nut;
they are terribly expensive; they are terribly fattening,' I
realized we had an image problem,'' he said. ``People thought the
nuts were sinful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian growers have been working to improve the nutritional
image for several years, capitalizing on the increasing awareness
that not all fat is bad fat. Much to their chagrin, though, growers
in other countries have been working to reduce the price, to the
point where Hawaiians have lost their lock on the market as foreign
nuts undercut them.
</P>
<P>
   It took Australia more than a century to realize the
profitability of its native tree, but over the last 10 years it has
become a major exporter, especially to Southeast Asia. South
Africa, China, Malaysia, Guatemala, Brazil and other countries have
also been cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, Hawaii's 50 percent share of the world
market declined to 36 percent, while Australia's share rose to 38
percent from 27 percent. Since the market in Southeast Asia
collapsed, amid the Asian economic troubles, Australian growers
have been selling their nuts in the United States at for less than
Hawaiian nuts. Some fear they may go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiians naturally insist their nuts are the best _ ``the
beluga of macadamia nuts,'' said Richard Schnitzler, president of
the Hamakua Macadamia Nut Company in Kailua Kona. Many Hawaiian
chefs agree, but most consumers from the American mainland to
Europe and Asia don't know a Hawaiian macadamia nut from a
Guatemalan and don't care. And that is not good for growers in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was glamorous in 1985 to grow macadamia nuts,''
said Midge Mebane, who with her husband, John, is one of the many
small growers. Six of their 12 acres overlooking Hilo are planted
with macadamia trees because the agricultural use of the land gives
them a large tax break. ``Otherwise, it would have been
prohibitive,'' said Mrs. Mebane, a disarmingly direct woman who
moved from Pennsylvania with her husband 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, the price of macadamia nuts was 92 cents a
pound, but now it's 50 cents a pound,'' she said. ``I did not
envision the costs. Our trees are now 11 years old, and we are sort
of breaking even. I thought it was a good investment, but we really
haven't made any money because we have to bring in so many people
to pick.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Like most small growers, the Mebanes have another source of
income: John Mebane is a physician in Hilo.
</P>
<P>
   The road from tree to table is long and complicated. A grower
who plants a tree has to wait seven years before it will produce
enough nuts to sell; it will not be profitable for five to eight
more years. The trees, which grow to 30 feet, were originally
described scientifically in the mid-19th century by an Australian
botanist, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, who named them in honor of a
friend, Dr. John Macadam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, the first macadamia plantation was started near
Honolulu, but it was not very successful. It took 20 years of
research to select and graft the varieties that reliably produce a
desirable nut. Today, there are seven varieties grown at different
elevations in various climates, almost all of them on the Big
Island. Macadamia trees live 45 or 50 years, although some are at
least 110 and still fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rock-hard nuts are ripe, they still have to be shelled,
which growers used do by laying a board over them, then running a
car over that. Unlike other nuts, which are picked at one time of
the year, macadamias ripen in waves and have to be harvested five
or six times. Growers wait until they fall to the ground in their
green husks, then gather them either mechanically or by hand. Mrs.
Mebane described the latter method as ``an amazing sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pickers walk around on kneepads for hours at a time,'' she
said. They also have to be sure to get to the nuts ahead of the
rats and wild pigs, who figured out how to crack them long before
humans did.
</P>
<P>
   At the processing plants, each load of nuts is weighed and then
husked, sorted, washed and put in air drying tanks. The shells are
removed mechanically, in a crusher using 300 pounds of pressure per
square inch. The meats are sorted first by machines, then by
humans. The last steps are dry-roasting and grading. The larger the
nut, the higher the grade.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Mauna Loa and MacFarms, Island Princess and Hamakua
Macadamia Nut Farms account for 80 percent of the nuts grown in
Hawaii. Most of the other farms are small; only 200 farms are 20
acres or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people with only two trees who call themselves
growers,'' said David Rietow, the president of the Hawaiian
Macadamia Nut Association, whose membership produces most of the
nuts grown in Hawaii. ``We call them shade-tree growers.'' Only 10
percent of these small growers farm full time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many growers, Yoshitaka Takashiba has acreage in both
coffee and nuts on the coast near Kona. Born and raised on a coffee
farm, Takashiba, who is 85 and still drives a tractor, was a
macadamia pioneer in the 1970s. ``At that time there weren't too
many buyers,'' he said. ``But I made better money than farmers who
had coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of three daughters, Takashiba, who may be slow of
foot but is quick of wit, said: ``When the girls left home they
vowed they would never come back because I abused them.'' Read:
they had to do farm chores. Now that he is older and his children
do his tax returns, he said, they know how much his land is worth
and have told him not to sell it because they are coming back. Like
many farmers, his riches are in land, land that others want to turn
into housing tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Vidgen, of MacFarms, is optimistic about the competition
Hawaiian growers face. ``We can overcome higher labor costs by
being smarter with technology,'' he said. ``Land costs are not that
high. We get yields similar to Australia but higher than other
countries. We'll keep coming up with new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One way has been to try to improve the ``too fattening'' image
of macadamias, which contain 200 calories and 19 grams of fat per
ounce, while an ounce of pecans has 167 calories and 15 grams of
fat. Peanuts have slightly less.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the scientific research sponsored by the
International Tree Nut Council has been directed at proving that
nuts in general are beneficial for health because they contain the
``good'' kinds of fat, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Several
recent studies suggest that nuts help reduce ``bad'' cholesterol.
To reinforce a more healthful image, MacFarms sponsors an Ironman
triathlete from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The costly image is harder to battle, especially when it can be
difficult to discern a difference between Hawaiian and Australian
macadamias. Even Rocco Damato, whose company, A.L. Bazzini in New
York, has been selling nuts for decades, says he would have a hard
time telling the two apart. He usually sells Australian but
sometimes Hawaiian or Costa Rican.
</P>
<P>
   One of his clients, Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Bouley
Bakery, had no idea where the nuts he uses in a dacquoise come
from.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed they were Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the late the 1980s, he would have been right.
``Eight or 10 years ago prices were so good we felt we had it
made,'' said Sotero Agoot, the director of Kona Pacific Farmers
Cooperative in Captain Cook, whose members grow macadamias or
coffee, and sometimes both. ``We quit advertising; we quit
marketing. We've dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After sampling macadamia nuts from Hawaii, Malaysia and
Australia, I'll go along with the Hawaiians who think theirs are
best.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian nuts had a subtle, sweet taste. The ones from
Malaysia were rancid. Two samplings of Australian nuts provided
different results: one bag was slightly rancid; the other was good,
but still not as sweet or as full-flavored as the Hawaiian nuts.
They were almost as crunchy but a trifle oilier.
</P>
<P>
   When Florian Bellanger, the pastry chef at Le Bernardin, tasted
Australian and Hawaiian macadamias side by side, he, too, preferred
the Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   So how can you be sure you are getting Hawaiian nuts? It's
difficult. If the label on the can says ``product of Hawaii'' or
``Hawaiian grown,'' chances are fairly good, though not 100
percent, that they will be Hawaiian. If there is nothing on the
label _ even if the packaging looks as if it comes from Hawaii _
there is absolutely no way to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   When buying nuts in bulk you have to trust what the storepeople
tell you, if in fact they know. Be sure to sample one before
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At Balducci's, Dean &AMP; DeLuca, Eli's Manhattan, Eli's Vinegar
Factory and Grace's Marketplace, the unsalted macadamia nuts are
usually from Australia, sometimes from Costa Rica and sometimes
from Hawaii. Prices vary. A pound of whole macadamia nuts is $13 at
Dean &AMP; DeLuca and $10.95 at the Vinegar Factory. Cans of nuts in
smaller amounts cost more.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy excellent fresh unsalted Hawaiian macadamias by mail
from Island Bakery and Grocery Supply. P.O. Box 1798, Kaunakakai,
Hawaii 96748; (808) 567-6517; checks, money orders and Visa
accepted. A pound of whole nuts is $8, halves are $7 and diced are
$6 plus shipping by priority mail: $2 for one pound, but the more
you buy, the cheaper the cost per pound. &QL;

<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the pineapple: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, sliced horizontally, seeds scraped
</P>
<P>

   \ cup mashed banana ({ large banana)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark rum
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh pineapple, peeled
</P>
<P>
   For the topping:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   } cup macadamia nuts (3 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   1 heaping tablespoon pecans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon pistachio nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. To prepare the pineapple, in
a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, \ cup hot water, the vanilla
bean and scrapings, ginger and cloves. Stir the mixture over medium
heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high,
and cook the mixture until it is caramelized and dark golden brown,
about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Carefully add 1\ cups hot water (the caramel will seize and
bubble up, so stand back), banana and rum. Stir the mixture over
low heat until the caramel is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour the caramel into a 9-by-2-inch pan. Add the pineapple,
and roast it, turning it every 10 minutes, for a total of 50
minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack, and let the pineapple cool
in the caramel. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   4. While the pineapple is roasting, prepare the topping. Place
the nuts on a baking sheet with a rim, and toast them in the oven
with the pineapple for 8 to 10 minutes, until pale golden brown.
Reserve 18 macadamia nuts, then coarsely chop the rest of the nuts.
</P>
<P>
   5. In the bowl of a mixer set with the paddle attachment,
combine the flour, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt,
cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir the mixture on low speed until it
resembles pebbles (do not overmix). Add the chopped nuts, and
briefly mix them in.
</P>
<P>
   6. When the pineapple is cool enough to handle, cut two
{-inch-thick slices from it, and cut the slices into quarters.
Reserve for garnish. Cut the remaining pineapple lengthwise into
quarters, and cut away the core. Dice the pineapple into {-inch
cubes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Divide the pineapple among six 8-ounce ramekins. Drizzle 1
tablespoon of the caramel over each. Top with the crumble mixture,
filling the ramekins to the top.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bake the ramekins for about 17 minutes, or until the tops are
golden brown. Serve warm, garnished with the reserved macadamia
nuts and pineapple slices.

EVOKING INDIA, HOT AND COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To order a masala chai or a Masala Mary is to speak
just a little Hindi, and to have just a little taste of Indian
cuisine in liquid form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masala is a northern Indian word at least 2,000 years old that
means blend,'' said Julie Sahni, who teaches and writes about
Indian cooking and is the author of ``Savoring Spices and Herbs''
(William Morrow, 1996). Masala spices come in assorted guises _ wet
or dry, sweet or savory _ and are aromatically making their way
into Western foods.
</P>
<P>
   Masala chai is tea flavored and perfumed by at least four
spices, which traditionally include clove, cinnamon, cardamom and
ginger. A pinch of the masala is allowed to steep in brewed black
tea, which is then consumed with sugar and milk or cream. It is
soothing, deeply flavorful, almost sybaritic.
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians have made creating this drink easy: a delicious
mix of aniseed, cinnamon, cardamom, pepper, ginger and cloves has
been packaged under the name MDH T-Plus: Tea and Milk Masala, which
is sold in eight-ounce portions ($1.99) at Foods of India, in
Manhattan; (212) 683-4419.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Cardoz, the executive chef of Tabla, an Indian fusion
restaurant on lower Madison Avenue, uses his own masala to infuse a
Bloody Mary with a richer, deeper, subtler flavor. Cardoz, who was
born in Goa, India, toasts and grinds mustard seeds, fennel seeds,
coriander, peppercorns, cumin and cinnamon, then mixes them with
cooked shallots, fresh ginger, garlic, celery root, tamarind and
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   He blends this mix with tomato juice and vodka, and the Masala
Mary is then poured over ice and garnished with lemon and freshly
grated horseradish. It is a drink with mystery.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Elia Kazan, the ailing 89-year-old director who in
recent years has been rejected for several lifetime achievement
awards because he informed on friends during the height of the
McCarthy era, will be given an honorary Academy Award at the Oscar
ceremonies on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences to give Kazan an honorary Oscar is, in some ways, a
direct rebuke to the American Film Institute, which has gone out of
its way to ignore Kazan in its yearly awards.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan is perhaps the foremost filmmaker of the 1950s and '60s,
the director of such classics as ``On the Waterfront,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Viva Zapata!'' and ``East of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   His name still stirs debate and even animosity because of his
appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities on
April 10, 1952. At the time, Kazan, who was also a top Broadway
director, informed on eight friends who had been fellow members of
the Communist Party in the 1930s. The House panel was zealously
looking for evidence of communist influence in Hollywood. Among
those whose careers were damaged or wrecked were actors Morris
Carnovsky and Art Smith and playwright Clifford Odets.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after acrimonious debate, the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association and the American Film Institute rejected
proposals to honor Kazan with life achievement awards.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his supporters said he was a victim of Hollywood
hypocrisy and trendy politics. After all, they said, many
organizations give lifetime and so-called humanitarian awards to
men and women with messy, sometimes destructive personal lives.
Kazan's critics, however, have said for years that his decision to
name names was so offensive that he should never be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   But academy president Robert Rehme said Tuesday that the
39-member board decided unanimously Thursday to give Kazan the
honorary award. Previous honorary Oscars have gone to Fred Astaire,
Buster Keaton, Orson Welles, Satyajit Ray, Cary Grant, Akira
Kurosawa and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Rehme, who has been a board member for about 15 years, said he
could not recall if Kazan had ever been nominated for an honorary
Oscar and added, ``I'm proud we're doing this.'' He said of the
vote: ``There was no debate, no discussion; it was overwhelmingly
approved with enthusiasm. Elia Kazan is one of the most
extraordinary directors of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehme said the board had voted after a speech by actor Karl
Malden, who appeared in three of Kazan's films. ``Just look at the
work he's done,'' Malden said Tuesday morning. ``If anyone deserved
this honorary award because of his talent and body of work, it was
Kazan.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan has won two Oscars, for his direction of ``Gentleman's
Agreement'' in 1947 and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, reached by telephone at his Manhattan apartment, said:
``I feel very happy about this. I'm flattered to death. I'm pleased
with it. What more can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   A family member described his health as ``alternately vigorous
and frail.'' But Kazan promised that he would fly to Los Angeles to
accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, who was a co-founder of the Actors Studio in 1947, helped
influence even the current generation of film and theater actors
because of his work with such performers as Marlon Brando,
Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Kim Stanley and Julie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-one actors who worked in films for him were nominated
for Oscars, and nine won Oscars,'' Malden said. ``That's a pretty
good average.''
</P>
<P>
   Malden added: ``Here's a man in his '80s who hasn't gotten what
he deserves. It's about time.''

`MERCHANT OF VENICE': FROM SERBAN, THE SHYLOCK OF YESTERYEAR, A
GO-TO GUY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)  
(nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Let Shylock be Shylock! is the unspoken motto
of Andrei Serban's daringly unapologetic production of ``The
Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shed no tears for the Jewish moneylender of Serban's design.
Shylock may be cruelly maligned by the Christian hypocrites in
Shakespeare's difficult play, with its anti-Semitic overtones, but
in this version he has hardly been conceived as a figure to touch
the heart. Though it has become customary to render Shylock with
compassion, as in Peter Hall's 1989 Broadway production, in which
Dustin Hoffman's dignified pillar of a Shylock endured the taunts
and a shower of spittle from his enemies, Serban breaks with modern
practice and gives us something more like the sinister Shylock of
yore.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the capable conjuring of the actor Will LeBow, Shylock
is imagined in this visually striking modern-dress staging at the
American Repertory Theater as a Venetian go-to guy who holds the
beautiful people of the canals in as much contempt as they hold
him. (The performance might appeal to the literary critic Harold
Bloom, who in his new book on Shakespeare argues for just such a
``comic villain'' of a Shylock).
</P>
<P>
   Just how spiteful a piece of work is this villain is revealed in
LeBow's rendition of the famous ``Hath not a Jew eyes?'' speech.
Routinely treated as a plea for understanding, it is instead
delivered here as a caustic act of self-mockery, intended to
patronize his bigoted audience, the Venetian dilettantes Solanio
(Stephen Rowe) and Salerio (Jeremy Geidt).
</P>
<P>
   Only when the embittered loan shark has them laughing along with
him does his voice rise in sudden anguish and fury: ``And if you
wrong us, shall we not  &UR; revenge &LR; ?'' That this is a man who savors
his singleminded pursuit of his pound of flesh is never in doubt;
in the climactic courtroom scene, where he is called upon to claim
the flesh owed him by the merchant Antonio (a shrewdly lugubrious
Jonathan Epstein), he even draws a circle in red on the torso of
his victim and theatrically traces it with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek affability of LeBow's seductive portrayal imbues this
Shylock with a visceral authority, a power to make things happen,
which also makes him the most compelling feature of Serban's often
absorbing production. But ``The Merchant of Venice'' is much more
than the tale of a moneylender's humiliation; its more central
concern is the romantic comedy of the wooing of Portia (Kristin
Flanders) by Bassanio (Andrew Garman) and other sillier suitors.
It's these lighter moments that trip up Serban, who seems much more
in his element elucidating the cosmic complexities of ``Merchant''
than in realizing the gently comic ironies in the love story.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the hideous resolution of the Shylock subplot _
can an enlightened audience identify with a heroine who utters
lines like ``Tarry, Jew'' or feel anything but squeamishness at
Shylock's forced conversion? _ insinuates itself like an odor that
can't be washed out. Still, Serban, who did such a fine job in
Central Park last summer framing the humane qualities in
Shakespeare's troublesome ``Cymbeline,'' has his actors take wide
swings at the comic interludes, like overeager croquet players. The
result is a tactlessness that undoes some of the production's finer
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchant'' is in part about the unraveling of riddles in
language and law and the unmasking of people who are not what they
seem. In this vein, the scenes encompassing the elaborate riddle
that Portia poses for her suitors are bizarrely broad and
consequently sophomoric; the young actors portraying princes from
Morocco and Spain, for instance, are encouraged to play cartoon
characters who throw off the play's rhythms, and Ms. Flanders and
Portia's lady-in-waiting Nerissa (Nurit Monicelli), engage in an
affected style of banter at an unnecessary remove from sincerity.
While the play has Portia outwitting Shylock in court, Ms. Flanders
never manages to challenge LeBow for primacy onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Serban is a restless experimenter, so his Shakespearean ventures
tend to be jampacked with ideas good and less good. One of his best
notions here is the decadent and sexually ambiguous world of
Antonio, the merchant of the title, who takes the disastrous loan
from Shylock, with its peculiar terms, to finance the effort of his
friend Bassanio to romance Portia.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Venice and Belmont, as suggested by the Adriatic
pastels in the lovely folding screens by Marielle Bancou and
William Bonnell and lighting by Michael Chybowski, turns out to be
a mirage. The scenic charm is as superficial as the slick,
two-faced Venetian businessmen themselves, who make deals with the
Jewish moneylender, only to revile him behind his back. (At a
costume ball, they even resort to garish masks with exaggerated
Semitic noses.) Dressing them all in natty European suits, it
seems, is a reminder by Serban and his inventive costume designer,
Catherine Zuber, that empty-headed bigotry has many contemporary
disguises.
</P>
<P>
   In this false paradise, Serban finds little to romanticize.
Portia sermonizes grandly to Shylock about the quality of mercy,
but she and the rest of Venice are complicit in a merciless
dismemberment of Shylock's fortune, his faith, his very identity.
It is the director's eloquent thesis, in fact, that Shylock and his
Venetian tormentors are more alike than different; the vengeance
envisioned by Shylock is symbolically carried out by his Christian
adversaries. To drive home the point, perhaps unnecessarily, Serban
creates a final dumb show in which Antonio _ who by Portia's
verdict appropriates Shylock's wealth _ is locked in a dance with
the masked Shylock. The borrower and the lender are now as one.
</P>
<P>
   Serban's uneven cast is an impediment. Several of the younger
actors simply do not add their own pound of flesh to these
mysterious characters, which gives the play an only partly lived-in
quality. As he did with Liev Schreiber's vital Iachimo in
``Cymbeline,'' though, the director finds in LeBow a lead actor who
helps us greatly in our navigation of the dark side.

WHITE HOUSE EXPLAINS CLINTON'S AVOIDANCE OF REPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Tuesday defended a decision to
have President Clinton avoid answering questions from reporters as
his Senate impeachment trial is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton has not been advised
by defense lawyers to avoid answering questions and is ``free to
talk.'' However, the president has decided to avoid meetings with
reporters because ``he doesn't know anything more productive he can
say'' about the allegations that led to his impeachment by the
House, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm keeping him isolated,'' Lockhart said as he
was peppered with questions during the daily White House briefing.
``It's not every day that the president decides to enter a Q&AMP;A with
you, and that's a decision we make.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers are expected to deliver a lengthy trial
brief to the Senate on Wednesday. The brief is designed to rebut
House allegations that Clinton ought to be removed from office for
allegedly committing perjury before a federal grand jury and
obstructing justice in connection with his cover-up of a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate impeachment trial gets down to business Thursday with
oral arguments by House members acting as prosecutors. The removal
of the president from office would require a two-thirds vote by the
100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd love to talk about some other subjects, some important
things he's doing,'' Lockhart said. ``It's hard for me to remember
when the last question like that was posed to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Buffalo, N.Y., and Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania on a one-day trip to elaborate upon his legislation
agenda following his scheduled Jan. 19 State of the Union address
to the House and Senate, Lockhart announced.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have rearranged events in recent weeks to
avoid situations where the president would face questions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the president traveled to the National Arboretum in
Washington to announce a new $1 billion effort to expand federal
wilderness areas and urban parks. White House officials limited
news media coverage to a small group of reporters who gained access
to the event in exchange for their agreement to ``pool'' their
material with colleagues who were not given access to the event.
</P>
<P>
   The pool reporters said their access was further restricted on
site and they were unable to get close enough to question the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the decision to limit news coverage was made on
``a case-by-case basis,'' adding: ``If you're asking me to look
into this, I'll be glad to look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted a summit and state visit with Argentine President
Carlos Menem Monday without the traditional joint news conference
and without the traditional question and answer session in the Oval
Office that usually accompany such meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If holding a formal news conference was the criteria for
keeping out of the limelight, we will have kept a pretty low
profile here lately,'' Lockhart said.

TO BE A FOOTBALL HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; TV's latest youth deity, ``Dawson's Creek'' star
James Van Der Beek, probably didn't need to spend his summer hiatus
getting his brains beaten out by the best young football players in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell him that. The 21-year-old actor is not only proud
of his first movie starring role as a reluctant small-town gridiron
hero in ``Varsity Blues.''He's also convinced that it was necessary
for him to play the demanding, punishing part _ at least if he
hopes to sustain his acting career after the hot hormonal appeal of
Dawson Leery inevitably cools off. (The show airs 9 p.m. Wednesdays
on L.A.'s WB outlet, KTLA Channel 5.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the fact that a high school quarterback _ even an
unusually literate, conflicted one like ``Varsity's'' Jonathan
Moxon _ has got to have more gumption in him than Van Der Beek's
talkative but painfully hesitant TV teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a conscious choice _ for my own sanity _ to play
somebody different from Dawson, somebody who's not paralyzed by his
own fears and insecurities,'' says the thoughtful, low-key Van Der
Beek. ``Also, as an actor, I knew I had to try something that was
really different.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know, there was risk involved,'' the blond,
Connecticut native adds. ``Doing the Texas accent, dyeing my hair
brown, putting on 15 pounds; I had to prove to myself that I could
do it. And I also had to show everyone else. I've got this kind of
flash-in-the-pan opportunity right now, and I wanted to seize that
as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   How very clear-eyed, intelligent and shrewd. Of course, it's no
surprise that Van Der Beek is smart. It takes a special young
actor, after all, to convincingly deliver the volumes of
introspective dialogue superscribe Kevin Williamson supplies for
the WB network hit every week. And even though he's been working on
stage since the age of 13, Van Der Beek also earned a scholarship
to Drew University in New Jersey, where he's maintained a 3.8 grade
point average as an English major.
</P>
<P>
   All that understood, there was more than a little pleasure
involved in the whole ``Varsity Blues'' venture. Indeed, it was a
chance for the sensitive intellectual to indulge his inner jock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge football fan, so it was a dream come true,'' says
Van Der Beek, the son of a minor league baseball player and a
Broadway dancer-turned-gym teacher, who got into acting after a
middle school head injury curtailed his blossoming football
prospects. ``We had three weeks of training before shooting began,
and the chance to pick up the skills and the rhythm of it was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped if you liked getting beaten up, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very intimidating and a real challenge to step up with
the real guys on the field, in the pads, and run the plays at full
speed,'' Van Der Beek adds, noting that, except for key characters
portrayed by other actors, most of the athletes in ``Varsity
Blues'' were actual high school football stars recruited from all
over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we worked so hard, and I was bigger and stronger than
I'd ever been in my life, I had this false sense of confidence. We
were deluded into thinking that we could actually take these hits.
We did, but I just got clobbered! I'd end up on my back a lot,
remembering that I'm an actor, not a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Van Der Beek liked the Texans. Since the film
is about how Lone Star football is something of a secular religion,
the local athletes provided invaluable reality checks on just how
crazy parents, coaches and assorted other fans could get _ and what
that pressure did to guys who, regardless of their power and
prowess, were still just kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Hollywood bull; we didn't feel like actors with
these guys,'' he explains. ``Even though we all had trailers, we
dressed in the locker room with the rest of the team. And they were
all really engaged, since we were essentially telling their story.
They were just so much help.''
</P>
<P>
   While the boys accepted Van Der Beek as one of their own, the
girls were a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of school scenes, party scenes and, of
course, all of the big games,'' notes ``Varsity Blues'' director
Brian Robbins. ``So we were shooting with a lot of extras, and all
the girls in Texas went crazy for James.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the football field, it took about 10 minutes for people to
recognize me with the dark hair,'' Van Der Beek recalls, obviously
embarrassed by the whole situation. ``Then everyone in the stands
would figure it out, and it was all over. It got to the point where
I couldn't sign autographs, because if I went up to the stands, all
the extras would flock around and screw up filming. People got
crushed against the barriers and it became a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I ended up doing was waiting until the sun came up and
shooting stopped. I'd been playing all night, I was battered and
sore and sweaty, and everybody was, like, `Can I take a picture?'
I'd go, `Sure. I've been wearing a helmet for the past nine hours,
but go crazy.' I'm going to be haunted by those pictures on the
Internet for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins found silver linings in the disruptive Dawsonmania.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to have a star that everybody knows, so it helped
out,'' says the director, who cast Van Der Beek in the movie before
``Creek'' premiered in the winter of 1998. ``Besides, we got to
give James endless Dawson abuse on the set. Whenever he'd get out
of line, I'd just put him in his place by saying, `Aw, Dawson
doesn't want to do this, Dawson doesn't want to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Robbins _ who had his own brush with youth stardom
when he appeared on the sitcom ``Head of the Class'' _ was greatly
impressed by Van Der Beek's sensible response to sudden celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot about how weird it is to be a TV star,''
Robbins notes. ``He's handling it very well. He's a very humble
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop Culture Phenomenon,'' Van Der Beek says, with a dismissive
laugh, of his current status. ``I mean, I was an English major in
college and an unknown theater actor, then I got a job and somebody
wrote in a magazine that I was a Pop Culture Phenomenon. It's just
a label that they put on me and Josh and Katie and Michelle
(`Creek' co-stars Jackson, Holmes and Williams, respectively), but
it's almost never in our consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an adjustment, it changes your daily life in many ways,
but you've just got to accept that,'' he acknowledges. ``As Cheesy
Actor as this is gonna sound, though, it's always been about the
work. That's why I got into the business, and `Dawson's Creek' has
given me a lot of great opportunities that I otherwise wouldn't
have gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's something to be said for reliving one's high
school days without the pain of getting tackled all night long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some critics say that 15-year-olds don't talk like
that,'' he says of the improbably articulate ``Dawson's'' crew.
``But it's a lot of fun to get the chance to relive those horrific,
adolescent moments, but somebody's put the right words in your
mouth that you could never quite come up with at the time.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a bitter, partisan impeachment vote behind
them, House members from Eastern North Carolina said this week they
are anxious to tackle diverse issues in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Topping their priority lists are environmental protection and
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., said he will push for legislation to
give the state the final word on offshore drilling and that he is
working on a measure to safeguard the state's water-quality by
coordinating efforts of different agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jones said he is optimistic that the House will
pass a bill regulating wetlands this year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, to be sponsored by Jones, would establish a system
that allows a government agency, nonprofit entity or entrepreneur
to create, restore or enhance a wetland and sell ``credits'' to
public and private developers who want to develop wetlands
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a great idea by developers, small businessmen and
state governments, the trade program has yet to win the approval of
many environmental groups, who fear it's intended simply to clear
the way for developers to destroy wetlands with their projects.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the legislation is ``a win'' for the environment,
will create larger wetlands and will help frustrated farmers who
are not allowed to use portions of their land designated as
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues on Jones' agenda include reducing taxes, ensuring
the future of Social Security and Medicare, and making a ``real
investment in our military to get it up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said he will be working on a ``couple pieces of
legislation'' to improve health care for veterans and that he is
committed to ensuring that tobacco farmers will not lose their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Helping tobacco farmers is a common goal for North Carolina
House members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we come together as a team,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said Tuesday that farming issues also
are high on her priority list.
</P>
<P>
   While happy about a recent settlement in a class action
discrimination lawsuit of black farmers against the U.S.
government, Clayton said the atmosphere that led to the suit must
be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed earlier this month to
settle the lawsuit by hundreds of black farmers in the South,
acknowledging that it faced liability in claims of racial
discrimination in the past distribution of government loans.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, whose legislation last year helped keep the lawsuit
alive, said she would advocate a ``monitoring system'' to make sure
the same problems don't surface.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said she would act to find solutions for the
financial trouble tobacco farmers face.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to let the public and members of Congress know
how severe the problem is, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tobacco farmers) will probably lose close to 20 percent of
their production _ and therefore, income level _ over what they had
last year,'' she said. This is compounded by losses in previous
years and other factors, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues on Clayton's priority list include protecting
Social Security, providing more child care for working parents and
supporting a patient bill of rights, which would give patients more
rights when dealing with managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said education issues will be critical for the
new Congress, including school construction and allocating
resources to schools in lower income areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clayton and Jones said they were optimistic about the new
session and looked forward to more cooperation under the low-key
style of the new Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hastert) is kind of like most citizens from Eastern North
Carolina,'' Jones said. ``He's easy-going and he's willing to
listen to you.''

 &HT;    Federal incentive to manage growth
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If ever a Clinton administration program had metro
Atlanta's name written all over it, it's the one Vice President Al
Gore announced this week to promote ``smart growth'' for America's
cities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say metro Atlanta can automatically help itself
to the federal assistance promised in this new initiative. Nope,
we'll have to take our place in line with supplicants from other
explosive growth centers.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the Atlanta megalopolis epitomizes all the
problems this new effort is intended to counter: sprawl, traffic
congestion, declining air and water quality, dwindling green space,
abandoned and polluted industrial sites, destructive competition
between neighboring communities and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone leaps to the conclusion that this is a plot to
supplant local decision-making with federal dictates, let's set the
record straight. Urban sprawl nationwide is in no small part a
result of long-standing federal policies _ especially subsidies for
road-building and tax exemptions for home mortgages _ that turned
the outward migration of city dwellers into a land rush to the
burbs. A federal stab at rectification is only justice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this initiative doesn't mean additional federal
controls, just incentives for local officials to engage more in
regional cooperation and additional financing tools for them to
manage growth.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``smart-growth'' push involves more money in the
next fiscal year for existing programs: $724 million extra for
public transit and $341 million extra for plans to reduce traffic
congestion and pollution. Part is for new approaches: $100 million
for grants to encourage groups of counties to band together to
fight sprawl and $10 million for grants to spur design of local
schools so they can double as community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Spread across the land, these outlays are modest, yet they form
part of the biggest federal commitment to planned growth. That's
because the program has one other element, ``Better America
Bonds,'' which would not require federal expenditures but still
could have an enormous impact on U.S. cityscapes.
</P>
<P>
   These 15-year, no-interest bonds would allow communities to buy
green space, protect wetlands, clean up industrial land or minimize
polluted runoff water. Instead of interest, bondholders would get
tax credits. The Clinton administration is banking on $700 million
in tax write-offs over the next five years generating up to $10
billion in bonds for urban upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta region and other boomtowns still will have to rely
mainly on their own resources and resourcefulness to bring their
growth into balance with quality-of-life considerations. Still,
it's a hopeful sign that, Congress willing, the federal government
may be able to shoulder some of the heavy lifting.
</P>

Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;    Perfect Tigers face SEC tests
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 16-game SEC basketball schedule is not a sprint but
a marathon, Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said. So no one should be
getting overly excited about the Tigers' 15-0 start, which has them
in the Associated Press Top Ten for the first since since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And the uphill climb in that marathon for Auburn, 3-0 in the
SEC, begins tonight when the Tigers travel to Oxford to play an
under-rated Mississippi team. Including tonight's game with the
Rebels (12-4, 2-1), Auburn will play five of its next seven games
on the road. Saturday, the Tigers host explosive Florida (11-2),
and a week from today they travel to No. 6 Kentucky (14-3).
</P>
<P>
   But first there are the Rebels, who shocked a lot of SEC
watchers Saturday when they went on the road to Arkansas and beat
the Razorbacks 76-65. Arkansas had been ranked No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are the team to beat in the (SEC) West,'' Ellis,
the former Clemson coach in his fifth year at Auburn, said about
the Hogs. ``When you go into Fayetteville, Ark., and win like they
did, that's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's program was expected to drop off this season after
it lost coach Rob Evans to Arizona State and superstar Ansu Sesay,
who averaged 18.6 points per game. But the Rebels, under first-year
coach Rod Barnes, are 2-1 against ranked opponents this season.
Auburn has lost five games in a row to Ole Miss in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the daunting schedule in the coming weeks there is
justifiable optimism at Auburn, which hasn't won 20 games since
1986 and hasn't been in the NCAA Tournament since 1988. Chris
Porter is the reason why.
</P>
<P>
   A junior-college transfer from Abbeville, Ala., Porter showed
Saturday night against LSU why this Auburn team is no ordinary one.
Down 19 with 10 minutes left in Baton Rouge, Porter led the
comeback with 17 points in that time, including nine in the last
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7 Porter finished the game with 26 points and 14 rebounds.
He had 21 points and 10 rebounds in the second half. It was his
sixth double-double of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter is the element that Auburn has needed,'' said Tennessee
coach Jerry Green, whose team was destroyed by the Tigers 90-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter is an athlete who can do it all,'' said Ellis, who
compares him to former Clemson star Horace Grant. ``There is not a
facet of the game that he doesn't have.''

 &HT;    The edge: a daily analysis
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 340 pounds and with his ample girth hanging several
inches over his belt, Jerry Ball is a caricature of a defensive
tackle, aligned smack in the middle of the Minnesota Vikings front
seven. But the Atlanta Falcons will have to succesfully handle this
real-life Fat Albert if they are to run effectively against the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The man who makes most of the tackles in the Minnesota run
defense ranked No. 11in 1998 is middle linebacker Ed McDaniel. The
guy who made most of McDaniel's 128 tackles possible, however, is
the gargantuan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Plucked from the NFL scrap heap in 1997 after being released by
the Oakland Raiders, Ball has resurrected his career with the
Vikings. The 12-year veteran is beyond individual honors and now
wants to get a Super Bowl ring before he retires. At age 34, the
onetime ``me-first'' defender has grown nicely into the
complementary role designed by coordinator Foge Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's simply a big-bodied guy who can anchor against the inside
stuff and really clog the middle,'' Green Bay offensive line coach
Tom Lovat said. ``On most running plays, he's going to tie up two
blockers and free other (defenders) up to get to the ball. He
really is a significant part of what they do against the run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota front usually relies on a one-gap scheme, with the
linemen responsible for stuffing only one side of their blocker and
the linebackers run-dogging to fill the other gaps. However, Ball
is a throwback to the two-gap style. Generally, he will align on
the center or in the gap between center and left guard.
</P>
<P>
   His responsibility is to occupy two blockers and allow his three
line partners to work one on one against offensive linemen. Ballhad
just 31 total tackles this season, 12th for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those stops came in third-and-1 situations, a testimony
to his strength on short-yardage plays. The Vikings led the league
in best third-and-1 defense, allowing only 10 conversions on 25
plays, and just six of 18 running plays.
</P>
<P>
   Even without injured fullback Bob Christian, the Falcons' staple
inside running play is the ``iso-lead,'' with tailback Jamal
Anderson reading off the lead block and picking the best crease
behind H-back Brian Kozlowski. But Ball has the strength to
stalemate the lead-blocker and occasionally toss him back into the
hole, so the Falcons must handle him at the point of attack.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ball has played significantly better on
artificial surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The task of getting to Ball most often will fall to Falcons
center Robbie Tobeck and left guard Calvin Collins. In his first
season back at center after three years when he started at guard,
Tobeck has played well, especially over the past month. Collins is
inconsistent in technique and performance. In recent games, he has
been replaced by rookie Bob Hallen for approximately one-third of
the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ball, the Minnesota front is smallish. Fazio has
switched John Randle to right end in most games, but the All-Pro
tackle probably will line up at all four defensive-line positions
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Randle weighs in at 285 pounds, while left end Derrick Alexander
is 286 and the other tackle, Tony Williams, is 291. Led by
McDaniel, the Minnesota linebackers are active, shed blocks well
and play better in the open than in closed areas. Weakside
linebacker Dwayne Rudd had a breakthrough season. The other key for
the Vikings is the play of strong safety Robert Griffith. Because
the powerful Anderson will bounce the ``iso-lead'' play to the
outside, the safeties must be much surer in their tackling than
they were against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Falcons running game vs. Vikings run defense
</P>
<P>
   In switching John Randle from tackle to end, the Vikings have
sacrificed some inside penetration and diminished his ability to
disrupt the run. Minnesota will attempt to exploit Falcons OG
Calvin Collins and OT Ephraim Salaam. But other teams have tried
that, and RB Jamal Anderson still has rushed for 100 yards in 13 of
17 games. When he bounces to the outside, Anderson should be able
to run over the Vikings cornerbacks. He will earn his yards, but
he'll get his yards.

 &HT;    Duval deserves recognition
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight hits in 27 at-bats? Batting .296 is common in baseball but
except for a handful of historical instances, it is virtually
unheard of in professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   What David Duval has accomplished since the fall of 1997, when
he closed with three wins in a row, through Sunday's win at the
Mercedes Championships, is the kind of stuff few players in history
have managed to even approach. Duval's nine-shot victory at Kapalua
_ on 29 birdies _ gave him eight wins in 27 tournaments and more
than $4.3 million earned in less than 18 months. If Duval is not
atop golf's official world rankings when the figures, currently
putting Tiger Woods at No. 1, are updated, then maybe it's time for
golf's computer poo-bahs to check their respective motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as dominating as Duval has been, matching Nick Price's
nine wins in 27 starts in 1993-94, he can't touch the greatest runs
in golf history. In 1974-75, Johnny Miller won 11 times in 24
starts. Arnold Palmer (1962-63) and Tom Watson (1979-80) won 10
times in 27 starts. Jack Nicklaus won 10 of 27 in 1971-73, then ran
it to 12 of 30. Before the modern golf era, of course, Byron Nelson
won 11 tournaments in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for those 20 players from Kapalua playing this week
in Hawaii's Sony Open, the season's first full-field event, Duval
is taking the week off to go skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't do that as well as I play golf,'' the former
Georgia Tech player said, ``but I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday special
</P>
<P>
   So what is a PGA Tour player to do when he misses a Friday cut?
In some cases this year, tee it up on Saturday, anyway. Founded by
Gary Hallberg, in cooperation with the family of the late Bobby
Jones, the ``Bobby Jones Saturday Series'' will be played during 29
PGA Tour events, matching 22 pros with four-man amateur teams. The
fee is $2,000 per person, with a significant portion going to
charity. A event with 22 pros and 88 amateurs will be played April
3 at White Columns Golf Club in Alpharetta after the BellSouth
Classic. A 10-pro, 40-amateur tournament will be held April 10 in
the Augusta area after the Friday cut at the Masters. Atlanta's
Greg Powers (770-552-4454) is tournament director for both events.
. . . Tiger Woods is skipping the BellSouth the week before the
Masters, even as defending champion, but others consider it an
opportunity not to be missed. Tournament director Dave Kaplan
already has granted sponsor exemptions to Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie and Ian Woosnam of Wales. . . . Fred Couples, who last
played the BellSouth in 1996, when the tournament was played before
Augusta because of the Olympics, already has put Atlanta on his
April schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Car wars
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth fans, irked about parking since the move to the TPC at
Sugarloaf, have some potentially good news. The tournament has
purchased 12 acres of parking space adjacent to Peachtree
Industrial Boulevard and signed a 25-year agreement with the city
of Duluth for access to another 48 acres, adding room for about
4,500 more cars. The North Gwinnett Soccer Association will use the
land for the other 51 weeks of the year. . . . The Senior PGA Tour
Nationwide Championship has announced a record contribution of
$341,000 to the Scottish Rite Children's Center and a charity total
of $440,000 through proceeds from the 1998 tournament at
Alpharetta's Golf Club of Georgia. . . . The Augusta National Golf
Club recently announced a $3 million charity contribution,
including $1 million to the PGA Tour's First Tee program.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Masters in jeopardy?
</P>
<P>
   Reality appears to be setting in with Jack Nicklaus. He's at
least mentally preparing himself for hip-replacement surgery, which
would force an end to his streak of 40 Masters in a row. ``Right
now, I can't play at all,'' said Nicklaus who turns 59 next week.
``If I have to (have the surgery), I will.'' . . . Ernie Els, 29,
recently married his long-time girlfriend, Liezl Wehmeyer, in
Stellenbosch, South Africa. . . . Barbara Trammell has been
promoted to director of tournament operations for the LPGA,
replacing Suzanne Jackson, who died in November. . . . Jekyll
Island celebrated 100 years of golf last week at the Great Dunes
Golf Course with players dressed in period attire and using
reproduction antique golf clubs and balls. . . . Olin Browne missed
the Mercedes Championships because of a wrist injury but still
earned last-place money of $38,700. Normally the tour makes it
mandatory for even a injured player to show up for payment, but it
waived the policy because of traveling distance to Maui.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE SAYS HOUSE CASE WEAK, 'CONSTANTLY SHIFTING'
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers prepared to outline
their impeachment defense in detail on Wednesday, as his spokesman
lambasted the legal brief spelling out the charges against him,
saying ''it reads like a cheap mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   With opening arguments in Clinton's Senate impeachment trial set
to begin on Thursday, Clinton himself remained mum on the matter
that threatens his office.
</P>
<P>
   As he has for weeks, the president said nothing about the
impeachment trial during the one public event he held _ a 15-minute
speech on the environment before perhaps 100 environmental
activists at the National Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge was White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, who
assailed the legal brief filed with the Senate on Monday by
Clinton's House accusers.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that in some cases, the 105-page document
expressed the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
differently than the formal articles of impeachment the House
approved last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hallmark of a weak case is one where the charges are
constantly shifting, as they have here,'' Lockhart told reporters.
''In order to try to strengthen a case that they have not to date
effectively made on the law and the Constitution, the sands keep
shifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart further charged that the House brief, filed with the
Senate on behalf of the 13 House members elected to be the floor
managers for the prosecution of impeachment charges against
Clinton, was written more to excite the senses than to nail down a
legal position.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second hallmark of a weak case is hyperbole and overblown
rhetoric,'' Lockhart said of the House brief. ''It reads like a
cheap mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House will file its own extensive trial brief
Wednesday. It is expected to consist of more than 100 pages of
responses to the House charges, attacking them on legal, factual
and constitutional bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will basically make the case that, on the facts and the
evidence, the articles are not supported,'' Lockhart said.
''They're not supported based on the Constitution, nor do they have
a sufficient legal foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers filed a 13-page response to the impeachment
charges on Monday, outlining its position that the charges are
untrue and, even if they were, they don't warrant the president's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, a two-thirds majority of the Senate must
vote to convict Clinton on at least one of the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., leader of
the House managers, said of the press secretary's remarks, ``We
have nothing but respect for the White House brief, so I'll leave
the invective to Mr. Lockhart.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief midday trip to the National Arboretum, Clinton
holed up in the West Wing for the afternoon, working with senior
aides and speech writers on his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to give the speech before Congress on Jan. 19, at
a time when, according to the schedule senators agreed upon last
week, the Senate will be hearing his defense in his impeachment
trial stemming from the Monica Lewinsky sex and deception scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, though, that Clinton will deliver the speech, the
president's once-a-year chance to lay out his annual agenda
directly to the Congress and the American people, as scheduled last
month by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to be there on the 19th,'' Lockhart said. ''The
decision is firm.''

 &HT;    NASCAR Notebook: Earnhardt Jr. to ride Winston Cup circuit
 &HT;    By Al Levine and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Dale Earnhardt Jr., the defending NASCAR Busch
Series champion, will compete in five Winston Cup races this
season, including the Napa 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Nov.
21.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., the son of NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt and
grandson of legendary driver Ralph Earnhardt, will make his Winston
Cup debut in the No. 8 Budweiser car in the Coca-Cola 600 in
Charlotte on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have asked for a better situation to make my
Winston Cup debut,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I'll be racing at the
track near my hometown (of Kannapolis, N.C.), in a car owned by my
dad, and competing against the best drivers in the world on the
same track where he began his Winston Cup career. Best of all, I'll
have my granddad's No. 8.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., 24, also will run a full Busch schedule this
year. He will move to Winston Cup full-time for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr.'s other Cup events for 1999 are the Jiffy Lube 300
at New Hampshire on July 11; the Pepsi 400 at Michigan on Aug. 22;
and the Winston 500 at Talladega on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot changes
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker has named Tony
Barclay as crew chief for his No. 00 Pontiac. Barclay, a
31-year-old native of Muskegon, Mich., worked under Ricky Pearson
for Buckshot Racing during the past three years. Pearson was
promoted to general manager and will oversee the Winston and Busch
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's brother, Larry, will take over driving duties in the
Busch Series. Kenneth Campbell, crew chief for the Busch car, has
been hospitalized and underwent surgery Tuesday to remove a lymph
node.
</P>
<P>
   Bahari safari
</P>
<P>
   Bahari Racing still has only one car in Winston Cup, the No. 30
driven by Derrike Cope. But this season, it will add new meaning to
the concept of the multi-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   Barahi's new sponsor, Sara Lee Brands, will dress the car out in
four company lines, each with its own paint scheme and driver's
uniform colors.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dean Sausages will be the primary sponsor for 19 races,
Bryan Foods will be the primary sponsor for eight races, State Fair
Corn Dogs _ hey, the official corndog of NASCAR! _ will have its
name on the hood for seven races, and Rudy's Farm sausage biscuits
will carry the colors for one race.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement illustrated how far the marketing of stock-car
racing has come. It included an ROTC unit carrying flags, the
national anthem, strobe lights, cars onstage on rotating carousels,
a balloon confetti shower and indoor fireworks. Models wore the
driver's uniform for each car.
</P>
<P>
   Now all Cope has to do to live up to the hype is win a race for
the first time since 1990. The sponsor, though, is convinced it is
in the right arena: A company spokesman said NASCAR fans consume 26
million pounds of sausage per month.

 &HT;    Justices aim to define line between teasing, harrassmentBy Bill
Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday
questioned whether it should be left up to the courts to resolve
allegations of one school student sexually harassing another,
because boys and girls tease each other in classrooms every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that schoolchildren naturally do tease each other,''
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court heard arguments Tuesday on a Georgia
case in which a Forsyth, Ga. woman sued the Monroe County, Ga.
school board for failing to act on repeated complaints that her
daughter was sexually harassed by a fellow fifth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little boys tease little girls,'' O'Connor said. ``It happens
in every school nationwide. Is every one of these incidents going
to lead to a lawsuit?''
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched closely by school districts across the
country. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the child's mother,
school boards nationwide might have a legal obligation to protect
students from sexually harassing each other and could be forced to
pay monetary damages when they fail.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the student's mother, Aurelia Davis, and the Clinton
administration told the justices that schools should be held
legally responsible if officials deliberately ignore complaints
that a student is being sexually harassed by another.
</P>
<P>
   Mere teasing would not apply; the sexual harassment must be ``so
severe that it deprives a student's ability to get an education,''
Deputy Solicitor General Barbara Underwood told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Davis filed suit in 1994 after a student, described only as
``G.F.'' in court records, had allegedly sexually harassed Davis's
daughter, LaShonda, over a five-month period. Davis said the boy
groped at her daughter's breasts and genital area, rubbed up
against her and sexually taunted her.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she and LaShonda, who is now 16, repeatedly
complained about the harassment to school officials, who did little
if anything to stop it. LaShonda's grades plummeted, she began
having nightmares and her father found a suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis took her complaints to the county sheriff's
department, ``G.F.'' eventually pleaded guilty to sexual battery in
Juvenile Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks the Supreme Court to hold school districts
liable for student-on-student sexual harassment under Title IX of
the 1972 Education Amendments, which say that schools receiving
federal funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex. The court
has treated sexual harassment in schools as a form of illegal
discrimination, but only when teachers or school officials have
been accused of sexually harassing a student, not
student-on-student.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments, a number of justices expressed concern about
transferring the legal requirements governing sexual harassment
from the workplace to schoolchildren in the nation's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does the school define sexual harassment among students?''
wondered Justice David Souter. ``. . . Little gangs form in schools
and their teasing can be very pervasive and very distressing to
other kids. Boys tease girls because they are girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer noted that schools often resolve
complaints through ``discussion, mediation, bringing in the
parents, psychologists. . . .Is there some way for the law to be
sensitive to that?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia asked playfully, ``Do we need to set some
'reasonable teenager standard?' ``
</P>
<P>
   During one exchange with the justices, school board attorney W.
Warren Plowden Jr. of Macon, Ga. said that if school boards are to
be held liable, ``no matter what the standard or how high you set
the bar, once you open the door to the federal courthouse a rash of
litigation will follow.'' And then the federal courts will have to
decide whether a school's response to an allegation of sexual
harassment was appropriate enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only money,'' Scalia interjected, again with a sarcastic
edge.
</P>
<P>
   To which Justice Anthony Kennedy quickly remarked, ``It's not
only money. This is about whether we would need a federal code of
conduct in every classroom in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' Plowden replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis's lawyer, Verna Williams of the National Women's Law
Center, told the justices that dismissing the lawsuit would give
parents and students no legal remedy under Title IX against
student-on-student sexual harassment, ``no matter how severe or
pervasive the misconduct, no matter how cognizant the schools were
of the harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the arguments, Plowden said that he believed the
school board acted responsibly when responding to Davis's
complaints, noting that the mother's lawsuit was dismissed before
pre-trial fact-finding could begin to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to the complaints of sexual harassment in an
appropriate manner,'' Plowden said. ``We dispute the facts alleged
in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, who attended the arguments with her husband, Leroy,
disagreed. ``When LaShonda and I asked for help from the school,
our complaints went ignored.''

 &HT;    Company building a better Y2K trap
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most PC software programs that test for Y2K problems
conduct limited searches. These explore only the computer's first
two layers, its real time clock and its BIOS, a chip in which basic
instructions have been hard wired.
</P>
<P>
   But most problems happen at the third level, in the operating
systems such as Windows or UNIX , claims Alpharetta-based
Client/Server Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Their updated product tests all three layers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unique things about our product, `Foundation/2000,
version 9,' '' said Alfred Nickles, president of the company.
``First, we test the operating system's application programming
interfaces, the path that programs use to access time and date
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that in conjunction with testing the BIOS and the real
time clock. The issue here is, while individual pieces may be
compliant, the sum of the pieces may not be. There is no other test
product on the market that we are aware of that tests these
interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, though, aren't ready to acknowledge the Alpharetta
company has the better Y2K trap. ``There are a lot of products out
there and they all do things a little differently,'' said Suzanne
Sliter, spokesman for Centennial 2000 made by Centennial
International in Burlingame, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fix the BIOS with our product, and if the real time clock,
a hardware piece that can't be fixed using software, is OK, that's
all the fixing that's necessary,'' she said. ``The key is the BIOS.
You gotta fix the BIOS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it's important to obtain compliance statements from
application manufacturers. We provide all of this testing plus an
inventory of applications that can be used to obtain compliance
statements,'' Sliter said.
</P>
<P>
   Her company's product starts at $48 per PC and can be ordered at
650-373-2090.
</P>
<P>
   One of Client/ Server Technologies' major customers doesn't
agree with Sliter's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's a Year 2000 exposure that goes beyond
checking the BIOS and the real time clock, and this is the only
product we found that does that,'' said Jim Deffenbaugh, vice
president, technology, at Equifax. ``We've been real pleased with
the product and the level of support.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: the Client/Server Technologies product tests for
Y2K and issues reports, but it doesn't fix the glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1993, employs 11, and its been in the
Year 2000 business since 1995. In addition to Equifax, clients
include BellSouth and several U.S. intelligence agencies, Nickles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Client/Server Technologies is located at 3050 Royal Blvd. S.,
Suite 180, Alpharetta 30022.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can order the testing program at 770-360-6302, and
individuals can download it from the Internet (http://www.f2k.com).
The cost is $49.95.

 &HT;    Falcons offensive line a force on, off field
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten large men were squirreled away the other day in a
dark meeting room in Suwanee, Ga. when the senior member of the
crew, NFL Hall of Fame offensive lineman Art Shell, pointed out
something on video. One of his pupils, Falcons left guard Calvin
Collins, made a nice play.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight men clapped softly, each smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In a season full of feel-good moments, the offensive line has
supplied plenty, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   No unit has surpassed expectations more than the men who cleared
the way for running back Jamal Anderson to rush for a
franchise-record 1,846 rushing yards and for Chris Chandler to
finish as fourth-highest-rated passer in the league.
</P>
<P>
   They all have played a big part in the Falcons' best-ever 15-2
season and first-ever berth in Sunday's NFC Championship Game, at
Minnesota (16-1). The biggest guys on the team _ Atlanta's starting
offensive linemen average 6-feet-4, and 308 pounds _ are the
closest. They go to lunch, dinner and movies together, have mutual
business interests and, most importantly, they play together.
That's essential on the offensive line. Shell, the Falcons'
offensive line coach, was pleased while reviewing film of
Saturday's 20-18 win over San Francisco. ``I've been on Calvin all
year about this: When your guy goes inside, . . . stay where you
belong, don't go with him,'' Shell said. ``Take care of your
assignment, and then help your buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust each other, and then worry about helping out. He did it
right, and the guys clapped. It was probably Calvin's best game of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were short on trust at the beginning of the season,
as Collins, 25, moved from center to left guard and Robbie Tobeck,
28, moved from left guard to center. Rookie Ephraim Salaam, 22,
became the starter at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   That left right guard Gene Williams, 30, and left tackle Bob
Whitfield, 27, as the only two starters in the same spot from last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta surrendered 16 sacks in the first three games. In the
final 13 games, the Falcons gave up just 2.8 sacks a game _ not a
great average but a major improvement over the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the running game has been great, as Anderson rushed
for 100 or more yards in 12 of the last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck calls the blocking assignments on the line. Sometimes,
though, he has to trust that his linemates see what he sees. They
developed that trust by going to lunch together every Friday at Don
Pablo's Tex-Mex in Lawrenceville or Pappadeaux's in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line also fines the heck out of heach other, for
any number of designated infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck said they already have accumulated about $6,000 among
themselves _ ``For quotes in the paper, missed assignments, sacks,
complaining too much,'' he said. ``It's mostly for complaining too
much. They call it the 'Robbie Rule.' Figure that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a line, you always try to do things together. That goes a
long way toward camaraderie. You get to know how the next guy
thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep snapper and reserve center/guard Adam Schreiber, a 15-year
veteran, is commissioner of the O-Line Club, and the only one
allowed to ``touch the board'' on which fines are written in the
meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield and Tobeck are sergeants-at-arms, meaning they
determine fines, although Williams has plenty of input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to get fined the most,'' Salaam said. ``Maybe because
I'm youngest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie reserve guard Bob Hallen _ the quietest of the nine
linemen, who also include rookie reserve tackle Jose Portilla and
reserve center/guard Dave Widell _ is treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   They already have donated money to the Falcons Youth Foundation,
and after the season, they'll donate part of the remainder to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will be used to rent limosuines for a night out with
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield said it's all part of keeping everybody on the same
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about this line is we bounce back
after bad plays and stick together,'' he said. ``That's because we
hang with each other, we talk to each other. Somebody might say,
'Watch the bull rush,' or 'If I get a chance, I'm going to break
his ribs for you.' We work as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   On game days, they're all business, and Shell said each man has
made significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield has been more consistent in his approach to every
game. Collins is using his hands better. Tobeck is doing a better
job of staying low. Williams has improved at finishing plays. And
Salaam has gotten better in a lot of ways, including keeping his
6-foot-7, 295-pound body low.
</P>
<P>
   The key has been the ability to read each other's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to slide toward a guy or a linebacker moves or
something, I'll say something at the line,'' Tobeck said. ``If
Chris (Chandler) hears me, he'll slow the count to give me time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, depending on the play clock, there's no time.
Then I have to count on the guys to see the same things. Usually,
that's what happens, because we've all learned how the others
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell heartily endorses his linemen and their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like dancers; they got to work together,'' he said.
``When you hang out together, even if you're not here, you're still
talking football, little things, techniques that make you better as
a team.''

IMAGINATION AUGMENTS YOUNG GIRL'S LOVE LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young couple in the picture look so happy. The scene is
pastoral and peaceful. She is sitting atop a beautiful, brown horse
as he stands on the ground holding the leather reins in his large,
brown fist.
</P>
<P>
   The wind makes it's presence known in the wispy strands of hair
that float beside her smiling face and the waves that ruffle the
animal's long dark mane. The sun's rays illuminate the sky and the
popcorn clouds that adorn the horizon. If the picture could speak,
one feels that it would opine, ``This is no ordinary love, no
ordinary love!''
</P>
<P>
   I handle the small picture carefully. With the passage of time,
it has become worn and frail. The colors have dulled beneath the
glaring light of extensive scrutiny by dozens of curious young
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I remember when that picture was the talk of the town or at
least, the talk of my school. His name was Jim or Bob or Jim Bob,
something like that. He was a big corn-fed country poke that I met
during a visit with my grandmother many harvest moons ago. Even
though I was only in junior high school, we had a whirlwind romance
that started the day we took that picture. Two months later my
mother let the cat out of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bob was so smitten with me. He called once a week and wrote
me beautiful love letters every other day. He even bought me some
hypoallergenic earrings that I wore every day in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. That meddlesome, gossip Erica came over one
day after school. When my mother peeked into my room to see if we
wanted some Kool-Aid and vanilla wafers, Erica said, ``Your
daughter really does have a neat boyfriend. I wish my boyfriend
could write poetry and speak three languages.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What boyfriend?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the one that lives in the country. The boy in the
picture with the pretty horse,'' Erica said, a mischievous glint in
her good eye, the one on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Mom smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, him. That's not her boyfriend. That's her cousin and he's
at least 18 or 19 years old. He speaks a little pig latin and he
can throw a bale of hay 30 yards, but that's about the extent of
his marketable skills. We're hoping that he gets promoted this
year. He's been in the 10th grade a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Busted.
</P>
<P>
   Now the whole world would find out that my Romeo was really my
academically challenged fifth cousin who didn't even want to take a
picture with me in the first place but his mother made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the boys had their lockerroom talk, most of my friends had
real boyfriends and I had nothing more than a phone that never rang
and a vivid imagination. So I invented a boyfriend and, frankly,
that was one of the best relationships I ever had. He never gave me
a bit of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that picture still makes me smile. I'm not sure what ever
happened to old Jim Bob. Last I heard, he had become a millionaire
writing romance novels. As for Erica, well she never told my
secret, but I had to help her with her homework for two years.
</P>
<P>
   And me, well, I have enough real drama now that I don't have to
make things up anymore. Not often, anyway.
</P>

POLL SHOWS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT EDUCATION OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Californians support tough new measures to
reform public schools but only narrowly favor Gov. Gray Davis'
proposal to allow the state to take over failing schools, according
to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Monday, also found that while the public
considered education California's most urgent concern, residents
had little faith in the state's ability to tackle major issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is very skeptical of the ability of the
governor and the Legislature to solve the most pressing problems
facing the state,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey
of 2,022 residents statewide for the nonprofit Public Policy
Institute of California. ``I think, politically, this makes it a
very difficult task in the next year for Gray Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis won election in November, in part, by promising to fix the
state's ailing public schools, and he has made education reform the
centerpiece of his first budget.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed, among other ideas, requiring high school
seniors to pass exit exams to graduate and a system to reward good
teachers and fire bad ones through evaluations by other educators.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's telephone poll, conducted Dec. 4-13, found
strong support for get-tough measures to reform schools, such as
requiring that teachers be better trained, which Davis has said he
supports.
</P>
<P>
   And the poll showed the public spreads the blame for the current
state of California's public schools. Though Davis has urged that
teachers not be blamed, the largest percentage of those surveyed,
22 percent, cited teachers as most responsible for the poor quality
of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents also blamed a lack of state money (11 percent),
overcrowded classrooms and aging facilities (11 percent), parents
(11 percent) and local school boards and administrators (5
percent).
</P>
<P>
   The poll found consensus for a number of reform proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty-four percent support merit pay to attract and reward
good teachers. Davis has proposed giving $10,000 to teachers who
get more rigorous certification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty-five percent favor requiring better training for
teachers and a tougher credentials process before they reach the
classroom. Davis wants more money for teacher training programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty-eight percent want students to pass a test before being
promoted to the next grade. Davis has proposed a graduation exam,
but only for high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ninety-one percent support remedial after-school programs and
summer schools for students who are not performing up to their
grade level. Davis has asked for more money for programs targeting
reading.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, however, found more tepid support for the new
governor's proposal for state takeovers of under-performing
schools. While 56 percent of respondents favored the idea, 39
percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has called for a Jan. 19 special session of the
Legislature on the overhaul of the state's education system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said the new poll raised several red flags for Davis
as he began his term.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, only 11 percent said they had a great deal of
confidence in the ability of the governor and Legislature to solve
the state's most important problems, while 58 percent said they had
only some confidence. Twenty-one percent said they had little
confidence and 9 percent said they had no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Even more strikingly, respondents by a 3-1 ratio said they
believed the initiative process was a better way to address state
issues than laws passed by elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I think the governor and the Legislature in
California have that extra pressure of citizen initiatives in 2000
if the public becomes impatient and frustrated with the pace (of
education reform) in Sacramento,'' Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   A note for Davis: Although he won by a 20-point margin in
November, only 53 percent of those polled knew his name; 47 percent
said they didn't know who was governor or gave another name.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT TO REST IN MICROSOFT CASE, CLAIMING SUCCESS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After calling 12 witnesses, offering nearly 11
weeks of testimony and entering tens of thousands of pages of
documents into the trial record, the government plans to rest its
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so claiming, in the words of Joel Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief, that it has presented ``compelling
evidence'' to show that the software giant ``has engaged in a
widespread pattern and practice of anti-competitive efforts
designed to crush any threat to its (Windows) operating system
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But that claim was disputed on the federal courthouse steps
Tuesday by John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer in the landmark
case.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the same spot where, minutes before, Klein had
spoken, Warden said that, from its inception, this case has been
brought on behalf of Microsoft's beleaguered competitors in the
personal computer arena and not to protect consumers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curtain is coming down on a feeble case presented by the
government,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Warden said he will file an 11-page motion for dismissal on
behalf of his client immediately after the government rests at
midday. But he conceded that Microsoft has ``no realistic
expectation'' of being excused by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson from putting on its own quota of 12 witness and
going home as a winner on an early decision.

<P>
   The defense phase probably will extend the trial well into
March, with a verdict and the inevitable appeals by the losing side
to follow in the months to come. Jackson had initially reserved six
weeks on his court calendar to try the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   As a parade of industry and academic witnesses has marched into
Jackson's 100-seat second-floor courtroom, the judge has taken an
increasingly direct role in the proceedings. On several occasions,
Jackson left Microsoft's $600-an-hour lawyers standing mute at the
podium while he directed his own questions to the witness.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, on Tuesday Jackson asked the government's final
witness whether Microsoft has followed a strategy of ``delayed
gratification'' by keeping its software prices low.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could indeed by true,'' said economics professor Franklin
Fisher, in his fifth day of testimony. ``Microsoft is taking its
profits in ways that are not reflected in the price of the
operating system,'' he added, by choosing to protect its valuable
Windows franchise rather than further raise its prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible to have a firm charge a price higher than if it
had no monopoly power and still not charge the highest price it
could,'' Fisher held.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, he contended, counts on the money it makes from such
applications as the Microsoft Office suite of programs, while
giving its Web browser away to thwart rival Netscape Communications
Corp., from designing a new operating system around an enhanced
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which has been joined by 19 states in filing
suit, has pursued the Netscape issue vigorously. But it dropped
original plans to include Microsoft Office in the complaint, as
some state attorneys general had urged, to streamline an already
complex case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's question seemed to knock the stuffing out of a key
defense claim: If Microsoft is so all-powerful as the government
charges, why hasn't it charged a lot more for its products?

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT TO REST IN MICROSOFT CASE, CLAIMING SUCCESS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After calling 12 witnesses, offering nearly 11
weeks of testimony and entering tens of thousands of pages of
documents into the trial record, the government plans to rest its
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so claiming, in the words of Joel Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief, that it has presented ``compelling
evidence'' to show that the software giant ``has engaged in a
widespread pattern and practice of anti-competitive efforts
designed to crush any threat to its (Windows) operating system
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But that claim was disputed on the federal courthouse steps
Tuesday by John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer in the landmark
case.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the same spot where, minutes before, Klein had
spoken, Warden said that, from its inception, this case has been
brought on behalf of Microsoft's beleaguered competitors in the
personal computer arena and not to protect consumers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curtain is coming down on a feeble case presented by the
government,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Warden said he will file an 11-page motion for dismissal on
behalf of his client immediately after the government rests at
midday. But he conceded that Microsoft has ``no realistic
expectation'' of being excused by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson from putting on its own quota of 12 witness and
going home as a winner on an early decision.
</P>
<P>
   The defense phase probably will extend the trial well into
March, with a verdict and the inevitable appeals by the losing side
to follow in the months to come. Jackson had initially reserved six
weeks on his court calendar to try the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   As a parade of industry and academic witnesses has marched into
Jackson's 100-seat second-floor courtroom, the judge has taken an
increasingly direct role in the proceedings. On several occasions,

SALT LAKE CITY GAMES WON'T BE MOVED, PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Games will go on. The Lords of the Rings affirmed this week
that there's no chance the 2002 Winter Olympics will be moved from
Salt Lake City in the wake of the worst scandal in modern Olympic
history.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually everything else will change, from the membership
of the International Olympic Committee to the selection of future
sites to the rules for future American bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   As many as a dozen of the Lords, many of them from Africa,
probably will be asked to resign later this month for accepting
cash and gifts, apparently meant to buy their votes, from the Salt
Lake City organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to throw the bad apples out of the barrel as soon as
possible,'' said Richard Pound, the IOC vice president and Montreal
attorney who is directing the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which allows all 115 members to choose host cities, has
banned them from visiting any of the six European bidders for the
2006 Winter Games, which will be awarded in June. And it's all but
certain that every Olympics from 2008 on will be selected by the
IOC's 11-member executive board.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee, which will help the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee choose its new president and chief operating
officer, will be even more involved with US candidates than it has
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will future bid cities see more of the USOC?'' said president
William Hybl. ``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake scandal, which involved cash payments up to
$70,000, college tuition payments, jobs, free medical care, and
expensive gifts to IOC members and their relatives, has been a
profound embarrassment all around _ to the IOC, to the USOC, to the
SLOC, to the state of Utah, and to Salt Lake City, whose mayor,
Deedee Corradini, announced Monday that she would not run for a
third term this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics have been a shining light, but there is a
sinister and dark corner of corruption,'' said Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt. ``This culture of corruption has taken root because of a
lack of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which has never expelled a member in its 105 years, is
expected to force nearly one-10th of the Lords to step down. Pound
sent letters this week to those believed to be involved, giving
them 10 days to explain themselves before the IOC's executive board
takes action Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that point, we believe that we will have folks who need to
resign clearly identified and, I hope, resignations in hand,'' said
IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, one of three American members.
``So I expect there are going to be fewer members of the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLOC, which is being investigated by the IOC, USOC, the US
Department of Justice, and its own ethics board, has already had
its bloodletting. President Frank Joklik and senior vice president
Dave Johnson stepped down last Friday, marketing and legal affairs
vice president Kelly Flint and licensing director Rod Hamson were
placed on paid leave, and former president Tom Welch was deprived
of his $10,000-a-month consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   Though the USOC, which is the SLOC's marketing partner, says it
won't take over operational control of the organizing committee, it
will take a more active hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are there in a consulting or an assisting role,'' said
Hybl.
</P>
<P>
   A special USOC panel investigating the Salt Lake scandal,
chaired by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, will make
its report by the end of February. The SLOC and USOC are expected
to announce a joint group Wednesday that will choose replacements
for Joklik and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who will be the SLOC's third in less than 18
months, is all but certain to be a Utahan. SLOC board chairman
Robert Garff is said to be the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEO should be from Utah,'' said Hybl. ``It has to do with
a degree of confidence and a degree of familiarity with the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the SLOC's previous financial improprieties, the chief
operating officer is likely to be an outsider. Roger Jackson, who
helped run the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, has been mentioned as
an interim successor to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The COO is more critical at this point,'' said Hybl. ``I would
be surprised if there isn't someone within 2-4 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Games are still three years off and most of the
venues are already in place, the SLOC still needs to raise $245
million of the $859 million in sponsorship cash that forms the bulk
of its $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC had hoped to have that part wrapped up by August. But
the scandal, says John Krimsky, who runs the USOC's business
affairs, has delayed the target date for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a huge impact on 2002,'' said John Hancock
president David D'Alessandro, who added that his company will
``wait and see'' before staying on as a worldwide Olympic sponsor
for the next quadrennium. ``I don't think any major American
corporation will step up unless they know more. Why would they
invest in something that may tarnish?''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, worried that American companies will drop their Olympic
sponsorships, had marketing director Michael Payne meet in Atlanta
Tuesday with officials from Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and United
Parcel Service to assure them that corrupt members would be dealt
with.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Salt Lake scandal has made certain that the
USOC, which shares in host-city marketing revenues, will exercise
much more direct oversight over future bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to sign a document that puts us in the middle of
their doings,'' said a USOC spokesman. ``And it will be a different
document than it would have been three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the scandal, the USOC had decided to take more
control over the domestic bidding process. After Atlanta's
operational and fiscal problems with the 1996 Summer Olympics and a
two-year negotiating wrangle with Salt Lake, the USOC laid down the
law in November 1997 to candidates for the 2012 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Besides requiring six-figure deposits and public underwriting,
the USOC has moved to stop the junketeering and lavish handouts
that got Salt Lake in trouble. It has banned cities from contacting
the IOC, national Olympic committees, or international sports
federations until they're chosen as US bidder in 2002. It has also
limited gifts to USOC members to a $50 total. ``That's a couple of
pins and a T-shirt,'' said a USOC officer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the IOC prepared for an unprecedented purge, Salt
Lake City was trying to focus on 2002 _ and a measure of
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal will follow its course,'' said a USOC officer.
``The healing part has got to begin. The mind-set now is to get
back to putting on the best Games possible.''

SNOW MELTS THE HEART OF A DESERT RAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I had hoped that I wouldn't let it happen again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I knew that the sun would be shining, the sky would
be blue _ why complain?
</P>
<P>
   Still . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's the media's fault. (Isn't everything?)
</P>
<P>
   I was watching CNN on Friday. The U.S. Senate had agreed to
postpone deciding whether to allow witnesses in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton; this was hailed as a great step
forward, and the announcers were bandying about words such as
``historic,'' so I turned up the volume and watched.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal was hammered out, they cut to Joseph Biden and
John McCain, a couple of senators always unavoidable for comment.
They were standing outside the Senate and said . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea. I didn't hear a word they uttered. It wasn't
that they were reciting long-winded, self-congratulatory pablum
(though they might have been).
</P>
<P>
   It was the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of it, falling down in buckets. The senators were bundled
up in topcoats and scarves, their breath making frosty little
clouds. And what looked like a minor-league blizzard was dumping
white powder all around them.
</P>
<P>
   Every frozen flake that fell broke a little more of my heart.
</P>
<P>
   It was beautiful. The senators didn't make a big deal out of it,
only a joke between McCain and a commentator about who was going to
pay his hospital bill after making him stand out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I was wearing shorts.
</P>
<P>
   But I got over it and moved on with my life. I settled in for
the weekend, to watch the Cardinals playoff game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. The game was in Minnesota. The usual flock of local
media outlets followed the team and outdid themselves relating how,
well, what do you know?, it's really cold up here in Minneapolis.
Below zero, even.
</P>
<P>
   That was bad enough. But then Fox, the network broadcasting the
game, showed all sorts of winter scenes between commercials. Ice
fishing. Cross-country skiing. (begin ital) Snow. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Local temperature: mid-70s.
</P>
<P>
   Just surfing past the Weather Channel is, of course, an exercise
in sadomasochism this time of year, what with the constant footage
of wicked winter storms elsewhere and the perky predictions for
more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   I know, we had a smattering of snow here in Phoenix in December,
an occasion so rare it garnered front-page headlines and led the
local TV newscasts. I immediately grabbed the video camera and
recorded for posterity the few flurries that fell in my back yard;
when I played it back, it looked like a still life with a slight
case of dandruff.
</P>
<P>
   I also know that every time I'm actually around snow, I'm given
a toe-numbing reminder of how cold it has to be to produce the
stuff. And that the Valley is populated with small armies of
Midwesterners who would rather stick knitting needles into their
eardrums than see another flake fall.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they're here.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't help it. I love snow.
</P>
<P>
   Like anything interesting, it's a contradiction. On the one
hand, it brings people together, either in suffering or happiness,
depending on your point of view. Snow falls on the rich and poor
alike (and, as Joyce wrote, the living and the dead).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, part of the beauty of snow is the solitude it
brings. The silence, the wet smell, the bite at your ears and nose
all but demand introspection _ especially when it snows at night.
Is there any more peaceful sound than the almost-sleighbell-like
muffled jingling of tire chains a few blocks over after a fresh
snow has fallen in the darkness?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Nothing a bright 70-degree January day offers, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure my weather-related weariness will pass. It's not as if
I don't enjoy benefits of the warmer weather: golf in
shirt-sleeves, dinner on the patio, that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   And one day _ perhaps next year _ maybe I won't miss snow
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Though no matter how much I may hope otherwise, I'm sure I
will. &QL;

`60 MINUTES' CLONE CLOCKS IN 
</HEADLINE>
 MINUTES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``60 Minutes'' has been often imitated, never
duplicated. Until Wednesday night, when the first officially
sanctioned clone of the veteran CBS newsmagazine comes to life.
</P>
<P>
   Call it sensible commerce or yet another sign that broadcast
networks have reached rock-bottom idea bankruptcy, but the coming
of ``60 Minutes II'' brings the newsmagazine saga full circle.
Remember, ``60 Minutes'' created the genre and its tricks _ the
shotgun interviews, the dramatic storytelling, the cult of the star
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, ``60 Minutes'' changed television forever by
proving that such news could be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some first-class telejournalism was committed along
the way, but the true legacy of ``60 Minutes' is the current
proliferation of prime-time newsmagazines, a shortsighted trend
that has encouraged broadcast networks to insert a ``Dateline'' or
``20/20'' into any time slot that needs shoring up.
</P>
<P>
   Newsmagazines are cheaper to produce than entertainment
programming and tend to deliver consistently acceptable ratings.
But there are reasons to believe that networks may be draining
their core business _ attracting loyal viewers to ongoing comedy
and drama series in prime time _ by perpetually plugging the
schedule with cookie-cutter newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   The deep decline in overall network ratings is the most obvious
of those reasons.
</P>
<P>
   To fully launch ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS recently brought its
stars into close contact with members of the Television Critics
Association, gathered in Pasadena for their annual winter publicity
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The new show will have its own correspondents (including ``CBS
News'' veteran Bob Simon and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose, among
others) but will share the look and feel of its venerable ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Tingle, a Boston-based actor and comic who has worked for
MSNBC, gets the Andy Rooney slot on ``60 Minutes II,'' which will
also feature regular updates of so-called classic ``60 Minutes''
stories, reported by the classic personalities who reported them
the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them: ``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather, whose
grizzled and chiseled visage will regularly accompany the
franchise's trademark tick, tick, tick.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, a veteran of the original ``60 Minutes'' who will
contribute fresh stories as well as classic updates to its
offspring hour, has been anchor and managing editor of the CBS
flagship newscast since March 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Forget turf battles between parent and child. (``Mike Wallace
gets what he wants,'' Rather said. ``The (stories) he doesn't want
to do or doesn't know about, the rest of us have the right to
squabble over.'') Considering the demands of the anchor job _
especially in weighty times such as these _ how will Rather find
time for newsmag legwork?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too much is made of how much work this is,'' he said.
``Everybody has their version of this. I'm not playing humble
beginnings, but I have worked stripped to my waist in 115-degree
temperatures for minimum wage with no benefits, thank you very
much, and (begin ital) that (end ital) was work. We worked from
early dawn until well after dark moving dirt. Now that's real work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This passion of mine, this joy of mine, it takes hours, it
takes time, it takes some juggling the schedule around, but listen,
I have worked for a living, and this beats working any day of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his existing responsibilities by signing on with ``60
Minutes II'' was ``not something anybody asked me to do,'' Rather
told the critics. ``It's something I jumped at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still chasing the dream _ and that's one reason I do it _
that I'm going to be a great reporter. And if you're going to be a
great reporter, you've got to report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to grab a pencil and a notebook and get out of the
office, and this is another chance to do it. I also will say that
my doctor told me that I suffer from too much relaxation, and he
recommended stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The question can't be dismissed with Danny Deadline talk,
however. Most of the ``60 Minutes II'' correspondents will also
keep their demanding day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The last significant newsmagazine launch, CNN's prime-time
collaboration with ``Time'' magazine, resulted in the ill-fated
Tailwind story, from which both news organizations almost
immediately backstroked.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the credibility of both news organizations involved,
the party most wounded in that debacle was correspondent Peter
Arnett, who, it was subsequently revealed, was not deeply involved
in the reporting of the story, which claimed that the U.S. military
used nerve gas on American defectors during the Vietnam War. The
prospect of ``60 Minutes II'' correspondents having to
``parachute'' into stories seems quite real. Unseen producers do a
vast majority of the scut work on newsmagazines anyway (including
``60 Minutes''), but Arnett, previously regarded as one of the best
TV reporters of his generation, is still recovering from the
third-degree career burns he got from adding his stand-up narration
to a piece that others had created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a danger in this particular form of journalism, but there
are dangers in every form,'' said Simon, who also met the critics.
``In hard news, the number of times that I have parachuted into a
place, landed at an airport, gotten into a taxi, gotten into a
hotel and the phone was ringing and I had to get on the phone and
explain the story _ you know, I've done that more times than I care
to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is why, as you may have figured out, taxi drivers get
quoted so often.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Coaches recognized Jordan's gifts right from start
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His first NBA coach, Kevin Loughery understood Michael
Jordan's potential in two days of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it that quick,'' Loughery said Tuesday. ``We
took one look and we knew what we had, or really, what we would
have as time went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's second coach, Stan Albeck, had him for only 18 regular
season games, plus a three-game playoff series against Boston. In
that short time, Jordan confirmed everything Loughery believed he
might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Larry Bird saying, 'We may be looking at a
basketball god,''' Albeck recalled, noting the accuracy of the
Celtic great's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Loughery lasted a year with the Bulls in a long coaching career
that took him from Julius Erving to Dominique Wilkins to Jordan to
Bernard King. An Atlanta resident and analyst for ESPN radio,
Loughery was involved with then Bulls general manager Rod Thorn in
the decision to make Jordan the third pick of the draft after
Hakeem Olajuwon and Sam Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 3 he proved a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that you have a guy as a rookie and in two
days you see he's going to be a great player,'' Loughery said.
``His talents were enormous, but his will to win, no one could
surpass that. That over-rides everything I saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would play games in practice, first team to 10 wins and I'd
wait until his side was up 8-1, 8-2, then put Mike on the other
team. He'd get mad at me and he'd go out and win the game from
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Later was the famous scrimmage in which Jordan charged that Phil
Jackson had cheated his team and stalked off the court.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Jordan had the stature of greatness, confirming it
with six championships in his last six full seasons, over eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough on his teammates, even as a rookie who left
college a year early,'' Loughery said. ``He's the type player, he
could walk into any team and he's the leader in two minutes as a
rookie. Even with superstars he would have dominated because that
was his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Jordan missed 64 games in 1985-86 with a broken
navicular bone in his foot. He came back in mid-March, led the
Bulls in scoring the last eight games of the season, then went for
49 against the Celtics in the first game of the playoffs, then 63
in game 2, a double overtime loss for the Bulls who were swept in
game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the beginning of the double-team in the NBA, ``
Albeck recalled. ``Detroit would run two guys at him to get the
ball out of his hands. I asked him, 'what's your first thought when
that happens,' and he said, 'I figure I have one second to decide
whether I pass, dribble or shoot it. if I dribble I have to break
the double team and go right to the basket and you know what you
have there _ a shot-blocking center. I have to assimilate all that
in my mind immediately.' I'm not sure I've seen guys be able to do
that. It was like he was programmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeck said he can close his eyes and see Jordan in that short
playoff series. ``First time I ever saw anybody come out on a high
pick and roll, when the center came out. He put the ball behind his
back, knifed between (Kevin) McHale and D.J. (Dennis Johnson) and
went to the hole. Best I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   How good was he?
</P>
<P>
   ``We might never see his like for 100 years,'' Albeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Loughery ranked him alongside Erving, Bird, Magic Johnson and
David Stern as the five people who had the greatest impact on the
modern game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players in the NBA owe these five people. They carried the
league,'' Loughery said. ``But in the last 10 years, Mike did it by
himself. That's how good he was.''

TOOTH TRUTHS: IF IT GETS KIDS TO BRUSH, IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD, RIGHT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are they toothbrushes, or are they toys? And are some really
better than others?
</P>
<P>
   With more choices than ever in the realm of kids' toothbrushes,
selecting the right one is easier _ and harder _ than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the Incredible Hulk? He glows in the dark and is
available with three different brushing heads. Or maybe it's
Flexaroo, which has a kangaroo with a baby joey fashioned in the
handle. Brushes come bedecked with cartoon characters on the
handles or packaged with tiny toy figurines.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Sportsbrushes sport soccer balls, footballs and
baseballs at the end of their handles, or even cheerleaders,
baseball players and football players built right into the grip.
</P>
<P>
   The newest gizmo is the REACH Powerbrush, which promoters say,
``combines the fun of a toy with proven plaque-busting
performance.'' The battery-powered brush vibrates at 7,000 beats a
minute tickling kids teeth and, with any luck, encouraging them to
brush more frequently and longer.
</P>
<P>
   Do all the bells and whistles really help kids brush better? The
answer is a qualified yes. In a recent survey, 19 of 20 parents
said that giving children a toothbrush specifically designed for
them motivates their children to brush their teeth, according to
the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists. The academy
unofficially recommends ``whatever works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoon characters, attractive colors and battery operation
may be exciting features for some children,'' notes Karen Fox,
communications coordinator for the academy. ``They are not
necessary. However, they may motivate children to brush
regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   The important features to a kid's toothbrush are simple: bristle
size and softness. ``Basically, the most important thing is that
the toothbrush be the right size, that it has a head small enough
to fit in the child's mouth,'' says Sherry Williams, office manager
for Dr. Bruce Weiner, a pediatric dentist in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's toothbrushes should have soft bristles and be
replaced frequently,'' Williams says. ``Younger children tend to
chew on them, so they wear out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   For young children, Weiner also recommends keeping two
toothbrushes in use, one for the child and one for the parent so
that parent and child can either take turns brushing the child's
teeth or the parent can follow up and make sure the child didn't
miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children's brushes have a longer handle with a smaller
head. You have to look for them, but they work best for parents
helping small children to brush,'' Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that the parent stand behind the child to brace
the child's head and to give a little more control as the adult
reaches over and around the child to help with the brushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they can tie their own shoes, they don't have the
dexterity to brush their own teeth,'' says Chris Smith, spokesman
for the Chicago Dental Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of products out there geared for really small
kids,'' Smith said in a telephone interview. ``We don't advocate
any of them. Our only position is that parents should be
supervising and/or brushing up to the age of 6, 7 or 8, depending
on the dexterity of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also warns against using too much toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids just haven't developed the gag reflex they need to keep
from swallowing toothpaste. They can develop fluorosis _ flaking
white spots on the teeth _ from swallowing too much fluoride,'' he
notes.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Business of Brushing
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatric Dentists offers the following
tips for parents of tots:
</P>
<P>
   _Children should have their own toothbrushes as soon as they
have teeth.
</P>
<P>
   _The best brushes for children have soft, round-ended (polished)
bristles that clean teeth but are gentle on the gums.
</P>
<P>
   _Children can play with the brush and chew on it, but parents
are responsible for thoroughly brushing the child's teeth until the
child has the manual dexterity required to properly accomplish this
task (usually around age 8).
</P>
<P>
   _Your child's teeth should be brushed at least twice a day:
after breakfast and before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   _Replace your child's toothbrush every three to four months,
after illness or when the bristles become worn or frayed.
</P>
<P>
   _Along with brushing, start flossing when any two teeth touch.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Commentary: Jordan done saving the NBA
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barring the overnight conversion of every golf course
in North America to public parkland, Michael Jordan today is
expected to announce to the NBA: Clean up your own mess.
</P>
<P>
   He will distance himself from the self-destructiveness of the
lockout and for one last time rise above the pack. Couldn't blame
him if he performed his trademark tongue-wag sometime today, only
this time as a parting comment on the state of the league. The man
apparently is done saving pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   We can be pretty sure that his 401(k) is in order, that he can
hold on until the Social Security checks begin rolling in. It's
Ahmad Rashad I worry about. Once you've ridden Jordan's wake, every
other star trip will seem so ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much about Jordan's place in the sporting firmament has
changed since the last time he retired. He won three more
championships and three more scoring titles after his baseball
dalliance. He created a martyr or two with his flair for the
game-winning shot, Utah's Bryon Russell recently joining the Craig
Ehlo club. Those were mere Post-It notes upon a body of work that
already was the greatest ever.
</P>
<P>
   It says so right there on the United Center statue erected in
1994 after his first retirement: ``Best There Ever Was, Best There
Ever Will Be.'' It long has been cast in stone. See no need for a
jackhammer rewrite at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, Jordan departs as the signature athlete of the '90s.
He joins the few sports figures _ Ruth, Robinson, Ali, Billie Jean
King _ who were walking Cliffs Notes on their eras. He defined and
was defined at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had come to rely upon the jumpshot more and more,
Jordan ultimately was all about the aerial highlight, the
PlayStation move, the extreme two points that so excited a crowd
grown bored with fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   If he was criticized for being more concerned with profit over
benefiting society, haven't we all felt the same guilt? Jim Brown
called him out for not using his influence for some good greater
than pushing shoes and sports drink. ``He's thoroughly a corporate
phenomenon with no apparent social or political conscience,''
chided John Hoberman, author of a work entitled ``Darwin's
Athletes: How Sport has Damaged Black America and Preserved the
Myth of Race.'' But didn't Jordan's apolitical nature only mirror
prevailing voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the most cunning competitor that we will ever know,
every bit as mentally acute as he was physically gifted. The
embodiment of modern business.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wondered about the future of the NBA the last time
Jordan left. Who would be the ``Next Jordan''? (no one.) Will the
Georgia Dome ever again fill to see _ or in some cases not see _ a
single athlete? (not in this lifetime.) These questions have more
bite now that the league has burned every bit of its good will. He
couldn't have left at a worse time for the game or a better time
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the NBA won't dry up and blow away if Jordan makes it
official today. It has replaced cornerstones before and will again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, try as they will to win us back with their graceful,
soaring apologies, there always be this disclaimer, ``Yeah, that
was nice, but we've seen it all done before, only better.

 COMMERCE REOFFERS 6 PERCENT AAA discount  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Auto insurers have been warning that discounts will dry
up this year, but Commerce Insurance of Webster plans to offer
Massachusetts members of the American Automobile Association the
same 6 percent discount they received last year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Commerce, the state's largest auto insurer with
just over a fifth of the market, said the company plans to file its
AAA discount with state regulators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 AAA members in Massachusetts currently receive
the discount, which translates into about $50 on the average
premium of $841.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce spokesman Anthony Battista said no decision has been
made yet on whether the company will continue its good-driver
discounts and at what level. The deadline for action is Jan. 28. In
1988, Commerce offered a 15 percent discount to drivers in the best
Step 9 classification. Drivers in the Step 10 classification
received a 4 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   No other insurers have disclosed their discount plans yet, but
the head of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts warned
two weeks ago that state-set auto rates were inadequate and would
force a retreat from the discount programs that have saved
Massachusetts drivers millions of drivers over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Battista said Commerce agrees that the state-set auto rates are
inadequate, but he said a 6 percent discount for AAA members was
still warranted because AAA members generally are better drivers
than other Massachusetts residents.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce also has to tread gingerly when dealing with its AAA
group discount because it has become such an integral part of the
company. According to company filings, Commerce insures 522,000
cars owned by AAA members. Those cars represent 66 percent of all
cars insured by Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Arbella Mutual Insurance Co. in Quincy, the
state's second-largest auto insurer, said no decision had been
reached on its discount plans yet. The spokesman said the company
``expects the industry generally will be reducing discounts this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry had sought a 15.5 percent increase in auto rates
this year, but Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt approved an
increase of 0.7 percent. It was the first rate hike in five years,
but consumer advocates participating in the rate-setting process
had said a rate cut of up to 12 percent was warranted.

 &HT;        PENNSYLVANIA SENATORS BOMBARDED WITH CALLS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 -- Pennsylvanians who have flooded their
Senators with calls telling them how to vote in President Clinton's
impeachment trial are mostly split on the issue, but with a recent
tilt toward conviction. ``We haven't heard this much response on
any issue for as long as I can remember,'' said John Ullyot,
spokesman for Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``There's been an enormous
amount of feedback. One of our receptionists lost his voice from
taking so many calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the more conservative Republican Sen. Rick Santorum's
office had been split, but shifted in the last two weeks in favor
of ousting Clinton. Meanwhile, calls to Specter's office have
remained split since the House voted to impeach the President last
month.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate began debating the structure of Clinton's trial
last week, calls to Specter's office tripled, netting 300 a day,
Ullyot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty much even with some days being 60 percent in
favor of convicting and other days being 60 percent against,''
Ullyot said. ``There's a similar split on whether the Senate should
call witnesses in the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 people have contacted Santorum's office since the
House voted to impeach Clinton last month, said Santorum
spokeswoman Melissa Sabatine.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, 70 percent of calls to Santorum's office
have been in favor of convicting Clinton, Sabatine said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said he was not surprised that the more conservative
Santorum received more calls from people in favor of convicting
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to contact someone they think will
agree with them,'' Roy said. ``Pennsylvanians who are strongly in
favor of convicting Clinton might feel they have a better shot with
Santorum than Specter.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say Santorum's handling of the trial will
affect his political future -- and some callers have threatened to
vote against him in his reelection bid in 2000, if he doesn't vote
their way, Sabatine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have definitely been threats and that kind of feeling
expressed,'' Sabatine said. ``He is not effected by the threats.
The Senator is just trying to steer clear of all that and do his
constitutional duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy warned that calls are not an accurate reflection of
Pennsylvanians opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to get a handle on public sentiment from
scientifically designed polls,'' Roy said. ``The calls to senators
are some indication of what people in the state think and its
interesting. You can't ignore it.''

COURT QUESTIONS WYOMING DECISION TO CURB POLICE SEARCHES OF CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday
questioned a Wyoming Supreme Court decision that police who have
stopped a car and suspect that drugs are in it may search the
vehicle and the driver but not any passengers or their bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common sense that the driver could put the drugs in
a container, any container, including a passenger's bag,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision, expected by July, could set new
guidelines on police powers and personal privacy in situations that
arise countless times every day nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The case at issue began just after midnight on July 23, 1995
when Highway Patrol Officer Delane Baldwin stopped a car driven by
David Young for speeding on Interstate 25 in Natrona County, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin noticed a syringe in Young's pocket and told him and his
two women passengers to get out of the car. When Baldwin asked
Young why he had the syringe, Young said he used it to take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin then searched Young, the two women and the car for
drugs. In the back seat, he found a purse, which contained a
wallet-sized bag with two syringes and a vial containing diluted
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin arrested the bag's owner, Sandra Houghton, charging her
with possession of a controlled substance. Young was not charged,
however, because his syringe was empty and he was carrying no
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After her conviction, Houghton appealed to the Wyoming Supreme
Court, arguing that Baldwin had violated the U.S. Constitution's
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for Wyoming argued that the search was allowed under
a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that gives state authorities the right
to search a vehicle as long as they have probable cause to believe
that incriminating evidence will be found in it. Specifically, the
ruling said police may search ``any container within the vehicle
that could contain the object of the search.''
</P>
<P>
   The state contended that Baldwin had probable cause to believe
drugs were in Houghton's purse and therefore was within his rights
to search the bag.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the Wyoming Supreme Court disagreed and reversed
Houghton's conviction, saying that police are not entitled to
search containers that belong to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling came under fire on Tuesday from the Clinton
administration and several U.S. Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Barbara McDowell argued that it would
be ``very difficult for police to apply (and) might be exceedingly
unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist told Houghton's laywer, Donna Domonkos, ``Lawyers had
been hopelessly confused before we ruled that police could search
any container in the car, and I'm afraid that if we rule for you
that we'll be back to that confusing situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer added: ``Why doesn't the fact that a
person is a drug user make probable cause for searching
everything?''
</P>
<P>
   Domonkos replied that in the Houghton case, the police officer
had no reason to suspect her client of being a drug user and that
the police were subjecting her client to ``guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked how police would know
if passengers were lying about which containers in the car belonged
to them. ``A person could lie and say everything was theirs,''
Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Domonkos said the police would have to use ``objective
criteria'' to determine who owned the different containers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rehurek, deputy attorney general of Wyoming, said the state
Supreme Court's decision placed police in the difficult situation
of figuring out ``who is lying about bags and boxes in the middle
of an arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter replied that ``most of the time, an officer
can recognize a woman's purse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rehurek contended that while ``an officer may know a purse,
he has no way of knowing if a gym bag or cardboard box belongs to
the driver or a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``And the officer has no way of knowing if the driver
has put drugs in the purse, with or without the consent of the
passenger.''

   SCOTUS-BALLOT (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rebuffs
Colorado's effort to regulate the process of getting initiatives on
the ballot, in a decision extolling the First Amendment value of
uninhibited ``communication with voters.'' The decision, 6-3 in

   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York has never been easy, but for most of this
century, the idea of high school sports at least had a firm place
in the roster of what public schools were meant to do. But in the
last quarter century, public school sports in the city have been
devalued and cast adrift. Interviews with more than 200 current and
former coaches, teachers, administrators and students, lay bare
what happened: at a time when medicine and sociology were
establishing as never before the benefits of physical activity for
young people and as an obsession with sports was growing across
much of the rest of America, the nation's largest public school
system all but walked off the field. By Kirk Johnson. (First of

 &HT;    Being underdog suits some Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even though the Atlanta Falcons are 15-2, they are big
underdogs to the Minnesota Vikings in Sunday's NFC Championship
Game. Despite their gaudy '98 record, they've been in that spot
plenty this season _ and for decades.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the fact the Vikings (16-1) are favored by 10 or 11
points isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   However, being an underdog in this game does not mean that the
Falcons suddenly can play as if they have nothing to lose. For
example, they are not like the 0-10 Indianapolis Colts who last
year played the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers,
who were 8-2, and beat them 41-38.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have plenty to gain, but they also have a lot to
lose. And a team doesn't advance on 10 consecutive wins without
plans to win more. Free safety Eugene Robinson has been on the
other side of the equation. Last year, he played for the Packers,
who were favored over Denver in Super Bowl XXXII. The Broncos won
31-24. ``The oddsmakers won't play a game,'' Robinson said.
``What's going to play the game is our preparation, our readiness,
and our hunger to seize the moment. . . . What matters is watching
film, and believing in your teammates. That's what makes the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened in the Super Bowl last year. People
said, you guys are favored by 14 points. I said, 'I've seen the
film, and those guys are good.' (Underdog) is not a bad place to
be. It's not like, let's throw caution to the wind because . . .
we've got a very good team. So let's continue to be the best-kept
secret. That makes you play much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a different attitude than Robinson had before the 49ers
game, when he said he was tired of the Falcons not getting their
due.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson said it's all part of a continuing
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what role we're in. We were favored last week,
but we weren't talking about it,'' he said. ``We've been underdogs
so often. We were underdogs at New England (where Atlanta won 41-10
on Nov. 8) Even though we were favored over the 'Niners, a lot of
people didn't pick us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, hey, we're in the championship game, so we obviously can
play pretty good football, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Craig Sauer might have said it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a difference between people saying you're an
underdog and us believing we're an underdog,'' the former
University of Minnesota standout said. ``If we don't believe we can
get it done, there's no reason for us to go up to Minnesota. The
whole point is to lay it all on the line and let it all fall where
it may. That's why we play these games.''

 &HT;    Coke ready to take Universal account
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Coca-Cola Co. is close to snatching away rival
Pepsico's contract as the exclusive beverage supplier to Universal
Studios' theme parks in a multipronged deal that also covers
marketing for Universal's music and movie divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's contract, in place for 10 years, expires at the end of
1999. The Purchase, N.Y.-based company says it's been in talks to
extend the agreement for the past 12 months, but the two sides have
been at loggerheads over exactly what the contract should include.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's pitch is far more involved than simply pouring soft
drinks at park concession stands. As it's done in recent years with
other sponsorships, such as NASCAR, the Atlanta-based company's
proposal includes experiential promotions, like discounts on
Universal's movies or freebie CDs. Universal's parent, Seagram Co.,
recently acquired PolyGram NV, making Universal's music division
the world's largest record company.
</P>
<P>
   Universal executives and lawyers have been at Coca-Cola's North
Avenue headquarters this week reviewing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are close to a deal,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Scott
Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   Terms have not been disclosed. A Tuesday Wall Street Journal
report, citing ``a person familiar with the negotiations,'' said
Coca-Cola would spend more than $100 million in marketing on the
deal, in exchange for free pouring rights. Pepsico has been asked
to spend about $120 million over five years under its proposed
contract, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico is still trying to craft a proposal that would allow it
to continue doing business with Universal's theme parks, but
``we've made it pretty clear that we have no interest in locking
ourselves in blindly on music and film properties,'' spokesman Brad
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico has a history of using celebrity endorsements, such as
those by actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who appears in the campaign for
its new Pepsi One diet drink. The company also has been active in
movie marketing, including the recent ``Star Wars'' anniversary
re-release and the upcoming ``Star Wars Episode One.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pepsico has steered clear of such wide-ranging tie-ins as
Universal's entire menu of offerings, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a better formula than blindly buying into
wholesale properties,'' he said. ``We'd rather buy the horse than
the whole stable.''

FROM BRITAIN, FRIENDS (BUT NOT `FRIENDS')
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17) 
(bl) 
By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Anna is a hard-smoking, tough-talking Scot who harbors
a lusty crush on Miles, an old college classmate with whom she once
enjoyed a one-night stand. Miles is arrogant and obnoxious, a
little too proud of his good looks and studly ways. Milly and Egg
are scrambling to make their long-term romance work, even though
she is full of ambition and all he wants to do is lie around the
house and watch soccer on television. Everyone _ except his parents
_ knows that Warren is gay.
</P>
<P>
   These are the fledgling lawyers and housemates from ``This
Life,'' a drama that made an inauspicious debut three years ago in
Britain but went on to become one of the most talked-about, and
passionately watched, shows in years. The series, which ended
abruptly after two seasons when the producers (but not the
audience) decided that it had run its course, has until recently
not made it to American television, its heavy use of nudity, racy
language and sex having all but insured that no network would go
near it.
</P>
<P>
   But BBC America, a station devoted to BBC programming that
appears on TCI digital cable and on two separate satellite systems,
has brought ``This Life'' across the ocean, leaving in the sex and
some of the nudity but excising the rudest four-letter words. The
first 11 episodes, from the first season, went on the air beginning
in November; the 11th will be broadcast on Saturday at 10 p.m. at
the beginning of a night devoted entirely to ``This Life.'' (The
second season, which has 21 episodes, will be shown later in the
year.)
</P>
<P>
   For those able to see it _ and currently only about 5 million
households (none of them Time Warner subscribers in New York) have
access to BBC America _ the series has begun to catch on in the
United States too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hooked on their lives like none other on American TV, save
the gang at `Homicide,''' wrote David Zurawik, The Baltimore Sun's
television critic, in November.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always this way. When ``This Life'' first went on
the air, on BBC2 (a less mainstream channel than BBC1, with a
generally smaller audience), a lot of viewers responded with a
resounding ``Huh?'' Critics called it self-indulgent, verging on
pointless, too full of casual sex, casual drugs and show-offy
camera work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show looks as if the cameraman suffers from the shakes or
has watched too many episodes of `Hill Street Blues' and `ER,'''
wrote the critic Tony Purnell in The Daily Mirror, going on to
criticize the lawyers for not doing enough lawyering. ``The only
chambers they seem to be interested in are bedchambers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But word of mouth and viewers' passionate allegiance helped
insure that the series was renewed for a second season, and ``This
Life'' surprised everyone by suddenly finding itself with an
audience of more than 4 million, an unusually large number for a
drama on BBC2 (and a respectable one even for the commercial
stations it competes with). Although the show attracted some people
in their 50s who were eager to understand their unruly grown
children, its biggest supporters were among the notoriously
hard-to-please 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the producers, that was the point all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see whether there was an audience for a program
aimed at people in their 20s,'' said Jane Fallon, the series
producer. ``It's quite an interesting age group because it's very
disillusioned. These are people whose parents were around in the
60's and were optimistic, yet who spawned a generation of people
who are quite cynical and finding it difficult to make their way in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the producers felt so strongly about making ``This
Life'' more realistic than the several American series with which
it is usually _ and wrongly _ compared. It is not a comedy along
the lines of ``Friends'' or a slick drama about upscale yuppies who
have already made it, like ``L.A. Law,'' or a show about nothing,
like MTV's ``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it caught on was that the audience, after all,
realized that this was an authentic voice of their generation,''
said Tony Garnett, the executive producer. He hired a number of
young writers with little experience but a good understanding of
their contemporaries, writers who could talk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted some attitude,'' Garnett said. ``There's a
callowness in too many young people now. They've been Thatchered to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, said Jack Davenport, who plays Miles, was that
the series never looked down on its viewers. ``The 18-to-35
audience is pretty canny, and if they think they are being
patronized, they will tune out or switch the channel,'' he said.
The show ``chose not to duck issues that it raised and didn't
approach anything in an overly simplistic, heavy-handed manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers decided to go with characters who were attractive
but not gorgeous and not particularly well-off or from particularly
posh families, things that can turn British viewers off. While the
British like watching rich Americans on television, they can
mistrust and despise commensurate British characters. So Warren,
the gay character, comes from humble roots in Wales, while Anna,
the feisty character, is so strapped for cash in the first series
that she has to borrow money to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the characters are shown struggling to make it at work,
particularly Miles, who just can't seem to cope with the hardship
of having a 9 to 5 job (he later quits and finds a job in a
restaurant).
</P>
<P>
   ``America is an aspirational country and there is not, as there
is here, a sour envy of people who are doing well and are
successful,'' Garnett said. ``In this country, there is a strand of
feeling which resents people who are young and attractive and
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the producers insisted that their characters had to be
able to curse with impunity, although they found themselves
bargaining with the BBC about how many times particular words could
be used in any one episode.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to show the characters having casual sex and doing
casual drugs, the way many people in that age group do. And they
wanted to be able to show full frontal nudity, in the men as well
as the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be very casual, to have people just walking
past the camera with no clothes on,'' Ms. Fallon, the producer,
said. ``We didn't want it to be too exploitative or spend ages
lingering on people's bodies, but we thought if people were shown
getting out of bed after having sex, they were likely to be naked.
And we had a rule that for every woman shown naked, a man had to be
naked, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the audience grew, critics started to come around, suddenly
praising ``This Life's'' unflinching realism and cleverly entwined
plot lines, which never culminated in the kind of moralizing or
neat conclusions you might get on American television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story lines were brilliantly plotted,'' said Davenport.
``At the end of the second series, rather unusually, every single
character is basically miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as is often the case, the critics didn't appreciate what
they had until it was almost gone, and when the producers announced
after two seasons that ``This Life'' was being summarily retired,
people reacted with all the outrage of toddlers suddenly informed
they could no longer watch ``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the decision not to go on to a third season
only added to the mystique of ``This Life,'' in much the same way
that ``Fawlty Towers,'' John Cleese's hotel farce, benefited from
its short run of 12 perfectly made episodes, leaving people begging
for more.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the series would most likely have gone on
and on until it grew hackneyed and stale, gradually driving its
audience away. But in Britain _ especially at the BBC, which does
not have commercials _ there were different considerations.
``Partly, it was the quit-while-you're-ahead syndrome,'' Ms. Fallon
said. ``We could have flogged it for a couple more years, but it
was a good decision not to. Also, without wanting to give too much
away, by the time you get to the end of the second series, the
household has kind of exploded. There's no way those people could
live in that house together.''
</P>
<P>
   So Britain has had to do without ``This Life.'' As for the
actors, they have all moved on to new projects, without getting
stuck in the typecasting rut that so often haunts performers
associated with a role for too long. (What, for instance, is
Anthony Edwards going to do when ``ER'' finally fizzles out?) In
Davenport's case, it has meant, among other things, a part in the
forthcoming film ``The Talented Ripley,'' starring Matt Damon and
Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have such a bad haircut in `This Life' that it was time to
move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Daniela Nardini, who, as Anna, turned out to be
one of the breakaway stars from ``This Life,'' has been deluged
with juicy leading roles in various British television dramas. But
she is invariably asked about Anna, and interviewers seem
disappointed when she turns out to be much more soft-spoken and
thoughtful than the brash, blatantly sexy character she played in
``This Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect me to walk into the interview, swear at them and
demand a double gin,'' she said.

MERINGUE ON ANISE COOKIES  
 PREPARING HAZELNUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We have an old family recipe for anise cookies that is
basically the same as the one in the first editions of ``The Joy of
Cooking'' (it was removed from the newest version). These cookies
are supposed to puff up while baking and get a hard white top. We
have made these cookies for decades at holiday time, and sometimes
they get the white top and sometimes they don't. What's the trick
to getting this automatic meringue?
</P>
<P>
   A. The trick is to beat the eggs enough, says Shirley Corriher,
a food scientist in Atlanta and author of ``Cookwise'' (William
Morrow, 1997). The recipe in ``The Joy of Cooking'' instructs the
cook to beat the eggs in an electric mixer for a full five minutes
before adding the flour. But after several failed batches of
cookies (some beaten for as much as 10 minutes), I found that this
is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Martha Stewart Cookbook'' (Clarkson Potter, 1995), a
similar recipe calls for a full 30 minutes of beating! Desperate
for some success, I set the timer and tried it, using a standing
mixer. This worked, the cookies inflating as if on cue into perfect
round pillows.
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem with this recipe, however. It calls for
the batter to be left out at room temperature to dry for 18 hours
(10 hours in ``The Martha Stewart Cookbook'').
</P>
<P>
   This runs counter to current food safety guidelines, which
recommend that eggs not be left out of the refrigerator for more
than two hours. When I tried making the cookies without the drying
time, they came out as hard, pale coins instead of light, puffed
clouds, whether I beat them for 30 minutes or not. So please use
discretion if you want to make these cookies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I received five pounds of hazelnuts in the shell. Is there an
easy way to remove the tough shells other than cracking each one
with a nutcracker? How do I store them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Cracking the nuts individually with a nutcracker really is
the best way to open them, advises the Hazelnut Marketing Board,
since nutcrackers remove the shell without too much damage to the
nut. This is especially important with hazelnuts, which after
cracking are often roasted or parboiled to remove the papery skins
that surround the nut meat.
</P>
<P>
   To simultaneously roast and skin the shelled nuts, bake them in
a 350-degree oven for about 12 minutes until golden (or in the
microwave for 3 to 4 minutes), then wrap the hot nuts in a rough
terry cloth kitchen towel. Let steam for five minutes, then use the
towel to rub off the skins. Patches of skin may still cling to some
of the nuts; this is normal, and those nuts can be used.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer your nuts perfectly skinless, (for instance, if
you need them for a garnish), you can boil the cracked nuts for
five minutes in a pot of water spiked with a teaspoon of baking
soda. When the nuts cool, the skins will slip right off. To recrisp
the nuts, which get soggy after boiling, bake them at 325 degrees
for five minutes, or longer for a roasted flavor; and for a golden
brown color, bake about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Unshelled nuts can keep for several years when stored at a cool
room temperature (between 55 and 65 degrees). Once they are
shelled, store them in the refrigerator for up to a year, or in the
freezer for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelnuts are wonderful to eat out of hand as a snack, mixed
into cookie doughs and cake batters, made into chocolate candies
and spreads or chopped and used as a crunchy garnish for all kinds
of sweet and savory dishes. &QL;

HAGUE JOURNAL: THEN IT WAS THE KLAN. NOW IT'S THE BALKAN AGONY. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas) (nk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Gabrielle Kirk McDonald is not easily
intimidated. As a federal judge in Houston in the 1980s, she faced
down the local Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, who told her in
her own courtroom that she should be removed from his case because
he could not get a fair trial from ``a Negress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he got nowhere,'' Mrs. McDonald recalled. ``I said
that if race was an issue, then being white was an issue, too. I
may be a Negress, but I'm a Negress with a black robe and the gavel
and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the color of her skin is not an issue, but her years as a
civil rights lawyer and federal judge instilled in her a belief in
the rule of law that is now being tested on an international level.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDonald, 56, is the only American among the 14 judges of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and
a year ago she was elected its president.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the tightly guarded building on the outskirts of The
Hague, she deals with the trials that address some of the many war
crimes that were committed during the breakup of Yugoslavia. She
listens to long lists of atrocities, to furious lawyers, indignant
prisoners, judges who disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In the dour world of cruel and deadly war crimes, Mrs. McDonald
is an unusually cheerful presence. While others speak of the
shortcomings of the tribunal dealing with the conflicts in the
Balkans, she stresses its achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing more than ever, and our trials are speeding up,''
she said in an interview. ``I walk through the hallways, they are
full of people. I can almost hear us humming.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the staff from more than 50 countries
working here, using new procedural rules and a legal system, a
hybrid of American and European law, specially conceived for this
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   People who remind her that the tribunal is not trying the war's
most senior leaders get this response: ``I've never heard a witness
say, `That person is not important enough.' I've never heard a
victim say, `I want someone with a higher rank.' Every individual
wants justice in their own case.''
</P>
<P>
   As the five-year-old court has become busier than ever, with a
recent surge in arrests and trials, she sees an opportunity to make
it more visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing great work here but we must make it known,
otherwise we're whistling in the wind,'' she said. ``Above all, it
must be known to people in the region, but also to people who
believe in the law everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, she is seeking more backing, both political and
financial, from the United Nations, which created the tribunal. To
reach her goal, she does not hesitate to speak her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are truly at a watershed,'' she said recently before the
U.N.General Assembly. This tribunal has done everything within its
power, she said, but it is continuously obstructed by the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, she said, is acting like a ``rogue state'' and
flouting U.N. directives because it will not apprehend indicted
war-crimes suspects whose whereabouts are well known. It also
refuses to allow tribunal prosecutors to investigate atrocities in
Kosovo Province in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, Mrs. McDonald said, must make the
``obstructionist'' government of President Slobodan Milosevic
cooperate. There has been no answer from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. McDonald does not blink easily. Her friends say there
is a practical side to her that is partly rooted in her being an
American, partly in the turmoil of her own professional past.
</P>
<P>
   As a young black woman, the daughter of a railroad worker from
St. Paul, Minn., her early professional years were spent as a civil
rights lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It might sound strange, she went on, but her background as a
civil rights lawyer in the United States have proved useful here,
half a world away, dealing with the blood that was spilled in the
Balkans. It was her civil rights experience that gave her the
belief that facing the aftermath of Yugoslavia's ethnic warfare was
possible and that she could take on tribunal tasks for which there
was little precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from the civil rights movement,'' she said.
``There we were dealing with a minority and with confrontation. And
at that time we got new laws and we had to use them to enable
people to live and work together. This is the task before us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The law dominates her life. ``It's something in my heart and in
my soul,'' said Mrs. McDonald, whose former husband and son and
daughter are lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. McDonald was speaking in her sprawling office, well
shielded from the bustle of the comings and goings of lawyers,
prisoners and witnesses who appear daily in the tribunal's three
modern, glassed-in courtrooms. On her walls are pictures of Bosnian
prison camps and a small Texas state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment as president means that women now run the
tribunal's three main sections. The chief prosecutor is Louise
Arbour, a Canadian, while the registrar and chief administrative
officer, is Dorothee de Sampayo, who is Dutch. A colleague, a man,
gives the women credit for being ``more involved'' than their male
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDonald rejects criticism that the tribunal has wasted
time and money. It is barely five years ago, in 1993, she said,
when she and 10 other judges from as many countries borrowed a
conference room and had ``nothing, except a piece of paper from the
Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 600 employees today, the tribunal has become a
busy place. Four cases have been completed and three trials are
under way, with seven more cases in pre-trial stages. The budget
has climbed from $10 million in 1994 to $62 million for 1998, with
the 1999 budget yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   While those held most responsible for the Balkan atrocities are
still at large, the tribunal's detention center near The Hague is
filled, with 26 prisoners _ including two generals, a Croat and a
Bosnian Serb.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. McDonald and the other judges, there is the strain of
having to establish court rules as they go along and the perennial
effort of having to persuade people from the region, the lawyers,
the accused, the witnesses, that the tribunal first and foremost
intends to hold fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   She often says that the court's goal is to dispense justice, not
extract revenge, and that for the court to contribute to peace and
reconciliation it must be known and understood in the living rooms
and on the streets of the torn communities of Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard Serbs say that this is a political court
motivated by revenge,'' she said. ``But it is about providing
justice and healing for the victims.''

   In the middle of a forest, there was a hunter who was suddenly

shoot the bear was unsuccessful. He turned away and started to run
as fast as he could. Finally, he ended up at the edge of a very
steep cliff. His hopes were dim. But, he got on his knees, opened
his arms and said, `My God! Please give this bear some religion!`
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a lightning in the air and the bear stopped just
a feet short of the hunter. The bear was puzzled and looked up in
the air andsaid, `My God! Thank you for the food I am about to
receive... `

   She asks, `You come every day to the wall. How long have you
done that and what are you praying for?`
</P>
<P>
   The old man replies, `I have come here to pray every day for 25
years. In the morning I pray for world peace and then for the
brotherhood of man. I go home have a cup of tea and I come back and
pray for the eradication of illness and disease from the earth.`
</P>
<P>
   The journalist is amazed. `How does it make you feel to come

</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says the impeachment mess has its upside.
At least Congress hasn't been passing any laws lately.
</P>
<P>
   House impeachment prosecutors have been rehearsing their opening
trial presentation. What's to rehearse? Won't they just say,
``Throw da bum out?''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no vote on a motion to stop the impeachment trial
until both sides have presented their cases. So first it's the
dismal stuff, then the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mr. Clinton ``do not rise to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' his lawyers argue. Then how about
to the level of inexplicable stupidity?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's lawyers have written a 13-page response to the
impeachment trial summons. Is that a page for each lie under oath?
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles of impeachment should be dismissed,'' the
president's lawyers say. Exactly what he should have done to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>

   DNA tests have proven that a rumor about Mr. Clinton fathering a
child by an Arkansas woman is false. It's astonishing what passes
for good news around the White House nowadays.

   Having both Iraq and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as hot news
provides a nice balance _ between a no-fly zone and a know-fly

<P>
   She showed him a bottle costing $50.00. `That's a bit much,`
said Tom, so she returned with a smaller bottle for $30.00. `That's
still quite a bit,` Tom groused.
</P>
<P>
   Growing disgusted, the clerk brought out a tiny $15.00 bottle.
`What I mean,` said Tom, `is I'd like to see something really

   &UR; SHAGGY BEAR STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a forest, there was a hunter who was suddenly
confronted with a huge, mean bear. In all his fears, his attempt to
shoot the bear was unsuccessful. He turned away and started to run
as fast as he could. Finally, he ended up at the edge of a very
steep cliff. His hopes were dim. But, he got on his knees, opened
his arms and said, `My God! Please give this bear some religion!`
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a lightning in the air and the bear stopped just
a feet short of the hunter. The bear was puzzled and looked up in
the air andsaid, `My God! Thank you for the food I am about to
receive... `

   &UR; YOU DONT HAVE TO BE JEWISH TO LAUGH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A journalist assigned to the Jerusalem bureau takes an apartment
overlooking the Wailing Wall. Every day when she looks out, she
sees an old Jewish man praying vigorously. So, the journalist goes
down and introduces herself to the old man.
</P>
<P>
   She asks, `You come every day to the wall. How long have you
done that and what are you praying for?`
</P>
<P>
   The old man replies, `I have come here to pray every day for 25
years. In the morning I pray for world peace and then for the
brotherhood of man. I go home have a cup of tea and I come back and
pray for the eradication of illness and disease from the earth.`
</P>
<P>
   The journalist is amazed. `How does it make you feel to come
here every day for 25 years and pray for these things?` she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The old man looks at her sadly. `Like I'm talking to a wall.`
</P>

</P>
<P>
   An Ivy league theology professor was out visiting a friend at a

students, `what is the opposite of joy?`
</P>
<P>
   `Sadness,` said one student.
</P>
<P>
   `And the opposite of depression?`
</P>
<P>
   `Elation,` said another
</P>
<P>
   `And how about the opposite of woe?`

</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says the impeachment mess has its upside.
At least Congress hasn't been passing any laws lately.
</P>
<P>
   House impeachment prosecutors have been rehearsing their opening
trial presentation. What's to rehearse? Won't they just say,
``Throw da bum out?''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no vote on a motion to stop the impeachment trial
until both sides have presented their cases. So first it's the
dismal stuff, then the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mr. Clinton ``do not rise to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' his lawyers argue. Then how about
to the level of inexplicable stupidity?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's lawyers have written a 13-page response to the
impeachment trial summons. Is that a page for each lie under oath?
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles of impeachment should be dismissed,'' the
president's lawyers say. Exactly what he should have done to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests have proven that a rumor about Mr. Clinton fathering a
child by an Arkansas woman is false. It's astonishing what passes
for good news around the White House nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Having both Iraq and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as hot news

   CHICAGO _ You can have all those muscular metaphors, those Big
Shoulders, that City on the Make. They were nice in their time, but
their time has long passed.
</P>
<P>
   Face it _ Chicago is the city of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any longtime Chicagoan what it has been like.
</P>
<P>
   When Eppie Lederer, alias Ann Landers, used to travel overseas
and mention she was from Chicago, she would get a response that
made her cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd go `Oh, Al Capone,' and make like they were putting
their finger to a gun,'' Lederer said. ``I was ashamed,
embarrassed. Who wants to come from a city that's known for the
worst gangster of all time, where they shot people like dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   His Airness changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when Lederer discloses her Chicago pedigree, people
use their trigger fingers to fake a turnaround jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they say, `Oh, Michael Jordan,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of reports that Michael Jordan is about to step down
as basketball's supreme deity, the Capone-Jordan transformation
story was told so often in Chicago on Tuesday that it must be at
least partly apocryphal. But that, of course, is not really the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Michael Jordan has given Chicago much more
than the chance to be home to perhaps the best basketball player
ever. He has salved this city's Second City complex, put substance
behind its bravado, and even, some people say, allowed Chicago to
slip free of the dusty harness of history and create a new sense of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer the hog butcher of the world,'' said the Rev.
Andrew Greeley, the Chicago priest and sociologist. ``We Chicagoans
like to think it's a classy city, a world class city with a lot of
style. Michael symbolized that.''
</P>
<P>
   With No. 23 expected to announce his retirement on Wednesday,
Chicago, chilled and submerged under nearly two feet of snow,
seemed on Tuesday to be steadying itself for a collective eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over now,'' sniffed a headline in The Chicago
Sun-Times. ``MJ Gone,'' mourned The Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, as a role model for children and for morality, we
will never be able to replace Michael Jordan,'' said Bev Mandolini,
48, a Chicago housewife eating lunch at Michael Jordan's, the
icon's downtown burger-and-crab-cake joint.
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby table, Brian Orlow, a 25-year-old accountant, was in
flat-out denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't believe this is for real,'' Orlow said. ``I
think even if he announces his retirement, the playoffs will roll
around, the Bulls will lose to the Knicks, and Michael's
competitive juices will start flowing and he'll decide he doesn't
want to sit around and smoke cigars all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the devotion Chicago feels for Michael Jordan, one
has to understand how much this city cares about competing, about
proving itself in every arena, especially in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The losing streaks in this town are legendary _ with the Bears
(who have been on the fritz since winning the Super Bowl in 1985),
the Blackhawks (who won their last Stanley Cup in 1961), the White
Socks (who have not won a World Series since 1917) and the Cubs
(who have gone 90 years without winning a World Series, Sammy Sosa
notwithstanding). The only glimmer of hope has been the Chicago
Fire, the soccer team, which won the national championship in 1998,
but, alas, too many people here still seem to have trouble getting
jazzed up about soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that he's a winner,'' said Studs Terkel, the
author and voice of Chicago's working class. ``It's a city that has
lost so often. Jordan represents a big moment in the city of
losers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just the sweet wine of victory. It's that
Michael Jordan charm, that ebullient charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a cult in the city,'' said Saul Bellow, who is
from Chicago. (``There was no public mourning when I left
Chicago,'' Bellow noted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's really a great figure,'' Bellow continued. ``He's
a beautiful athlete. He's an exceptional person. He conducts
himself like a real gentleman, one of the few gentleman
professional sports has produced. There's no skulduggery. There's
no underhandedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, of course, has benefited financially from the Jordan
phenomenon too. And not just from his enterprises - a golf store
and two restaurants. His image has been a magnet for tourists and
basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The chief economist for the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce once
estimated that Michael Jordan single-handedly added as much as $1
billion to the region's economy, taking into account everything
from T-shirt vendors outside the United Center to the business his
endorsements bring to area businesses, like McDonald's Corp. and
Quaker Oats Co., which owns Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this also being a town that likes to think of itself
as scrappy, it was still possible on Tuesday to find people acting
nonchalant, even blase.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the larger scheme of things it doesn't make much
difference,'' said Allen R. Sanderson, an economist at the
University of Chicago who specializes in the business of sports,
who had the temerity to suggest in an opinion piece in The Chicago
Tribune on Tuesday that fans just ``get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, a self-proclaimed Bulls fan, said, ``The most
favorite season I had was the season he was gone,'' referring to
the 1994-5 season when Michael Jordan left basketball for a stint
in minor-league professional baseball. ``The rest of the team was
out there scrapping it out every night. The games were exciting,
and one pulls for the players, now that they were abandoned by
their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow, too, has faith in the resilience of Chicagoans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll begin to say, `Those were the good old days, and
there's never been anybody like Michael before or after,''' he
predicted. ```The march of history continues. Let's turn our
attention to the commodity trade.'''

   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says the impeachment mess has its upside.
At least Congress hasn't been passing any laws lately.
</P>
<P>
   House impeachment prosecutors have been rehearsing their opening
trial presentation. What's to rehearse? Won't they just say,
``Throw da bum out?''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no vote on a motion to stop the impeachment trial
until both sides have presented their cases. So first it's the
dismal stuff, then the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mr. Clinton ``do not rise to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' his lawyers argue. Then how about
to the level of inexplicable stupidity?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's lawyers have written a 13-page response to the
impeachment trial summons. Is that a page for each lie under oath?
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles of impeachment should be dismissed,'' the
president's lawyers say. Exactly what he should have done to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests have proven that a rumor about Mr. Clinton fathering a
child by an Arkansas woman is false. It's astonishing what passes
for good news around the White House nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Having both Iraq and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as hot news
provides a nice balance _ between a no-fly zone and a know-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial confrontations continue to be reported in Iraq. To say
nothing of on the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins have been sold for about $800 million.
Someone must have mistaken them for an Internet stock.

AFI'S STAR SALUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Those irrepressible list-makers at the American
Film Institute are at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The organization behind last year's successful, controversial
``100 Years ... 100 Movies'' celebration announced Tuesday that it
will commemorate the century of cinema again with ``100 Years ...
100 Stars'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``100 Movies'' contest, ``100 Stars'' will present the
results of a vote conducted among 1,800 members of the film
community (actors, filmmakers, executives, critics, historians,
etc.) on a CBS television special in June.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ``100 Movies'' poll, ``100 Stars'' will only list 50
winners _ 25 men and 25 women. And don't expect Leonardo DiCaprio
to be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Humphrey Bogart,
Katharine Hepburn and John Wayne. To qualify among the 500 names
listed on the AFI's official ballot, an actor had to have begun his
or her movie career in 1950 or earlier. Or be dead.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the star roster will be made up of
contemporary actors, each of whom will be invited by AFI officials
to introduce the work of a screen legend. Presumably, the younger
thesps get paid for their appearance, but since nobody voted for
them, they don't get on any official-seeming list.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it sounds strange. But AFI board chairman Tom Pollock has a
good justification for the apparently arcane qualification rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forces the jurors not to think about who's the star of the
most popular movie of all time last week,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be sure that we recognized those people who had a
considerable body of work,'' adds AFI director and CEO Jean Picker
Firstenberg. ``So we thought, if we used the cutoff date of 1950 or
before, we could choose from those who had, in the majority of
cases, more than half a century of work that we could assess and
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we could invite the stars of the day to pay tribute to
those who preceded them _ those who established the bar, if you
will _ we could have a very good balance,'' she continues. ``In
many instances, we will be inviting the stars of today, for whom
the legends have been role models, to be on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominees, 250 from each sex, were chosen by AFI historians
and archivists. As you can imagine, the ballots are pretty
exhaustive: Obvious candidates such as Bette Davis and James
Stewart compete with names like Seena Owen (a strikingly beautiful,
silent romantic star) and Harold Russell (the World War II vet who
won two Oscars for ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' _ and only
appeared in one other movie, ``Inside Moves,'' 34 years later).
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``100 Stars'' is meant to celebrate American film,
nearly half of the nominees are foreign born. In cases like Max Von
Sydow's and Sophia Loren's, first movies were made in their native
countries just in time to qualify for the competition, although
their U.S. debuts came years after 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Teams were also eligible, which means the dancing Nicholas
Brothers are nominees, along with more obvious comedy group choices
like the Three Stooges and Marx Brothers. Whether Shemp or Zeppo
will get mentioned if their teams make the final cut remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Guy clause could theoretically result in amusingly
embarrassing gaffes. Inserted to allow the likes of indisputable
icons such as James Dean, Grace Kelly and Anthony Perkins to
compete, it could also lead to the spectacle of John Belushi or
Elvis rating on a list of movie greats that isn't going to include
Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   And what if, God forbid, Jack Nicholson croaks between now and
June? Will we really be able to accept, say, Sabu (an actual
nominee) in his place?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let anybody die between now and then, or
else they'll be in a lot of trouble,'' Firstenberg jokes.
</P>
<P>
   It is hoped that the voting criteria suggested by the AFI will
prevent ``100 Stars'' from resembling the half-baked popularity
contest that many critics thought ``100 Movies'' turned into.
</P>
<P>
   Among the qualities voters are supposed to consider are actors'
star quality (i.e., charisma and unique personal characteristics),
craft (basically, talent), legacy (a body of work that enriches and
inspires), popularity (unavoidable, ain't it?) and historical
context (how political and social forces impacted their status and
career).
</P>
<P>
   Whether the voters follow the criteria or not, Firstenberg feels
that results will inevitably reflect more than knee-jerk
favoritism. At least, according to her, that's what happened last
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue (with ``100 Movies'') was not about favorites but
about people's passionate reaction to the list,'' she says. ``They
were really touched on a personal level and hurt if something that
really mattered to them was not included. To me, that's not about
popularity; that's about art. Art touches you emotionally and stays
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the TV shows and video cross-promotions associated
with the ``100 Years ...'' celebrations give off a distinct whiff
of commerce. They've become a major source of revenue for the AFI,
and the 32-year-old nonprofit education and preservation
organization needs to fill the funding gap created by recent
National Endowment for the Arts budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But Pollock, a former Universal Pictures executive, sees the
programs as fulfilling a much more important mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few ways that we as an organization are
able to bring to the fore American film history,'' he says. ``You
talk to most average Americans about film history, and it's last
year's movies. We think the `100 Movies' program was incredibly
successful in terms of setting a national agenda _ it got the press
and public to focus on film heritage instead of box-office grosses
_ and we hope this year's will be as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with outcries against ignoring such cinematic geniuses as
Buster Keaton, Ernst Lubitsch, Fred Astaire and Preston Sturges,
the ``100 Movies'' show attracted more than 11 million TV viewers
and contributed to surges in video sales and rentals of all the
films on the list. The top pick, ``Citizen Kane,'' enjoyed a 1,600
percent increase in rentals.
</P>
<P>
   And if this year's celebration matches 1998's success, a sequel
for the millennium _ the second 50 years worth of ``100 Years ...
Stars'' _ seems like a natural.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock isn't committing to anything like that, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can come up with how to do this on a
regular basis,'' he says. ``We thought that this would work, so we
did it. But `100 Years ... Cinematographers'? I'd like it, but I
don't think CBS would like it.'' &QL;

said Tom, so she returned with a smaller bottle for $30.00. `That's
still quite a bit,` Tom groused.
</P>
<P>
   Growing disgusted, the clerk brought out a tiny $15.00 bottle.
`What I mean,` said Tom, `is I'd like to see something really
cheap.` So the clerk handed him a mirror.

shoot the bear was unsuccessful. He turned away and started to run

steep cliff. His hopes were dim. But, he got on his knees, opened
his arms and said, `My God! Please give this bear some religion!`
</P>
<P>

pray for the eradication of illness and disease from the earth.`

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;

   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says the impeachment mess has its upside.
At least Congress hasn't been passing any laws lately.
</P>
<P>
   House impeachment prosecutors have been rehearsing their opening
trial presentation. What's to rehearse? Won't they just say,
``Throw da bum out?''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no vote on a motion to stop the impeachment trial
until both sides have presented their cases. So first it's the
dismal stuff, then the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mr. Clinton ``do not rise to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' his lawyers argue. Then how about
to the level of inexplicable stupidity?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's lawyers have written a 13-page response to the
impeachment trial summons. Is that a page for each lie under oath?
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles of impeachment should be dismissed,'' the
president's lawyers say. Exactly what he should have done to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests have proven that a rumor about Mr. Clinton fathering a
child by an Arkansas woman is false. It's astonishing what passes
for good news around the White House nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Having both Iraq and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as hot news
provides a nice balance _ between a no-fly zone and a know-fly

CLINTON'S LAWYERS PREPARE RESPONSE TO IMPEACHMENT CHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tempers flared at the White House on Tuesday over
the House prosecution's brief accusing President Clinton of weaving
a ``sinister ... plot'' to cover up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers prepared to deliver to the Senate on Wednesday
their own formal response to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reads like a cheap mystery,'' bristled White House Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart. ``The discussions about sinister plots is
something you would expect to read in a novel rather than in a
document by the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member House prosecution team, made up solely of
Republicans, plans to make its case against the president with
opening arguments Thursday in only the second impeachment trial of
a president in history.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., met behind closed doors Tuesday to begin readying
themselves for their appearance in the Senate chamber. Their
opening arguments are to take place over three days, ending
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers will present his defense beginning next
Tuesday afternoon and wrapping up on Thursday. In the meantime,
they intend to file a long brief with the Senate on Wednesday
providing a point-by-point rebuttal to the impeachment charges and
laying out to a large degree what they plan to say in their oral
arguments next week.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Clinton is built on two articles of impeachment
approved last month by the House alleging perjury and obstruction
of justice stemming from his attempt to keep his extramarital
affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, private. But
White House officials charged that the House prosecution will try
to ``shift attention'' from the two charges outlined in the
impeachment articles to other aspects of the Lewinsky matter that
have not been made public and have nothing to do with the formal
charges alleged in the House indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our view what's happening here is in order to try to
strengthen a case that they have not to date effectively made on
the law and the Constitution, that the sands keep shifting,''
Lockhart said. He was referring to suggestions by House prosecutors
that they may try to introduce ``certain facts,'' as they put it,
to help them prove that Clinton engaged in a pattern of lies and
deceit so horrendous that they warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde refused to be drawn into a fight with the White House,
saying only that he was ``proud of our brief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave the invective to Mr. Lockhart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial was to begin in earnest Wednesday, with
the senators, who were sworn in as jurors in the case last week,
voting on various motions that had been expected from both the
White House and House prosecutors. But neither side offered any in
their pretrial maneuverings, removing any need to hold a trial
session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an unexpected day off, Republican senators plan to
continue with a party caucus they began Tuesday to talk about the
impeachment proceedings and to brainstorm on the legislative agenda
they hope to offer this year. Some senators are worried that
Clinton's plans to go ahead with his State of the Union address
Jan. 19, in which he will unveil his own legislative agenda for the
coming year, will pre-empt some of their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   They're so concerned that aides said Republican leaders would
likely release ``a blueprint'' of their agenda this weekend, in
hopes of winning some of the credit for proposals that Clinton
might outline in his address.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senators have called on Clinton to postpone the
annual presidential address to a joint session of Congress and the
nation until after his impeachment trial has ended. But the White
House said the president is ``firm'' on going ahead, despite the
fact that it will take place on the same day his lawyers begin
their defense in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton believes that ``it's proper'' to deliver
his address next Tuesday because ``the business of the nation
should not stop'' for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate needs to take care of the business before them, but
the agenda and the policies that the president pursues, the
people's business, also has to go forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to hit the road the day after his speech to
promote his agenda. His schedule includes visits to New York and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for the most part, has kept well away from the media as
the Senate proceedings of last week unfolded. In his briefing for
reporters Tuesday, Lockhart flared at suggestions that there was a
White House plan to limit media access to Clinton until the
impeachment trial is concluded. But he acknowledged that advisers
to Clinton believe it would ``not be productive'' for Clinton to
hold a news conference with reporters to talk about impeachment
matters while senators are considering whether he should be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also was defensive about Republican allegations of a
link between the White House and charges leveled by Hustler
magazine publisher Larry Flynt that a number of GOP lawmakers,
including a few of Clinton's biggest critics, have engaged
themselves in unseemly behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Republicans) ought to stop practicing the politics of
innuendo, which is just about as sleazy as the politics of personal
destruction,'' Lockhart said. ``If they've got evidence, they ought
to bring it forward. If not, they ought to knock it off.''

SUIT SEEKS TO OVERTURN COPYRIGHT LAW REVISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Eric Eldred began republishing old books on the
Internet in 1995, he thought of it as an amusing and socially
beneficial hobby. Now he fears his hobby could put him behind bars,
thanks to a tough new law that makes copyright violations a
criminal offense and extends the life of a copyright by 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Eldred won't surrender without a fight, and he's got some
impressive allies _ members of the Harvard Law School faculty and
the high-powered law firm Hale and Dorr. Together they filed a
federal lawsuit this week seeking to overturn the revision of
copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any money,'' said Eldred, ``but my lawyers think
there is a good chance that this could be heard in the Supreme
Court and overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred is a former computer systems administrator who now lives
on workers' compensation as a result of repetitive stress injuries
received on the job. To pass the time and express his fondness for
books, Eldred in 1995 began Eldritch Press, an Internet site that
posts obscure and classic books that are no longer covered under
copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act puts a crimp in
Eldred's plans. For one thing, the new law extends the life of a
copyright from 75 to 95 years. Prior to the law's passage, Eldred
had planned to begin publishing works written after 1922, because
the copyrights on these works would have just expired. Now such
works are still covered. ``Therefore, there's a whole great amount
of American literature that I can't put on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the books are out of print, and likely to remain so.
Still, Eldred says he doesn't dare put them on his Web site. That's
because the new law also carries criminal penalties for copyright
violations, with possible prison sentences ranging from one to six
years.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bono law was enacted last October, Eldred posted a
message on his Web site warning that the law would force him to
shut down his site. He has since said the threat was intended to
bring attention to his situation and spark opposition to the new
law.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked. Jonathan Zittrain, lecturer in cyberlaw at
Harvard and executive director of Harvard's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society, says press accounts brought Eldred's plight
to the attention of Harvard faculty. ``We were just talking among
ourselves and we said, hey, maybe there's some way we can challenge
this law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the center teamed up with Hale and Dorr attorneys.
Both groups are working on the case free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Zittrain says the new law violates the constitutional principle
that copyright protection should last for only a limited,
reasonable amount of time. Instead, he argues, the new law gives an
unjust windfall to publishers, by letting them keep exclusive
rights to valuable works for an unreasonably long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly a giveaway,'' said Zittrain. ``It locks up for
another 20 years a number of works that are already difficult to
find even if you did want to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   However the court rules, Eldred may still elude the long arm of
the law. According to Allan Adler, vice president for legal and
governmental affairs at the Association of American Publishers, the
new copyright law contains a loophole for libraries and archives.
If such institutions make a good-faith effort to confirm that a
particular title is no longer in print, they're allowed to treat
the title as if it were in the public domain. There's just one
problem _ it's unclear whether Eldred's Web site counts as a
library or archive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we need the court to help us find out,'' Eldred said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit.
The department did not return calls about the suit Tuesday.

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   THIN-RED-LINE-FILM (Undated) _ The Thin Red Line'' is a very odd
movie. I think it one of the pinnacles of American filmmaking in
the 1990s, but I can also appreciate the objections leveled against
it by other film critics who were baffled, irritated or chagrined
by this three-hour challenge. By Phillip Lopate.
</P>
<P>
   1,000-MOONS-INTERNET (Undated) _ ``1,000 Moons,'' is a
five-minute digital short designed for the Internet and one of four
movies now being screened at a site called The Bit Screen
(www.TheBitScreen.com). It's hazardous to make statements about who
is or isn't doing what on the Web, but it would appear that the
site is, if not unique, then most unusual. The movies aren't
intended for showing on the theater screen or on video. Films like
``1,000 Moons'' are conceived and created to arrive by modem and be
shown solely on a computer screen. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ At supper in his studio in St.
Petersburg or at lunch in a New York restaurant, Boris Eifman, 52,
is all good-humored gallantry. It isn't until the Russian
choreographer reveals his life story that one understands how a
surface calm harbors the emotional intensity that blazes through
his ballets. Not every choreographer has been housed in an
underground pit during a harsh early childhood in Siberia or had
all his father's relatives killed by the Germans during World War
II. Nor have most choreographers, at least in the West, had to
invent themselves within the closed society of the Soviet era. And
rare is the choreographer who, like Eifman, has never been a
professional dancer. Yet a passion for creating dances has consumed
Eifman since he was 13 and passionate dancing is synonymous with
the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg, which opens a two-week season
Tuesday night at City Center. By Anna Kisselgoff. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-LANE-THEATER (Undated) _ Producers are not going to tell
you what they really think of George P. Lane: that they dislike
him, that they believe he is too demanding, that they dread his
phone calls. That is because Lane represents just about every hot
young playwright and director in the theater business these days,
not to mention a crop of blue-chip actors. So producers need him.
They basically can't live without him. By Robin Pogrebin.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby's reviews `Far East';
`Phedre' and `Britannicus.'Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   RICHTER-MUSIC (Undated) _ In 1957 the Russian pianist Sviatoslav
Richter made friends with the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould at a
concert in Moscow. And now Bruno Monsaingeon, a Canadian film
director who collaborated on projects with Gould, has issued a
documentary, ``Richter: The Enigma,'' which will open the Lincoln
Center series ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century'' on Friday
evening at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan. By John Russell.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most musicians making their
Carnegie Hall debut don't open with ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
But this was no ordinary debut. On Jan. 23, 1943, Duke Ellington
and his orchestra played to a capacity crowd in a benefit concert
for the Russian War Relief fund. Ellington was riding high. At 43
he was one of the leading exponents of swing, the exuberant style
of jazz then reaching the crest of its popularity. His music was
known throughout the world. Thousands bought his recordings,
listened to his radio broadcasts, danced to his rhythms and
romanced to his songs. That evening at Carnegie Hall, though,
Ellington chose to play more than ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Don't Get
Around Much Anymore'' and the hits his fans expected. He also made
it clear that he expected serious recognition as a composer. By
Mark Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON (Undated) _ What a world to step into, if you
were inquisitive. And at the beginning of the 1920s, Duke
Ellington, touched by genius and ambition, prepared by education
and class privilege, walked into the 20th century. When he arrived
in New York in 1923, it was the present and future cultural capital
of the world. He began playing in what were known as black and
tans, joints that catered to black and white audiences, and in
1927, just a year after his first wobbly recordings under his own
name, he fell into the job that changed American cultural history.
By Peter Watrous.
</P>
<P>
   ELLINGTON-RECORDINGS (Undated) _ In April, RCA will issue ``The
Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The Complete RCA Victor
Recordings 1924-1973,'' a 24-CD set, and for the rest of the year
the label will slowly issue the music from that set in triple-CD
bunches. By June, Columbia will have reintroduced spruced-up
versions of six albums, including the film-score album ``Anatomy of
a Murder'' and the Shakespeare-inspired ``Such Sweet Thunder,'' as
well as a three-CD overview. By Ben Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   MARISSIAUX-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ One of the rare discovery in
photography festivals this year was a Belgin pictorialist named
Gustave Marissiaux, who was widely show in Belgian, Paris, Berlin
and Itlay in the first decade or so of this century, then large
forgotten even in his own country until a 1997 retrospective at the
Musee de la Photographie in Charleroi. A show during the Mois at
the Wallonie-Bruxelles Center in Paris closed on Nov. 26, but a
beautifully illustrated and well-researched catalogue, ``Gustave
Marissiaux: La Possibilite de l'Art,'' by Marc-Emmanuel Melon, has
been published by the Charleroi museum. By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   SAYS-YOU-RADIO (Undated) _ ``Says You!'' _ a low-budget,
independently produced half-hour quiz show reminiscent of the
old-time radio series ``Information Please'' and the long-running
BBC series ``My Word'' _ seems to have a good chance to join the
quirky listener-supported National Public Radio pantheon that
includes ``Car Talk,'' ``This American Life'' and ``A Prairie Home
Companion.'' Recorded over Sunday brunch in various Boston-area
hotel banquet rooms, ``Says You!'' is now broadcast on more than 60
public radio stations nationwide. By Andy Meisler.
</P>
<P>
   THIS-LIFE-TV (London) _ ``This Life,'' a television drama made
an inauspicious debut three years ago in Britain but went on to
become one of the most talked-about, and passionately watched,
shows in years. The series, which ended abruptly after two seasons
when the producers (but not the audience) decided that it had run
its course, has until recently been absent from American
television, its heavy use of nudity, racy language and sex having
all but assured that no network would go near it. But BBC America,
a station devoted to BBC programming that appears on TCI digital
cable and on two separate satellite systems, has brought ``This
Life'' across the ocean, leaving in the sex and some of the nudity
but excising the rudest four-letter words. The first 11 episodes,
from the first season, went on the air beginning in November; the
11th will be broadcast on Saturday at the beginning of a night
devoted entirely to ``This Life.'' By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   RORSTRAND-PORCELAIN-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The New York
entrepreneur, Robert Schreiber, collection of 150 Art Nouveau
Rorstrand vases, bowls and jardinieres is described by experts as
the largest and most important anywhere. A selection of 86 pieces
is now on view in ``Rorstrand: Swedish Art Nouveau Porcelain From
the Schreiber Collection,'' an exhibition at the American Craft
Museum in Manhattan, through May 23. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

IN A TINY OFFICE, KHMER ROUGE FILES TELL GRISLY TALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ With portraits of their quarry on the
walls around them, a dozen Cambodian researchers sit at computers
in a tiny office here, processing hundreds of thousands of
documents that form the core of a potential legal case against the
leaders of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked behind the researchers are the frayed and yellowing
documents: painstaking accounts of torture, killings and forced
confessions, along with the autobiographies and personnel records
of the Khmer Rouge functionaries who carried them out.
</P>
<P>
   Some time next month, three legal experts who have examined the
documents are to report to the United Nations on the strength of
the cases and the possible legal procedures that could be directed
against a half-dozen surviving Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare their report, debate is under way here over
whether to bring these leaders to justice or let them go free in
the interest of something called ``national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been spurred by the surrender last month of two
key leaders _ Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ who have been allowed
for the time being to settle into a quiet life among their former
comrades in the remote town of Pailin.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen has not made clear whether he wants a
trial. It also remains to be decided whether any tribunal would be
held in Cambodia or elsewhere, what form it would take and who
would conduct it.
</P>
<P>
   But preparations are gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the potential evidence in November, the U.N.
legal experts said any tribunal would probably focus on fewer than
a dozen top figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many are guilty?'' said one of the experts, Sir Ninian
Stephen. ``In a sense, thousands, many thousands.'' But Sir Ninian,
a former governor general of Australia, added, ``If we go after the
small fish, we will be locked in a trial process for 20, 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Khmer Rouge leadership from 1975 to 1979, more than a
million Cambodians died of starvation, overwork and disease as well
as from torture and executions as the movement killed off its
perceived enemies and devoured itself in internal purges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scale of the carnage, the case against the Khmer
Rouge leaders will be complex.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the stacks of documents and the piles of skulls that
still lie scattered in more than 400 killing fields around
Cambodia, the potential case appears to be an intricate skein of
memos, signatures, bureaucratic routing and inferred culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top leaders wouldn't be the actual killers,'' said Youk
Chhang, who heads the Documentation Center of Cambodia, the office
where the research is being done. ``The leader kills people by
policy, and other people implement the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the killings were carried out throughout the
country and in a similar way is clear evidence that they were
organized and conducted by a central leadership, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of reports and confessions sent to the leaders show that
they ``knew or should have known that torture and probably killing
of political enemies was going on as a regular practice,'' says a
report presented to the U.N. experts by the documentation center.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, sent by a Khmer Rouge interrogator to Nuon Chea on
Nov. 9, 1977, reads, ``Although I pressed him to answer, he did not
answer, but he did once tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, dated two days later from another interrogation, reads,
``As he was still unclear in his answer to this point, we further
tortured him, and then he spoke out.''
</P>
<P>
   Where this kind of documentation is absent, the center's report
says that even records showing the leaders' ranks and duties are
useful in enforcing the ``doctrine of superior responsibility,''
under which top officials must answer for the acts of their
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said they had ``very little documentary
evidence'' to portray the chain of command, a key element of any
potential prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Khmer Rouge were obsessive record keepers, and
although the center has collected some 350,000 documents, the
quality of potential evidence against the different leaders is
uneven.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in April,
depriving his countrymen of a chance to hear his explanations in
court for the death and ruin he caused.
</P>
<P>
   But legally, Youk Chhang said, the evidence against him was
thinner than that for most of his colleagues. Similarly, there is
little evidence at the center against Ta Mok, the last high-ranking
holdout, a man with a reputation for brutality even among his Khmer
Rouge colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest material is in reports that were sent to
Nuon Chea, now 71, a Khmer Rouge ideologue who oversaw personnel
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a lawyer to understand it,'' Youk Chhang
said. ``You just have to be a farmer who can read. Just reading it,
you know that he did something wrong involving killing human
beings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the file on Khieu Samphan, 67, he said, ``requires a lawyer
to do deeper analysis.'' The most immediate indication of
culpability comes from Khieu Samphan's position as the titular head
of the Khmer Rouge government and the likelihood that he had
knowledge of what his government was doing.
</P>
<P>
   The center also focused in its report on Ieng Sary and Ke Pauk,
both members of the Khmer Rouge Central Committee, and on Kaing
Khek, widely known by his nickname, Deuch, who was in charge of the
Tuol Sleng prison, where at least 14,000 people were tortured and
killed. Another target is the prison's chief interrogator, Mam Nay.
</P>
<P>
   The center's most direct potential evidence is against the Tuol
Sleng officials, including direct orders like this one from Deuch:
``Resume carrying out torture, 16 January 1977.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentation center, set up four years ago, is run by a
Cambodian staff of 25 and operates with money from the U.S.
Congress _ via the Cambodian Genocide Program at Yale University _
and from Norway, the Netherlands and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to collecting and collating the documents, the
center has mapped 410 ``killing fields'' of various sizes around
the country, has amassed a trove of photographs and movie film and
has interviewed a number of former Khmer Rouge functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which Youk Chhang reported last week to have been
lost, has been rediscovered in the hands of a French film company
and negotiations are under way for its return, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is other potential documentary evidence in France,
Germany, China and Vietnam and in the hands of some Western
historians, Youk Chhang said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, witnesses who worked with the Khmer Rouge leaders
could offer potentially important testimony against them, he said.
And the leaders themselves could well turn against each other, as
they have in the last two years as their movement broke apart in
infighting and defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, Ieng Sary himself already pointed a finger at
Pol Pot,'' Youk Chhang said. ``Ke Pauk has pointed a finger at Ieng
Sary. Ta Mok has pointed a finger at Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
And Nuon Chea has pointed his finger at the dead body of Pol Pot.
They are the leaders and they are the killers, and they are also
the witnesses.''

FIDELITY TO FIELD EIGHT NEW ADVISOR FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding ammunition to one of the fastest-growing parts of its
business, Fidelity Investments said Tuesday it was launching eight
new mutual funds for sale through its unit catering to brokers and
other channels.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of three US stock funds and five international
equity funds to Fidelity's Advisor fund family comes as sales
through the ``wholesale'' unit soar. Through separate units,
Fidelity also peddles funds directly to individual customers _ a
core retail business where the firm's sales have been weak _ and to
institutions with corporate retirement plans, where sales have been
solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of growth here,'' said Kevin J. Kelly, president
of Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Co. Kelly's unit
sells Advisor funds and other Fidelity products through 4,500
brokers, banks, insurers and other intermediaries, who then sell
the products to customers. The third-party channels receive as fees
from Fidelity a portion of the assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity, the nation's largest fund firm, is
tapping into a growing trend in the $5.3 trillion fund business.
Nearly 69 percent of all mutual funds sold in 1998 were done so
through an intermediary, such as a broker-dealer, insurer, or bank
_ up from 52 percent in 1995. A move among ordinary investors to
seek out advice as they prepare to shift some $11 trillion in
retirement assets into retail funds in coming decades is expected
to increase sales via third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's unit, which in addition to Advisor funds sells
annuities, funds for foreigners, money market funds, and other
investment products, manages a total of $166 billion in assets, or
23 percent of Fidelity's total $716 billion. Around $54 billion of
Kelly's assets are in Advisor funds.
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales through Kelly's unit have grown this decade. While
sales of Advisor funds slipped in recent years, mirroring weaker
sales throughout Fidelity, they began to make a comeback last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales through Kelly's unit in 1998 were $12 billion _ more
than double the previous year's level _ and accounted for nearly
one-third of Fidelity's overall sales last year. The proportion in
1997 was one-quarter. Kelly said total sales for his group would
climb to at least $14 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales of long-term Advisor funds over the first 11 months of
1998 were $2.5 billion, according to Financial Research Corp. of
Boston. While that is sharply below levels seen in 1995, when the
figure topped $6.8 billion, it is up on 1997's level of $2.2
billion, Financial Research data showed.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity competes with American Fund Distributors, Putnam
Investments of Boston, and Franklin Resource Inc. in selling funds
through third-party channels. Fidelity's eight new funds bring the
number of Advisor funds to 36, including 20 US equity, 7
international, and 9 fixed-income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Advisor funds are definitely a driving force in terms of
new money coming in,'' said Jim Lowell, editor of the independent
Fidelity Investor newsletter. ``And the only way to appease
third-party sellers is with more options.'' One area Kelly's group
may need to beef up: small- and mid-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where the growth and the money are,'' Lowell said. ``If
money's knocking on the wall, you should create a door.''

STATE BANK AGENCY ADOPTS Y2K GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING .  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Small banks in Massachusetts, beware. State regulators
could swoop in to fire your chief executive and even shutter your
doors if you fail to cope with federal Year 2000 guidelines
designed to prevent computer-induced chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Division of Banks has adopted its own set of
rules to ensure that some 300 state-chartered banks, credit unions,
cooperatives, and trusts are ready to function come Dec. 31, 1999.
The guidelines create no new paperwork or hurdles for banks.
Instead, they serve to reinforce federal laws, and cast state
banking officials in the role of sheriff with extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Division's rules reflect the degree to which local officials
want to be able to act fast should banks flounder in 2000, when
unprepared computers will read 2000 as 1900 and potentially wreak
all manner of havoc on everything from savings accounts to
clearance systems.
</P>
<P>
   Action that Massachusetts regulators may take includes
suspending or dismissing offending bank executives and `taking
possession and control of the bank or credit union', according to a
Division memo reviewed Tuesday by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Massachusetts regulators is fairly unusual in the
banking industry, by most accounts among the best prepared to cope
with what is known as the Y2K problem. The Federal Reserve has
plans to circulate extra cash should systems shut down, and small
banks are spending on everything from new software to power
generators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we don't have to take substantive action against any
banks,'' said the Division's senior deputy commissioner, Steven L.
Antonakes. ``But we do have things in place if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are miffed. ``We already have cease and
desist powers against offending banks,'' sniffed one official who
declined to be identified, adding that the Massachusetts guidelines
merely mirrored Federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials partly agree. ``Efficiency argues for one
regulator,'' said Robert P. Fichter, senior vice president of the
Massachusetts Bankers Assocation, or MBA. But he said local banks
welcomed what he termed the ``second opinions'' of state
regulators, especially after the savings and loan crisis of the
1980s, which shuttered many local institutions.
</P>
<P>
   With directives like the following: ``All banks and credit
unions shall take all necessary steps and measures to adhere to and
implement the Federal Year 2000 guidelines'', the Division
guidelines, which go into effect next week, read like a czarist
decree. They also reflect growing competition among assorted
regulatory bodies in various industries for the upper hand in
dealing with one of the mostly costly problems to bedevil modern
business.
</P>
<P>
   State officials initially irritated banks by attempting to force
them to be Y2K compliant by concrete dates this year. MBA officials
countered that the requirement was too restrictive, and that a
small bank paying an outside consultant to sort out its Y2K mess
shouldn't be laid out on the chopping block if it is a day late.
</P>
<P>
   Division regulators say state-chartered banks have done an
admirable job in readying their computers and see no major cause
for concern. In recent years banks have been inspected quarterly,
by either state or federal officials, and most are now testing
their new systems.
</P>
<P>
   At Lowell Five Cent Savings Bank in Lowell, Pres. Robert A.
Caruso said he did not mind state regulators stepping in. ``We're
already ready, and they just want to be sure of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Massachusetts Division of Banks might want to
ensure its own systems are Y2K compliant. The agency received a
middling, need-to-improve mark from state examiners last summer. It
says it has since improved things.

EDGY JACK IN THE BOX COMMERCIALS FUNNIERS THAN MOST TV FARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is trite to suggest that television commercials are often
more entertaining than the shows that they interrupt. But we'll
stick with this threadbare observation because we're not clever
enough to say it in a more original fashion. If we were, we might
be in advertising, like the wacky folks at Kowloon Wholesale
Seafood Co. in Santa Monica, Calif., who write the greatest
commercials ever: the Jack in the Box ``Jack's back'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, you're saying. Greatest ever? What about the other
fantastically funny ad campaigns, like the ESPN ``SportsCenter''
ads (example: ESPN trades stocky, hirsute boxing announcer Charley
Steiner to ``Melrose Place'' for hunky Andrew Shue) or the Miller
Lite campaign (the fat guy dancing because the bottlecap says
``twist to open'') or the recent NBA lockout ads by Nike (Spike Lee
trash-talking a female high-school basketball player named Regina
Miller)?
</P>
<P>
   These offerings are worthy competitors. But for consistent
hilarity, none rivals the Jack in the Box campaign. Since Foodmaker
Inc., Jack in the Box's parent company, brought Jack back in 1995 _
he had been blown up in a 1980 commercial to signal the company's
increased focus on an ``adult'' menu (insert your own joke here) _
the commercials have been one of the few things to look forward to
in prime-time advertising. (Witness the horrible ``funny''
commercials during this past year's Super Bowl.) The one where the
little Jack pingpong balls gather for a morning meeting (''Let's
watch out for cats''), the ad where the obnoxious guy in a
drive-through line is connected to Jack in his corporate plane, the
supertechie yuppie on the beach who looks at Jack's life and
concludes that ``my ... life ... blows'' _ these are just average
Jack ads, and they're chuckle-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   It is time, then, in these weeks leading up to the next Super
Bowl ad letdown, to give Jack his props. Here are our Jack faves:
</P>
<P>
   Name: Focus Group
</P>
<P>
   Background: Jack and his corporate suits are conducting a focus
group composed of meat-lovers, asking them what they think of the
company's new Ultimate Cheeseburger, which contains only meat and
cheese. The men complain about the use of a bun. ``Lose that bun,''
says one, ``and you got somethin'.'' Jack storms in and screams
that they're suggestion is ridiculous because ``your hands would be
covered with MEAT and CHEESE!''
</P>
<P>
   Jack's best line: His resigned acceptance of the no-bun theory:
``All right, we'll look into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: Focus groups are inherently hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name: The Visit
</P>
<P>
   Background: The newest, perhaps best of the bunch. In an homage
to ``Cops,'' Jack is followed by a camera guy to the door of a
belligerent slacker who has been dissing the company. Jack tells
him to try a burger to see if he still feels that way. The slacker
freaks out and runs through his house toward his back yard, Jack
and the cameraperson in full pursuit. Jack tackles the slacker and
forces the burger down in his mouth. The guy, despite having his
arms pinned, compliments Jack on the taste.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's best line: Jack says he's heard that the slacker has been
referring to the company as ``Junk in the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: Acknowledges the long-standing ``Junk in the
Box'' jokes; corporate self-deprecation is funny.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name: Spicy Crispy Chicks
</P>
<P>
   Background: To celebrate a new chicken sandwich the company is
hawking, a marketing dork shows Jack the music video he's put
together, complete with dance music and the Spicy Crispy Chicks
dancers. Jack is despondent as the goob shakes his booty while
watching the video.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's best line: ``You are so fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: The video is produced by ``Fluffy Bun
Productions.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name: The Fireman
</P>
<P>
   Background: One of the Jack ping-pong balls talks to a fireman
who just put out a blaze. The Jack ball, seared himself, asks the
fireman if he's hungry. The fireman says yup. The ball asks for a
ride on the firetruck antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Jack pingpong ball's best line: Atop the speeding truck:
``Yeeee-haaaaah!''
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: C'mon, it's a ping-pong ball. The firetruck toots
its horn. These are time-tested comedy elements.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name: The Election
</P>
<P>
   Background: A parody of a campaign ad, complete with a sweeping
score, Jack hugging a tree and condemnation of his opponent, whom
Jack describes as a ``shake-hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack's best line: No line, but Jack does elbow a kid who is
making him look bad.
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: A perfect sendup of campaign ads. Even the
family's golden retriever is waving to the crowd in the final
feel-good shot.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name: Flashback
</P>
<P>
   Background: A '70s-era party, wherein everyone disco dances and
a burger spirals your screen by way of cheesy, trippy graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's best line: ``Mellow out. Let's fire up the beta.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny because: The ``Shaft''-ish guy who supports the ``women's
libber'' with a closed fist and a well-timed ``Right on!''
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hipolito Burgos, a 17-year-old senior at Queens
Vocational High School, is an immigrant from the Dominican
Republic, co-captain of his school's baseball team and an all-round
threat as a catcher, outfielder and batter.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a good man with a bilge pump, said his coach, Rob
Schimenz. That's an important skill for a ballplayer at Queens
Vocational. The team's home field, at a public park about two miles
from the school, takes on water like a leaky barge because of a
pronounced depression near second base. Shovels, rakes and pumps _
along with bats and balls _ are part of the team's equipment, and
making the field playable before games has become part of a
captain's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hand you're dealt, you try and keep a positive
attitude, you try to work with it and the kids,'' Schimenz said of
his school's sports program, which has no gymnasium, no athletic
fields of its own, no money at all for uniforms, and not much more
for equipment. Schimenz even paid for the bilge pump himself. ``I
don't know what the baseball budget is because I don't have one,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing high school sports in a city like New York _ a
crowded concrete landscape _ has never been easy. But for most of
this century, the idea of high school sports at least had a firm
place in the roster of what public schools were meant to do.
Funding was sufficient, if not lavish. Schools like Erasmus Hall in
Brooklyn and DeWitt Clinton in the Bronx were nationally recognized
powerhouses and vibrant, vital local institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last quarter century, public school sports in the
city, and the physical education programs that helped underpin
them, have been devalued and cast adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Budgets for sports programs were slashed in the 1970s and were
never fully restored; sports facilities, from football fields to
basketball gyms, decayed along with many of the rest of the city's
school buildings and then always seemed to become the last priority
for repair; physical education classes were cut in half in the
early 1990s at most schools; demands by the teachers union that
coaches get fairly compensated for the many hours they worked led
school administrators to control costs by cutting sports. Concerns
about legal liability cast a shadow of caution, from the Board of
Education down, about physical activity and its inherent risks of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than 200 current and former coaches,
teachers, administrators and students, as well as an examination of
25 years of school system budgets and staffing levels, lay bare
what happened: at a time when medicine and sociology were
establishing as never before the benefits of physical activity for
young people and as obsession with sports was growing across much
of the rest of America, the nation's largest public school system
all but walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite modest spending increases in the last few years,
the city's public high school system offers only a handful of teams
for freshmen, provides schools with no money for uniforms, asks
varsity football and other coaches to run their programs on budgets
of $100, and does not give any school _from elementary through high
school _ a dime for gym equipment. For the 40,000 students who play
a sport in a New York high school _ about one in eight _ athletics
has become an extra, lumped with all the other categories of
experience that would be nice to offer in a perfect world, but that
cannot be maintained in this one.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-Year Decline: Political Expedience And Parental Apathy
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year decline and disinvestment in public high school
sports happened because politicians either did not pay attention or
looked away, as the lesson was absorbed that, because parents and
educators rarely objected, there was a minimal political price to
be paid. The city's fiscal crisis of the 1970s sapped will and
material. Pressures to improve academic performance and reduce
overcrowding swallowed resources in the 1980s and 1990s, with other
programs such as art and music diminished or erased along with
sports. A new policy that allowed students to travel across the
city to the high schools of their choosing undermined the concept
of the local high school _ and its sports teams _ as the anchors of
a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   And the apathy of parents matched that of the politicians.
Attendance at games and meets, which once helped to pay for sports
programs and to reinforce their importance, has all but collapsed.
National education experts say that school sports in many major
urban centers have struggled to survive, but that in New York both
the dimensions and consequences of the decline were magnified by
the huge size of the school system, the vast gulfs of wealth and
poverty between neighborhoods and the many athletic traditions that
were fostered or invented here in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we used to consider the standard for school sports is now
nostalgic,'' said Frank Macchiarola, who was New York City Schools
chancellor from 1978 to 1983, and who was credited then with trying
to rebuild the athletics program. ``I don't think the city has the
commitment any more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to precisely measure the consequences of the
school system's diminished interest in providing quality sports
programs. But educators, coaches, parents and the students
themselves say the results range from missed opportunities for
college athletic scholarships to poorer general health of students
to the loss of an educational tool for teaching self-esteem and
teamwork to the erosion of what many once saw as a bridge that
could connect young people divided by race and income and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in many cases that road was very shortsighted,''
said Rudy Crew, who took over as the New York City schools
chancellor in late 1995 and who has restored some funding to the
sports programs since then. Crew said he believed the damage from
the years of budget cuts and the resulting decline in facilities
and commitment was largely invisible, and irreparable, measured in
the lives of students who passed through the system untouched by
the benefits that athletic activity can bring. ``We lost a lot of
kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The picture of public high school sports is grim when compared
to much of the rest of the nation:
</P>
<P>
   _In the 1990s, as enrollment in the school system surged,
spending on extracurricular sports in New York City high schools
fell by more than 19 percent, according to the New York State
Department of Education, from $10.8 million in 1989-90, in
inflation-adjusted dollars, to $8.7 million last year. New York
spent more for interscholastic high school sports in the 1974-75
school year, when the city was on the brink of bankruptcy _ about
$9.1 million _than it did last year at the height of an economic
boom, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   _The city spends less per pupil on extracurricular athletics
than other major cities in New York or around the nation. The
amount provided to schools for sports materials, equipment and
supplies has also fallen sharply _ down more than 29 percent since
1974, according to state figures _ compounded by a dramatic
increase in the number of high schools and new teams, especially
for girls. School teams now get an average of about $100 for a
whole school year _ or about the price of a single new football
helmet. And unlike their counterparts in many large cities in the
nation, or in New York's suburbs, teams get nothing at all for
uniforms or transportation.
</P>
<P>
   _The percentage of New York high school students participating
in a sport is now at the very bottom among the nation's largest
cities, according to a 1997 survey by the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Of the 15 cities
surveyed, New York was tied with Miami for the lowest rate of
sports participation.
</P>
<P>
   _Physical education efforts have been decimated. System wide
there were fewer than two gym teachers for every 1000 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade in New York City last year,
according to analysis by The New York Times, using state data. That
is less than half as many gym teachers, measured against
enrollment, as schools have in Westchester, Nassau or Suffolk
counties or across the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   _Many students are overweight and inactive. More than half of
the 1,500 New York City public high school students randomly tested
in the 1990s in a study by Queens College already had one major
risk factor for heart disease, mainly excess weight and lack of
physical activity. Almost half of the girls and one in five of the
boys were overweight to a level considered medically obese, the
study said. Figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention also suggest that obesity rates among teen-agers may
be higher in New York. Only about one in eight of the teen-agers
tested across the country by the Centers in the most recent period,
from 1988 to 1994, were even deemed overweight, a threshold below
that of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheering Stopped: From a Model System To a Cautionary Tale
</P>
<P>
   New York, to a great degree, helped invent many of the 20th
century forms of public school sports, historians say, through the
Public Schools Athletic League, created in 1903. The PSAL, as it is
known _ an arm of the Board of Education charged with scheduling,
monitoring and assigning funds for interscholastic sports _ was
copied by cities all over the country early in the century. By the
1920s, PSAL track and field events were held that attracted tens of
thousands of boys and girls from elementary school age on up to
compete for medals in exercises such as situps and pullups.
</P>
<P>
   Public school sports got more money and resources then, but also
more attention and respect. In the 1950s and early 1960s, generally
considered the heyday of New York City high school sports _ at
least for boys, since sports for girls barely existed in those
years _ football rivalries like Samuel J. Tilden against Thomas
Jefferson were often played out in front of 15,000 fans or more at
Ebbets Field. Players for major sports schools like Bayside in
Queens, or Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, got hero treatment: warm-up
parkas, trophies, championship rings. Just about every school had a
pep band and a parents booster club that could mobilize resources
when the city's contribution fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of community spirit, a lot of school spirit
that you don't see now _ it all held together,'' said Moe
Finkelstein, the former head football coach at Thomas Jefferson
from 1955 until his retirement in 1987. ``And all the schools were
loaded with clubs and activities beside sports. There were
lectures, clubs _ you never wanted to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, school administrators have faced wrenching choices
in distributing their resources. But sports, even if they were
never formally disavowed by any administrator or mayor, almost
always lost out to something deemed more important. At the same
time, whether to have sports at all _ or what emphasis to give them
_ has become a matter of debate. Many teachers and coaches say, for
example, that they believe that professional sports no longer send
positive images to young people, who see only the money and ego and
greed, and that tales about high schools and colleges where sports
have become perhaps too important _ to the detriment of students _
have made athletics harder to defend.
</P>
<P>
   But many others say that the deterioration and disappearance of
the city's public high school sports _ and a diminished emphasis on
physical activity in general _ flew in the face of a growing body
of evidence about their positive impact on young people. That
evidence indicated that athletic participation could be a crucial
element in keeping students in school, preventing pregnancy and
improving academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   There are educators who have held onto sports, and schools where
meaningful athletics programs exist in the city, but they are rare
and scattered. The odds were against them.
</P>
<P>
   The first body blow to school sports came in the mid-1960s, when
the school system's teachers began protesting that the old loosely
structured work rules about after-school duties _ for athletics as
well as arts and clubs _were exploiting their good will. Successive
contracts with the union that included formalized rules about pay
and seniority then followed, pushing costs up and resulting in
decisions to scale back sports, among other things. At the same
time, fear of violence at school sports events encouraged school
officials to play down the importance of interschool contests, or
to limit attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s then brought outright financial setbacks for sports
programs that had already been weakened. In 1975 alone, the PSAL
program, which administered virtually all sports, was cut by nearly
41 percent. More important, the cuts also marked the beginning of a
pattern: silent acquiescence. Sports slid away more or less
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep doing it, it gets easier _ it becomes part of the
protocol,'' said Edward I. Koch, the city's mayor from 1978 to
1989. ``Like any budget, you have to make a decision as to what's
important, and if you decide, as many did, that, `most important,'
didn't cover sports and cultural subjects, then that's what got
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and 1990s, the athletic program came under stress
from internal forces in the education system itself as the system
sharply grew and changed. Federal law mandated equal treatment for
girls' sports, but without more spending by the city, that simply
meant a further stretching of limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   The number of high schools offering sports also grew from 107 to
165 as the city began experimenting with smaller, specialized
schools. Such schools, unlike traditional high schools, draw
students from all over the city, and many school officials and
parents say that has muted one of the traditional pressure points
of local school politics in the city: organized, vocal parents who
live in defined geographic areas, and to whom a single city council
member or community board representative had to answer. About one
in five of the city's 312,000 high school students now attends one
of these specialty academies.
</P>
<P>
   Physical education requirements for high school students,
meanwhile, were falling. New York City for many years _ by
tradition if not requirement _ provided high school students with
gym five days a week, a level that was twice the minimum state
requirement. But in the early 1990s, that tradition quietly died as
most schools went to the lower standard of two days one week, three
days in the next. Coming at a time of other budget cuts, that
furthered the downward spiral for athletics, teachers say, by
making many students physically unfit to play sports, or
predisposed toward not wanting to. But more crucial for the system,
administrators say, it sharply reduced lobbying pressure for
physical education from the United Federation of Teachers, because
that part of the union's membership declined.
</P>
<P>
   Internal changes at the Board of Education _ mainly a result of
cost cutting and streamlining _ also altered the political balance.
In the early 1990s, for example, the Bureau of Physical Education,
which had been part of the division of Curriculum and Instruction,
was dismantled. An agency with a vested self-interest in defending
gym at budget time was silenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no longer a single point of advocacy for that area
of the New York City school system,'' said the former head of the
city's high schools division from 1991 until 1997, John Ferrandino.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the support of parents _ considered by most coaches
to be the most important element of a program's success _ withered.
Schools that could once draw thousands or hundreds of fans _ buying
tickets that helped pay expenses _ saw the numbers fall into the
hundreds, even dozens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents don't support children the way they did years ago,
the city doesn't support them, some of the heads of the school
don't support them,'' said Ann Davis, who was one of about two
dozen people in the stands to watch Thomas Jefferson High School's
football team play its first home game in early September. Ms.
Davis and her husband, Ray, still come even though their son,
Rashan, graduated last year. ``Do you see a principal here, a
dean?'' Ms. Davis said. ``They're not even here to support the
team. And that is sad, that is sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock-Hard Neglect: So Few Fields, So Many Dreams
</P>
<P>
   Even getting former New York City politicians to remember what
happened to sports is hard.
</P>
<P>
   David Dinkins, the mayor from 1990 to 1993, said that he had
always been a supporter of school athletics, but that without a
search of his administration's archives, he could not recall or
comment on what his record had been. Koch confessed that he didn't
know what the Public Schools Athletic League even was.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the PSAL? Are they private sector?'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Money was not the only thing to dry up. Where there was less
money, there was also less attention, less energy and less emphasis
on getting things done or making them better, school officials say.
Where getting by is the rule, school officials say that improvement
or repair to sports facilities has become almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn Technical High School, for example, has been playing on
a vacant industrial lot near Fort Green Park for more than 15
years. The city spent about $250,000 in the mid-1980s on
engineering studies, but the $3.2 million plan to convert the
rock-strewn lot into a real ball field foundered during the
recession at the decade's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a field outside that's totally useless _ a soccer
field, it's all dirt _ but there's no plan or no method for me to
say, `Look guys, I need you to upgrade my field here,''' said Bill
Belfi, the chairman of the physical education department at
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens. ``You get on a
list and you wait 10, 15 years _ then it's still maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Top school system administrators say they now believe that the
worst of the imbalances against athletics are over. Funding has
increased in the last several years, particularly in middle school
athletics and for high school junior varsity teams, both of which
had been completely eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   New private alternatives have also emerged, like the Ivy League,
which organizes girls' softball in Washington Heights and is funded
by private donations. And there have always been other ways
children in the city have found a way to play sports _ at YMCA's or
in church leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some school coaches have even turned the city's neglect of
athletics into a motivational tool. Athletes in New York, they say,
have to be tougher and more dedicated to put up with what the city
throws at them: crumbling facilities, apathy, incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Places like ``The Rock,'' as South Shore High School's
rubble-strewn football field has been dubbed, or ``The Iron Cage,''
that the basketball team from East Side Community High School
sometimes practices in _ the ceiling so low that you can't take a
jump shot without banking it off the ceiling _ are held out by
players and coaches like badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us mad, so we're tougher,'' said Alex Figueroa, a
17-year-old co-captain and quarterback of the Brooklyn Technical
High School Football team as he showed off the scars that snaked up
his forearms from playing for four years on the school's rocky
field.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Separate, and Unequal: Can't Fund It, Just Drop It
</P>
<P>
   At Stuyvesant High School, a gleaming new showplace of the
city's education system in lower Manhattan, the athletic program
spends $2,000 a week during the football season for a bus to carry
the team and its equipment three miles across town to its practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   At Bronx Regional High School in the South Bronx, the assistant
principal, Wade Williams, was reduced, literally, to passing around
a hat to raise enough money to get his girls' volleyball team home
from a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did what he said he had to do at least once a year: He
went to the faculty and told them the athletics department had gone
broke again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls have to walk through the projects to get to the
train station, and God forbid something happens to these young
ladies,'' Williams said, recounting his story to the teachers. ``
`You've got to help me out here,' I said, then I took off my hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, both schools live by the kindness of strangers and
friends. The city provides no money for Stuyvesant's buses or for
Bronx Regional's carfares _ school sports teams in New York get no
money for uniforms, no money for transportation and little money
for equipment. The city pays salary stipends for coaches and
athletic directors and for officials at games and meets, leaving
just about everything else to the discretion, and fund-raising
ability, of the schools. Stuyvesant, with an illustrious alumni
list and a solid middle-class base of students, simply has better
sources to beg from than can be found in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The city's contribution to the schools is equal per team, but
since that contribution leaves school officials with the need to
make up 80 percent or more of a sports program themselves, it has
separated the city into socioeconomic haves and have-nots, and
created what school sports experts say is, in effect, a
pay-for-play sports system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PSAL will tell you if you can't fund it, drop it,'' said
Nick Ragusa, the athletic director at Chelsea High School in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The unevenness of the system has also highlighted the
differences between the city's schools and the large system of
private and parochial schools, many of which have thrived by
cultivating their images as places where sports in New York still
work the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a social and political issue,'' said David S.
Liebschutz, the associate director of the Center for the Study of
the States at the Rockefeller Institute of government. ``If you
don't have the wherewithal to get access to stuff, as people do in
the suburbs, where you do you go?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it simply means kids are left out. Claude Robinson,
the athletic director at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn,
had two great baseball players in the building last year, but they
didn't play because neither one of them had money for cleats.
Robinson said he wanted to pay for the cleats himself, but
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give to one, you have to give to all,'' he said. ``And
there wasn't money for that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to physical education, school regulations require
that every child below high school age get at least three days a
week of gym. The reality is more like Public School 310 in the
Bronx, where Sonia Menendez, the principal, struggles to give her
nearly 1,100 students even one gym class a week.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez lost about half of her playground in the 1980s to a
temporary classroom annex. The school has a small gym, and half
again as many students as it was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making do, that's what's happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable statistics about gym because many teachers
and principals say it has become a lie. Things can be called gym to
satisfy the paper requirements. Overcrowded schools like 310,
including many in Queens and the Bronx, cannot meet the
requirements because of limited space. In other schools, there is
just not enough money to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, we had five gym teachers,'' said Hank
Whitney, who has been the principal of Intermediate School 49 in
the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn since 1977. ``Now I have
three. I had to sacrifice gym because I don't have the personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   That gap, between what is required and what is possible, has
left administrators and coaches all grappling to make do _ some in
corrosive cynicism about the system's hypocrisy, some in idealism
as they try to make their resources stretch. School administrators
say that since they never see any school reprimanded for not
providing enough physical activity, the inevitable message is that
it doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical education is dying in New York City,'' said Hector
Martinez, the athletic director at West Side High in midtown
Manhattan, as he showed a reporter the school's gym, essentially a
classroom with weight-lifting machines. Martinez admitted that he
had to cheat a little, by borrowing money from the school's health
department budget, to get even this secondhand equipment. ``That's
what you have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials also said that formal structured gym had
in fact been tacitly discouraged in a system where lawsuits and
liability are a constant concern. They say that less formal gym
instruction means less exposure to lawsuits from possible injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that schools are not in compliance, and nothing is
being done _ I have not heard of one school being written up,''
said Maria Rodriguez, the director of East Harlem Technical Junior
High School, which reinstituted physical education classes several
years ago after about a decade without organized gym.
</P>
<P>
   Many students say that gym has become something to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you just sit there in your sweats or your
T-shirt for 45 minutes on the floor or against the wall or
whatever, the teachers take attendance, and that would be it,''
said Kerly Suffren, a 17-year-old junior at Martin Luther King High
School in Manhattan. ``Then the bell rings, and you change and go
back to your regular class _ so a lot of kids feel that it's not
necessary or that it's irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students said they think an irrelevant gym class deserves
the fate that has befallen it.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Beller, West Side High School's basketball coach and an
English teacher, said he thought that for all the talk about
broader educational horizons, New York has actually narrowed its
vision _ so much so that everything beyond academic performance has
become almost invisible. As he talked, he watched his basketball
team thread down Eighth Avenue in the garment district, weaving
around men with their beers in paper bags and the racks of suits
being trundled through the crosswalks. His team, lacking a gym, was
in search of a park to practice in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period of time when the whole child, the whole
development _ all that stuff had currency, had some, I don't know
what the word is, validity in the minds of the Board of
Education,'' he said. ``Now it seems to have no validity with them
at all.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE TARP AND THE IGLOO THAT WEREN'T  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unaccustomed as they are to being in the American Conference
championship game, the Jets might be too giddy to check for the
logistical problems that surfaced in their two previous appearances
in this Super Bowl semifinal: the missing tarpaulin in soggy Miami
after the 1982 season and the plastic igloo on the Raiders' bench
at frigid Shea Stadium in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general genius, had hired
carpenters to put up the plastic igloo to warm the Oakland bench.
When a league official noticed that it blocked the view of box-seat
ticket holders, it came down. The Jets won, 27-23, then went on to
win Super Bowl III, 16-7, over the Baltimore Colts, fulfilling Joe
Namath's ``guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the missing tarp, it had rained in Miami for
several days and throughout the night and morning before the
kickoff. At game time, the Orange Bowl resembled a rice paddy. With
mud depriving running back Freeman McNeil and wide receiver Wesley
Walker of their speed, the Jets lost, 14-0, to the Dolphins, who
then lost Super Bowl XVII to the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   With such low crimes and misdemeanors in mind, a phone call was
made to AFC headquarters in Denver to determine (a) if a tarpaulin
is covering the grass at Mile High Stadium, (b) if any mysterious
carpenters have been sighted, and (c) both of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a tarp at Mile High, but it's not on the field
because it's warm and sunny here,'' said Tim Davey, the National
Football League's assistant director of game operations. ``If it
gets colder later in the week, we'll put the tarp on at night to
keep the frost off. We'll put the tarp on Friday night and Saturday
night anyway as a precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding carpenters who might be carrying large sheets of thick
plastic and two-by-fours, Davey reported that none had been
sighted.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets couldn't ask for a better watchdog. When the 1982 Jets
were in Miami, Davey was their director of operations. Shea Stadium
tarpaulins were his specialty, so he was more surprised than
anybody when the Orange Bowl field suddenly turned up sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jim Kensil, then the Jets' president, and Coach Walt
Michaels angrily blamed Don Shula, the Dolphin coach, for plotting
to mire the Jet offense. Shula blamed the Orange Bowl, which didn't
have a tarp; its officials claimed the field usually drained well.
</P>
<P>
   The real culprit was Al Ward, the league official who,
ironically, had been the Jets' former general manager. Believing
that the Prescription Athletic Turf field would drain properly,
Ward had neglected to order a tarpaulin trucked in to keep the
field dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the next league meeting,'' Davey recalled, ``the owners
passed a rule that every team had to have a tarpaulin.''
</P>
<P>
   That was too late to know if the Jets would have won on a dry
field and gone to that Super Bowl, and maybe won it. Instead,
Michaels was fired, Joe Walton was hired as coach and the Jets went
into a tailspin that lasted until Bill Parcells' arrival two years
ago as chief of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Raiders' plastic igloo, Al Davis thought he had
sheltered his thin-blooded northern California team from Shea's icy
winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plastic was translucent, light could go through it, but it
wasn't transparent,'' recalled Harold Rosenthal, then the American
Football League's publicity director. ``As soon as I saw it, I told
Al that it had to come down because it was blocking the view of the
fans in the box seats at field level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al yelled, `Are you telling me to take it down?''' Rosenthal
added. ``I said, `Yes I am, and if you don't take it down, you will
when the president of the league tells you to take it down.' I
found Milt Woodward, who was the president of the AFL, and when
Milt told him, Al had it taken down.''
</P>
<P>
   But not before Davis got the AFL office to pay the carpenters'
$2,500 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al told us to put it on the game expenses,'' Rosenthal said.
``And we did.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plastic igloo had remained, maybe the Raiders would have
remained warm enough to win that AFL title game. Instead, Namath,
who was woozy at halftime, threw three touchdown passes (two to Don
Maynard, one to Pete Lammons) and linebacker Ralph Baker recovered
an unwise Raider lateral.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, those Jets won the Super Bowl, still the only
torch in the darkness for this long frustrated franchise that
suddenly will be going to Super Bowl XXXIII if it can dethrone the
reigning Super Bowl champions in Mile High Stadium, where the
Broncos are 18-0 since a 1997 playoff loss to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a tarp there, and even if a snowstorm swirls into
Denver on Sunday, there's no need for a plastic igloo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got these `Hot Seats' now for the players to sit on,''
Davey said. ``They're better than plastic.''

</P>
<P>
   For one horrible moment in ``The Noel Coward Story,'' I thought
Coward was being interviewed by Austin Powers. But no, the mod BBC
journalist sitting across from Coward has much better teeth. The
year is 1969, and the subject, almost 70 years old at the time,
looks distinctly uncomfortable, especially when asked about his
humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come from, in fact, a very different background yourself
from the characters in your plays,'' says the interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, perfectly ordinary suburban middle-class background,''
says Coward, his cigarette held in front of his face as he speaks.
He continues, ``But of course we hadn't got very much money, so it
was sort of genteel poverty we lived in originally.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange but true. The man whose plays, songs and personal style
epitomized brittle upper-class British sophistication in the 1930s
and '40s was the son of a piano salesman. The man who wrote
``Private Lives,'' ``Hay Fever,'' ``Blithe Spirit'' and ``Mad Dogs
and Englishmen'' ended his formal education at the age of 9. But
his life changed early on, as recounted in ``The Noel Coward
Story,'' an uneven but often glorious two-hour documentary on
``Great Performances'' on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coward, who was born in Teddington, Middlesex, England, in 1899,
became a child actor, at his mother's urging. At the age of 14, he
was befriended _ no one in the documentary suggests that it was
anything more _ by a painter, Philip Streatfield, and moved into
the elegant home of friends of his in Rutland. There the teen-age
Coward was exposed to a considerably higher stratum of the British
class system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, at the age of 24, Coward burst onto the London theater
scene with ``The Vortex,'' a play that shocked audiences with its
depiction of an older woman, her drug-addicted son and her much
younger lover. Coward, who wrote the play, directed it and played
the son, was soon the toast of the town, he recalls in the film,
with ``an extravagant amount of dressing gowns and pajamas.'' He
was photographed everywhere, including, he says, sitting up in bed
``looking like a heavily doped Chinese illusionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success and the attendant new money, he continued
living in his mother's boardinghouse until he was 30. That year,
with the success of his new play, ``Private Lives,'' in which he
starred with Gertrude Lawrence, Coward bought a large farm in Kent
and moved there with his parents and his lover (Jack Wilson, an
American agent). His success continued into the 1940s, with plays
like ``Blithe Spirit'' and films like ``Brief Encounter,'' which he
adapted from one of his one-act plays. Meanwhile, Wilson developed
a drinking problem, left Coward and married.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Coward bought a house in Jamaica, where he
entertained the rich and famous, like Laurence Olivier and Vivien
Leigh. Then he bought another, Firefly, with only a sitting room
and one bedroom, as his one-man retreat. When his plays went out of
style, he simply got his act together and took it to Las Vegas or,
as the critic John Lahr, one of his biographers, puts it, ``He took
his persona on the road.'' He bought a chalet in Montreux,
Switzerland, where Graham Payn, his companion and co-editor of his
diaries, still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, in the age of gay pride, one of the most
intriguing aspects of Coward's life is his steadfast refusal to
acknowledge his homosexuality publicly. But his 1933 play, ``Design
for Living,'' was about a romantic triangle in which the two men
have a strong attraction to each other, and lyrics don't get much
more open than these from ``Mad About the Boy'': ``People I
employ/Have the impertinence/To call me Myrna Loy/I rise above
it/Frankly love it/And it's all because/I'm mad about the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Coward did a favor to posterity in 1926 when he bought a movie
camera. For that reason, ``Great Performances'' is able to present
film of his Hawaiian vacations, his world travels and his poolside
parties with the stars, not to mention rehearsals and performances
of his early plays. Unfortunately, when the creators of the
documentary don't have film of a specific time and place, they
resort to illustrating that part of Coward's story with film of
double-decker buses in London, New York traffic scenes and even
Coward's various biographers strolling through the streets and into
the Underground. Luckily, this stops fairly early in the film.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary conveys a wistfulness and a conviction that a
great deal of sadness lay beneath Coward's banter. In his later
years, says Elaine Stritch, who worked with him in ``Sail Away,''
he was very tired of being expected to amuse. He died alone, at
Firefly in Jamaica, in 1973.

TV NOTES: ARE THEY GREAT OR JUST NEW?
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The chief programmer for a competing network
checked out the rating for the opening episode of NBC's new Friday
night drama, ``Providence,'' and declared it ``the most stunning
development of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the first true hit of the season really be this
soft-focused, soft-hearted, coming-home drama about a doctor in
Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   The numbers say it is: NBC scored its best ratings for a series
on Friday night at 8 in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Then more news arrived. The new animated comedy on Fox, ``The
PJ's,'' with Eddie Murphy providing the voice of a janitor in the
housing projects, proved to be the most-watched new entry on that
network since ``The Simpsons'' began nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a fall season in which mediocrity seemed an
all-but-unattainable achievement, how could two shows burst through
within three days?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, network executives said here, was highly
concentrated, highly skilled promotion, proving again that
midseason is increasingly the best time to introduce shows.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly not a barrage of critical acclaim that drove
viewers to their sets to catch these debuts. The shows got few good
comments, with ``Providence'' earning especially dismissive
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But each received a flood of attentive promotion spots to the
exclusion of almost everything else on the networks. That is
possible only in January, when just a few new shows are introduced;
it can never happen in the fall, when hordes of new series are
unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows also benefited by being promoted especially hard
during heavily viewed shows close to their premieres. John Miller,
the executive vice president for promotion at NBC, pointed out,
``We had our Thursday night to tell people about `Providence'
coming up on Friday, and Fox had football to tell them about `The
PJ's.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fox's executive vice president for marketing, George
Greenberg, flooded Saturday's and Sunday's National Football League
playoff games with moments from ``The PJ's,'' which also benefited
from following ``The Simpsons'' and leading into ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his colleague Vince Manze formed an elaborate
strategy for ``Providence,'' pushing the show ``like a theatrical
movie release,'' Miller said. That meant using not only promotional
television spots but also billboards, ads on the sides of buses and
posters at bus stops. During prime-time shows as well as ``Today,''
when the network has mostly female viewers, NBC created unusual
60-second featurettes that had the look of movie trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Manze commissioned three separate music excerpts for
use in their promos, finally deciding on John Lennon's emotional
anthem ``In My Life,'' which is now the main title music for the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was providential as well, and not only because many
cities in the East and Midwest were snowed or iced in on Friday.
Manze said: ``The country was just looking for something with
themes like this: about coming home, about family. I think it went
with the things going on with the President and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone at NBC expected results like this: It reached 21
percent of the audience when NBC rarely hits 10 percent. ``This was
five share points above dream city,'' Miller said. And it could
hardly come at a better time for NBC, which has suffered a grim
season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the viewers have to come back a second time and more.
Fox executives will find out when they receive the ratings results
if ``The PJ's'' held up when it moved to its regular spot on
Tuesday, and NBC will find out on Friday how many viewers liked
their trip to ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   That and $8 . . .
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal'' still roaring along,
David E. Kelley remains the hottest drama creator-producer in
television. He is also married to Michelle Pfeiffer. But neither
accomplishment helped get him into the movies Saturday night in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he and his wife tried twice that night to get into a
theater with no success. And what else would television's best
writer of legal dramas be trying to see but ``A Civil Action''? It
was sold out at both showings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is finishing the script for a new ABC series called
``Snoops,'' about young detectives who rely on electronic
eavesdropping. He is hoping not to duplicate the experience he had
with ``The Practice.'' ABC could not find a suitable spot for the
show for two seasons. It finally landed on Sunday night at 10,
where it is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason for the dearth of good openings: newsmagazine
programs. ABC now has five on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses said that if Kelley
turned in another strong series, she might try to revive a
once-cherished plan of grabbing away the Wednesday-at-10 spot
occupied by an edition of ``20/20.'' That program used to be
``Prime Time Live'' before it was folded into the ``20/20''
umbrella. When ABC Entertainment tried to claim that spot before,
to accommodate ``The Practice,'' the news division fought the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we love the pilot, we would fight again for Wednesday at
10,'' Ms. Tarses said. ``I think there's an openness now to saying:
`You know what? There's a lot of news on the schedule.'''
</P>
<P>
   Failing a shot on Wednesday, Ms. Tarses said she would consider
another ``20/20'' location, Sunday night at 9. She noted that the
powerhouse show at that hour, ``The X-Files'' on Fox, is to end
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Top Spot or Spots
</P>
<P>
   Who says network television is a troubled business? How could
everything be doom and gloom when five networks are No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Over a week, five networks laid claim to the top spot in various
analyses.
</P>
<P>
   CBS pointed to figures establishing that it is No. 1 in total
viewers. ABC said it was No. 1 in ``reach,'' meaning that it was
watched by more different viewers each week than any other network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is still No. 1 with viewers 18 to 49, a vital group to most
advertisers. Fox is No. 1 among viewers 18 to 34, the other vital
group to advertisers. And the WB boasts that it is the top network
among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, success is everywhere. That must be the reason
there are new top program executives at three of the No. 1
networks.

COURT'S DECISION LIMITS LAWSUITS FROM INTERNATIONAL AIR PASSENGERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International air travelers' ability to sue
airlines was limited Tuesday by a Supreme Court decision throwing
out a New York lawsuit filed by a passenger who was aggressively
frisked before boarding a plane to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-1 high court decision said airlines have the power to
impose the limits in the Warsaw Convention, the global agreement
governing international flights. This agreement includes a rule
prohibiting passengers from suing airlines in state court for
injuries they sustain while getting on or off flights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision restricts the compensation for injured passengers
to the convention's limits on such claims, preventing travelers
from seeking the much greater damage awards available from federal
and state court juries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court's majority,
said the Warsaw agreement's goal of setting an international
standard for compensating airline injuries would be undermined if
local lawsuits could be pursued. International airlines might be
discouraged from operating if they could be sued in Texas, New York
or other jurisdictions renowned for large jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the convention's comprehensive scheme of liability rules
and its textual emphasis on uniformity we would be hard put to
conclude that the delegates at Warsaw meant to subject air carriers
to the distinct, nonuniform liability rules of the individual
signatory nations,'' Ginsburg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling will not affect any future cases. Last fall,
the United States ratified a new treaty, the Montreal Protocol No.
4, that modifies the Warsaw Convention in a way that would preclude
the woman's lawsuit, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tsui Yuan Tseng, a New York hospital employee, was at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York to board a flight to Tel
Aviv on May 22, 1993, when a security guard ranked her as a
``high-risk'' passenger because of answers to questions that he
said were illogical. She was taken to a private security room,
where she was told to remove her shoes, jacket and sweater before a
female security guard frisked her. Guards permitted Tseng to board
the plane after the search yielded no dangerous items.
</P>
<P>
   Tseng sued El Al in New York court, claiming the search left her
emotionally distraught and saying that it amounted to assault and
false imprisonment under state law. The airline had the case moved
to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court dismissed Tseng's claim, ruling the
convention barred her from filing suit. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed, saying the international agreement
applies only to an ``accident'' while boarding, on or disembarking
an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   El Al appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, said the Warsaw
Convention does not prohibit lawsuits based on the ``willful
misconduct'' of airline personnel, such as the type of behavior the
guards allegedly exhibited toward Tseng.

HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS ON SEX HARASSMENT BY STUDENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga.)  (See also SCOTUS-BALLOT) 
(bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer for a Georgia school board warned the
Supreme Court on Tuesday that school districts across the country
would face dire financial consequences if the court extended
federal sexual harassment law to apply to harassment of one student
by another and made schools liable for failing to curb students'
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the closely watched case, the justices appeared sympathetic
to the school board's concerns _ somewhat surprisingly so, in light
of the court's generous reading of sexual harassment law in a
variety of other contexts.
</P>
<P>
   This fifth sexual harassment case to come before the court in
the last 15 months is an appeal by a woman whose fifth-grade
daughter was subjected to months of a male classmate's unwanted
poking, grabbing and taunting while school administrators in
Forsyth, Ga., refused to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the mother, Aurelia Davis, went to the police, and the
boy pleaded guilty to sexual battery. Ms. Davis then sued the
Monroe County Board of Education under Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, a federal law that bars sex discrimination by
schools that receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, in another Title IX case, the court ruled that
schools could be liable for a teacher's sexual harassment of a
student as long as top officials knew of the problem and did
nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   That definition of liability appeared comfortably to fit the
current case, with the one difference being the harasser's identity
as a fellow student rather than a teacher. But it quickly became
evident Tuesday from the justices' skeptical questions to Ms.
Davis' lawyers that this one difference might well mean all the
difference in the world for the legal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   How does one draw the line between harassment that amounts to
sex discrimination and garden-variety teasing and flirting in the
school yard, the justices wanted to know. ``Little boys tease
little girls through their years in school,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor told Verna Williams, representing Ms. Davis on behalf of
the National Women's Law Center in Washington. ``Is every incident
going to lead to a lawsuit?''
</P>
<P>
   A ``necessary consequence'' of the plaintiff's argument, Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy warned, was ``a federal code of conduct in every
classroom in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, along with several other justices,
said the courts' experience in dealing with sexual harassment in
the workplace was not easily transportable into the classroom.
Behavior problems in school are appropriately handled by
counseling, calling in the family, ``discussion and mediation,''
Breyer said, adding, ``What's worrying is the gearing up of the
great legal mechanism to replace that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams and Deputy Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, who
presented the government's argument in support of Ms. Davis,
labored to allay the justices' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary teasing is not an actionable wrong,'' Ms. Underwood
said, adding that the law would not apply unless the behavior was
so ``egregious'' that the victim was effectively deprived of the
ability to benefit from the educational program. In addition, she
said, the school would not be expected to solve every problem, only
to respond reasonably and appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   W. Warren Plowden Jr., the school board's lawyer, would not
accept those limitations on liability. ``No matter how high you set
the bar,'' he said, ``once you open the door to these lawsuits,
some federal judge has to make a judgment on, `Was the response
enough?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a principle beyond the context of sexual
harassment, Justice John Paul Stevens asked Plowden whether a
school could be liable under Title IX if boys prevented girls from
using a baseball field that had been set aside for them, while the
school athletic director stood by and did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No, Plowden said, because the misconduct would be not the
adult's but the children's.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to sexual harassment, he said ``the potential here is
enormous'' for school liability because three-quarters of all girls
and two-thirds of boys, in one study, had reported being sexually
harassed between the 8th and 11th grades.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected that ``we don't know the
definition of harassment'' under that particular study. She said
that while she understood the difficulty of drawing the line
between innocent teasing and sexual harassment, ``I don't
understand why it's so hard'' to evaluate the adequacy of a
school's response.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said there was a clear difference between simple
negligence, for which a school would not be liable, and
``deliberate indifference,'' the standard the court adopted in the
teacher harassment case last year. She defined deliberate
indifference as ``meaning you have to know and you don't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, No.
97-843, is an appeal from a 1997 ruling by the 11th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. In dismissing the lawsuit, that court
ruled that Title IX imposed no liability on schools for students'
wrongdoing. The 7-4 decision overturned an earlier ruling in the
case by a three-judge panel of the same court, which saw the issue
differently and held that a school could be found liable for its
officials' ``failure to take action to stop the offensive acts of
those over whom the officials exercised control.''

HIGH COURT REJECTS REGULATIONS ON THOSE SEEKING TO GET INITIATIVES
ON BALLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS-RDP) 
(pr) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday rebuffed Colorado's
effort to regulate the process of getting initiatives on the
ballot, in a decision extolling the First Amendment value of
uninhibited ``communication with voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, 6-3 in most respects, had possible implications
for the court's approach to political speech, the doctrine at the
heart of the debate over campaign finance reform. In reiterating
its long-held view that political messages should be delivered free
of government-imposed obstacles, the court gave little comfort to
critics who have speculated that the justices might be willing to
lower the level of First Amendment scrutiny for campaign
regulations in general.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the states that are increasingly uneasy about the use of
ballot initiatives, the subject before the court on Tuesday, likely
to get much help from the court in curbing the vigorous populist
impulse that is forcing contentious social and political issues
onto ballots in growing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado regulations that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
majority opinion struck down on Tuesday included requirements that
people who circulate petitions be registered Colorado voters, that
they wear badges identifying themselves by name and that sponsoring
organizations employing paid petition circulators include in
reports the name, address and compensation of each worker. The
regulations were challenged by a Denver-based organization, the
American Constitutional Law Foundation, which promotes voter
referendums as a form of direct democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While examining each regulation separately, Justice Ginsburg
said that in general they were ``not warranted'' by the state
interests invoked to justify them, which she identified as
``administrative efficiency, fraud detection and informing
voters.'' Justice Ginsburg said the First Amendment's free speech
guarantee required the court to be ``vigilant'' in guarding against
``undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ginsburg herself has been critical of the court's 1976
decision in Buckley vs. Valeo, which in equating political spending
with speech has blocked efforts to limit the flow of money in
politics. In a campaign finance case three years ago, she joined a
dissenting opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, who said that ``I
believe the government has an important interest in leveling the
electoral playing field by constraining the cost of federal
campaigns.'' So her opinion on Tuesday _ that political
communication is enhanced in the context of voter initiatives by
limiting regulation _ does not necessarily translate into a postion
against government regulation of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting Justices Tuesday _ Sandra Day O'Connor, Stephen
G. Breyer and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who felt strongly
enough to write one of his rare dissenting opinions _ all stressed
the broader implications of the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed with the majority that the identification badges
were unconstitutional but said the financial disclosure and
registered-voter requirements were reasonable and necessary. The
court's action in striking them down ``invalidates permissible
regulations that are vitally important to the integrity of the
political process,'' Justice O'Connor said in an opinion that
Justice Breyer also signed.
</P>
<P>
   While requiring petition circulators to reveal their names on
badges ``directly regulates the core political speech of petition
circulation,'' Justice O'Connor said, the other regulations were
less direct and so should be evaluated under a less exacting
standard of constitutional review. The requirement that circulators
be registered voters was a ``neutral qualification for
participation in the petitioning process'' and one that was easily
met, she said, while the disclosure requirements served the state's
legitimate interest in ``combating fraud and providing the public
with information.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist took particular aim at the ruling that
petition circulators could not be required to be registered voters.
``State ballot initiatives are a matter of state concern, and a
state chould be able to limit the ability to circulate initiative
petitions to those people who can ultimately vote on those
initiatives at the polls,'' he said in his dissenting opinion,
adding that the ruling on Tuesday, while seemingly rather narrow,
``threatens to invalidate a whole host of historically established
state regulations of the electoral process in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Buckley vs. American Constitutional Law Foundation,
No. 97-930, was an appeal by Colorado of a 1997 ruling of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. Reviewing an
array of restrictions on the initiative process, the appeals court
upheld a number of them, including a requirement that circulators
be at least 18 years old and that they attach to each petition an
affidavit containing their names and addresses. These provisions
were not part of the case on Tuesday, which was limited to three
provisions the appeals court struck down.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Supreme Court has frustrated
Colorado's effort to regulate ballot initiatives. In a 1988
decision, Meyer vs. Grant, the court ruled that Colorado's
prohibition on paid circulators violated the First Amendment by
curbing ``interactive communication concerning political change.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's regulatory efforts in turn reflect mounting concern
in many of the states that once celebrated the openness of their
political processes as reflected in the initiative process.
Colorado moved earlier and has gone further than other states in
regulating how initiatives are placed on the ballot, and the case
has been closely followed by states considering such steps.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four states, most in the West and midwest, provide for
voter referendums which, as the Chief Justice's opinion noted on
Tuesday, were a feature of the Progressive era and ``were advanced
as a means of limiting the control of wealthy special interests''
that dominated the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But a backlash has been growing, as the process has been used
more in the 1990's than in any other decade. Initiatives on
subjects from abortion and assisted suicide to term limits and
taxes have forced controversial questions onto ballots, often with
the assistance of out-of-state political consulting firms that
recruit and pay petition circulators. The Colorado case is widely
seen as a test of whether the backlash would continue to develop
with the court's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the voter registration requirement, Justice
Ginsburg said there were hundreds of thousands of Coloradans who
were not registered to vote, including some for whom ``the choice
not to register implicates political thought and expression.'' The
registration requirement, she said, ``cuts down the number of
message carriers in the ballot-access arena without impelling
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David
H. Souter joined the majority opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas
agreed with the result but wrote separately to object that Justice
Ginsburg had not subjected the regulations to the most exacting
``strict scrutiny,'' a test that he said was constitutionally
required and which the regulations all failed.

A MIAMI TRIAL FOR 7 ACCUSED IN CASTRO PLOT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ In what could prove a pivotal ruling in
the case of seven Cuban exiles accused of plotting to kill Fidel
Castro in 1997, a federal judge Tuesday granted a defense petition
to transfer proceedings to Miami, despite opposition from the U.S.
attorney's Office here.
</P>
<P>
   Trying the case in Miami, which is heavily populated by
Cuban-Americans who oppose President Castro, is expected to make it
easier for defense lawyers to get a sympathetic jury. In San Juan
many Puerto Ricans are indifferent toward the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   Even when evidence has been strong, federal prosecutors in
southern Florida have rarely charged Cuban exiles with plotting
against the Cuban government. Former prosecutors have said they
assumed that local juries would be unwilling to convict these
defendants, and the outcomes of many cases filed in the 1970s and
1980s supported such views.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exiles are charged with conspiring to assassinate a
head of state or ``internationally protected person,'' permitting
an American motor vessel to be used for criminal activity, making
false statements to U.S. Customs agents and smuggling weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven defendants are Miami residents, among them Jose
Antonio Llama, 68, a businessman who is a board member of the
politically influential Cuban-American National Foundation. Most of
the other defendants are also said to have links to the foundation,
which maintains that the charges against the exiles are politically
motivated and part of a plot to dismantle the United States'
long-standing policy of isolating Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Hector Laffitte validates a joint motion
filed last October in which lawyers for the defendants argued that
the case should be heard in Miami because ``all of the critical
acts in this case took place or were launched from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the conspiracy had as its objective the murder of a
foreign head of state on foreign soil, and a few overt acts in
furtherance of that objective took place on the high seas and in
foreign territory, this conspiracy is not essentially foreign in
nature,'' the judge wrote in his decision. ``It was hatched,
nurtured and fledged from the Southern District of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Quinon, the Miami defense lawyer who wrote the motion for a
change of venue, said in response to the ruling Tuesday: ``From our
point of view, having all the Cuban defendants in the alleged plot
to kill Castro, I can't think of a better place to have the trial.
Miami is home sweet home for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven men are accused of plotting to assassinate Castro in
November 1997 while he attended a summit meeting of Southern
Hemisphere leaders at a Venezuelan island resort. About a week
before the meeting, four of the defendants were intercepted by the
Coast Guard off northwest Puerto Rico and forced to dock their
cabin cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   On board, Coast Guard officers discovered a stash of weapons and
commando gear, including two .50-caliber sniper rifles, which cost
$7,000 apiece and can hit a target as far as a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men aboard the vessel, Angel Alfonso-Aleman, a former
political prisoner and avowed anti-Castro activist, blurted out
that the weapons were his and that he was on a mission to kill the
Cuban leader, according to testimony by a federal agent.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argued in their motion for a change of venue
that their clients' contacts with Puerto Rico ``are few and either
fortuitous or perhaps the result of government forum-shopping,'' a
charge prosecutors denied.
</P>
<P>
   The motion says that the vessel, named La Esperanza, the Spanish
word for hope, broke down off the Dominican Republic and that it
was the decision of government agents to take the defendants to
Puerto Rico to interrogate them.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-foot vessel belongs to the sole corporate defendant in
the case, Nautical Sports Inc., which is owned by Llama. The
indictment also states that Llama ``obtained possession'' of one of
the sniper rifles confiscated by Customs agents, though it does not
specify whether it is the same one that FBI agents later determined
was registered to Jose Francisco Hernandez, president of the
Cuban-American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants are Jose Rodriguez-Sosa, Alfredo Domingo
Otero, Angel Hernandez-Rojo, Juan Bautista Marquez and Francisco
Secundino-Cordova, all of Miami.

DISNEY HALL CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 99 percent of its $209 million cost on hand,
construction will finally begin this summer on the Walt Disney
Concert Hall and finish in time for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
fall 2002 season, Music Center of Los Angeles County officials
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dreams and have had them for sometime, and those
dreams are beginning to come true,'' said Nicholas Goldsborough,
chief operating officer of the Music Center. ``I'm here to tell you
that Disney Hall is a virtual certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the announcement at an upbeat ``State of the Arts''
gathering of the dons of Los Angeles high culture at the Music
Center. Leaders of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, L.A. Opera, Center
Theater Group and Los Angeles Master Chorale all reported good
news, whether it was heavier attendance, better finances,
provocative new programming or national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   And they said the Disney Hall opening will allow the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion to become a world-class opera house, featuring
substantially more performances and visits from more international
touring groups. The Philharmonic and Master Chorale, which will be
housed at Disney Hall, also will expand their seasons and kinds of
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a great addition to the arts of Los Angeles
County,'' said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who has overseen
the project. The county donated the site and will run the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney Hall will be a magnet for the entire region as people
come from all over to see and experience the hall,'' Yaroslavsky
said. The dramatically improved acoustics should change the way an
audience experiences a concert performance.
</P>
<P>
   Music Center leaders said they want to diversify the programs
offered at the massive arts complex, adding performances that will
appeal to a broader swath of Angelenos, not just fans of classic
high culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,250-seat Disney Hall has been mired in controversy for
years, as its distinctive rippling design by architect Frank Gehry
caused costs to balloon, quickly outstripping huge initial
donations from Disney's heirs and others.
</P>
<P>
   After a December 1992 groundbreaking ceremony on the site at
downtown Los Angeles' First and Grand streets, little has been done
other than completion of an underground parking garage capped with
a semi-permanent roof.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsborough said that cap will have to be removed first in
preliminary work that may actually start this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Among other bits of good news announced during the forum: Opera
subscriptions rose by 2,000 to 16,500; the Chorale's latest album,
``Lux Aeterna,'' was nominated for a Grammy Award; and fund raising
by the Music Center Foundation was up 30 percent. &QL;

CONFLICTS MUDDY MEXICAN PROBE OF JOURNALIST'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas) (bl) 
By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The investigation into the apparent murder of
Philip True, an American journalist who died in December during a
10-day hike through remote mountains, has become mired in
conflicting autopsy reports and contradictory confessions by two
men charged with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A government coroner in the western state where True's battered
body was found in a shallow grave Dec. 16 ruled that the
correspondent had been sexually brutalized and strangled to death.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, authorities charged two Huichol Indians with
the murder, citing a confession in which the men said they killed
True along a mountain trail Dec. 6 after he angered them by
snapping photographs of sacred Indian lands.
</P>
<P>
   But at their arraignment, the men drastically altered their
confession, saying they strangled True on Dec. 4 in their mountain
village after he grew belligerent and appeared likely to rape the
wife of one of them. The defendants and their families have
complained that they were mistreated during interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mexico's attorney general issued a summary of the
second government autopsy, conducted three days after the first in
the presence of a forensics expert from the FBI. It asserts that
True was neither strangled nor sexually brutalized, but died of
blows to the head and chest, seeming to leave open the possibility
that he died in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not explained why it kept the results of the
second autopsy secret for 20 days and has not made its text public.
Nor have the FBI experts' views been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rivard, True's editor at The San Antonio News-Express,
who traveled to Mexico to search for the correspondent,
congratulated the Mexican authorities for the vigorous effort by
army aircraft and infantry that eventually found True's body. But
Rivard expressed disappointment with the course of the criminal
investigation that has followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept that we may never know the whole truth,'' he said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rivard said he remained convinced both that True's death was a
homicide and, despite the contradictions in their confessions, that
the two Huichol defendants took part in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that this is a real-life `Deliverance'
story,'' Rivard said, referring to the 1972 movie in which urban
campers are attacked by sadistic mountaineers. ``I think a couple
of bad guys, perhaps with robbery as the motive, perhaps suspicious
over the presence of an outsider, killed him and attempted to stage
the murder as a hiking accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivard acknowledged, however, that other scenarios, including an
attack by narcotics traffickers or by Indian-hating ranchers who
view outsiders as ``pro-Indian provocateurs,'' could also explain
True's death.
</P>
<P>
   True, who was 50 and an experienced hiker, died about halfway
through a solo 100-mile, 10-day trek through the Sierra de los
Huicholes, a rugged range straddling the border of Jalisco and
Nayarit states.

 &HT;    Suntrust growth news dulled by rise in operating income
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SunTrust Banks reported double-digit revenue growth
Tuesday, but fourth-quarter operating income rose at a single digit
8 percent primarily because of higher expenses. Robinson-Humphrey
analyst John W. Coffey said the expense drag was largely at
newly-acquired Crestar Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income was $275 million, or 86 cents per share,
compared to $254.6 million, or 80 cents per share, in the fourth
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The results were 3 cents per share below the consensus estimate,
according to First Call. The service said this was the first time
since it began keeping records in 1990 that SunTrust Banks failed
to meet or beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, these estimates were clearly on a pre-merger basis,''
said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, meaning ``that
the old-SunTrust may well have met estimates'' if tracked
separately.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Bank's spokesman James Armstrong said the old SunTrust
Bank would have earned 93 cents a share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Banks closed at $77.18 3/4, down $1.75 on a day many
bank stocks declined.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the fourth quarter, which included aftertax
merger charges of $117.1 million, was $157.9 million, or 49 cents
per share. The bulk of the merger charges were for legal fees and
severance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue grew 10.8 percent, to $1.2 billion from $1.08 billion.
Of that, net interest income rose 6 percent, to $764.6 million from
$721.9 million, and non-interest income increased 20.6 percent to
$436.1 million from $361.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, interest expense rose 5 percent, to $689.5
million from $656.7 million in 1997, and non-interest expense rose
36.5 percent, to $851 million from $623.4 million. Armstrong said
$119.6 million of the fourth-quarter non-interest expense stemmed
from merger related charges. Excluding this amount, expenses grew
17.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they saw no reason to change their forecasts for
1999. R. Harold Schroeder of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods expects the
banking company to earn $4 per share this year. Coffey is looking
for $4.05.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Banks reported operating earnings of $1.09 billion, or
$3.41 per share, in 1998, against $975.9 million, or $3.04 per
share, in 1997.

 &HT;    Georgians expected to pay significant increase in insurance
co-pay
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundreds of thousands of Georgia HMO members now must
swallow higher out-of-pocket costs along with their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs and the employers they serve in Georgia, as well as their
national counterparts, have recently raised co-pays for patients
who receive brand-name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   HMO industry officials in Georgia said Tuesday they have seen up
to 20 percent increases annually in their prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the No. 1 driver of (HMO) premiums going up'' for
employers, said Kevin Curtin of the Georgia Association of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Low prescription co-pays have long been a selling point of
managed-care plans such as HMOs. But instead of paying $5 to $10
co-pays for drugs, some patients in HMOs now are paying twice as
much or more.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the increases, experts say.
They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher prices from drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ More use of pharmaceuticals by patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aging of America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drug firms' new direct advertising to patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ The introduction of many new, expensive pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health-care costs are perking up again, and prescription drugs
are probably the most frustrating part to control,'' said Lew
Yeouze of consulting firm William M. Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the co-pay structure is arrived at jointly by the
employer and the HMO. Employers pick the benefit plan _ and co-pays
for doctor visits and drugs _ based on options presented by the
managed-care company. Generally, the richer the drug benefit, the
higher the premiums paid by employers.
</P>
<P>
   A spike in co-pays for HMO members can lead patients to skip
needed drug therapy, warned Kathleen Haddad of Families USA, a
Washington-based consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant numbers of low-salaried employees may not use the
drugs they need,'' said Haddad. ``The consequences could be that
they end up sicker, and cost more for the system and the health
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry, meanwhile, has enjoyed booming earnings
growth in recent years. But an industry trade group, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said Tuesday
that a sufficient profit level is necessary to sustain research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies on average spend three or four times more than
other industries on research and development,'' said Jeff Trewhitt
of PhRMA.
</P>
<P>
   The double-digit increase in drug costs mainly stems from
increased use by patients, Trewhitt said. ``There are more
medicines for more patients.'' For example, there are 10 to 15
drugs for Alzheimer's disease, where 10 years ago, there were none,
Trewhitt added.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia HMOs surveyed Tuesday reported increases in prescription
co-pays over the past two years. Several have created a
three-tiered system of payments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, United HealthCare moved from an average co-pay of
$12 in 1997 to a system that charges $10 for generic drugs, $15 for
brand-name drugs on its preferred list, and $30 for other drugs.
With the $30 co-pay, patients can buy prescriptions not on the
company's formulary, United said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, at the end of last year, began offering
employers a three-tiered system, with generic drugs costing either
$5 or $10; formulary drugs $10 or $15; and non-formulary drugs
either $25 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, whose drug co-pays average $5 to $10, plans
to increase that amount by $2 or $3. ``It's up to the employer,''
said spokeswoman Laura Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   For Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, co-pays for generic
drugs have remained at $5 since 1997. But co-pays for brand-name
drugs have climbed from $5 in 1997 to $10 last year, to $15 in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in Blue Cross' drug costs _ about 18 percent annually
_ are far outstripping its other medical costs, said Charlie
Harman, a company vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And Cigna HealthCare, after years of $5 to $15 co-pays in
Georgia, has seen its drug costs balloon about 16 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Now it offers a three-tiered system, with generics at $5; brand
name drugs on its preferred list at $10 to $15; and other drugs at
$25 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraging clients to choose this option,'' said Jack
Towsley of Cigna.

DEAL NEAR ON STEAM PLANT AT PLANNED STADIUM SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last remaining obstacle to the New England
Patriots' move to Hartford, Conn. is close to being cleared as
Connecticut officials are nearing an agreement on relocating a
steam plant on the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and
cools many of Hartford's buildings, is considering a partnership
with another power producer, allowing its facility _ now sitting on
what would be the 50-yard line _ to be demolished without
disrupting heating and cooling service downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away from the planned stadium site sits the
quasi-public Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority plant, which
burns all of the garbage from 64 towns in the state and produces
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   CTG could buy steam from the CRRA plant, which makes more than
five times the amount of steam as the facility on the proposed
stadium site, to do the job. If that plan falls through, the state
could take the CTG site by eminent domain and reimburse the company
for its value.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the quasi-public agency say they could run steam
lines from their plant to the site, where they could connect with
existing CTG lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer the energy deal,'' said Lynn Blackwell,
spokeswoman for CTG Resources Inc. ``Negotiations are continuing .
. . and they're going very well. The meetings are cordial and
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the energy deal could be completed by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   CRRA president Robert Wright also said the best deal for
everyone was for his agency to sell power to CTG.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to pay a price to make it now,'' Wright said,
referring to CTG's steam. ``They can pay us to make it for them.
That's the easiest deal. Other things are being talked about and
it's everything from someone coming in and buying them to someone
coming in and condemning them.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-term energy agreement between the two power producers
would be lucrative for CTG, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line on it is, one way or another, the plant is
going to be removed,'' he added, ``and the stadium is going to be
built and we're just talking about the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Connecticut Governor John Rowland signed the
legislation that funds the $374 million open-air stadium, leaving
two other details to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   First, the National Football League owners need to approve the
move, which they are expected to do at their next meeting,
tentatively scheduled for Jan. 28 in Miami. An alternate date for a
vote is Feb. 16 in Atlanta. Twenty-four of the 31 owners must vote
yes to allow the relocation, according to league spokesman Greg
Aiello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the owners, but we don't see any major roadblocks
at this time,'' Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lengthy and complex development agreement between
Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the state needs to be completed.
The development agreement will include the original memorandum of
understanding reached by Kraft and Rowland and the legislation
passed by the Connecticut General Assembly Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The document was due to be finished Friday, but could take
another week before all the details are put in writing, people
familiar with the deal say.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was only a faint stir to the
season here Tuesday after the morning news sounded the alarm that
Michael Jordan would not be rising with a league now at risk of
awakening to a global ennui. Jayson Williams and Rony Seikaly were
shooting around with the well-traveled Lloyd Daniels and an
apparition from the days when a New Jersey Nets practice had all
the iridescence of a haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, in their Derrick Coleman days, worked out in a cramped
trucking facility, team and teamsters side by side. ``Man, this is
nice,'' Coleman said of the Nets' new digs, a bright, roomy gym
smack dab in the middle of a Meadowlands industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Media work room and all, it has a familiar feel to the Chicago
Bulls' state-of-the-art practice building in Deerfield, Ill. It
also has the fresh smell of coming success, and if the Nets can
hold on to Williams _ a free agent _ and their other young stars,
they will finally begin to achieve beyond their standard
make-the-playoffs prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a ticket to the Eastern Conference finals, us
and Indiana,'' said Williams, in mourning over Jordan's reported
retirement for at least 20 minutes. ``It's right there.''
</P>
<P>
   While this prognostication may be overly optimistic, it was as
good a day as any for the National Basketball Association to hear
Jayson Williams propose the sanguine side of a Jordan-less but less
predictable sport. As Commissioner David Stern gets ready to unlock
his league, he could do worse than have an upbeat bunch like the
Nets make a daring move to inherit the East.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan officially pulls the plug on the NBA's reigning
dynasty Wednesday in Chicago, the nominations for the position of
His Heirness will surely commence. Grant Hill. Kobe Bryant. Antoine
Walker. Shaq Fu. Williams' personal choice and teammate, Keith Van
Horn. No offense to any of these skilled men, but this will be an
exercise comparable to naming one's poison.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, Seikaly said, ``You won't find another one like
Jordan for at least 10 or 15 years.'' Williams, for his part,
advised Stern to make a list, check it twice, eliminate those who
are naughty, not nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to take the next 15 Olympians, guys who are
accessible, good people,'' he said, before raising his hand to
volunteer. Williams promised to start this weekend by appearing at
an unspecified Bob's clothing store to sign autographs and by
letting the hecklers take it all out on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can come curse me out for the lockout,'' said the man
who turned up the volume for those who were calling for the
hard-liners to facilitate its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Better than the autographs, Williams should sign up for another
half-dozen years with the new Nets owners, who are determined to
take an exciting, contending team into a proposed downtown Newark
arena in a few years to help with the revitalization of that
long-suffering city. How's that for one fresh new marketing spin
after so many years of Buy-My-Shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Another Jordan may be inevitable, but he will arrive in his
time, on his terms, not Stern's or Nike's. This notion of just
inventing the phenomenon is what got the NBA in trouble in the
first place. So while we await the next Elvis, better this league
should focus less on solo acts and more on harmonious bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of players who are good but can be the
biggest jerks,'' Seikaly said. ``They want to see exciting teams
that want to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what the lockout, to a large degree, was about?
Curbing the high-end salaries so young teams in New Jersey,
Minnesota and San Antonio could keep more than one or two promising
players and have them blossom together? Perhaps with Jordan's $35
million stricken from their cap, even the Bulls might grab a
high-profile free agent, re-sign Scottie Pippen and piece together
a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   The truncated season is an open book _ I suspect the Knicks
would like to take that Charles Oakley deal back _ and real
basketball fans may come to appreciate this sooner than they think.
Right to the end, Jordan represented must-see TV, but on that last
night in Salt Lake City, there was a scripted, albeit spectacular,
feel to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the silver-haired gentleman behind the backboard in the
lower right corner of the photo of the now famous and final Jordan
jumper that beat the Jazz. His arms were folded, his face was glum,
before the ball was ever out of Jordan's hands. He knew. We all
knew. It was superman against men. Like it or not, the time has
come for a fairer fight.

BUSH DISCUSSES PRESIDENCY WITH POLICY EXPERTS, LAWMAKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Condoleezza is cq) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush is conducting a series of lengthy meetings
about the presidency with policy experts, financiers and lawmakers
from other states while saying his focus is on Texas and the
personal aspects of a White House run.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesmen say he routinely meets with thinkers and
elected officials to discuss issues of interest to him and the
state. But in the last four weeks, according to his guests, some of
the meetings were organized to help Bush get ready for a possible
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz,
former U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and former White House
Council of Economic Advisers chief Michael Boskin joined a group of
public policy experts &UR;  &LR; that discussed foreign and domestic policies
with Bush, participant Martin Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at the Governor's Mansion in Austin,
Texas, and lasted about six hours, said Anderson, who was a policy
adviser to former Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Anderson is
now a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked to the experts about foreign relations, Social
Security and tax reform as issues he would pursue in a presidential
contest, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you kind of decide to do and the next
morning you just do it,'' Anderson said of Bush's preparations for
a potential campaign for the Republican nomination. ``If he does
decide to run, this work (of discussing policies) has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush had lunch at the mansion with five Republican
leaders of the New Jersey Legislature who had said they wanted to
get to know Bush in his role as a potential candidate, said New
Jersey lawyer-lobbyist Bill Palatucci.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers ``gave (Bush) some encouragement as to why he
should run,'' said Palatucci, who arranged and attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A gathering of some major Republican campaign donors from across
the country is scheduled for the Governor's Mansion on Jan. 21, two
days after Bush's second inauguration as Texas governor, according
to a source who did not want to be named. The meeting is similar to
one that drew nine donors Dec. 18, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   These are prominent examples, but not a complete list, of
meetings dedicated to Bush's would-be run for the White House. On
Bush's daily schedule that is made public, such meetings are not
listed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said Tuesday that Bush ``has been
meeting and talking with variety of people _ some of them request
meetings _ and has been listening and learning, to help him make up
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Austin-based political consultant, Karl Rove, has issued
invitations for policy experts and potential campaign financiers to
meet with the governor, said Anderson and others involved with the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Rove referred comment to Bush's government spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose father served as president from 1989-1993, has said
repeatedly that he will make a decision about running for the White
House based not on policy matters or political money, but on
whether he wants to expose himself and his families to the rigors
of a national campaign and close scrutiny by the news media and
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some important GOP figures are more anxious than others to make
the pilgrimage to Bush's residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex Spanos flew himself down there to see Bush,'' a leading
California Republican said of the wealthy real estate developer,
owner of the San Diego Chargers football team and a major
Republican contributor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who won California in 1992 and 1996, was the
first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the Golden State
since 1964, and Republicans are anxious to stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Several close political friends of the governor, acknowledging
that it sounds self-serving, contended that the Austin meetings are
the result of a spontaneous outpouring of interest in Bush's
possible candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of it's just reacting to people who call and
ask for time'' with Bush, said a national political operative with
almost two decades of ties to the Bush family. ``It's as close as
you get to a legitimate draft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenon I've never seen before,'' another longtime
Bush family associate said. Other prospective candidates ``are
scrambling for people'' while Bush has to walk the fine line
between possibly offending people by refusing to see potential
supporters and not wanting to appear as if he's already got a
campaign going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to appear pro-active, but at the same time he
doesn't want to be disrespectful to people who want to pay their
respects. It's a delicate balance,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy meeting in December was stocked with experts who
served under Bush's father: Shultz, Cheney, Boskin, Anderson and
others, such as Condoleezza Rice, who recently resigned as Stanford
University provost, saying she wanted to return to international
affairs and politics. She was an expert on the Soviet Union in the
Bush presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's talks with the group ranged from details about
the nation's missile defense system to the political mechanics of
running for president, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he operates reminds me more of Reagan than anyone
else, in terms of his general views,'' Anderson continued. ``He had
very clear views; he was expanding, asking questions, going into
details'' on the policy subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, who was governor of California before he became
president, Bush would have no foreign policy experience if he were
to move directly from the governorship to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, a likely GOP presidential
candidate, said in a Washington speech Tuesday that no contender
should be taken seriously unless they understand the importance of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to critique potential rivals, but said in an
interview afterward when asked about Bush's foreign policy
abilities, ``Clearly experience helps. I don't need on-the-job
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and a few other Republican governors went to Israel late
last year on an informational trip sponsored by a U.S. group of
Jewish Republicans. He was scheduled to play golf Wednesday in
Austin with Argentine President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's meetings with experts from California has been
coordinated, at least in part, through Los Angeles corporate
acquisition specialist Brad Freeman. Bush was at Harvard Business
School almost 30 years ago with Freeman's partner, Ron Spogli.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman apparently has become Bush's ``man to see'' in
California. He hosted a luncheon for Bush when the governor was in
the state last year and is on active standby for a Bush
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still prejudiced. I think he's so good,'' Freeman said
Tuesday. ``I'd love to have him run, and I'd do whatever he wanted
me to do.''

 &HT;    Sculpture will lose inches for Schuller's Crystal Cathedral
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Televangelist Robert Schuller was clearly
moved by the sculpture he viewed Tuesday in a warehouse off Blue
Heron Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America's foremost preacher of ``possibility thinking''
wondered about the possibility of the female subject losing a
little weight in the hips and thighs and having more graceful toes.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, West Palm Beach artist Mehri Danielpour Weil assured
Schuller.
</P>
<P>
   Schuller, whose weekly Hour of Power program is the most-watched
religious show in the United States, jetted in for a few hours
Tuesday to inspect a clay version of a sculpture that will be cast
in bronze and placed in the entrance of his famed Crystal Cathedral
near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Weil's life-size work depicts the New Testament story of the
poor widow whose gift of two coins was counted by Jesus as greater
than the larger gifts of wealthy donors because the coins were all
the widow had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's captured it. Isn't that a lovely expression?''
Schuller enthused as he looked at Weil's artistry. ``This
instantly, completely caught me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had only a few minor questions and suggestions before the
work is cast in bronze. Were the coins in the woman's hand
authentic? Could her big toes be a little less ``blunt''? And could
she be a little trimmer in the backside?
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, commissioned by a friend of Schuller, Isabelle
Paul of Boca Raton, will be cast by RDK Studios Inc. at its Riviera
Beach foundry.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cathedral is known for its seven-figure gifts from
prominent donors, but Schuller says its financial success is
embodied in the story of the poor widow's gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `Where does the money come from?' '' Schuller said.
``It comes from the widow's mite, from so many people whose names
we don't even know . . . beautiful people that have great joy in
giving whatever they can.''

   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York has never been easy, but for most of this
century, the idea of high school sports at least had a firm place
in the roster of what public schools were meant to do. But in the
last quarter century, public school sports in the city have been
devalued and cast adrift. Interviews with more than 200 current and
former coaches, teachers, administrators and students, lay bare
what happened: at a time when medicine and sociology were
establishing as never before the benefits of physical activity for
young people and as an obsession with sports was growing across
much of the rest of America, the nation's largest public school
system all but walked off the field. By Kirk Johnson. (The story

HIGH COURT HEARS HARASSMENT CASE INVOLVING CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sexual harassment isn't child's play. But in
hearing its first case of student-to-student sexual harassment, the
Supreme Court Tuesday searched for how to define the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure schoolchildren nationwide tease each other; little
boys tease little girls,'' said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, as the
court contemplated the case of a 10-year-old Georgia girl allegedly
harassed by a fifth-grade boy. ``Is every one of these cases going
to lead to some kind of lawsuit?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Clinton administration and the National Women's
Law Center, a private advocacy group, said no, but insisted that
the quarter-century old Title IX, a federal law that bars sex
discrimination in education programs, requires schools to address
and remedy real cases of pervasive, offensive, and severe
student-to-student harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a peer situation, Title IX imposes an obligation that
a school stop it,'' said Verna L. Williams, a law center attorney.
``When the school can prevent it, it must take reasonable steps to
prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of LaShonda Davis said they tried unsuccessfully for
months in 1992 and 1993 to get her teacher and principal in a
Monroe County, Ga., elementary school to protect their daughter
from distracting and persistent grabbing, groping, and suggestive
talk and acts by a 10-year-old boy. When officials took no action,
LaShonda's mother, Aurelia, filed a lawsuit charging the local
board of education with a violation of Title IX for failing to stop
the harassment and asked for damages.
</P>
<P>
   W. Warren Plowden, Jr., a Macon, Ga., attorney representing the
Monroe County school board, argued Tuesday that holding schools
legally liable for a student's misbehavior was wrong and would
``open the courthouse door to all kinds of lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Plowden said schools are better able than courts to assess and
handle student misbehavior, a point on which Justice Stephen Breyer
seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be careful,'' Breyer said. ``My concern is applying the
same standard you apply for sexual harassment in the workplace to a
7-year-old doing something to a 6-year-old, or a 13-year-old doing
something to a 12-year-old. And do you want to remove the problem
in school from teachers, pyschologists, and counselors and give it
to a judge?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the justices voiced concern about how to draw the line
between juvenile teasing and more serious misconduct in schools.
Lawyers for the Davises urged the justices not to ignore that
sexual harassment is a problem in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys tease girls because they are girls. Is every case of
pervasive teasing a federal case?'' asked Justice David H. Souter.
``My concern is that there is no way to draw a line between every
act of teasing and a case for federal litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices seemed just as reluctant, however, to accept the
argument made by Plowden and the National School Boards
Association, in a friend-of-the-court brief, that school officials
have no liability for acts of sexual discrimination that occur on
their watch but are not perpetrated by adult faculty or staff.
</P>
<P>
   Justice O'Connor asked if girls' civil rights wouldn't be
violated by the school if it stood by silently while boys blocked
their entry into the computer lab. Justice John Paul Stevens
suggested a school would be liable under Title IX for sexual
discrimination if it did nothing while boys usurped the time set
aside for girls on the playground baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the problem of drawing a line between rough-stuff
teasing and sexual harassment,'' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
``but I don't understand that schools can be allowed to be
negligent or deliberatively indifferent'' to sexual discrimination
or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has closely examined the issue of sexual
harassment. The court last year also considered a school-related
case in which a Texas teacher had secretly carried on a sexual
affair with a student. The court ruled that under Title IX, the
victim could not recover damages because the school district was
only liable for misconduct that it ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis case, filed in 1994, was dismissed by a federal
district court. It was reinstated by an appeals panel, but the full
appeals court reversed it. The boy, identified in court papers as
``G.F.,'' was charged in 1993 with sexual battery and pled guilty
to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education, 97-843.
The court's decision is due by the end of June.

 &HT;    Jordan knows when to step away
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So Michael Jordan's retiring. Fine with
me, and not just for the obvious reason that the pigheaded NBA,
half a season shy of a load, doesn't deserve the hastened recovery
that his participation guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Mike has lived the life of the global sports and marketing icon
long enough to know when a breath of fresh air is in order. Maybe
we don't always embrace his timing or his methods - that late-night
Atlantic City casino sidetrip in the midst of the 1993 Eastern
Conference Finals matchup comes to mind - but there is no
disagreement over the efficiency of his personal management. Six
NBA titles, five league MVP awards and 10 scoring titles are all
that needs to be said about that.
</P>
<P>
   To step away from basketball at a point so fantastically high
that other athletes' fantasies fall short is Jordan's option and
his alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls certainly have no say in it. The United
Center, site of 542 consecutive sellouts, has become a center of
disunity with Phil Jackson gone and Scottie Pippen sick of staying.
Besides, Jordan needs another Bulls contract like Bill Gates needs
a new truckload of mouse pads.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's family, too, lacks the pull to bring him out of the
limelight and into the living room for any significant period of
time. Difficult to forget the tone of Mike's first retirement
announcement five years ago, when he spoke of logging some serious
make-up time with the wife and kids rather than continuing the
tiresome pattern of running from airport to arena to golf course
and back again. Four months later Jordan signed with the Chicago
White Sox, packing his bags to embark on another personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   There is no competitive obsession like Michael's. How else does
a kid once cut from his high school basketball team become, by
universal acclamation, the greatest ever to play the game?
</P>
<P>
   Michael has determined that another spectacular season would be
more than redundant. It would be counterproductive. Sinking the
final, winning shot in the final seconds of a world championship
effort against Utah last summer was the perfect farewell. Jordan,
36 next month, has no promise of another moment like that, framed
in pure gold, centered in the public consciousness and savored for
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Selfish of us to ask for more, based solely on the fact that no
one like this will come again. Nobody rode George Washington
Carver, the great American botanist who came up with more than 300
medical and commercial uses for the peanut, to start in fresh on
rutabaga research. Jordan has done everything that a human being
can with a basketball. Enough already, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling, you see, whether Michael is truly finished.
Perhaps the biggest reason why this retirement is fine with me is
the fascination of what's coming next. The first time Jordan quit,
for instance, was enormously newsworthy, but his return was epic.
My guess is that whenever and wherever Phil Jackson returns to the
NBA, Michael will be sorely tempted to join him in a new and
greater challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If not that, look for Jordan at the next PGA Tour qualifying
school, or driving a Nike-sponsored car on the NASCAR circuit, or
signing on as an astronaut to get taxpayers excited about some
future manned mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   After the monotony of so many championships, any new Michael
Jordan story line is fine with me. All that's needed now is for him
to figure out which direction he wishes to lead.

 &HT;    Heat won't miss Jordan
 &HT;    By Tom D'AnGelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Members of the Miami Heat wished Michael
Jordan a fond farewell Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And some even revealed their true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I miss him? No. Honestly no,'' Alonzo Mourning said.
``I've been working all these years to try to be a part of a team
to beat him and we never accomplished that. No I won't miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dan Majerle: ``Miss him? No. Give somebody else a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will announce his retirement today, 6 1/2 months after
winning his sixth championship. Although his announcement comes
during a time of crisis for a league that must recover from a
six-month labor dispute, Jordan will leave at the top of his game
and with his legacy untarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA, the fans and America and society and history, coaches
and players, is losing the greatest influence that sports has ever
had,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``The true meaning of leadership
is one's influence, he has influenced the world, he has influenced
the league, he has influenced me, he has influenced his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is he's had the most influence of every living
athlete in the history of any sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Keith Askins, who has been a part of more Heat vs.
Jordan games than any other player, puts Jordan in an exclusive
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember anybody besides Ali touching the country like
he has in his sport and with his God-given ability,'' Askins said.
``Everybody has a path set for them when they're born and I think
his path was to be the best basketball player ever.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the great moments, he will be best remembered for the
final 37.1 seconds of his career in which he scored on a baseline
drive, stole the ball from Utah's Karl Malone and then hit a 17
foot jumper with 5.2 seconds to play to give Chicago an 87-86
victory over the Jazz and secure their sixth title.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he described those final seconds all summer while
giving motivational speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said so much,'' Riley said. ``The history of Michael, the
Chicago Bulls. ... The last seconds of the game, the delirious
crowd that thought they were going to win, the Jazz in control and
assuredly going to play Game 7 at home. It was all just taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then to leave us there with a statue (of his follow
through). It's a fitting departure. I think it's fitting if there
is a bronze statue in the NBA offices with that, the perfect follow
though.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls star has tormented many teams over his 13 seasons,
including the Heat. The Bulls are 36-5 in games against the Heat in
which Jordan has played and Jordan has led Chicago in scoring in
all but two of those games. He averaged 32.95 points against Miami,
including playoffs, which is 1.47 points above his career
regular-season average.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley does not look at Jordan's retirement as an automatic
path to the Finals, as it was for him five years ago when Jordan
left basketball for 17 months to pursue a baseball career. That
year, Riley's Knicks benefited most in the Eastern Conference by
advancing to the Finals before losing to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not celebrating his leaving because he's giving me an
edge,'' Riley said. ``The competitive paranoia always comes back.
You have so much respect for your adversaries because there was
always a common denominator that you hated each other for, which
was the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have won the last three championships and all six this
decade in which Jordan played a full season. Now that he's gone,
who's next?
</P>
<P>
   Not the Heat, according to Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say us, but I don't think we're to the level of
maturity as those other teams,'' Riley said. ``I think we do have
some parts. Just playing hard and being conditioned and being
defensive is not going to win championships. We're not far away but
I think there are teams that are a little bit more ready than we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Those teams, according to Riley, are Utah and Indiana first,
followed by New York, Seattle and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Heat players said they regret Jordan leaving because they
will not get the chance to end the Bulls' run. The Bulls eliminated
Miami in three of the Heat's five trips to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that he's upset a lot of guys because a lot of guys
wanted to be the ones to say, `We retired Michael Jordan,''
Mourning said. ``Now he can just sit back and laugh at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tim Hardaway: ``I wanted him to stay because I really
wanted to beat him in the playoffs and take that next step like he
did against the Pistons and like the Pistons did against Boston.
It's not going to happen.''

MINING EXECUTIVE RETURNS FROM CAPTIVITY A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Norbert Reinhart, a Canadian mining company owner who
last October swapped himself for an employee taken hostage by
rebels in Colombia, finally came home Tuesday to a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did what needed to be done,'' said the 49-year-old
Albertan, released over the weekend by guerrillas of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia after 94 days in captivity.
``It was nothing special. I just tried to fulfill my responsibility
to someone working for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt but in good humor, Reinhart was embraced by his wife,
Casey, while his two daughters, Robin, 7, and Molly, 2, squealed
with delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the day we've been dreaming of,'' said Casey. ``We're
joyful beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, at a remote mountain pass high in the Colombian
Andes, under the guns of suspicious guerrillas, Reinhart offered
himself to the Marxist rebels as a replacement hostage for Edward
Leonard, 60, a fellow Canadian seized from the company's gold
exploration camp in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your shift is over,'' Reinhart told his site manager that day.
``It's time to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, upon gaining his own freedom after a ransom
of $70,000 was reportedly paid to the rebels, Reinhart _ who had no
contact with the outside world during his captivity _ seemed
stunned to find he had become a sort of national folk hero for his
extraordinary act of executive compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era where responsibility is something to be evaded, and
when employees often feel their bosses really don't care about
them, the gesture (by Reinhart) captured the popular imagination,''
the Montreal Gazette said in an editorial. ``Mr. Reinhart put
himself at great risk for the sake of his employee.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart shrugged off the fanfare. ``Most of the suffering was
done by my family and other good people who were probably a lot
more worried for me than I ever was worried for myself,'' he said
in an interview. ``I had the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reinhart acknowledged, his ordeal was arduous,
occasionally scary, and often bizarre. ``No one pointed a gun to my
head, no one directly threatened to kill me,'' he said, stressing
that he was well treated by his captors. ``But my life was always
in danger because of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After a treacherous night march along a muddy mountain track to
the rebel hideaway, Reinhart's main enemy was boredom. ``I read
what little there was to read. I did situps and pushups. I worked
on improving my Spanish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed to keep his camera, for which the young rebels
liked to pose clownishly, one donning a brassiere and vamping for
the lens. He taught his captors how to play the card game Crazy
Eights. He subsisted on beans and rice. He lost weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I worried that my family was worried about me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The strange saga started on June 24 when Leonard, site manager
for Reinhart's Ontario-based company, Terramundo Drilling Inc., was
captured at the exploratory gold mine in the Angostura region.
Terramundo was the drilling subcontractor for a British Columbia
mining company, Greystar Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was sick with anguish, he felt a powerful sense of
being responsible for his employees,'' said Casey Reinhart.
</P>
<P>
   Over the vehement objections of Canada's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Reinhart used intermediaries to strike a deal with the
rebels: Surrender the employee, get the boss. Canadian officials
warned that the scheme was far too dangerous and that it was the
Colombian government's responsibility to secure Leonard's release.
</P>
<P>
   When the dramatic human tradeoff was made in the mountain pass
near the Venezuela border, it marked the first time Leonard had met
his boss. Reinhart had hired him, on the basis of a phone
interview, just a week before the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   After the switch, the rebels demanded $2 million for Reinhart's
release. According to Canadian press reports, the ransom was
lowered after negotiations involving the Catholic church, the
Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, and
Greystar. Canadian officials insisted they played no role in the
payoff, which reportedly came from the coffers of Terramundo.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping is commonplace in Colombia, with 2,200 abductions
officially tallied last year in the violence-torn country,
including the seizure of 58 foreigners. Many kidnappings are the
work of rebels using ransom to finance their guerrilla operations.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart said his youthful captors never offered a detailed
explanataion of their political agenda, although they seemed
committed to some sort of socialist revolution meant to win
agrarian reforms for Colombian peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife and children, Reinhart was greeted in
Toronto by his sister, Celeste Reinhart, who helped turn his
abduction into a Canadian cause celebre. A letter-writing campaign
by schoolchidren increased the pressure on bureaucrats in Ottawa
and Bogota to press for his release.
</P>
<P>
   The drilling company owner was freed early Saturday morning.
After making his way to the city of Bucamaranga, Reinhart first
phoned his wife then placed a 7 a.m. call to Ed Leonard in
Creswell, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best wake-up I've ever had,'' said Leonard. ``He's
the man who saved my life.''

COMMENTARY: FAMILY VALUES STALKERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This huge organization that has tons and tons of money keeps
targeting our family,'' said Jon Galluccio when he contacted me
over New Year's weekend. ``It's scary. The fear comes that one of
their followers will be even more fanatical and take it one step
further ...''
</P>
<P>
   Galluccio is half of a gay suburban couple that has made
headlines over the past two years by successfully challenging the
New Jersey law that limited joint adoption exclusively to married
couples; in 1997 he and his partner won their court battle to
legally adopt an HIV-positive crack baby to whom they had been
foster parents, and they're currently in the process of adopting
two other needy children. The ``huge organization'' to which he
refers is the Family Research Council, the powerful
Washington-based ``family values'' outfit that has made a cause out
of both ``healing'' and decrying gay people and has spawned a
likely GOP presidential candidate, Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Galluccio nervous is a series of references
singling out his family _ six since last May, the most recent
appearing Christmas week _ in the council's Internet ``Culture
Facts'' newsletter. It's the same weekly publication that _ as I
reported here last month _ disseminated misleading statistics
demonizing lesbian couples as preponderantly violent. The council
has called the Galluccios' union ``twisted'' and labeled them among
``the bad of 1998'' for proselytizing for gay civil rights with a
Web site and public appearances. It's typical right-wing
boilerplate, but that doesn't calm Jon Galluccio's nerves. ``If
they have a problem with us being activists and gay poster parents,
as they put it, that's fine,'' he says. ``But don't put our kids in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Matthew Shepard murder, Bauer and his
many moneyed allies in the family-values crusade have strenuously
argued that there is no connection between their political rhetoric
_ which is, after all, protected by the First Amendment _ and
gay-bashing. But in making the case that their words have no
consequences they must contradict their own repeated argument that
outspoken gay people, whether Galluccio or Ellen DeGeneres, foment
a ``dangerous homosexual life style.'' They also must ignore FBI
statistics that show a 9.5 percent rise in hate crimes due to
sexual orientation bias from '96 to '97 even as the rate of serious
crimes fell by 2 percent. And they must ignore history. It was when
Father Coughlin's conservative radio broadcasts turned explicitly
anti-Semitic in 1938 that small groups of violent, unstable thugs
formed something called the Christian Front and started brawling
with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   What is the right's modern obsession with homosexuality? Why do
organizations like the Family Research Council spend fortunes on
ads aspiring to ``heal'' gay people who are not sick? Last week
Bauer even made a gratuitous appearance at a rally in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, in a failed effort to defeat a city civil-rights ordinance
that protects gay people from job and housing discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this obsession may be due to fear and bigotry. Some of
it is take-no-prisoners culture war: Gay people are among the
designated scapegoats for all that the right hates about the '60s
in general and Bill Clinton in particular. And possibly some of it
is pathological. From Roy Cohn to the Jesse Helms political
consultant Arthur Finkelstein, some vitriolic right-wing exploiters
of homophobia have turned out to be gay themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, it's hard to see the moral profit in
vilifying people like Galluccio, who has helped give a home to sick
children. It's also hard to see why his family threatens any other
family. Might not the reverse be true? Such is the eloquent case
made by a reader _ Keith Thompson, a freelance writer in Petaluma,
Calif. _ who sent me an e-mail just before Christmas as he awaited
the birth of his first child. ``I keep doing my best to take
seriously the notion that `family values' and `the rights of people
of faith' are and must be diminished by the fact that some gays and
lesbians wish to marry, practice monogamy, raise children,'' he
wrote. ``But each time I check my heart, gut and mind, I keep
finding that my faith in God and my appreciation for family are in
fact deepened and strengthened by knowing that other people who
aren't straight/white/married have similar aspirations.''

DEAL NEAR ON STEAM PLANT AT PLANNED STADIUM SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last remaining obstacle to the New England
Patriots' move to Hartford, Conn. is close to being cleared as
Connecticut officials are nearing an agreement on relocating a
steam plant on the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and
cools many of Hartford's buildings, is considering a partnership
with another power producer, allowing its facility _ now sitting on
what would be the 50-yard line _ to be demolished without
disrupting heating and cooling service downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away from the planned stadium site sits the
quasi-public Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority plant, which
burns all of the garbage from 64 towns in the state and produces
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   CTG could buy steam from the CRRA plant, which makes more than
five times the amount of steam as the facility on the proposed
stadium site, to do the job. If that plan falls through, the state
could take the CTG site by eminent domain and reimburse the company
for its value.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the quasi-public agency say they could run steam
lines from their plant to the site, where they could connect with
existing CTG lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer the energy deal,'' said Lynn Blackwell,
spokeswoman for CTG Resources Inc. ``Negotiations are continuing .
. . and they're going very well. The meetings are cordial and
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the energy deal could be completed by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   CRRA president Robert Wright also said the best deal for
everyone was for his agency to sell power to CTG.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to pay a price to make it now,'' Wright said,
referring to CTG's steam. ``They can pay us to make it for them.
That's the easiest deal. Other things are being talked about and
it's everything from someone coming in and buying them to someone
coming in and condemning them.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-term energy agreement between the two power producers
would be lucrative for CTG, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line on it is, one way or another, the plant is
going to be removed,'' he added, ``and the stadium is going to be
built and we're just talking about the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Connecticut Governor John Rowland signed the
legislation that funds the $374 million open-air stadium, leaving
two other details to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Natinal Football League owners need to approve the
move, which they are expected to do at their next meeting,
tentatively scheduled for Jan. 28 in Miami. An alternate date for a
vote is Feb. 16 in Atlanta. Twenty-four of the 31 owners must vote
yes to allow the relocation, according to league spokesman Greg
Aiello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the owners, but we don't see any major roadblocks
at this time,'' Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lengthy and complex development agreement between
Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the state needs to be completed.
The development agreement will include the original memorandum of
understanding reached by Kraft and Rowland and the legislation
passed by the Connecticut General Assembly Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The document was due to be finished Friday, but could take
another week before all the details are put in writing, people
familiar with the deal say.

WITNESSES RAISE RISK FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton's lawyers released a 13-page
rebuttal this week to impeachment charges, they repeatedly cited
testimony by Monica S. Lewinsky to back up their assertion that the
president did not commit perjury or obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the White House is vehemently fighting any
chance that Lewinsky and other witnesses might testify at the
impeachment trial. The reason, legal experts said, is that putting
a witness on the stand is one of the riskiest maneuvers a trial
lawyer can make _ and the risk here is that it might turn the case
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some damning new facts that could come out if
witnesses were called,'' said former federal prosecutor Robert
Ullmann of Boston. And it is not just Lewinsky who might provide a
revealing new fact. Referring to other possible witnesses, Ullmann
said, ``I don't think we know everything that Bill Clinton and (his
friend) Vernon Jordan said to each other. I don't think we know
everything Clinton said to (his secretary) Betty Currie. So, of
course, at a trial, new damning facts could come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe said every potential
witness is a ``walking time bomb.'' While lawyers would try to
defuse the possible explosions in depositions taken before
witnesses testified before the Senate, there is always a chance the
bomb will blow up in the face of the prosecution or defense, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, asked why they are so adamantly opposed
to putting Lewinsky on the stand, responded that her testimony is
unnecessary and would prolong the trial. Many Democrats, meanwhile,
have said they want to avoid a public discussion of the tawdry
details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you go down that path'' of witnesses, ``you introduce the
uncertainty that is the overriding consideration,'' said lawyer
James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special counsel's
office. Asked whether the White House was concerned that new
testimony from Lewinsky might hurt the president's case, Kennedy
said he couldn't respond to such a question.
</P>
<P>
   But former federal prosecutors said the White House has much to
fear from Lewinsky and other potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Attorney Joseph diGenova, a Republican who has been
critical of the president, said Lewinsky and other possible
witnesses not only could hurt the president's case, but also could
hurt the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that any of these witnesses could be dangerous for
either side,'' diGenova said. ``There are too many variables that
play here to be predicting who is going to be good for whom. In a
matter like this where the stakes are very high, people might feel
pressure far more than in an ordinary judicial proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky clearly would be the star witness of the case. While
the House managers have said they don't plan to ask her about the
details of her sexual relationship with Clinton, they would like to
ask her whether she and the president agreed on a plan to obstruct
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky is an absolutely critical person to have as a
witness,'' said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, a House
manager who is expected to prepare Lewinsky for the trial if she is
called as a witness. ``You can't have a trial in the true sense of
the word without a witness, and yes, I would like to have her.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said while the White House frequently cites Lewinsky's
testimony that no one told her to lie, her full testimony makes
clear that she and the president ``had an arrangement to lie about
their relationship to anybody. They went over their cover stories.
All she said was he didn't explicitly say, `lie in the affidavit.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The two other most important witnesses, according to the House
managers, would be Currie and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Currie would be questioned about whether Clinton sought to
influence her grand jury testimony and whether he told her to
retrieve gifts he gave to Lewinsky. Currie has denied being
involved in any effort to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe, who believes Clinton should not have been impeached, said
Currie potentially is as important a witness as Lewinsky. In a
much-discussed exchange with Currie, the president seemed to ask
his secretary to affirm that he was not alone with Lewinsky.
According to the report from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr,
Currie said Clinton made the following comments to her:
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always there when she was there, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never really alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see and hear everything, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified that he wasn't trying to get Currie to change
her story, but instead was trying to refresh his memory. Currie
also said the president was not trying to get her to change her
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said Currie's testimony could be crucial because Clinton's
comments ``on the face of it don't sound like attempts to get
information, they sound like attempts to get her to change her
testimony. So presumably the House managers will try to undermine
her ultimate conclusion that she did not understand the president
to be attempting to make an effort to shape any testimony she might
eventually give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very serious risk that the way she explains
everything will end up negating the testimony she did give to the
grand jury, which was exculpatory'' for Clinton, Tribe said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan likely would be questioned about whether he worked with
Clinton to get Lewinsky to deny the sexual relationship with the
president. Jordan also would be questioned about his help to get
Lewinsky a job, including arranging an interview at Revlon Corp.
Jordan has said he helped Lewinsky as he would help other young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, like most of the possible witnesses, remains on good
terms with the president. Thus, the prosecution team has to weigh
whether it is worthwhile putting witnesses on the stand who could
try to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible witnesses include: former White House deputy
chief of staff Harold Ickes, one of Clinton's closest advisers;
Dick Morris, who conducted a poll for the president in an effort to
determine whether the public would forgive adultery; Robert
Bennett, the president's lawyer in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit; Linda R. Tripp, who secretly tape recorded her
conversations with Lewinsky; Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent
who worked with Tripp; White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal, who
was told by Clinton that Lewinsky was known as a stalker; and
Starr, who testified before the House Judiciary Committee about his
report.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clearly Lewinsky's possible testimony that is driving
the debate over whether to allow witnesses. While she is the center
of the case, she is also the enigma. She has been heard on the
Tripp tapes and her lengthy testimony before the grand jury has
been released in transcripts, but she has never been seen
explaining her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the president would probably lose with Lewinsky,''
Ullmann said. ``It is highly unlikely that she would provide
exculpatory evidence, but she could say something that dug his hole
even deeper. So his lawyers would rather pick and choose her words
from among the thousands of Starr's report.''

 &HT;    UGA's Jones will look for redemption against Vanderbilt
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ For Jumaine Jones, the best thing about his
0-for-7 shooting performance against Florida on Sunday is that he
gets to play again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's all-star forward, who remains the SEC's leading
scorer, was held to just three points in the 72-62 loss to the
Gators. So he'll be looking for redemption tonight when Vanderbilt
visits Stegeman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most players, when you have a game like that, the next
game you're thinking about getting it going again,'' said Jones,
who is averaging 19.5 points a game. ``I just need to concentrate
on playing defense and getting rebounds, and the rest of it will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Florida game, Jones had scored 18 or more points
eight games in a row and had recorded double-figure rebounds in
seven of them. But he had just five rebounds against the Gators,
despite playing 39 minutes, and he also committed four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida concentrated on Jumaine the whole game,'' Georgia
coach Ron Jirsa. ``You can see that when you look at how our other
inside guys were doing: Badi (Oliver) was 4-for-5, Robb (Dryden)
was 2-for-2, (Jon) Nordin was 2-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a broken, open-floor game, and it's hard to get
the ball to him out of our regular sets. But I thought J.J. was
very encouraging to the rest of his teammates. He knows how that
game was played, and I think he's ready to come back and play
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps of more concern to Georgia than Jones' performance is
its play against the zone. Florida's switch to a zone played havoc
with Georgia the last five minutes of their game Sunday. The
Bulldogs can only hope that they have made drastic improvements in
the three days since, because they're liable to see 40 minutes of
zone against Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia seemed to go catatonic against the Gators' zone, turning
the ball over five times and missing two three-point attempts in
the final three minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I would say we're a pretty good team against the
zone; we just didn't do a good job against Florida,'' Jirsa said.
``We're a pretty good three-point-shooting team and (have) some
guys that can penetrate. We just have to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Florida, the zone is not a novelty defense for the
Commodores. They depend on it, almost to a fault. Coach Jan van
Breda Kolff was criticized by some for sticking with the zone too
long in a 73-57 loss to Kentucky on Saturday. The Wildcats had a
field day, shooting 58 percent from three-point range, 14 of 24,
and making 15 of 16 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt is led by forward Dan Langhi, one of the SEC's
leading scorers with a 16.1 average. But the 6-11 junior forward is
in a rut similar to Jones'. He was held to four and five points,
respectively, in the Commodores last two games, against Florida and
Kentucky, making just 4-of-23 shots.

FOR CHICAGO, A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Inside Michael Jordan's Restaurant, there is a
basketball under glass, signed not by him but by one of his many
supporting players, guard Steve Kerr. The inscription, meant as a
joke, reads: ``Michael Who?''
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thought of Life After Michael, of the day when
some young basketball fan might ask that very question, swept
through this city like a cold wind down the Magnificent Mile as
news spread that the Bulls superstar would announce his retirement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the loss of Jordan will damage the reeling NBA and
his sponsors, nowhere will the effects be felt as profoundly as
here in Chicago, which has embraced him as not just an athlete but
a soaring symbol of the best of this storied city.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that kept haunting Chicago Tuesday was that this
retirement was for real _ as opposed to his respite five years ago
_ and Bulls boosters would soon suffer the fate of Celtic fans
after the loss of Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even think about how this city is going to
feel,'' moaned Eddie Rodriguez, bartender at Michael Jordan's
Restaurant. ``You're up, up for so long, feeling like champions,
and then you're Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is one more year,'' said cab driver Masook Malik.
Then, sheepishly, he admitted, ``If we got that, yeah, we'll
probably want one more and one more after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The laments echoed throughout Chicago Tuesday, but nowhere were
they heard more plaintively than in Jordan's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the roof is adorned by a huge basketball, and banners
on the building trumpet Jordan's feats. Inside are hundreds of
photos, most of Jordan, but also of celebrities from Oprah to Frank
Sinatra, as well as framed copies of the Wheaties cereal boxes on
which Jordan appeared. There also is a warmup jacket from the
Harlem Globetrotters, a fitting tribute to the basketball showmen
whose skills Jordan emulated, then exceeded, and who for decades
were barred from professional league play because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flocked to the LaSalle Street eatery hoping for a glimpse
of the flying wonder (he was nowhere in sight) or just wanting to
eat Michael's Smoked BBQ Chicken ($14.99) while watching the giant
screen behind the bar, where Jordan highlights play in a continuous
loop.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Paz and Cholo Nunez were on the last day of a three-day
trip to Chicago, and they couldn't bear the thought of leaving
without paying homage to the most famous athlete in their native
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody at home is a Bulls fan,'' said Nunez, nursing a beer
at the bar. ``Our whole country will become sad by his leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's gift shop did a brisk business Tuesday as fans
scooped up Jordan T-shirts, sweatshirts, sunglasses, and even his
signature cologne, which was on sale for half price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little somber, but we're happy for him if this is
what he wants,'' said Laura Foxgrover, the restaurant's director of
marketing. ``Maybe we'll get to see him here a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been down a bit, she said, as a result of the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordan fans tried to put a brave face on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction is he is going to join the Blackhawks,'' said
Sharon Clark of Detroit. ``He'll prove that a black man can become
the greatest hockey player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion, David Mertens, thought even bigger: ``If Jesse
Ventura can be a governor, how could Michael Jordan not become
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Though most fans were focused on Jordan, a few sought to find a
villain in Bulls vice president Jerry Krause, with whom Jordan
feuded at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be the most hated man in Chicago, I guarantee you
that,'' said Joe Leahy, an information systems manager from
suburban Palatine who has a small shrine to Jordan in his den.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement dominated local sports radio and television,
where news anchors and sports reporters nearly ran out of
superlatives to describe Jordan. Reporters even brought up the
subject at an economic development news conference, where Mayor
Richard M. Daley wished Jordan the ``best of health'' and said the
people of Chicago should be excited for their hero as he enters a
new phase of life.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Jordan fans expressed sadness, few said the news
took them by surprise. A few even said Jordan had made the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Neil Fiorito, a bellhop in a
downtown hotel. ``A classy guy like him should go out in style, as
a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Others held onto hope, however faint, that Jordan would reverse
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll retire yet,'' said cab driver Ivan Matis.
``He's too involved in it, loves it too much, to leave. At least I
hope so.''

SHOE STORE OWNERS BATTLE NINE WEST OVER PRICING SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Fla.l, Texas, N.Y.) (bl) 
By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Polites, owner of a Nine West store in New Jersey, slashed
the price of a popular, smart-looking women's shoe last winter,
knowing he would attract many more customers _ and still earn a
smooth 60 percent profit on each pair.
</P>
<P>
   But Polites' sale irritated some managers at large department
stores down the hall in the Mall at Short Hills. One Nordstrom
manager, he said, walked into Polites' small store, picked some
shoes off the shelf, looked at the prices, slammed them down and
left without a word.
</P>
<P>
   Polites said the Nordstrom manager later explained that the
flats that Polites had reduced to $49.99 from $60 were included on
a confidential list of styles _ known as the ``off-limits list'' _
whose prices Nine West Group Inc. rarely, if ever, lets stores mark
down.
</P>
<P>
   Polites' low prices also maddened executives at Nine West, the
footwear giant that says it sells one out of every five pairs of
shoes sold to women in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West chief executive Vincent Camuto called Polites
(pronounced po-LEE-tus) and demanded that he end his sale. When
Polites refused, Camuto told him that in that case, ``We can't ship
you those shoes.'' Polites taped his phone conversations with
Camuto and other Nine West executives because, he said, he felt his
store, which sells only Nine West shoes, was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   He and two other owners of small Nine West stores, who have
fought with the company over other business issues before, say the
incident helped them solve a puzzle they had been piecing together
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to information gathered by the three store
owners, is that for years, Nine West and major department stores in
the United States, which sell millions of pairs of the company's
shoes, have worked together in an elaborate and secret system that
almost guarantees that women, no matter how many stores they shop
in, will always find the same prices for most Nine West styles.
</P>
<P>
   The store owners say they have talked to regulators at the
Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the antitrust laws, about
the pricing practices and have given them copies of the so-called
off-limits list, as well as memos by Nine West employees and tapes
of phone conversations with Nine West executives.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Bedol, Nine West's general counsel, said, ``We have been
cooperating fully with the Federal Trade Commission and intend to
continue our cooperation,'' adding that ``we do not anticipate that
the preliminary inquiry will result in a material adverse effect on
the company.'' He said the company would not comment further on its
pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   According to the store owners' information, the system works
like this: Nine West and some department stores agree on minimum
prices; Nine West employees patrol all stores to insure that prices
are not lowered; if a department store finds another store charging
prices below the minimums, it complains to Nine West; and Nine West
warns stores that shipments will be delayed or even ended if prices
are too low.
</P>
<P>
   If Nine West stopped enforcing the minimums and allowed stores
to compete on price, women would almost surely find lower prices,
saving as much as $10 or more on many styles. Nine West prices most
of its shoes from $50 to $90 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   So are Nine West's pricing practices illegal? That is not clear.
Ken Peterson, a lawyer in Wichita, Kan., who represented the three
store owners last year, wrote a letter to Nine West in February
saying he believed that its practices violated federal antitrust
laws. Peterson's letter received no response.
</P>
<P>
   And Peterson warned his clients, who all still have Nine West
shoes marked down, not to acquiesce to company demands that they
raise prices. If they did, Peterson said, they themselves could be
found guilty of conspiring to fix minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor who is an
antitrust expert, said it is illegal for a distributor and a
company that sells its products to agree on minimum retail prices,
though it is legal for a distributor to demand that its price list
be followed. The federal laws are technical and ambiguous,
Hovenkamp said, and they have been weakened over the years by court
decisions. He said it was unclear whether Nine West and the
department stores were breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the legalities, the details unearthed by the three
small store owners offer a rare glimpse into just how far some
retail companies and department stores will go to keep shoppers
from finding better prices elsewhere. The details also show just
how quietly Nine West and the department stores have stepped to try
to keep the pricing practices private.
</P>
<P>
   The three store owners, who also include Richard Reichle, owner
of a Nine West store in the Galleria in Houston, and Sandy Ruback,
who owns one in the Dadeland Mall in Miami, said they decided to
talk about what they had found after more than 10 years of buying
shoes from Nine West because they were bitter and frustrated with
the way the company repeatedly made their day-to-day operations
difficult. The three became partners in a joint venture with Nine
West in 1984, and recently filed an arbitration complaint against
the company over the prices it was charging their stores for shoes.
In that case, arbitrators awarded the three stores $4.5 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nine West's current objections to his sale price,
Polites said the company was continuing to ship him shoes, though
sometimes they were delayed. Reichle (pronounced RYE-cul), who said
he had also been told by Nine West employees to raise his prices,
said the company was delaying shipments to his Houston store.
Ruback said he had experienced no delays.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC lawyer said it was the commission's policy to neither
confirm nor deny whether it was investigating a specific company.
</P>
<P>
   Several department store companies, including Nordstrom Inc. and
Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's
and other stores, said they had strict policies prohibiting any
agreements with a manufacturer or competitor on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Broderick, general counsel for Federated, said he was not
aware of any meetings between Federated and Nine West at which
minimum prices might have been agreed on. He said that Nine West
asks department stores to follow the price list, and that if they
do, Nine West gives them financial incentives or discounts for
expenses like advertising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They say if you want our promotional assistance, you'll get it
if you follow this pricing,'' Broderick said, adding that this was
a common practice between many companies and department stores.
``This is not price-fixing,'' Broderick said.
</P>
<P>
   (The store owners say that in addition to financial help with
promotions, Nine West has agreed to take back unsold shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for May Department Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP;
Taylor and other department stores that carry Nine West products,
declined to comment on the pricing issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., caters mostly to women
who do not want to pay $100 to $200 for a pair of designer shoes,
yet do not want to buy the cheaper shoes offered by discount
stores.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs low, the company buys most of its shoes from
factories in Brazil and China, where labor and leather are cheaper
than in the United States or Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, it acquired the footwear business of United States Shoe
Corp.; it now offers 12 brands and takes up large sections of the
women's shoe departments at major department stores. The brands _
Nine West, Enzo Angiolini, Easy Spirit, Evan Picone, Selby,
Pappagallo, Bandolino, Amalfi, 9 &AMP; Co., Calvin Klein, Calico and
Westies _ are marketed individually, and women may not know they
are buying two pairs from the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shoes
to department stores each year. While it does not disclose sales to
each store, it did say in its 1997 annual report that Federated was
its largest wholesale customer, making up 12 percent of its net
revenues, or about $224 million.
</P>
<P>
   With such large purchases from Nine West, the department stores
have grown increasingly dependent on the company, and any shipping
cutoffs or delays would quickly eat into their profits.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Nine West has also built hundreds of its own
retail stores. In many shopping malls, Nine West's stores are
located near the department stores, making the shoe company and the
big stores direct competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West wholly owns most of its retail stores. The exceptions
are the very few stores, like those owned by the three store
owners, that it operates through joint ventures with partners.
</P>
<P>
   It also sells millions of shoes at wholesale prices to
independent shoe stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to information the three store owners have gathered
and their sworn affidavits detailing the discussions they have had
with more than a dozen Nine West employees, Nine West's pricing
system involves several steps.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Nine West displays its new styles at shows in New
York City and Las Vegas. Through the years, the three store
managers have found, Nine West's sample shoes at the shows often
have no suggested retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the store owners asked about this, they said, they were
told by several Nine West employees that representatives from the
company and the department stores would later meet to discuss the
shoes and to agree on prices. At those private meetings, the
``off-limits,'' or ``protected,'' list is drawn up, Nine West
employees have told the store owners.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the minimum prices on dozens of styles. It
also includes the specific dates, if ever, that the shoes can be
put on sale and what the minimum sale price should be.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the lists, dating back several years, show that some
of the company's most popular styles have had similar minimum
prices for years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the shoe that Polites had put on sale _ the Liberty
style, sold under the Enzo Angiolini brand _ has been priced at
$59.99 to $62 for as long as eight years, Reichle said.
</P>
<P>
   Three major department stores in New York City _ Macy's,
Bloomingdale's and Lord &AMP; Taylor _ are selling the Liberty at
either $59.99 or $59.98.
</P>
<P>
   While women may find sales on shoes in shades of purple or
green, the prices of the company's most popular shoes in the most
sought-after colors _ black, brown and navy _ rarely fall below the
minimums.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reichle's sworn affidavit, in February 1997, at a
shoe show in Las Vegas, Maura Martin, a Nine West analyst,
described a ``wrap-up'' meeting that she said was attended by Nine
West employees and some department stores. ``The purpose of the
meeting is to finalize the wholesale cost, suggested retail price
and the off-limits list for all Nine West Group products and
lines,'' Ms. Martin told Reichle and Ruback, according to Reichle's
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   When the two men asked Ms. Martin what would happen if a
department store did not follow the off-limits list, she replied,

   Reichle said he did not believe that Nine West's current pricing
practices were good for its bottom line or its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   He said his lower prices helped him sell more shoes last year
and make more in profits, which he shares with Nine West, than in
any year since his store opened. In comparison, Nine West reported
last month that sales at its own retail stores were slipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never made business sense,'' Reichle said, ``but yet the
madness continues to march on.''

FOR CHICAGO, A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Inside Michael Jordan's Restaurant, there is a
basketball under glass, signed not by him but by one of his many
supporting players, guard Steve Kerr. The inscription, meant as a
joke, reads: ``Michael Who?''
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thought of Life After Michael, of the day when
some young basketball fan might ask that very question, swept
through this city like a cold wind down the Magnificent Mile as
news spread that the Bulls superstar would announce his retirement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the loss of Jordan will damage the reeling NBA and
his sponsors, nowhere will the effects be felt as profoundly as
here in Chicago, which has embraced him as not just an athlete but
a soaring symbol of the best of this storied city.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that kept haunting Chicago Tuesday was that this
retirement was for real _ as opposed to his respite five years ago
_ and Bulls boosters would soon suffer the fate of Celtic fans
after the loss of Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even think about how this city is going to
feel,'' moaned Eddie Rodriguez, bartender at Michael Jordan's
Restaurant. ``You're up, up for so long, feeling like champions,
and then you're Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is one more year,'' said cab driver Masook Malik.
Then, sheepishly, he admitted, ``If we got that, yeah, we'll
probably want one more and one more after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The laments echoed throughout Chicago Tuesday, but nowhere were
they heard more plaintively than in Jordan's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the roof is adorned by a huge basketball, and banners
on the building trumpet Jordan's feats. Inside are hundreds of
photos, most of Jordan, but also of celebrities from Oprah to Frank
Sinatra, as well as framed copies of the Wheaties cereal boxes on
which Jordan appeared. There also is a warmup jacket from the
Harlem Globetrotters, a fitting tribute to the basketball showmen
whose skills Jordan emulated, then exceeded, and who for decades
were barred from professional league play because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flocked to the LaSalle Street eatery hoping for a glimpse
of the flying wonder (he was nowhere in sight) or just wanting to
eat Michael's Smoked BBQ Chicken ($14.99) while watching the giant
screen behind the bar, where Jordan highlights play in a continuous
loop.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Paz and Cholo Nunez were on the last day of a three-day
trip to Chicago, and they couldn't bear the thought of leaving
without paying homage to the most famous athlete in their native
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody at home is a Bulls fan,'' said Nunez, nursing a beer
at the bar. ``Our whole country will become sad by his leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's gift shop did a brisk business Tuesday as fans
scooped up Jordan T-shirts, sweatshirts, sunglasses, and even his
signature cologne, which was on sale for half price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little somber, but we're happy for him if this is
what he wants,'' said Laura Foxgrover, the restaurant's director of
marketing. ``Maybe we'll get to see him here a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been down a bit, she said, as a result of the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordan fans tried to put a brave face on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction is he is going to join the Blackhawks,'' said
Sharon Clark of Detroit. ``He'll prove that a black man can become
the greatest hockey player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion, David Mertens, thought even bigger: ``If Jesse
Ventura can be a governor, how could Michael Jordan not become
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Though most fans were focused on Jordan, a few sought to find a
villain in Bulls vice president Jerry Krause, with whom Jordan
feuded at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be the most hated man in Chicago, I guarantee you
that,'' said Joe Leahy, an information systems manager from
suburban Palatine who has a small shrine to Jordan in his den.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement dominated local sports radio and television,
where news anchors and sports reporters nearly ran out of
superlatives to describe Jordan. Reporters even brought up the
subject at an economic development news conference, where Mayor
Richard M. Daley wished Jordan the ``best of health'' and said the
people of Chicago should be excited for their hero as he enters a
new phase of life.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Jordan fans expressed sadness, few said the news
took them by surprise. A few even said Jordan had made the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Neil Fiorito, a bellhop in a
downtown hotel. ``A classy guy like him should go out in style, as
a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Others held onto hope, however faint, that Jordan would reverse
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll retire yet,'' said cab driver Ivan Matis.
``He's too involved in it, loves it too much, to leave. At least I
hope so.''

JAPAN INTERVENES TO PUSH YEN DOWN, BOOST TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (nk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese central bank intervened in the currency markets
Tuesday, selling yen for dollars and sending the currency down 3
percent, its biggest one-day loss in more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention was an acknowledgment by Japan that the rising
value of the yen, up 31 percent since August, is making its
faltering effort to turn the economy around even more difficult. A
strong yen is damaging because it makes Japanese exports, a
possible engine of recovery, much more expensive, and therefore,
less competitive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the intervention is going to stop the yen's rise and
the dollar's decline is unclear. Many traders think that the yen
will have to rally a little further _ and the dollar slip lower _
before there is a turnaround. That means the Bank of Japan, the
nation's central bank, will probably have to intervene again.
Whether the United States will join in, as it did this past June,
is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Japanese currency intervention after a meeting
with President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin would not comment directly. But he did say, ``I'll
just repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong dollar has
served us well and our dollar policy is absolutely unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Avinash Persaud, global head of currency research at J.P Morgan
Securities in London, said that two forces were moving the two
currencies and that they were both generally negative for the
dollar and positive for the yen.
</P>
<P>
   One is Japan's current-account surplus with the United States,
reflecting trade in merchandise and services. The surplus has
Japanese businesses turning more dollars from trade back into yen,
strengthening the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor is that large institutional investors are
sitting on their hands, refusing to take a position against the yen
even though the economic fundamentals, including Japan's weak
economy, low interest rates and poor prospects, point to a weaker
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as investors stay away, the current account will push
the yen higher and the central bank will still have to intervene,''
Persaud said, adding that he expected the yen to reach 105 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials did not confirm the intervention publicly but
made comments that seemed to indicate they had intervened. Several
currency traders, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
central bank did intervene. The total sales, they said, ranged from
$2 billion to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They said the intervention began in Tokyo trading and carried
over into trading in London. It came after the dollar fell to a
28-month low against the yen of 108.93 on Monday. But in late
trading in New York, the dollar rose 3.2 percent, to 112.43.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention, some traders said, was done through foreign
banks, which might have been intended to send a stronger signal
about the government's desire to at least slow the yen's rally.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that the Bank of Japan had intervened to
reduce the value of the yen since April 1996. Along with the
Federal Reserve system, the bank pulled off a surprise intervention
in June to support the yen when it was approaching a level of 150.
At the time, many analysts were worried that a weaker yen would
cause a currency devaluation by China, aggravating an already
troubling international economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China held its ground, but the yen did not really begin to rally
until August, when Russia effectively defaulted on its debt and
devalued its currency, setting off fears of a wider and deeper
financial crisis. Hedge funds and others who had lost money in
Russia and other emerging markets began selling dollars and buying
yen to lock in the big profits they had made betting against the
yen. This selling snowballed, forcing others to sell and all of a
sudden the yen was too strong, not too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Persaud said there were now signs of the selling of dollars for
yen by long-term institutional investors, like pension funds, which
had held on during the speculative selling by hedge funds. This
selling by long-term investors, Persaud said, may have been one of
the factors that truly worried Japanese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at
BankBoston, expects the yen to lose value against the dollar over
the next several months because Japan's economy is so weak and its
rescue process is so haphazard.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that in the short term the yen would
most likely rally and the dollar would fall. ``We are expecting
another test of 110 yen and below,'' he said. ``People want to see
some action'' from the Japanese before changing their view.
</P>
<P>
   In trading in Europe, the dollar slipped slightly against the
new euro, although the euro is proving to have a weaker start than
many analysts had expected. The euro was worth $1.15550 Tuesday,
compared with $1.15420 on Monday.

 &HT;    Falcons report: History of wins on Vikings side
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Longtime Falcons fans would probably prefer the team's
first NFC Championship Game be played somewhere other than
Minnesota. Atlanta is 1-10 on the road against the Vikings, winning
only in 1966, the first year of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   That woeful record includes a 30-24 payoff loss on Jan. 9, 1983,
the Vikings' first season in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of corporate development Tommy Nobis, the first
Falcon ever drafted, was a rookie middle linebacker on the only
Atlanta team to win in the Great White North. When the Falcons won
20-13 on Dec. 4, 1966, it was the team's second win ever.
</P>
<P>
   Old Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, outside the Twin Cities
could be a brutal place in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was colder than sin,'' said Nobis, who battled Minnesota
center Mick Tingelhoff that day while chasing quarterback Fran
Tarkenton. ''It had snowed overnight, and the tarp had frozen to
the field. When we got to the stadium, they were panicking, blowing
the hot air underneath that tarp.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobis, who made first-team All-Pro as a rookie, was shocked at
the conditions, marveling over the fact the stands were still
mostly full.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something for a boy from south Texas,'' he said. ''You
couldn't stay warm. You'd put a layer of clear cellophane on your
legs, then analgesic (which gets hot like Ben-Gay), then another
layer of cellophane and pull your socks up over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcon update
</P>
<P>
   Players were off Tuesday, although a few came in for injury
treatment. The most serious continues to be the strained hamstring
of reserve safety Devin Bush. He worked out with trainer Ron
Medlin, but it's not clear if he'll practice today. If Bush is
unable to play Sunday, rookie safety Omar Brown likely would be
activated. Rather than using Brown in nickel and dime defenses, the
Falcons would likely leave starting strong safety William White on
the field. . . . Fullback Bob Christian, who was supposed to have
surgery Tuesday to repair torn ligaments in his left knee, pushed
the surgery back to next week. He still has considerable swelling
in the joint. Plus, he wants to go to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   More great expectations
</P>
<P>
   Terance Mathis' wife, Arnedia, gave birth to a girl, Terae,
Saturday morning, just hours before the Falcons played the 49ers.
At least three other Falcon wives are about to follow suit.
Quarterback Chris Chandler's wife, Diane, is due any day. Also,
defensive end Lester Archambeau's wife, Kathleen, and right guard
Gene Williams' wife, Melissa, are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Money matters
</P>
<P>
   Every Falcon player who has been with the team all season will
get a full playoff share of $15,000 for last Saturday's game
against the 49ers. Each player will earn $32,500 for Sunday's game
at Minnesota. Players on the winning Super Bowl team will get
$53,000 each. Players on the losing Super Bowl team will get
$32,500. All full-time employees of the club, including coaches,
receptionists, etc., will get bonuses to be determined by
management.
</P>
<P>
   Going home
</P>
<P>
   Reserve defensive tackle Esera Tuaolo played for the Vikings
from the middle of the 1992 season through '96, and still makes his
offseason home in St. Paul. That's a story in itself considering
that he is a native of American Samoa who grew up in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find much snow in either of those places, save the
highest points on the island of Hawaii, but Tuaolo loves Minnesota,
and said he doesn't mind the cold, snowy weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way of living up there is cool. It's real relaxed, and
everybody is real nice. That's all I need,'' he said. ''If you like
doing outdoor stuff, and going fishing and hunting . . . that's the
perfect place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Tuaolo's sisters live in the Twin Cities, and he said he
plans to stay there after his career, when he hopes to pursue a
career in music. ''I have great connections there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Craig Sauer played at the University of
Minnesota, with home games in the Metrodome, from 1992-95.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been hard getting tickets for family and friends,'' said
Sauer, a native of Sartell, Minn. ''I would have loved to play this
game in Atlanta in front of our fans, but this will be kind of
neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   This will be the Falcons' ninth straight game in a Dome. They're
11-0 in domes this season. This will be the first-ever championship
game in a dome, and for the first time, a dome team will play in
the Super Bowl. . . . The Falcons (plus-20) and Vikings (plus-14)
were the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the NFL in turnover ratio.
Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock and Falcons cornerback Ray
Buchanan tied for the NFC lead with seven interceptions each. . . .
This will be Falcon coach Dan Reeves' 15th AFC or NFC Championship
Game. He was 0-2 as a player with the Cowboys, 5-3 as an assistant
with Dallas, and 3-1 as head coach of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny on refunds for tickets to this Sunday's
playoff game, which would have been played in Atlanta if Minnesota
lost last Sunday to Arizona. Season ticket holders will be refunded
automatically, either to their credit card or by refund check _
unless they asked in advance that the extra $72 per championship
game ticket be applied toward season tickets next year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who purchased tickets at the Georgia Dome must return
their tickets with a ticket refund form (Atlanta Falcons ticket
office, 1 Georgia Dome Drive, Atlanta, Ga. 30313). Their credit
card will be credited or they will get a refund check. Those who
purchased through the Ticketmaster phone center will be credited by
Ticketmaster, either by credit to charge card or refund check.
Those who purchased at Ticketmaster ticket center must take tickets
back to the point of purchase for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Travel plans
</P>
<P>
   After a light practice Friday morning, the Falcons will board a
charter plane, and depart Hartsfield Airport. The team will return
from Minneapolis Sunday night, arriving at Hartsfield between 8:30
and 10 p.m., later if they win and have to stick around for trophy
presentations and the like. The arrival gate has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take the dome
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was asked if he favored playing in Domes. With the
experience of playing for the Cowboys against the Packers in the
legendary ''Ice Bowl'' on New Year's eve, 1967, his decision was
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had my choice, playing in Green Bay one time, I'd rather
play in the dome,'' he said, remembering the Cowboy's 21-17 loss at
Green Bay's Lambeau Field, when temperatures dropped well below
zero. ''I'd definitely rather coach in a dome.''

   The NHL released the roster Tuesday for the North America team
that will play against the World team on Jan. 24 in Tampa, and
Blake was the only Los Angeles King selected. No Kings player made
the World roster, which was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mighty Ducks, Paul Kariya was selected to the North
American team, and Teemu Selanne will play for the World Team. Both
were voted on to their teams as starters.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Blake, who won the Norris Trophy last season as
the NHL's best defenseman, has 15 points in 23 games this season.
He missed 15 games with a broken foot and three games because of a
suspension. The Kings (15-22-4) are 3-15 when Blake is out of the
lineup, 12-7-4 when he's in the lineup. Blake will be making his
second All-Star appearance.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Robitaille, who scored his 500th
NHL goal last week and is third in the league with 22 goals this
season, also would be selected to play in the All-Star game. Among
those beating out Robitaille for a spot on the team was Montreal's
Mark Recchi, who has eight goals and 21 assists this season.
</P>
<P>
   In other Kings news, the team reassigned defenseman Sean
Blanchard from Mississippi of the East Coast Hockey League to
Springfield of the American Hockey League.

COMMENTARY: THE ABYSS OF DESIRE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Desperate times call for desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the cognoscenti think they've discovered the antidote
to this putrid mess in the nation's capital: a female president.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Elizabeth Dole, Cokie Roberts said: ``After what
we've just been through, I think that women are looking better. The
slogan could be, `I won't embarrass you in front of your
children.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Miller, the comedian, says we would never have to worry
about Madame President summoning Luke the Intern into the ``Oval
Lair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys never pause to ask `What's the downside here?''' he says.
``To Clinton, sex is like a Skinner box. He just keeps ramming his
forehead into the corn kernel plate. Women do have some ability to
extricate themselves from the abyss of desire. They do hover at
that libidinal fail-safe point for a nanosecond. That's why they're
the more evolved species.''
</P>
<P>
   Women were long considered hormonally unsuitable for high office
or combat. Who can forget Newt Gingrich's warning that in war,
women ``have biological problems being in a ditch for 30 days
because they get infections''? The fallen Speaker also noted that
``males are biologically driven to go out and hunt giraffes,''
while women liked to sit still.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is the men who are acting hysterical, and Bill
Clinton and Kenneth Starr who are scratching each other's eyes out
in the catfight of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Women may be affected by lunar tides. But men are total
lunatics. Women are sometimes driven by hormones. But men are
pushed around by them all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prism has turned,'' says Helen Fisher, a Rutgers
anthropologist. ``Instead of regarding females as headless horses,
now males are regarded as headless horses.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a president with a congenital need to get his hand
caught in the cookie jar, so he can be rescued yet again by the
brainy wife he has turned into Mommy Dearest. We have a
``prosecutor'' picking the wings off female bit players. We have a
bunch of House conservatives who can't see their own hypocrisy. We
have Senate bloviators engaged in an orgy of self-congratulation
for their agreement to agree on very little. We have a Supreme
Court chief justice who fails to appreciate the value of basic
black.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the capital has been contaminated by testosterone, why
not try estrogen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe men have recognized that women are better than men,''
mused George Stephanopoulos. ``Or maybe men are arrogant enough to
believe that they don't have to worry about a woman in power
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is an element of wishful thinking when men depict
women as less driven by desire. History has shown that once they
get the power, women can be just as sexually capricious and
demanding as men.
</P>
<P>
   When Bette Davis played Elizabeth I, wasn't she always sending
her lovers off to the Tower of London when they made eyes at her
pretty ladies-in-waiting? Catherine the Great was hardly known for
her restraint. And how about Agrippina or Cleopatra or any of those
other sexually rapacious ancient babes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it touching that they think we are so under control?''
says Helen Fisher. ``But every time a man is sleeping around, he is
sleeping around with a woman. It's basic math that women are 50
percent of the problem here. Men want to delude themselves into
thinking that women are Madonnas and pristine and in control of
their sexuality because men have a terrible fear of cuckoldry.''
</P>
<P>
   Men get in trouble by focusing on gratification. But women don't
stay out of it by focusing on intimacy. Female pols often get
burned on financial issues related to their mates.
</P>
<P>
   As a girlfriend of mine puts it, ``Women make the greatest
mistake of all _trusting in a man in the first place. Who's made
bigger mistakes in judgment _ Hillary or Bill? I say Hillary did.''
If you doubt this, witness Hillary's shelling out $375,000 from her
blind trust to pay off Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian, is not sure whether women
have more purity or less opportunity. ``Women have had a narrower
world,'' she says. ``It would be nice to think women had
internalized such high moral values that we could skip over the
phase of being tempted. But maybe we just haven't evolved to that
point yet.''

JORDAN DEPARTS AGAIN, FOR GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ We have been here before and, like the first time, we
are reluctant to accept reality. Michael Jordan retired once before
and came back. He will retire again Wednesday, supposedly for
keeps.
</P>
<P>
   He is leaving as so few do, on his own terms, at the top of his
game, with his reputation intact, if not enlarged, and with an
indelible closing moment from seven months ago against the Utah
Jazz. He probably could dominate the NBA this year as he did last
year, the year before that, and the year before that. Few doubt he
could come back next fall at the age of 36, fresh and energized,
and maybe do it again.
</P>
<P>
   But we are told that is not to be the case. This is final. A
news conference at the United Center, the arena Jordan helped build
and once vowed he'd never play in, will serve as the farewell. An
era will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had hinted strongly throughout last season that he might
retire. He set conditions under which he might return, one of which
was the return of coach Phil Jackson. When Jackson decided to take
a coaching sabbatical, that seemed to have sealed Jordan's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls held out hope for a change of heart, going so far
as to anoint Jackson's successor, Tim Floyd, with almost every
title except ``head coach.'' For a while, Jordan even showed some
interest in the labor talks with the NBA, challenging Washington
Wizards owner Abe Pollin and exchanging views across a table from
commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   There was scuttlebutt that Jordan was doing this to prop up the
union; if that was the case, he failed, a rarity. The union took a
beating throughout the lockout and then basically settled for the
owners' terms. Jordan avoided a hasty, ill-conceived exhibition
game in Atlantic City as well as a players rally in New York that
turned into a ratification vote on the new agreement. He wasn't
working out with his characteristic zeal and he had converted his
gym at home into a cigar room.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the settlement, word leaked out that Jordan was
indeed finished. A man who chooses his advertising pitches with
great care decided he would not, could not be a part of a league
under attack and one that was playing a truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the end of a 13-year career, minus his minor league
baseball hiatus from 1993-95. It marks the end of the career of
arguably the game's greatest player, someone who was too small (5
feet 9 inches) to make the E.A. Laney High School varsity team in
Wilmington, N.C. Chosen instead was 6-8 LeRoy Smith, who
unwittingly served as an inspiration to Jordan for years.
</P>
<P>
   It was at E.A. Laney that Jordan discovered perhaps his first
hoop idol: a 5-10 senior named James Beatty. Teammates nicknamed
Beatty ``Sputnik'' because of his leaping ability, which naturally
appealed to Jordan. Beatty also wore No. 23, and when he left the
following year, Jordan grabbed it. He wore No. 23 throughout
college and the NBA (save for a brief run with No. 45), and James
Beatty is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   He first burst on the national scene as a freshman at North
Carolina in the NCAA title game against Georgetown, coolly draining
a 15-footer to give coach Dean Smith his first title. He leaves the
national scene in much the same fashion, after draining a 15-footer
against Utah to win Game 6 of the NBA Finals last June and a sixth
title.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up Olympic gold in Los Angeles in 1984 _ the Russians
stayed away, which was just as well _ and then embarked on his NBA
career. It's safe to say no one had an inkling then that he would
turn into the greatest ever. Two teams, the Houston Rockets and
Portland Trail Blazers, bypassed Jordan on draft day for big men,
the Rockets selecting Akeem Olajuwon and the Trail Blazers defying
pressure to take Jordan and settling for Sam Bowie. Portland
already had an athletic guard, Clyde Drexler, and needed a big man.
That was the company line, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Jordan was an acrobat, a logical descendant in the
line of Elgin Baylor, Julius Erving, and Connie Hawkins. He took a
couple of slam-dunk titles early in his career, which seemed
entirely fitting. But he also joined a bad team that stayed
mediocre for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985-86, his second year, Jordan missed most of the season
with a broken bone in his foot. He fought the Bulls to let him come
back before the end of the season, going so far as to wear fake
eyeglasses _ so he would be taken more seriously _ at a meeting
with management.
</P>
<P>
   The brass relented and Jordan was phased in over the last few
weeks of the season. The Bulls claimed the eighth playoff spot and
a first-round matchup with the 67-15 Celtics, probably the greatest
team of all time. Jordan frightened the Celtics with 49 points in
the opener and then nearly beat them single-handedly with a
playoff-record 63 in Game 2, a double-overtime Boston victory.
</P>
<P>
   That was his official coming-out party. At that point, the rest
of the league was on Jordan Alert. He began to assert himself,
making a game-winner against the Cavaliers in the playoffs. In a
game against Utah, he dunked over John Stockton, prompting a fan to
say, ``Why don't you pick on someone your own size?'' He proceeded
to dunk on Mel Turpin and then asked the fan, ``Is he big enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the Bulls got better. When the Celtics dissolved in
1988, Chicago was there to challenge the Detroit Pistons for
Eastern supremacy. The Bulls lost twice in the conference finals
before finally getting over the hump in 1991. What followed was
Jordan's first appearance in the NBA Finals, against the Lakers,
and the ascendancy of a supernova was complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' victory legitimized Jordan's career and thrust him
immediately into icon/rock star/global legend status. Until then,
he was always singularly spectacular, but without a title. There
were questions about how much of a team player he really was, and
he derisively referred to his less talented teammates as his
``supporting cast.'' But he answered those questions and won two
more titles in 1992 and 1993, the latter coming against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Then his father was murdered in North Carolina. There already
had been questions about Jordan's penchant for gambling. He decided
to step away in 1993, saying he wanted to spend more time with his
family. Instead, he gave baseball a shot, but that served only to
kill time.
</P>
<P>
   When labor strife struck baseball in 1994-95, Jordan rejoined
the Bulls. But he wasn't quite himself, and Chicago lost in the
conference semis to Orlando. He promised to come back better than
ever, and he did. The Bulls won 72 games, Jordan won the MVP, and
the Bulls won their fourth title. They won again in 1997, with
Jordan delivering an extraordinary performance in Game 5 in Utah
while battling a stomach bug, and last year, with Jordan stealing
the ball from Karl Malone in the closing seconds and nailing the
game-winner. Jackson called it ``the best performance ever by
Michael Jordan in a critical game in a critical series.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the last shot, but many wish it weren't. NBC
probably would have agreed to hold the Finals in August if Jordan
agreed to come back. Last year regular-season games featuring
Jordan averaged a Nielsen rating of 6.5; non-Jordan games averaged
a 3.8. The four highest-rated NBA Finals games all featured Jordan.
And last year in Atlanta, more than 62,000 fans showed up in the
Georgia Dome to see what they thought might be Jordan's last visit
to their city.
</P>
<P>
   Several players called Tuesday a ``sad day,'' and true
competitors probably were hoping Jordan would return so they could
be the one to dethrone him. You can be sure Larry Bird was itching
to do just that after coming so close last year with his Indiana
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, again, upstaged everyone else. There will be an NBA
champion this year, and while it will be legit _ or as legit as the
winner in a 50-game season can be _ there will be, for a while, the
question of ``what if?''
</P>
<P>
   Now he will call it quits. It's a big deal. All three ESPN
networks are televising the news conference live. ESPNEWS will air
24 hours of Jordan highlights starting at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That will have to do for now. The basketball world again is
saying goodbye to its most electrifying personality and greatest
talent, and maybe it's a good thing we got to do it twice instead
of once.

AS THE ROSTER OF HEALTH INSURERS SHRINKS, COMPLAINTS WIDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ind., Pa., Calif., Ga., Texas, Ill.)  (fe) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The health insurance industry is rapidly whittling itself down
to a few giant companies that dominate the health systems of some
of the country's biggest cities. Critics warn that the trend no
longer is simply a threat to doctors and hospitals. It is
increasingly raising questions about the cost and availability of
care to millions of patients and their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism sharpened after the recent announcements of two
billion-dollar deals that would propel Aetna Inc. to first place
among the nation's health insurers. Last month, Aetna agreed to buy
Prudential Health Care, the No. 5 for-profit managed care company,
while it was still digesting its July purchase of Nylcare, No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Health Care would thus join a pantheon of insurers
swallowed in the last few years, including the health care
divisions of Metropolitan Life, Travelers, New York Life and John
Hancock. In only five years, a dozen companies have been scooped up
by six survivors: Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, Foundation
Health Systems, Pacificare and Wellpoint Health Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal quickly drew expressions of concern from groups
monitoring patients' rights and doctors' groups like the American
Medical Association and medical societies in a half-dozen states.
Executives of large employers were worried about the impact on cost
and quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that payments to doctors will be trimmed, leading
them to spend less time with each patient, and this could hurt the
quality of care. And patients fear that they will be forced to
switch doctors.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors and hospitals, the concern is not only that insurers
dictate prices, but that if one or two insurers dominate a market,
some doctors and hospitals will be left out in the cold. And
employers worry about having fewer plans competing for their
business, a trend that is already translating into higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage of Aetna and Prucare will result in one company
controlling over one-third of the New Jersey market,'' said Dr.
David Swee, a New Brunswick family practitioner, who is an official
of the Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And with about three of every 10 managed care members in
Atlanta, Aetna ``will be in a position to start dictating
reimbursement rates,'' said David Harrell, chief executive of the
Georgia Baptist Health Care System. ``That is extremely dangerous.
It ultimately has the potential of driving down quality'' by
pressing hospitals to discharge patients prematurely and skimp on
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry insists that these concerns are
groundless, assuring critics that small regional insurers, as well
as hospitals' own HMOs, will always be around to provide
competition. And they must be big in a given market, they say, to
keep costs from spiraling out of control _ and to afford extensive
information systems that may someday help improve patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismiss such arguments. The New Jersey medical society
called for ``appropriate action'' by state and federal antitrust
authorities ``to protect consumers, assure a vigorous market and
protect the patient-physician relationship.'' The New Jersey
Citizen Action Group has also asked insurance regulators in New
Jersey to investigate the Aetna-Prudential deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Prudential deal ``could endanger patient choices and impair
patient care,'' said Dr. Swee of the New Jersey society. The
American Medical Association made the same point in a letter last
month to the Justice Department's antitrust divison.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, even before the Prudential purchase, Aetna and
a local Blue Cross company, Keystone Health Plan East, together
controlled about four of every five members of HMOs and similar
networks. With Prudential, Aetna would be even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A marketplace this large should not be subject to a near
monopoly,'' said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, director of the University of
Pennsylvania health policy center. ``If one of the two starts to
gain a larger foothold, or the other one slips, we are going to
have a true monopoly situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national
health care consumers organization, said consumers ``would have
good reason to be concerned'' in markets where Aetna, which has
adamantly opposed patient protection legislation, took a dominant
position. ``Other HMOs have been much more forthcoming in trying to
be patient-sensitive and consumer-sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employers are also frustrated, said Charles Blankensteen, a
health care expert at William Mercer, a consulting firm. ``Choice
in the marketplace is rapidly diminishing, customer service and
value for the dollar are less than spectacular,'' he said. ``Who
bears the costs of these acquisitions? My bet is, it's the people
who buy the services.''
</P>
<P>
   But insurance executives say plenty of competition remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very fragmented industry,'' Richard L. Huber,
Aetna's chief executive, said in an interview. ``There's lots of
competition'' from Blue Cross plans and nonprofit HMOs. ``The
smaller regional guys will do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber predicted that there would be ``no more than three truly
national players'' _ Aetna, Cigna and Unitedhealth Group, which
until recently was called United Healthcare. ``We will compete with
each other and against the Harvard Pilgrims,'' he said, citing a
big nonprofit HMO with 1.3 million members in New England.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint Health Networks,
said, ``There will be fewer, bigger players and always an awful lot
of local and regional players.'' Hundreds of hospitals have their
own HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hanway, president of Cigna Healthcare, said: ``Size
matters. You need to have sufficient mass in major marketplaces.''
But he said he was ``not convinced that there is a significant
difference between 12 million members'' _ Cigna's customers _ ``and
20 million'' _ Aetna's and Prudential's.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said more consolidations were likely. Cigna,
No. 4 in managed care, has just agreed to sell its
property-and-casualty business to focus on health care and will
soon have $4 billion available for acquisitions. Humana Inc., No.
6, has also been seeking a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health system is stumbling toward a bilateral monopoly of
insurance companies and provider groups in every market,'' said Uwe
E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, already the largest insurers
in many cities, have also been consolidating, with mergers and
alliances in Connecticut and Indiana, central and western
Pennsylvania, California and Georgia, and Texas and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Some health policy experts say they do not worry about big
companies getting bigger at the national level, if customers are
thinly scattered. But with the acquisition of Prudential, Aetna,
with 39 percent of the Philadelphia market, would take similarly
potent positions in numerous other markets. It would have nearly 60
percent of managed care members in Houston, nearly half in Dallas
and more than 30 percent in Atlanta, Philadelphia and the New York
area, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein, the Wall
Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   If only one insurer is left to deal with local doctors and
hospitals, Professor Reinhardt said, ``They will send the bill to
the consumer'' by raising premiums. ``Then the government will say:
`You have converted health care into a public utility. We are going
to regulate you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross plans in some states are already closely controlled.
For instance, the Michigan plan, which has two-thirds of the
private insurance market in Lansing, is ``regulated by the state
and purchasers and unions on its board,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg,
president of the Center for Health System Change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives reject Reinhardt's argument, saying that
statistics commonly used on Wall Street do not give the full
picture, which should include not only managed care customers but
also fee-for-service insurance and employers that self-insure.
</P>
<P>
   By the more inclusive definition, Aetna is ``still only a
minority player, even in markets like New Jersey where we are the
largest,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Size may be a mixed blessing in some states. ``HMOs are
struggling in Texas,'' said Margaret Jordan, a hospital consultant
in Dallas, where hospital executives and doctors have loudly
criticized HMOs, starting with Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   The A.M.A., which has jousted with Aetna for months over harsh
restrictions in doctors' contracts, said the acquisition would
``create a dominant entity'' that would ``further diminish the
ability of patients to receive the quality of care they seek.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Justice Department, the Federal Trade
Commission and state insurance officials in New Jersey and
Connecticut, Consumers for Quality Care, a patients' advocacy group
in Santa Monica, Calif., urged regulators to ``disallow the
proposed buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With greater market share in key cities and states,'' it said,
``Aetna will have put itself in a position to offer more patients
less coverage for ever higher premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   AMA officials said last Friday that they had had preliminary
discussions with Justice Department officials and would provide
data to the government this week to support the doctors' charges.
In a rare indication of government concern three years ago, Justice
Department and FTC antitrust officials asked a federal appeals
judge in Chicago to leave the door open for future cases against
HMOs. Judge Richard A. Posner did so, remarking in his ruling that
health plans ``may vary in respects crucial to antitrust
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal antitrust officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leibenluft, a health care lawyer in Washington who
specializes in antitrust matters, said the federal agencies had
rarely, if ever, challenged HMO mergers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leibenluft said it was unclear whether the managed care
consolidations were ``such that the HMOs would be able to raise
their prices and the buyers would not have an alternative.'' Even
if an HMO dominated a market, he said, the buyers might be able to
switch to other types of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A ``more serious issue,'' he said, would be whether doctors were
locked into exclusive arrangements with a particular HMO. In a 1995
ruling, Judge Posner held that although an HMO affiliated with the
Marshfield Clinic in rural Wisconsin was ``the dominant provider of
medical services'' in its region, the HMO was not a monopoly
because patients could consult the same doctors through other
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Several large employers said the merger trend had not paid off
in better care.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bradley, director of managed care plans at General Motors
Corp., said he was ``very concerned that the health care industry
is moving away from local delivery systems and HMOs are becoming
more and more like insurance companies,'' which mainly pay bills
without focusing on providing appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the managed care companies had the potential to
improve their information systems, attract ``good local physician
leaders'' and press them to treat patients according to ``best''
practices. ``The opportunities are good, but I haven't seen it
happen yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Peres, manager of benefit planning for Ameritech Corp.,
said employers wanted to see if Aetna could ``mesh these
organizations together without creating employee relations
nightmares'' involving poor service to customers and angering
doctors and hospitals by delaying payments.
</P>
<P>
   J. Randall McDonald, an executive vice president of GTE Corp.,
said GTE would consider the quality of service and costs in judging
the merged companies. ``If it works to our standard, we'll be a
good customer,'' he said. ``If it doesn't, as we have done with
others, we'll say they don't meet our criteria, and we'll move
on.''

JORDAN'S TELEVISION IMPACT WAS HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BKN-JORDAN-CHICAGO, BKN-JORDAN-AD-COLUMN,
BKN-VECSEY-COLUMN, BKN-ARATON-COLUMN, BKN-JORDAN-RDP,

(JT) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In eight seasons of televising the National Basketball
Association, NBC has been blessed with Michael Jordan. NBC
purchased the rights as Jordan was exploding as a national icon and
in time to carry the Chicago Bulls' first title in 1991. Five more
championships followed, always in prime time on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Jordan's retirement means the disappearance of another
must-see NBC star, like Jerry Seinfeld. Jordan's impact on
television was huge _ the transcendent star whose presence was
guaranteed to lift ratings. Jordan and the Bulls appeared on NBC
and the cable networks TNT and TBS as frequently as the NBA would
allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique to have been in a partnership with the NBA for
eight years, and to have had this fairy dust sprinkled on us,''
said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ``Now we have to
reintroduce this generation of stars. But will we get Babe Ruth
tomorrow? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider how Jordan affected NBC's Nielsen ratings:
</P>
<P>
   _During the last regular season, the eight Bulls telecasts _ the
maximum the network was allowed to carry _ averaged a 6.5 rating,
71 percent better than the 17 other broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   _The Bulls' 1998 playoff games _ minus the finals _ averaged a
10.9 rating, 102 percent above telecasts without Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   _The 1998 finals produced an NBA-record 18.7 rating, the best of
the Bulls' six titles. Game 6 last June, Jordan's finale, produced
a whopping 22.3 rating.
</P>
<P>
   _The finals with Jordan always beat the finals without him. The
six won by Chicago have ranged in ratings from a 14.2 to an 18.7.
The championships won by the Houston Rockets in 1994, when Jordan
retired to play baseball, and 1995, when Jordan played a partial
season, produced ratings of a 12.3 and a 13.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be crazy to say that there weren't a large number of
people who watched the finals just because of Michael,'' said
Ebersol, who never regretted showing Jordan as often as possible.
``Did `Wide World of Sports' show Muhammad Ali too much in the
1960s? It's what the public wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan Effect on TNT and TBS has also been salutary. Bulls
games averaged a combined 2.8 rating on the cable networks last
season, 65 percent better than the 1.7 regular season average for
all other games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan's presence had a dramatic effect on the air and off the
air,'' said Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner signed their new, four-year, $2.64 billion
contracts with the N.B.A. knowing Jordan might not play through
2002. Knowing his plans before their schedules are set next week
will let NBC and Turner reduce their Bulls exposure. NBC will not
carry 11 Bulls games, the new league maximum.
</P>
<P>
   TNT and TBS will not likely carry nearly its maximum of 15 games
unless the Bulls retain Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman and sign a
top free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the Bulls are on more than five or six
times, none of them nationally,'' Ebersol said. NBC's post-lockout
schedule will focus on the teams it hopes will keep ratings from
skidding without Jordan: the Knicks, Los Angeles, San Antonio,
Miami, Detroit, Indiana, Seattle and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   How many appearances these teams make may depend upon whether
they sign free agents who will make a good squad into a superior
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the Lakers pick up someone who will help take Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant over the hump?'' Ebersol said. ``You need a
core of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said: ``There are stories to be told. I don't know the
stories, and you'd be mistaken if you try to predict what they will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the networks are awaiting the next superstars to make
up, in some measure, for Jordan's departure, so are the companies
that make NBA-licensed apparel and other products. Bulls
merchandise has led NBA Properties' sales rankings since the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   The licensed merchandise market has been swooning, but the NBA
market was laid low by the lockout and has been hurt again by
Jordan's farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``His retirement is a huge loss for the market,'' said Corey
Brown, licensing editor of Sporting Goods Business, a trade
magazine, which estimated that NBA-licensed goods fell 30 percent
to $2.3 billion last year. ``If not for the Bulls winning their
sixth championship, it might have been down more.''
</P>
<P>
   At Champion Products, the league's top apparel licensee and
maker of replica uniforms, has plenty of Bulls stock ready to ship
for Jordan-starved fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, Michael was a significant part of our overall NBA
and Bulls business,'' said Bill Kraus, director of licensed
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The company is hoping that key free agents move to new teams
that could become hot properties. ``This provides a lot of
opportunities,'' Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player, another major apparel licensee, capitalized heavily
on the Bulls' championships, producing T-shirts first seen when
Chicago players wore them in the winning locker room. About 22
percent of the company's NBA business came in the short period
after the Bulls won their sixth title last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls and Michael Jordan were between 30 and 40 percent of
our NBA-licensed apparel business,'' said Doug Kelly, Pro Player's
president. ``Without a focus on Michael, it ought to mean other
teams and players will emerge.'' &QL;

PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD OVERSHADOWS MIDEAST CONFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Faisal Husseini, the polished and outspoken
Palestinian spokesman in Jerusalem often at odds with Yasser
Arafat, was in sync with the Palestinian leader this week on one
count: May 4, the date the interim peace agreements with Israel
expire, should not pass into history quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do something,'' Husseini said at a gathering in Tel
Aviv of current and former diplomats and politicians from around
the world brought together by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres. ``There will be a vacuum May 4. We will have nothing to do
but announce a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments were shared by most of the Palestinians invited
to a three-day conference, sponsored by the Peres Center for Peace,
that brought an array of elder statesmen to the West Bank town of
Ramallah on Monday and to a series of round table discussions in
Tel Aviv on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 350 participants included former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, South African Archbishop Desmund Tutu and former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The panel held its annual
conference, which ended Tuesday, in Tel Aviv to talk about the
prospects for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the repeated vows by Arafat to declare independence
unilaterally in May overshadowed the events.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during a speech in front of the Palestinian
legislature that earned him a standing ovation, Peres backed the
Palestinians' quest for statehood but urged them to reach that goal
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our deep hope ... that the Palestinian people will gain
independence,'' said Peres, a Nobel peace laureate and architect of
the interim Israeli-Palestinian peace accords known as the Oslo
agreements. ``(But) it is our common interest to see a Palestinian
state taking place as a result of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., took it a step
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do anything on the fourth of May because all hell will
break loose and all your achievements will go down the drain,'' he
said. ``It would be a tragedy for you and for the region.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have discouraged Palestinians from declaring
independence since Arafat first issued the threat months ago. More
recently, Palestinian leaders have sent ambiguous and often
conflicting signals as to whether they are still intending to go
ahead with the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a key factor in the Israeli election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts have predicted that such a declaration May 4
would help to re-elect Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
when Israelis go to the polls May 17.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after greeting Peres in Ramallah, Arafat stopped
short of explicitly repeating the vow but said that ``important
dates'' must be kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot bypass that date simply because one of the parties
wants to keep it hostage to its narrow domestic calculations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Husseini, the Palestinian representative in Jerusalem, said
Palestinians would be left with no other choice but to declare
independence as long as peace negotiations remained frozen under
Netanyahu's right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard any alternatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians have argued that it would be foolish to claim
sovereignty over territory that Israel could easily strangle
economically.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have sole control of 5 percent of West Bank
territory and 75 percent of Gaza, and only a nominal presence at
border crossings, which are controlled by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Shtayyeh, a Palestinian economist who directs a
quasi-governmental economic council that oversees the Palestinian
economy, says those constraints should not dissuade them from
declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic problems, they are there now,'' he said. ``We
live with closures (of the West Bank and Gaza). Our businessmen
have trouble moving (goods). I don't anticipate problems due to a
declaration of statehood, because the problems are already there.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to respond to a Palestinian
declaration of statehood by annexing those parts of the West Bank
and Gaza _ some 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively _ still
under sole Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-December, Netanyahu has frozen further West Bank troop
withdrawals called for in the latest peace accord signed at
Maryland's Wye River conference center in October, alleging
Palestinian noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, largely with U.S. backing, say they have kept up
their end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations would likely resume should Ehud Barak of the Labor
Party win elections for prime minister. That would put Peres, as
No. 2 in Labor, back in the foreign ministry, where he was when he
forged the initial Oslo agreements in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility has prompted some Palestinians to favor holding
off on a declaration of statehood just two weeks before Israel's
national elections. Others, including Shtayyeh, say that by doing
so Palestinians would miss a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should declare statehood on May 4,'' Shtayyeh said.
``This state is not a threat. Why should Israel take aggressive
measures against it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wise thing that Israel can do is to recognize this
state, to say, fine, congratulations, now let's negotiate the
borders, et cetera. Because if there will not be a state declared
on the fourth of May, then when?'' &QL;

 &HT;    Lewis still maintains innocence in Collins-Resto bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It is nearly 16 years later, and Panama Lewis is
still pleading his case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis stands next to a boxing ring and tells a small jury of
media members, ``Every day I have that fight in my mind. It won't
go away. They knocked me out of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's viewpoint, Lewis either spent two years in
jail for something he didn't do or he should feel fortunate he
wasn't convicted of manslaughter. In 1983, a rising junior
middleweight named Billy Collins was left partially blind after a
bout against a club fighter named Luis Resto.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, it was determined that Resto's gloves
were tampered with _ half of the horsehair stuffing had been
removed, making Resto's punches far more lethal than normal. Lewis
was Resto's trainer. Both lost their boxing licenses and were
convicted of assault, tampering with a sports contest and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon. They spent two and a half years in
prison, ironically named the Collins Penitentiary in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, things deteriorated for Collins. He was depressed
because orbital damage prevented him from getting medical clearance
to box again. He turned to alcohol. Nine months after the fight, he
got drunk and drove his car into a tree in Antioch, Tenn. Collins'
friends and family have blamed Resto and Lewis for the boxers'
demise. Resto and Lewis have proclaimed their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Resto sweeps the floor in a Bronx gym. Lewis trains
fighters. One of his current pupils, South African heavyweight
Francois Botha, was Mike Tyson's hand-picked opponent for his
comeback fight back Saturday night at the MGM Grand. But Lewis
won't be in the corner on fight night.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has worked with a dozen major fighters in the last
10 years, Lewis is not licensed by any state athletic commission.
Pennsylvania and Florida licensed Lewis for a brief period but then
stripped him when all states agreed to abide by each other's
suspensions. So on fight night Saturday, he will sit in a folding
chair ringside _ preferably close enough to shout instructions to
Sterling McPherson, Botha's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bitter, but what else can I do?'' said Lewis who has a
pending application for a trainers license in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Billy's daughter (now a teenager). I have told
the state athletic commissioner that if they give me a license I
will give five percent of my purses to her. That's what Billy would
want. But . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, he is innocent. When the subject of Collins is
brought up, Lewis now deflects the blame and brings up the name of
Arthur Curley, who was Resto's cutman the night of the Collins
fight. Convenient, skeptics say, considering that Curley died of a
heart attack before Lewis' trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arthur Curlie was alive today, I wouldn't be here talking
about this,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is indicting Curley, Lewis said, ``No. But he put
the gloves on. If you put the gloves on, you know if they're messed
up. He should've told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also denied that Resto needed to cheat to win, saying,
``Resto was a good fighter. He ain't no garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his controversial trainer, Botha said, ``I
don't ask him about his history. He paid for what he did. I think
it's a shame. They took everything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   After several questions about Resto and Collins, Lewis sought to
change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about this,'' he said. ``I don't want to
go back in history. I want to look forward in life.''

 &HT;    Georgian's odyssey from Vietnam retold
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera ab Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tonight's debut of CBS' ``60 Minutes II'' (9 p.m.
) features an update on Atlanta resident Kieu My T. Nguyen, who was
flown from Vietnam to Atlanta in 1982 to be reunited with her
Vietnamese mother and American serviceman father.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace originally interviewed Nguyen almost two decades
ago while doing a story on Amerasian children in Vietnam separated
from their parents. Nguyen was born days before her parents left
for the United States with her 3-year-old sister, staying behind in
Vietnam with her grandmother and aunt because she was too young to
fly and her paperwork could not be processed.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was finally flown here with the help of the ``60
Minutes'' crew and an agency that reunites mixed-blood children
with their parents. She was shown a picture of her mother and told,
``Go to her when you get off the plane.'' She did when she landed
at Hartsfield International Airport as a scared 7-year-old who
didn't speak a word of English.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was raised in Fairburn and Dunwoody (Ga.), eventually
attending the Darlington School in Rome. Now 23 and a single
parent, Nguyen works as an eye surgeon's assistant. She visits
relatives in Vietnam every year. Her parents are divorced, with her
father, Joseph Norman, retired in Florida, and her mother, Ly
Phillips, running an Atlanta jewelry business.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen says she wasn't surprised to get a call from Wallace: The
CBS correspondent and Nguyen's father have kept in touch over the
years. She remembered being interviewed by Wallace in Vietnam; her
aunt acted as translator.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace showed Nguyen a tape of the 1982 story when he
interviewed her here last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult. I cried, which you'll see in the
show,'' Nguyen says. ``It brought back a lot of memories. He would
say, `There's your house there,' and I would say, `There's my room
up there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frightened at the time. I didn't speak any English.
I had to leave the people I knew to go somewhere I didn't know
anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen hasn't seen the segment yet. She plans to watch it
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it's good,'' she said nervously.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding a classic
</P>
<P>
   Film editor Rick Schmidlin, who earned raves for his recent work
on the director's cut of Orson Welles' 1958 thriller ``Touch of
Evil,'' will produce a re-edited version of Erich von Stroheim's
silent MGM masterpiece ``Greed'' for Turner Classic Movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cable movie channel will debut the restored ``Greed'' in
December as part of the 1924 film's 75th anniversary. It stars
Gibson Growland, ZaSu Pitts and Jean Hersholt in a tale of a
dentist who slowly goes mad as his wife becomes increasingly
obsessed with money after winning a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Von Stroheim, considered one of the great early film masters,
was more widely known in his Oscar-nominated role as Gloria
Swanson's butler in Billy Wilder's classic ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin's re-edit will involve reconstructing missing film
footage using up to 633 still photos and von Stroheim's notes on
color tinting of a few areas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the director's first, eight-hour cut of the film was
ordered destroyed by MGM's Irving Thalberg after he supervised the
editing of the movie to just more than two hours. Schmidlin's
restoration is planned to approach von Stroheim's final cut, which
ran a little more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   TNT western scores
</P>
<P>
   TNT's gunslinging, way-way-out western ``Purgatory'' saced No. 2
and No. 3. TNT's ``Monday Nitro'' at 8 p.m. finished No 4 with 6.7
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purgatory'' was the second most-watched original film ever on
basic cable behind TNT's ``Last Stand at Saber River.''
</P>
<P>
   A late `Later Today'?
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Viewers seem to like ``Today.'' So NBC will give them
more.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the network will launch ``Later Today,'' hosted by
Jodi Applegate. The hour show is planned to follow ``Today'' at 9
a.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliate WXIA, however, airs its own ``Peachtree Morning''
at 9 a.m. and won't decide till later whether ``Later Today'' will
land in metro Atlanta at 9, 10 or 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WXIA announced Tuesday that morning weather anchor
Cathy Ballou will join ``Peachtree Morning'' in February. The move
coincides with the on-air start of weather anchor Paul Ossmann, who
left WAGA last year to join WXIA's morning team.
</P>
<P>
   ABC drops `Line'
</P>
<P>
   ABC's midseason replacement shows will bump ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway'' (9:30 p.m. Wednesdays) off the network's lineup after
March 17. The improvisational game show that's not really a game
show, hosted by Drew Carey and based on the original British series
of the same name, reportedly will be out of new episodes by that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping ABC finds a way to keep ``Whose Line.'' It
finished No. 27 with 15.4 million viewers in the latest Nielsen
ratings and, more importantly, is the No. 16 show among viewers
ages 18-49 for the season to date.

 &HT;    Lewis still maintains innocence in Collins-Resto bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It is nearly 16 years later, and Panama Lewis is
still pleading his case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis stands next to a boxing ring and tells a small jury of
media members, ``Every day I have that fight in my mind. It won't
go away. They knocked me out of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's viewpoint, Lewis either spent two years in
jail for something he didn't do or he should feel fortunate he
wasn't convicted of manslaughter. In 1983, a rising junior
middleweight named Billy Collins was left partially blind after a
bout against a club fighter named Luis Resto.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, it was determined that Resto's gloves
were tampered with _ half of the horsehair stuffing had been
removed, making Resto's punches far more lethal than normal. Lewis
was Resto's trainer. Both lost their boxing licenses and were
convicted of assault, tampering with a sports contest and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon. They spent two and a half years in
prison, ironically named the Collins Penitentiary in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, things deteriorated for Collins. He was depressed
because orbital damage prevented him from getting medical clearance
to box again. He turned to alcohol. Nine months after the fight, he
got drunk and drove his car into a tree in Antioch, Tenn. Collins'
friends and family have blamed Resto and Lewis for the boxers'
demise. Resto and Lewis have proclaimed their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Resto sweeps the floor in a Bronx gym. Lewis trains
fighters. One of his current pupils, South African heavyweight
Francois Botha, was Mike Tyson's hand-picked opponent for his
comeback fight back Saturday night at the MGM Grand. But Lewis
won't be in the corner on fight night.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has worked with a dozen major fighters in the last
10 years, Lewis is not licensed by any state athletic commission.
Pennsylvania and Florida licensed Lewis for a brief period but then
stripped him when all states agreed to abide by each other's
suspensions. So on fight night Saturday, he will sit in a folding
chair ringside _ preferably close enough to shout instructions to
Sterling McPherson, Botha's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bitter, but what else can I do?'' said Lewis who has a
pending application for a trainers license in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Billy's daughter (now a teenager). I have told
the state athletic commissioner that if they give me a license I
will give five percent of my purses to her. That's what Billy would
want. But . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, he is innocent. When the subject of Collins is
brought up, Lewis now deflects the blame and brings up the name of
Arthur Curley, who was Resto's cutman the night of the Collins
fight. Convenient, skeptics say, considering that Curley died of a
heart attack before Lewis' trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arthur Curlie was alive today, I wouldn't be here talking
about this,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is indicting Curley, Lewis said, ``No. But he put
the gloves on. If you put the gloves on, you know if they're messed
up. He should've told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also denied that Resto needed to cheat to win, saying,
``Resto was a good fighter. He ain't no garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his controversial trainer, Botha said, ``I
don't ask him about his history. He paid for what he did. I think
it's a shame. They took everything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   After several questions about Resto and Collins, Lewis sought to
change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about this,'' he said. ``I don't want to
go back in history. I want to look forward in life.''

MICROSOFT PUTS ITS FIRST WITNESS ON THE STAND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An economist testifying for the government conceded
Tuesday that there was scant evidence that consumers had been
harmed by practices that are central to the Justice Department's
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In antitrust doctrine, the damage to consumers from
anticompetitive conduct is generally measured in higher prices and
fewer choices of products. When asked whether consumers were being
harmed by Microsoft's practices in the Internet software market,
Franklin M. Fisher, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, replied that the question was difficult to answer. But
after hesitating for a moment, he added, ``On balance, I'd think
that the answer is no, up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft quickly seized on the comment by Fisher, the last
government witness, as support for the contention that the Justice
Department and 19 states suing the company have been unable to show
that consumers are being damaged by Microsoft's actions. William H.
Neukom, the senior vice president for law and corporate affairs,
said the government's case was inspired by Microsoft competitors
and based on the ``raw speculation'' that consumers might be harmed
in some distant future if the company was not reined in.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department argues that it is sound public policy
to intervene early in fast-moving high-technology industries when
the predatory acts of a monopolist threaten to stifle innovation
and consumer welfare in the long run _ and such, it contends, is
the case with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With the prosecution case about to close, Joel I. Klein, the
Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, appeared on the courthouse steps Tuesday to
declare that the government had presented ``compelling evidence
that Microsoft has engaged in a pattern of practices to crush any
threat to its operating system monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says that Microsoft bundled its Internet browser
with its industry-standard Windows operating system, gave the
browser away and unfairly used its market power to force personal
computer makers and Internet service suppliers to agree to
anticompetitive contracts. All this was done, the government
asserts, to thwart the challenge posed to Microsoft's dominance of
the software industry by rivals led by Netscape Communications
Corp., the early leader in browsing software, and Sun Microsystems
Inc., creator of Java, an Internet programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that its contracts are routine business deals
and that its product decisions have been guided mainly by its
desire to improve its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was still on the stand as court recessed Tuesday, even
though the written testimony of the first defense witness for
Microsoft was released Monday. That witness is Richard L.
Schmalensee, an economist who is dean of MIT's Sloan School of
Management. To speed up the trial, the court decided that the
direct testimony of witnesses should be submitted in written form
and released the afternoon before the witness is expected to take
the stand for cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Fisher elaborated on his earlier remark about
the effect of Microsoft's practices on consumers. He said consumers
might suffer now from reduced choice because Microsoft's contracts
make it more difficult for a rival's software to be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the real problem, he argued, lies in the future, because
Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems _ its Windows is shipped
with 90 percent of all computers sold _ makes it a de facto
gatekeeper on new technology in the personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has shown that it will decide how innovation takes
place in this industry,'' Fisher testified. The lesson from
examining Microsoft's conduct in the browser market, he said, is
that rivals ``will be squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fisher testified, ``I don't think that's good for
consumers, but those effects have only just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult-to-measure danger, he said, is largely
prospective. ``It won't be a consumer-driven society,'' Fisher
declared. ``It will be a Microsoft-driven society.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from David Boies, the Justice Department's
lead trial lawyer, Fisher sought to explain what some economists
regard as an unanswered question in the government's case: why the
price of Windows is not higher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher replied that Microsoft was taking its ``monopoly
profits'' not solely from the pricing of Windows but also from
increased sales of Microsoft products that run on the Windows
operating system _ its Office suite of business software, including
word processing and spreadsheets, for example. The Windows pricing,
he added, can also be explained as a discount to increase sales and
thus strengthen the Microsoft monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted to ask
whether it was a ``valid concept'' that a monopolist might
logically pursue a pricing strategy of ``delayed gratification'' to
maximize its long-run gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think so,'' Fisher replied.
</P>
<P>
   The government will begin its cross-examination of Schmalensee,
the lead-off defense witness, on Wednesday, a day later than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Before it rests its case, the government plans to introduce
further excerpts of deposition testimony from Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates and from several other industry executives as supporting
evidence that Microsoft planned and executed a strategy to thwart
competition.

MEXICAN GRAY WOLVES IN ARIZONA TO STAY: MORE LOBOS ON WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered
Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona
governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today (WED. JAN 13) in the
Apache National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances
and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf
reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this
winter _ perhaps as many as 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some wolves may even arrive by helicopter as researchers attempt
to keep the captive-bred wolves as wild as possible by releasing
them in the most inaccessible parts of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to make these wolves as wild as possible, and keep
them wild,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, Mexican wolf biologist for the
Arizona Game and Fish Department.
</P>
<P>
   All the wolves released this winter sport bright orange, pink or
yellow markings on their fur and their radio-location collars, an
attempt to prevent hunters from mistaking them for coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists continue to post a $50,000 reward
for the arrest of those responsible for last year's wolf killings,
while ranchers continue their opposition to the reintroductions
with a new federal court petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a government program that can destroy an individual
and his private property,'' said Sam Luce, a rancher along the
isolated Blue River whose trained cow dog, Pepi, was killed by a
wolf last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears expressed by ranchers and others, no cattle, sheep
or people have been killed or injured by the wolves, which
generally feed on overpopulated herds of wild elk.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists plan to re-establish a self-supporting
population of at least 100 wolves in eastern Arizona and western
New Mexico by 2005. At that point, the wolves might be removed from
the federal Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   The lobos of the Southwest are the rarest subspecies of wolf in
North America, and their recovery is the No. 1 priority among
international wolf experts. There are fewer than 200 at 40 zoos and
breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction efforts across the West represent a complete
reversal of policy by the federal government. Earlier this century,
government agents _ acting on behalf of ranchers _ shot and
poisoned Mexican wolves, leaving none in the wilds of the United
States after 1970 and none in the wild in Mexico after 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, (Jan 7 ) the first of up to four new wolf packs
arrived in eastern Arizona _ an adult pair and their three
8-month-old pups. Their arrival comes a year after Babbitt brought
11 wolves to Arizona to get the program started.
</P>
<P>
   Another adult pair and two more pups arrive today, two pairs of
adults were released Dec. 11 and two more pairs of adult wolves may
arrive before the end of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Although they wear brightly colored collars, their thick winter
fur could obscure these markings, and hunters remain responsible
for identifying their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers plan to release some wolves inside the Blue Range
Primitive Area, one of the first places in the national forest
system to ban motorized vehicles. No pens or other structures can
be built inside the primitive area, so wolves released there might
be brought in by helicopter and immediately left to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But even the primitive area hosts a few ranchers, like Bill and
Barbara Marks, who fear the wolves brought in by helicopter will be
too close to their spring calving grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our reward for opposing the program,'' said Barbara
Marks. The Markses, like most ranchers in the West, own a small
amount of private land surrounded by government lands they lease
for their cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 wolves brought to the wilds of Arizona last year, five
were shot dead, one is missing and presumed dead and three were
recaptured for their own protection. In addition, the first Mexican
wolf pup born in the wild in half a century is missing and presumed
dead. Of the original 11, the two remaining males were paired last
month with two new females.
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 reward is offered for information leading to the
arrest of those responsible for the deaths of the wolves, whose
killing is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and a year in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, there have been no arrests, and speculation is
growing among those involved in the reintroduction that the
killings may have been random acts by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Babbitt condemned the wolf killings and
promised that no matter what, more wolves would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who did it, but it's a tragic event. It's not in
anybody's best interest, whether they're hunters or ranchers or
anyone else.'' &QL;

CLINTON PROPOSAL AIMS TO RETURN DISABLED TO JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Del., Vt., N.Y., Mass.) (bl) 
By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose Wednesday a new tax
credit and health insurance coverage to help people with
disabilities go back to work, White House officials said Tuesday.
Senior members of Congress from both parties immediately endorsed
major elements of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the proposal was ``the most important
initiative for people with disabilities since passage of the
Americans With Disabilities Act,'' a landmark civil rights law
signed by President George Bush in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, worked out over the last two months in
conversations with Congress, would cost $2 billion over five years,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the initiative is a bill to expand Medicaid
and Medicare so that tens of thousands of people with disabilities
can retain their health benefits when they return to work. Under
current law, people with disabilities say, they often have little
incentive to seek work because they risk losing Medicaid and
Medicare coverage if they have any significant earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million people receive more than $50 billion a year in
disability benefits from Social Security and Supplemental Security
Income, but fewer than 1 percent of them return to work. Allowing
them to keep Medicaid and Medicare while working would cost the
government $1.2 billion over five years, but many of them would pay
income taxes that they do not now pay.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William Roth,
R-Del., and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources, James Jeffords, R-Vt., endorsed the president's effort
to expand Medicaid and Medicare for workers with disabilities. So
did the ranking Democrats on the two committees, Sens. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is, in effect, embracing a bill drafted by the four
senators. The bill is called the Work Incentives Improvement Act.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton will also propose a new tax credit of
$1,000 a year for workers with disabilities, which the White House
said would aid 300,000 people and cost $700 million over five
years. To qualify, a worker would have to be certified by a doctor
as needing assistance from another person to perform one of the
basic activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, eating and
getting in and out of bed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An aide said that Kennedy would support the new credit.
Spokesmen for Roth, Jeffords and Moynihan said the senators had
just learned of the proposal and did not know enough of the details
to take a position on it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton proposed a $1,000 tax credit for people who
provide home care to elderly relatives or children with chronic
illnesses or disabilities. That credit would cost $5.5 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are similar in two respects. First, Clinton is
deliberately vague about how he would pay for them. The White House
is much more eager to highlight its popular proposals for tax
relief than to disclose the unpopular proposals it will make to cut
spending or raise revenue elsewhere in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Clinton increasingly uses the tax code as an instrument
of social policy, to provide assistance that Congress would not
approve in the form of new federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a Republican Congress, tax incentives are more
well received than direct spending initiatives,'' a White House
official said. In addition, he observed, tax incentives are often
simpler for the government and for the intended beneficiaries
because there is less need for bureaucratic supervision. On the
other hand, new tax breaks complicate the tax code, and taxpayers
must fill out complicated forms to take advantage of some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid finances health care for low-income people. Under the
president's proposal, people with disabilities could buy Medicaid
coverage even if they took jobs and earned income that would
normally make them ineligible. Medicaid covers two items of great
value to many people with disabilities: prescription drugs and the
services of attendants who assist them with personal tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to seek sweeping changes in federal programs
that provide job skills to people with disabilities. He will
endorse the approach taken in a bill passed last June in the House
by a vote of 410-1. The government would issue a voucher, or
``ticket to work,'' that could be used by a disabled person to get
employment services from either private organizations or state
agencies.

 &HT;    Officials contend Games won't move
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ Olympic officials are dismissing
suggestions that investigations into bribery and corruption
allegations to win the 2002 Winter Olympics for Salt Lake City will
end fund-raising for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   They strongly disagree with International Olympic Committee
executive Marc Hodler's assertion that the scandal could chase away
potential sponsors and force the Olympics out of Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``war, earthquake, civil disturbance or an act of God''
would result in the Games' relocation, IOC marketing director
Michael Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman Mike Moran said Hodler's
comments were ``from left field and without basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledge the task of recruiting sponsors had not
been helped since mid-December, when Hodler first raised questions
about vote-buying by bid cities, including Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy general secretary of the USOC John Krimsky said the
scandal had made it more difficult to reach the goal of $859
million by Aug. 1 of this year. Krimsky has pushed the completion
date back one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a high degree of confidence that we will make our
goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City has raised about 75 percent of its budget, partly
because TV contracts and international marketing deals have been
signed. Salt Lake Organizing Committee chief financial officer Mark
Turner said the scandal has not affected SLOC's finances. ``It is
still our intent, in case there was a revenue shortfall, that we
would not spend money before we have it,'' Turner said.
Fund-raising is on schedule, he said. Corporate sponsors and
suppliers are being counted on to give as much as $775 million for
the Games, which have a privately financed budget of $1.45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest sponsors, Blue Cross and Blue Shield remains
committed. A commercial shows a skier tumbling out on control on a
slope. The voice-over on the spot said that, as Salt Lake knows,
``It's not whether your win or lose but whether you have a back-up
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly prophetic spot apparently was making references to
the SLOC's failed bid to win the 1998 Games, which went to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Other sponsors, however, while not withdrawing support, continue
to monitor the developments, including Atlanta-based Delta Air
Lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware of the reports (and investigations), but we're
not making comments until we see the facts,'' Delta spokesman John
Kennedy said. ``We look to continue our support of the Olympic
movement and our third-largest hub, (in Salt Lake City), as we head
toward a world-class event. We are just waiting to hear the IOC
report.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta had announced its support in 1995 when Salt Lake City
received the Olympics, but it made no financial commitment then.
</P>
<P>
   Major sponsor US West, which pledged an investment of $60
million, earlier announced a decision to withhold a $5 million
payment to the SLOC. The company has refused to say whether it
would drop its sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate decisions are expected after a SLOC board
meeting, which had been scheduled for Thursday. That meeting was
postponed Tuesday and has not been rescheduled. When the meeting is
held, an ethics committee is expected to release its findings into
potential wrongdoing by Salt Lake City officials during the bidding
process.

ADVERTISING: WILL MARKETERS STILL LIKE JORDAN AFTER HE RETIRES?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the second and apparently final retirement of Michael
Jordan from basketball, which is expected to be announced
Wednesday, will Madison Avenue lose the most prolific, most richly
compensated and perhaps most effective endorser ever?
</P>
<P>
   Or to paraphrase Porky Pig, one of Jordan's many commercial
co-stars, will he be able to proclaim ``That's not all, folks,''
rewriting the rules of peddling products after a sports career ends
in the same way that he has rewritten so much of the pitchman's
play book?
</P>
<P>
   As reports circulated Tuesday that Jordan had decided not to
return to the Chicago Bulls for the abbreviated 1999 season, many
executives said they thought he could remain a commanding presence
in campaigns for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than an athlete, he's a cultural icon, so associated
with our lives and times,'' said Bob Scarpelli, the vice chairman
and chief creative officer at DDB Needham Chicago. That agency,
owned by Omnicom Group, has produced Jordan-centric ads for
McDonald's Corp. and the Wheaties cereal brand sold by General
Mills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan the brand is much bigger than Michael Jordan
the basketball player,'' said Brad Burns, a spokesman in Arlington,
Va., for MCI Worldcom Inc., the telecommunications marketer that
has featured Jordan in advertising since 1996. ``He doesn't have to
be in a sports setting.''
</P>
<P>
   But some executives offered caveats about the shelf life of this
human brand, ranging from the fickleness of fame to a need for
Jordan to counter perceptions that his roster of sponsors is longer
than the list of his basketball records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It partly depends on what he decides to do now,'' said Tod
Seisser, the chief creative officer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New
York, a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC that works for advertisers
like Delta Air Lines and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he becomes nothing but a professional pitchperson,''
Seisser said disapprovingly, ``I don't think we need a 7-foot-tall,
black, athletic Ed McMahon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of those interviewed echoed the thoughts of David
Lubars, creative director at Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers will still want to use him because he has
transcended sport,'' said Lubars, whose agency produces ads for
brands like Lee jeans and Miller Lite beer.
</P>
<P>
   By accomplishing that, Lubars said, Jordan is like Muhammad Ali.
And in being famous for being famous, he added, Jordan is
comparable to an Elizabeth Taylor, a Beatle or a Steve Jobs of
Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at another Babe Ruth,'' said Mark Roseler, the
chairman at CMG Worldwide in Indianapolis, which licenses to
advertisers the likenesses of celebrities, living and dead,
including Ruth, Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally with sports stars who retire, their endorsement work
gradually goes away,'' he added. ``But 40 years from now, you will
be able to envision Jordan flying through the air, dunking a
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been called the ultimate pitchman for his
overwhelming success in selling products despite what had once been
considered barriers to lucrative endorsement deals: being black,
being a professional basketball player and being on a team outside
of Los Angeles or New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last June, The Sports Marketing Letter, a sports
business newsletter, projected that Jordan would make $42 million
from his sponsors over the next 12 months. That was, as usual, by
far the fattest figure on the newsletter's annual ranking of the
``10 most wanted'' sports spokesmen, well ahead of the golfer Tiger
Woods, at $30 million, and the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal,
at $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ridiculously handsome, tremendously articulate and has a
great screen presence,'' Seisser said. ``As long as he retains
that, people will want to `be like Mike.'''
</P>
<P>
   That final remark is of course part of a slogan that has been
featured in campaigns for the Gatorade sports beverage sold by
Quaker Oats Co., one of Jordan's most prominent marketing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not about what Michael is doing, it's about who he
is,'' said P.J. Sinopoli, a spokeswoman in Chicago for the Gatorade
unit of Quaker, ``embodying the attributes of a quintessential
champion: will and perseverance and discipline and excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``we don't think the image of him with the sweat pouring
off his brow will fade quickly,'' she added, Quaker will
``absolutely'' honor a 10-year contract with Jordan that expires in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gatorade commercials for 1999 that feature Jordan will
continue to run, Ms. Sinopoli said. Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in
Chicago, a unit of True North Communications, is the Gatorade
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the most celebrated celebrities capitalize on
their popularity by signing multiple, multiyear,
multimillion-dollar endorsement contracts, Jordan's stand out for
their sheer number and variety.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisers that have visited the land of Jordan include
Nike Inc., for the Air Jordan and Jordan brands of footwear and
apparel; the Sara Lee Corporation, for Ball Park Franks and Hanes
underwear; the General Motors Corporation, for Chevrolet vehicles;
the Rayovac Corporation, for batteries, and Bijan, for the Michael
Jordan fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was borderline overexposed in terms of his
endorsements,'' said Jamie Barrett, the creative director for the
New York office of Fallon McElligott, ``which will become more of a
problem if he's not performing daily heroics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he kept topping himself, you kind of excused the
occasional lame Ball Park Franks spot because he was delivering the
goods on the court,'' said Barrett, who before joining Fallon
McElligott New York City was a leading creative executive on the
Nike account at the longtime Nike agency, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy Inc. in
Portland, Ore. ``But if he can't reinforce his star status on the
court, maybe he should be a little more selective.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and other executives agreed that how Nike decides to
portray Jordan from this moment on would significantly influence
his post-basketball marketing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael believed that once he stopped playing, his endorsement
career may become dated,'' said Andy Berlin, the chairman at Berlin
Cameron &AMP; Partners in New York, an agency that once worked for the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's popularity is still enormous,'' Berlin said. ``He's
intelligent, he's legitimately nice, he's handsome and he's
arguably the best basketball player of all time. Maybe he will be
with us in a different form.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nike's plans, Vizhier Mooney, a spokeswoman in Beaverton,
Ore., said, ``We're refraining from comment until Michael
announces.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan first retired from basketball, to play baseball in
1994, Nike incorporated that startling switch into a campaign story
line. And when he returned to the NBA in 1995, that, too, became
fodder for Nike ads. A television commercial by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy
from the fall of 1997, promoting Nike's Jordan brand product line,
may offer a preview of Jordan's persona after he stops running with
the Bulls. The spot portrayed him as ``CEO Jordan'' in a stylish
business suit, working hard in a corporate office.
</P>
<P>
   At Gatorade, ``we don't envision a Michael not in motion,'' Ms.
Sinopoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpelli, the DDB Needham Chicago executive, offered what may
be the best turn of events for advertisers. ``We're all hoping that
he buys the Bulls,'' he said, laughing, ``and runs the team.''  &QL;

EPA INVESTIGATES HOUSTON COMPANY FOR CHEMICAL SPILL IN LOUISIANA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: La.) 
 
By JIM MORRIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston-based company is under criminal
investigation for an eight-month chemical spill that fouled a
Louisiana estuary five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   David Bary, a spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in Dallas, confirmed Tuesday that Condea Vista Co. is the
subject of ``an investigation into alleged environmental
improprieties.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry is associated with a massive pipeline spill of
ethylene dichloride that began in July of 1993 and continued until
March of 1994. Millions of pounds of the substance _ a suspected
carcinogen known as EDC _ polluted the Calcasieu Estuary, a
biologically important network of lakes and streams near Lake
Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small amount of EDC was recovered, and what remains could
contaminate the area's underground drinking water supply. The
Houston Chronicle reported last year that Vista was warned in 1990
that the pipeline had deteriorated and might leak, but did not
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   EDC is a highly toxic liquid used in the early stages of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic manufacturing. A federal grand
jury in Lafayette, La., is expected to hear testimony about the
Lake Charles spill from several Vista officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Vista said it is ``cooperating fully
with the grand jury investigation. We are not aware of any criminal
conduct by the company or by Condea Vista employees in connection
with the EDC pipeline leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1947, the pipeline was used to carry EDC from the
Conoco refinery docks on the Calcasieu River to a vinyl chloride
monomer plant several miles inland. The plant was operated by
Conoco until 1984, when it was taken over by newly formed Vista.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a contract between the companies, Conoco
continued to operate and maintain the pipeline, but it was Vista's
responsibility to replace the line if it could not be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1990, a Conoco official warned Vista in a
memorandum that ``the underground EDC line is a significant issue
that must be addressed as soon as possible to prevent a possible
leak and negative environmental impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, monitors began detecting extraordinarily high
EDC levels in the estuary, but the pipeline leak was not located
until the following spring.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco managed and paid for the cleanup; it has sued Vista in an
attempt to recover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists are worried about the spill's long-term
effects on the Calcasieu Estuary, a vital nursery ground for fish
and resting place for migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the EDC has tainted an upper zone of the Chicot
Aquifer, which supplies some private water wells. The concern is
that the contamination will sink into a zone that provides city
water for more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Zilbert, interim coordinator of the Calcasieu League for
Environmental Action Now, or CLEAN, said Tuesday that she welcomes
the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see it happening. It's really nice,'' she said.
``We hope that there's a bigger picture. We want the other
companies to see that the pendulum is swinging back toward greater
enforcement and greater protection of communities.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the impeachment trial of President Clinton
resumes on Thursday, the House and the White House will not only be
arguing over whether the president should be removed from office.
They will be trying to shape the outcome of a critical series of
votes later this month that could decide whether the impeachment
saga ends abruptly or ventures into uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike a normal courtroom drama, the trial of the nation's
42nd president will not necessarily take a steady and straight path
to an uncertain verdict decided by an impartial jury. In fact, most
senators think the verdict in this case is already known _ that the
Senate will never put together the two-thirds vote, or 67 senators,
needed to remove Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   What is in doubt is how long it will take the Senate to get to
the acquittal and at what cost to the Congress and to majority
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some answers will come in late January. Under the bipartisan
trial plan approved last week, senators face a pair of decisions
the week of Jan. 24 after the House and White House complete
opening arguments: First, whether by majority vote to make a quick
exit and simply end the proceedings, and next whether to vote to
open the door to sworn testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   No one now knows how those votes will turn out. ``It is really
way too early to tell,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, a
member of the Senate Republican leadership. Sen. Susan M. Collins,
R-Maine, said, ``The trial will have a dynamic of its own that
makes it unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the coalitions that are likely to form are uncertain, the
math of the Senate is clear. If the Senate trial is to end quickly,
Democrats need to hold all 45 of their own members and then draw
six of the 55 Republicans over to vote with them to dismiss the
case or to prevent witnesses from being called. A vote against
witnesses would likely clear the way for the final vote on the two
articles of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that possible converts could come from the ranks
of Republican moderates such senators as Ms. Collins, Olymia J.
Snowe of Maine, John H. Chaffee of Rhode Island, and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont. Another possible pool of support is from the
Senate barons who balk at the idea of sullying their institution by
having Monica S. Lewinsky testifying in the Senate chamber about
the nature of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This group could include such senators as Ted Stevens of Alaska,
or Pete Domenici of New Mexico or even Trent Lott, the majority
leader from Mississippi. Stevens said on Tuesday that ``I don't
think you make up your mind until you hear the very last word that
is said.'' But he showed some impatience with the case when he
noted that he had spent the weekend looking at 8,000 pages of the
record made in the House. ``There's enormous redundancy in that
record,'' he said, ``Enormous redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week Lott said of witnesses, ``I want somebody to show
me why X, Y and Z witness might be needed, what they might testify
to, and some justification.'' He added, ``And I have to tell you I
have to be persuaded because I'm not, you know, all that excited
about the prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that many Republicans do not want to undercut the
House Republicans, the vote on whether to just dismiss the case
after opening arguments is widely considered unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, however, think that it could be a useful test
vote. For if it shows that there is almost majority sentiment to
end the trial and that there is no way to reach the 67 votes needed
to convict Clinton, they argue it could persuade more Republicans
to vote against hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a motion to dismiss and you can't get 51 votes, the
question is how much short of that will you be?'' asked Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``Is it 48? 45? Is it 33? These numbers
can have a large impact on what will occur next.''
</P>
<P>
   But this could be wishful thinking. This case is not dividing
Republicans along ideological lines, and some of the moderates who
the Democrats hope will turn into allies have already staked out
positions in favor of hearing from some of the cast of characters
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some witnesses are desirable,'' Chaffee said in an interview.
``That doesn't mean an army.'' Ms. Collins has also been an avid
supporter of a limited number of witnesses to clear up conflicting
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some Republicans who are savvy about the internal
dynamics of their caucus say that if the motion to dismiss the case
fails, then it is only logical that the Senate will vote to allow
the trial to proceed with the questioning of witnesses. ``I'm very
confident that would be successful,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the January vote only allows the House and
White House to depose witnesses in private. New majority votes are
needed to bring any of the witnesses onto the Senate floor to
testify. ``What is very hard to handicap is a vote on live
witnesses,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes to allow witnesses to be deposed, it could
throw the chamber into an uncertain hiatus. For the deal struck
last week did not include any agreement or details on how much time
would be alloted for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have said they will be aggressive in any
discovery period. And Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from
South Dakota, warns that his party will not necessarily be pushing
any longer for a quick outcome once witnesses are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot of us will change our positions if the
senators chose to allow the House to bring witnesses,'' he said in
an interview. ``Then many of us would feel equally strongly about
the the White House's opportunity to bring witnesses. We want
symmetry, some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Republicans risk that uncertainty? No matter where they
stand on whether Clinton should be removed from office, Senate
Republicans do have an overriding goal. They want to come out of
the impeachment process with their chamber's dignity intact so they
do not risk their majority.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday they received a warning. As they caucussed in
private to plan a legislative agenda for the year, they received
polling data about the November election from Linda A. Divall, a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The data was a far-ranging assessment of where Republicans
should stand on issues, but it also contained the disturbing news
that voters most often mentioned the Republicans' handling of the
Lewinsky matterr as the factor that caused them the greatest
concern about continuing Republican control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So one by one, senators emerged from the caucus, insisting that
the ongoing trial does not mean that legislative work on issues
such as Social Security, Medicare and tax relief would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have the false assumption that while we're
dealing with the impeachment trial, that we can't also conduct the
nation's business,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``And I would say that's incorrect.''

U.S. ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS ON 3 RUSSIAN SCIENCE LABS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced economic
penalties Tuesday against three Russian institutions that it
contends are helping Iran and possibly other nations develop
nuclear weapons and missiles. The sanctions, imposed by executive
order, mean that all American exports to the institutions, and all
imports from them, are banned.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment was levied against the Mendeleyev Chemical
Technical University in Moscow, the Moscow Aviation Institute, and
the Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power and
Technology. In announcing the sanctions, the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, said Russia should develop an export-control
system that is ``designed to work, and does.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban affects ``all U.S. government procurement from, and
assistance to, these entities,'' said David Leavy, a National
Security Council spokesman. Much of the trade between American
interests and the Russian institutions involves exchanges of
information and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said he could not provide specific figures, but that the
sanctions would mean the loss of ``millions of dollars'' for the
Russians. The sanctions will continue ``until we see reliable
evidence of progress in curtailing the proliferation'' of dangerous
information, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sanctions announced last July against seven Russian
enterprises accused of selling sensitive weapons technology to
Iran, Libya and North Korea remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Russia can police its own borders, factories and
technology industries,'' Berger said in a speech at the annual
Carnegie International Nonproliferation Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about the sanctions, the White House
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, sounded a conciliatory note when he said
the administration would ``continue to work with the Russians on a
broader range of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've enacted some tough new laws,'' Lockhart said, ``but
there's more work that they need to be doing, and we will continue
to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States' dispute was with the Kremlin
rather than the three institutions, Lockhart said: ``I can't get
into the details of these particular companies and what they may or
may not have been doing, but these companies, we believe, were
taking steps that made it impossible for the United States
government to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the July sanctions were announced, the Russian government
said it would investigate possible improper dealings by the
companies, a promise that brought praise from the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the Russian government deserved credit for having
stopped several suspect deals with Iran in recent months. ``Has
there been enough progress? We think there can be more,'' he said,
adding that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would discuss
those issues with Russian leaders on her visit to Moscow this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at the Russian Embassy in Washington could not be
reached for comment Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Berger said the administration would redouble its
efforts to secure Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which would bar all testing of nuclear explosive devices.
The treaty, signed by 151 countries so far, would set up a global
system of sensors to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to ratify, we will undercut our own efforts to curb
further nuclear-arms development, particularly in South Asia,'' he
said.

POLITICS PLAYS A PART AS CHINA TARGETS CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ These days China's press is hauling out one
big fish after another, as each is caught in the net of a national
campaign against corruption and smuggling. The point, as with all
political campaigns in this country, is to show the virtuous
determination of the authorities, without too much concern for
details like evidence or legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit featured over the weekend was Chu Shijian, who led
the nation's largest tobacco company for 17 years, operating an
extensive cigarette-smuggling operation and, according to the
official version of events, embezzling $3.5 million. A court in
Yunnan Province, presumably with guidance from Beijing, sentenced
him to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the chosen offender was a deputy minister of public
security, Li Jizhou, who supervised anti-smuggling operations. Li
was the highest-ranking security official ever charged with
corruption in Communist China, and it seemed particularly galling
that an anti-smuggling inquiry should yield even the man in charge
of running anti-smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
   But these two cases, as with dozens of other corruption cases
that have come to light in recent weeks, seem to be more about
politics than about crime, and more about who has or who has lost
connections than about legal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has become so extensive in China that people
frequently tell poll takers it is the gravest threat to the
country. Smuggling has become a particularly shocking variety of
lawlessness, because even the government now admits that the main
perpetrators are military and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet smuggling has been rampant for years, as China's
fast-growing economy has fed demand for imported goods with
extremely high import duties. Official estimates indicate that $30
billion in goods _ cars, oil, computers, mobile telephones and
cigarettes, above all _ were smuggled into China in 1998. The true
figure may be far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The relevant question is whether after turning a blind eye to
smuggling for years why did President Jiang Zemin order a crackdown
last summer? Why have a series of big cases been trumpeted over the
last month, at a time when a series of dissidents were jailed?
</P>
<P>
   The political system is still so secretive that no one outside a
small inner circle in Beijing can know for sure. Yet the crackdown
on smuggling, corruption and political dissent may be part of a
larger effort to appear aggressive at the opening of 1999, a year
with sensitive anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   This year includes the 10th anniversary of the massacre near
Tiananmen Square, as well as the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China, an event that is important for
leaders to celebrate without disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious message that Beijing would like to send is it ise
tolerating no funny business, so don't try anything. The message is
directed at local officials around the nation, as well as at
potential dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   With such a political campaign under way, corruption cases are
generally prosecuted for political, rather than legal, imperatives.
As most Chinese officials know, the most useful rule of thumb in
determining who is prosecuted for corruption is looking at who
lacks connections.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption exists throughout the vast bureaucracy and in
state-owned companies. When prosecutors are looking for someone to
be used as an example they invariably settle on those whose
connections are weak and then find the evidence as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials and business people familiar with specific
cases say particular charges are often a mixture of real and
falsified allegations by the ``discipline inspection'' teams that
formally investigate wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Chu, the tobacco boss, was routinely praised as one of the
leading businessmen, no doubt in part because he was close to the
longtime Communist party secretary of Yunnan Province. Only in
1996, when the party secretary was unexpectedly dismissed, did Chu
become a target.
</P>
<P>
   For years Chu played the same games as managers of state-owned
companies all over China, hiding huge parts of company revenue and
spending most of it on new machinery, employee housing and modern
offices. Like other managers paid a paltry salary _ Chu's was $250
a month _ he apparently also hid a few million for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen in Yunnan said it was an open secret that Chu's
company was earmarking a major part of its cigarettes for export
and then smuggling them back to China, to avoid heavy duties. The
local authorities had no objection to Chu's operations, it seems,
until his political backing fell away.
</P>
<P>
   Business people often say if the authorities were truly serious
about eliminating smuggling they could remove its root cause, high
duties. Duties on cars, for example, generally exceed 200 percent.
But in public meetings on smuggling that issue is rarely raised.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS VOW TO WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE STATE'S PROBLEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to avoid the ``partisan gridlock'' of
Washington, the 76th Texas Legislature convened Tuesday with
leaders promising to seek bipartisan solutions to the state's needs
and to give Gov. George W. Bush the harmonious session he's
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying bipartisanship even further, retiring Democratic Lt.
Gov. Bob Bullock, who will preside &UR;  &LR; over the Senate just one more
time, introduced the Republican governor as the ``future president
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose expected race for the Republican presidential
nomination will likely divert attention from lawmakers in the
coming months, visited the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   He told senators he wasn't there to ``be nominated for another
office, but to see if the old lieutenant governor could still swing
a gavel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Perry, Bullock's Republican successor who takes over next
week, told senators the ``time for politics is over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the time for all of us now to work together to address
the basic needs of this state. I pledge I will work with each one
of you in the spirit of respect, cooperation and unity,'' said
Perry, who will become the Senate's first GOP presiding officer of
modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said his personal priorities include using the state's
$5.6 billion surplus and projected income growth to give teachers a
pay raise, improve public schools and then give Texans a
``substantial'' tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The House kicked off the 140-day, biennial session _ the last of
this century _ by unanimously re-electing Democrat Pete Laney, from
the tiny West Texas town of Hale Center, to a fourth term as
speaker. He opened the session with a call for wise spending
decisions and campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue on our course for economic growth with
responsible budget management, our state will enjoy budget
surpluses long into the future,'' Laney predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate elected state Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, as its
new president pro tempore, or assistant presiding officer. Bivins
will be third in line of succession to the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Senators also paid tribute to Bullock, who gaveled the Senate to
order as he nears the end of a 40-year career of public service.
They approved a resolution honoring Bullock as a ``legendary
figure'' in Texas and agreed to establish a scholarship in his name
at Baylor University, where Bullock attended law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've rewarded me with memories of working with you for
Texas,'' he responded, visibly moved.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, 69, said he planned to skip Wednesday's brief Senate
session, after which lawmakers planned to adjourn for a long
weekend. He said he was suffering from a recurrence of pneumonia,
which forced him into the hospital for a few days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bullock said he planned to preside over the Senate next
Tuesday, for the inauguration ceremony in which Bush will begin a
second term and Bullock will hand over the Senate's gavel to Perry.
</P>
<P>
   This legislative session comes on the heels of a hard-fought
election season, in which Republicans won every statewide office,
trimmed the Democrats' margin in the 150-member House to six and
held on to a 16-15 edge in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And, for several weeks to come, it may share the public's
attention with President Clinton's impeachment trial _ and its
sharp partisan overtones _ in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the Senate, despite the change in lieutenant
governors, will ``carry on the great traditions that have been part
of the Texas Senate, and first and foremost among those traditions
is the spirit and practice of bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of speechmaking from Washington, D.C., in
the last month about the benefits of bipartisanship,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find some irony in that (because) those speeches are coming
from what I have observed to be the heart of partisan gridlock in
this country. In the Texas Senate, we not only talk the talk, we
walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said proof of the Senate's cooperative attitude will be
found in its operating rules, which will be formally adopted next
week. He said senators will keep the rule requiring approval from
two-thirds of the senators, or 21 members, before any bill can be
debated on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, with their one-vote margin, could change that rule,
Bivins said, so that ``Republicans could run over the Democrats
whenever they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``There is not one of my (Senate) colleagues who
wanted to change that rule, which is proof positive we are going to
continue to walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock drew cheers in a brief visit to the House, where Laney
praised him as ``a person who has had more impact on public policy
in our state than anyone else in the last half of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking his oath of office, Laney reminded members that as
recently as 1991, the House was grappling with multibillion-dollar
revenue shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that our remarkable economic growth in
recent years has increased state revenues. But that does not tell
the entire story of our state's progress from budget shortfalls to
budget surplus. We have managed wisely. The Legislature has
demanded accountability and performance for every dollar
appropriated to every agency of government,'' Laney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst mistake we could make is to view this budget surplus
simply as a pie to be divided up and parceled out among many
competing interests,'' Laney said. ``It should be used to set our
course for a secure and prosperous future for all Texas.''

OVERDUE DAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, 49 states will honor the life of Martin Luther King
Jr. with a holiday named for the slain civil rights leader. Only
New Hampshire will celebrate ``Civil Rights Day,'' insisting on a
generic spin to what the rest of the country and many citizens of
the Granite State view as a fitting tribute to an extraordinary man
of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, New Hampshire lawmakers have defeated measures to
commemorate King, the most recent losing by one vote in 1997. The
Legislature is expected to debate the issue again next month, and
proponents think the votes will finally be there to do what should
have been easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the effort has foundered on the state's
conservative bedrock, where long memories bridle at King's
opposition to the Vietnam War. New Hampshire's crusty independence
has played a part, too: King Day opponents have relished what they
consider the status of being different.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no status in taking a stand that can be read as
racism. Pointedly refusing to honor King by name is offensive to
many people _ black, white, and every other color.
</P>
<P>
   It is offensive to Governor Jeanne Shaheen, who in her inaugural
address last week called on the Legislature to seek a broader
vision. ``We must not end this century without making Martin Luther
King Day part of the heritage we leave to our children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrariness is out of step with the many unity breakfasts,
prayer vigils, church services, concerts, and speeches that will
honor King in towns around New Hampshire on Monday, just as similar
events will honor him across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   King was larger than ``Civil Rights Day.'' He stood for social
justice and the eradication of poverty, which would bring the
marginalized segments of society to the table with the American
family. He was foremost a man of peace who believed in changing the
world with understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In his way, he embodied the New Hampshire motto. Seeking freedom
for millions, he died.

THE DAMAGE POLLARD DID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to
make the release of imprisoned spy Jonathan Pollard a quid pro quo
for his assent to the Wye River peace agreement struck last
October, the issue of clemency for Pollard has revived bitter
polemics here and in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that President Clinton may be so eager to advance the
peace process that he will trade Pollard's release for Israeli
cooperation, active and retired intelligence and law enforcement
officers have been trying to persuade the president and the public
that Pollard did tremendous damage to US security and should not
have his life sentence commuted. The particulars of their case
against leniency are presented in a provocative article in the
current New Yorker by veteran reporter Seymour Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's sources, confirming charges that former defense
secretary Caspar Weinberger made in a classified declaration to the
judge in the Pollard case in 1986, describe a betrayal of this
country's most zealously protected intelligence material as well as
the methods and sources used to acquire that material. They make a
compelling case that Pollard's spying, even though it was done for
an ally, caused great harm to the operations of US intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Much less persuasive are the scattershot suspicions and
allegations that many of the secrets Pollard stole were in one way
or another transferred to the Soviet Union. One hypothesis is that
the Israelis bartered Pollard's information for the release of Jews
who had been working on highly sensitive Soviet programs. Israeli
officials deny this allegation, compellingly. Another thesis is
that the KGB had so penetrated Israeli intelligence that it was
able to steal Pollard's stolen secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should heed the recommendations of his senior security
and foreign policy advisers and refuse to release Pollard. The spy
should be judged by the gravity of his crime. But US officials who
cannot back up their allegations about a Soviet destination for
Pollard's purloined files ought to retract their accusations.

 &HT;    $1.55 million raised for inaugural festivities
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The committee organizing inaugural festivities
for Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry has raised a
little more than the $1.5 million expected to be spent, an official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four donors, including Dell Computer Corp. and H-E-B
Grocery Co., contributed $1.55 million for the Jan. 19 events. No
public money and no campaign money will be used, committee
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that there be underwriters so that every Texan
has the opportunity to participate in inaugural festivities,''
Tucker said. She added that noncash donors, such as printers and
refreshment companies giving their services, will be made public
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Once sworn into office, Bush will become the first Texas
governor elected to back-to-back, four-year terms. Perry, the
former agriculture commissioner, will become the first Republican
lieutenant governor since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the inauguration, Bush and Perry will travel to a
Martin Luther King Jr. birthday celebration in Houston on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a $3 barbecue lunch, parade and four evening galas _
all open to the public _ will follow the oaths of office for Bush
and Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the inaugural committee still is working on details
that could change the cost of events. She added, however, that
there will be more than enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, $100,000 has to be left in the inaugural
committee fund to help pay for the next inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Other leftover money goes to the Inaugural Endowment Fund. Money
from that account can be spent on preservation of state property or
public school and public library projects.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking contributions, the inaugural committee asked for
donations of $50,000, $25,000 or $10,000. Fourteen contributors,
including Dell and Lee Bass, of the Fort Worth Bass family, gave
$50,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Bass, father of Lee Bass, was among 22 contributors who
gave $25,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Five individuals are helping to pay for the bash. They include
Perry Bass and Lee Bass; auto dealer J.L. Huffines; San Antonio
real estate executive George Hixon and J. Virgil Waggoner, a former
executive for Sterling Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other corporate donors include Anheuser Bush Companies
($50,000); Enron Corp. ($50,000); AT&AMP;T ($25,000); Microsoft
($25,000); Compaq Computer Corp. ($10,000) and Hunt Oil Co.
($10,000).

JURY TO DECIDE WHETHER ANTI-ABORTION WEB SITE HAS FREE(EQ)SPEECH
PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.Y, Colo., Fla., Ga.)  (fe) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ ``The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists
on Trial,'' proclaims the site on the World Wide Web. With
simulated blood dripping from fetus parts, the site leads a
cyber-visitor to the ``main archive,'' listing the names of dozens
of doctors and clinic workers around the country who provide
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the people the site calls ``baby butchers,'' the
information includes photographs, home addresses, license plate
numbers, the names of their spouses and children. A few doctors,
including Barnett A. Slepian of Amherst, N.Y., near Buffalo, who
was fatally shot by a sniper last fall, have a line through their
names, denoting that they have been killed; those who have been
wounded have their names listed in gray.
</P>
<P>
   For a federal court jury here, hearing a civil case brought by
Planned Parenthood and several doctors against some of the most
militant abortion opponents in the country, the trial will boil
down to this question: is the Web site constitutionally protected
free speech?
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who are seeking up to $200 million in damages,
have brought their case under the 1994 Federal Freedom of Access to
Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal to use ``force or
threat of force'' against anyone seeking or providing an abortion
and allows clinics to seek unlimited damages if abortion workers
are harmed or intimidated. But as simple as the question before the
jury sounds, the legal issues are not.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this is first major case brought under the law
that does not involve direct personal threats or an actual physical
confrontation. And while the plaintiffs say the web site amounts to
a solicitation of murder, the defendants contend that it is a legal
informational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coalition of concerned citizens throughout the U.S.A. is
cooperating in collecting dossiers on abortionists in anticipation
that one day we may be able to hold them on trial for crimes
against humanity,'' explains the site, which is named for the
German city in which Nazis were put on trial after World War II.
``We anticipate the day when these people will be charged in
perfectly legal courts once the tide of this nation's opinion turns
against the wanton slaughter of God's children.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion is legal. And in the climate surrounding the issue
_ the National Abortion Federation says there have been seven
killings, 15 attempted murders, 99 acid attacks, 154 arson
incidents and 39 bombings involving abortion clinics or workers in
the last two decades _ the plaintiffs here say that radical
anti-abortion groups are clearly using devices like the Web site to
incite more violence and deny women access to abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like bounty hunters of the Old West, the defendants want
to stop the doctors by any means _ dead in their tracks,'' Maria
Vullo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told jurors. ``It's terrorism,
ladies and gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony here on Monday, Dr. Warren Hern of Boulder, Colo.,
said his life has been turned into a nightmare by the protesters,
who have also put his face on their ``Deadly Dozen'' flier, which
looks like a wanted poster and says he and other doctors are
``Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made me feel a great sense of personal isolation,'' Dr.
Hern told the jurors, explaining that he now wears a bulletproof
vest, covers his windows, always sits with his back toward the wall
and is leery of any contact with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the roster of 14 defendants, which included the American
Coalition of Life Advocates, an umbrella group that has been
described as too extreme by more mainstream anti-abortion groups,
say most of the information they provide could be found in
telephone directories.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they say, nothing in the ``Nuremberg Files''
specifically advocates violence against the doctors or clinic
workers, although the site does include links to other Web pages
that defend killing abortion workers as legally justifiable
homicide and to a letter from prison from Paul J. Hill, who
murdered a doctor in Pensacola, Fla., in 1994. In it, he describes
``the joy I felt after shooting the abortionist, and still feel
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In opening arguments last week, Chris Ferrara, a lawyer for the
defendants, said the case was baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about the threat to kill or injure, which is
simply not there,'' he said. ``Opinions? Yes, sometimes harsh. But
no violence.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones has turned down requests
from the defendants to dismiss the case outright, in effect ruling
that the Web site was not automatically protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he seems to have signaled that the plaintiffs may
have a valid case.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting an appeals court ruling in another case, Jones wrote
that ``alleged threats should be considered in light of their
entire factual context, including the surrounding events and the
reaction of the listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   And, issuing his opinion against dismissing the case, he said it
should go to a jury because ``there is substantial evidence of
record from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that the
defendants in this case were aware of and promoted the atmosphere
of violence surrounding the anti-abortion movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, said the case poses a difficult question
of where to draw the line between protected free speech and illegal
threats. The basic standard set by the Supreme Court is that speech
is protected unless it is directed toward and likely to produce
``imminent lawless action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for the plaintiffs is, the Web site does not
explicitly say, it is your moral duty to go out and kill these
people or maim them or harm their family,'' Entin said. ``On the
other hand, in the context in which this case is being litigated,
we know there are people who are out there who are willing to go
out and kill people who perform abortions. So the question is, to
what extent will people take seriously the implicit message on this
Web site, which is clearly that all right-thinking people should
use whatever means necessary to stop people from performing
abortions?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that if the Web site specifically advocated
murder, it would almost certainly be found to be illegal, and,
conversely, if it did not list doctors' names and addresses, it
would almost certainly be considered protected speech. But the
question before the jury, where in the middle does it belong?
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues in this case are very tricky,'' said David J.
Fidanque, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Oregon, which has filed a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing
that the jury must focus not only on the fear the list may have
spurred in the doctors, but also on the intent of the abortion
opponents who contributed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have a serious chilling effect on political debate
in this country if it's not handled properly by the courts,'' said
Fidanque.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking damages, the plaintiffs want an
injunction from Jones that could essentially force the abortion
opponents to cease circulating the files. Among the 14 named
defendants are Michael Bray, a minister and author of a book called
``A Time to Kill,'' which argues that killings of abortion doctors
can be justifiable, and C. Roy McMillan, director of a
Mississippi-based anti-abortion group, who has said that ``it
wouldn't bother me if every abortionist in the country today fell
dead from a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief collector of information for the Nuremberg Files, Neal
Horsley, a Georgia computer consultant, has not been named as a
defendant. Jones has issued a gag order in the case, preventing
anyone directly involved with it from talking to the media during
the trial, so lawyers for the plaintiffs could not elaborate on why
they left him out.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Tuesday afternoon, another defendant, Andrew
Burnett, publisher of Portland-based Life Advocate Magazine,
defended publishing the names and addresses of doctors on the Web
site _ www.christiangallery.com/atrocity. He said his own address
had been published numerous times in The Oregonian, the daily
newspaper in Portland, after he was arrested in abortion protests.
</P>
<P>
   It was a jarring experience, Burnett said, but one that made him
realize how committed he was to his cause. Of publishing the lists,
he said, ``It's a legitimate way to have people reconsider what
they do for a living.''

CLINTON'S INSIPID PLAN FOR ELDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's offer of a tax credit for the care of
elderly people in the home is a feel-good proposal that would
accomplish little. The $5.5 billion in forgone revenue would be
better spent on improving existing government programs that provide
medical care for older people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would provide a credit of $1,000 to anyone who cares for
an elderly person with three specific kinds of disabilities. But
$1,000 is not enough these days to materially improve anybody's
life, and the money would have little impact on spouses and others
who take care of their frail relatives as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   The credit would begin to phase out for couples who make
$110,000 and individuals who make $75,000, disappearing entirely
for couples earning more than $130,000 and singles over $110,000.
Those on the high end probably do not need the credit, and the very
poor, who pay no income tax, would not get any relief at all.
Clinton's plan fails the test of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Less costly aspects of the Clinton package do have merit. One
feature would provide better information for Medicare recipients,
reminding them that they are not covered for long-term care unless
they buy supplemental insurance. Another would establish a program
for federal employees to buy long-term care policies at group rates
while they are working, at lower prices than when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   At $5.5 billion over five years, the tax credit is the costliest
element of the plan, and it comes just as the the government is
squeezing Medicare to balance the budget. Services to keep frail
old people in their homes are especially threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, when he announced the program, acknowledged that older
people are living longer, healthier lives. There is no crisis that
demands immediate tax relief. Instead, what is needed is a
thoughtful look at all medical and caregiving services for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Initial congressional reaction was favorable. This is the kind
of middle-class tax relief much beloved by Republicans and
Democrats alike. If passed, it would become yet another subsidy
embedded in the tax code while the Medicare program continues to
falter.

CLINTON SENDS PAULA JONES A CHECK FOR $850,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as the Senate is about to begin President
Clinton's impeachment trial in earnest, Clinton sent $850,000 to
Paula Jones on Tuesday to settle the sexual misconduct lawsuit that
started it all.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said a check for $850,000, the amount
agreed to in November to settle the case, was being sent by
overnight mail to Mrs. Jones and her lawyers. The officials, who
asked that their names not be used, said that a little more than
half of the money, $475,000, came from an insurance policy against
civil liability that the president held with Chubb Group Insurance.
The remainder was withdrawn from a blind trust in the name of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, which officials said last year had assets
of slightly more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   A blind trust in the president's name was reported in financial
disclosure forms last year to have less than $100,000 in assets. A
White House official said that although the trusts were in separate
names, they were, in effect, joint accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The payment ends Clinton's involvement in the lawsuit itself,
but its repercussions continue as the Senate prepares to hear
opening arguments on Thursday in the president's trial on two
articles of impeachment stemming from Mrs. Jones' complaint. It was
in a deposition that the president gave in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit last
Jan. 17 that he first denied having sexual relations with Monica S.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment articles charge that Clinton lied about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before a grand jury and obstructed
justice by trying to conceal that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit that led to the impeachment drama was filed by Mrs.
Jones in 1994. She claimed that three years earlier, when she was
an Arkansas state employee and Clinton was governor, he had her
summoned to his hotel suite in Little Rock, Ark., where he made a
crude sexual proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied the accusation, but he allowed that it was
possible that Mrs. Jones was escorted to the suite for an innocent
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the president and Mrs. Jones came close to settling
the lawsuit, but did so only last November after much of the damage
to Clinton had occurred. As part of the settlement, he did not
admit to any wrongdoing and did not offer any apologies, two
conditions that Mrs. Jones had earlier insisted would have to be
part of any agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones and her lawyers now have to turn to the contentious
issue of how to divide the money.
</P>
<P>
   Her first set of lawyers, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph Cammarata,
have submitted legal bills totaling $874,000. Her second set of
lawyers, a Dallas firm, has said its bill exceeds $1.4 million, and
the Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., which helped with
her legal expenses, has said it paid more than $400,000. Mrs.
Jones' friends have said that she hopes to take a substantial
portion of the settlement for herself.
</P>
<P>
   The check, which was written on the escrow account of Clinton's
lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, was made out to Ms. Jones, Davis and
Cammarata, the Dallas lawyers and William McMillan, a California
lawyer and husband of Susan Carpenter-McMillan, who became a
spokeswoman for Mrs. Jones. McMillan helped negotiate the final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton purchased the Chubb Group Insurance policy years ago,
before he was president, officials said. The policy is known as a
personal liability umbrella, an option often available on standard
homeowners' policies.
</P>
<P>
   After Judge Susan Webber Wright of Federal District Court in
Little Rock threw out defamation charges in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit
last April, Chubb initially said it would not pay for the remaining
sexual harassment counts, but its officials changed their minds
after negotiations with Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the remaining amount was not withdrawn from
the Clintons' legal defense fund as officials had once suggested it
would be. A conservative legal organization said it would bring
suit to prevent Clinton from using that fund to pay the settlement.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon said Tuesday that it would continue
its low-level war of attrition with Iraqi air defenses even though
American attacks have done little to damp President Saddam
Hussein's defiance of the no-flight zones over northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have dismissed Iraq's provocations as
militarily insignificant, involving only brief sorties by Iraqi
warplanes or aimless firing of surface-to-air missiles that have
little chance of hitting an American jet.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges have grown despite six confrontations with
American and British jets patrolling the zones. The United States
and its allies demarcated the zones, in which Iraqi air traffic is
prohibited, to protect Kurdish and Shiite populations facing
repression from Saddam's forces after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Iraqi jets, including Soviet-era MIG fighters and
French-made Mirages, flew into the two zones Tuesday, bringing the
number of such incursions over the past three weeks to more than
70, Pentagon officials said. Iraqi forces have also moved more
mobile anti-aircraft batteries and surface-to-air missiles into the
zones.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Iraqi provocations have continued may be that the
American retaliatory strikes have had mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Two attacks on anti-aircraft batteries in northern Iraq on
Monday, involving an F-16CJ fighter and two F-15Es, failed to
destroy their targets, a senior defense official said. A week ago
American jets fired on Iraqi aircraft in their first air-to-air
confrontation in six years, but they also missed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what Iraq hopes to gain by challenging American
and British control of the no-flight zones, which cover about 60
percent of the skies over Iraq. American commanders have speculated
that Iraq hopes to down an American or British pilot to use as
bargaining leverage or a propaganda tool.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials have described the
provocations as signs of Iraq's increasing desperation since last
month's four-night bombardment by American and British forces.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, visiting American troops in
Japan, Tuesday called Saddam ``agitated and frantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has found itself isolated from other Arab states,
especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where officials openly call for
his ouster. But the Clinton administration has also faced
criticism, particularly after the repeated skirmishes this month.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's new prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, Tuesday criticized
the United States for having no clear vision in its confrontation
with Iraq. Turkey allows American and British jets to use an air
base in Incirlik to maintain the patrols of the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what the United States wants to achieve,''
Ecevit said in a television interview reported by Reuters. ``They
have tactics, but no policy or strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest confrontation in Iraq, an American F-16 fighter
jet fired Tuesday on a radar facility in northern Iraq in what the
Pentagon described as self defense.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot fired, the officials said, even though the jet was not
being tracked by an anti-aircraft battery or missile launcher, as
has been the case in the previous skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Michael Doubleday, said the strike
against the radar, near Mosul, was justified by Iraq's increasingly
strident statements and actions since the attacks last month. He
said the installation was ``integrated'' with Iraq's surface-to-air
missile sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear from all the actions that have been
reported for the past several weeks,'' Captain Doubleday said,
``that certainly the Iraqi approach to the no-fly zones has
changed, and our actions in response have been appropriate and have
been essentially responsive to the provocations that the Iraqis
have made.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Iraq has more than 100 radar sites like the one attacked
Tuesday, but he declined to say whether Tuesday's confrontation
signaled a new American aggressiveness in striking at those sites.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has increased the number of warplanes in the
region. Kuwait announced Tuesday it would provide a base for eight
more F-16 jets the Pentagon has sent to expand patrols of the
southern zone. The United States now has nearly 200 aircraft in the
Persian Gulf region and about 40 in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the administration has not taken other steps to
increase pressure on Iraq. A Kurdish faction in northern Iraq, the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, has called for an expansion of the
northern no-flight zone, from the 36th parallel south to the 35th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not ruled out the possibility of additional
steps, including renewed bombing by American and British forces, if
Iraq remains defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to protect our forces and take whatever measures
are necessary,'' Cohen said Tuesday. ``Beyond that I wouldn't want
to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of frustration among some Pentagon officials
with what they see as a cat-and-mouse approach. ``How long does
this go on?'' one said Tuesday. ``Do we wait until an aircraft is
hit?''
</P>

AFTER MONTHS OF TALK, LUCENT TO BUY ASCEND FOR $19 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., N.J.) (nk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies is expected to announce Wednesday that it is
acquiring Ascend Communications Inc., the data networking company,
in a deal valued at about $19.3 billion, people close to the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Lucent, the telephone equipment maker, approved the
acquisition on Tuesday. Ascend's board, which was still discussing
the deal late Tuesday night, was expected to approve it as well, a
person close to Ascend said. But as with all negotiations, a deal
could still fall apart until the board approves it.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, which is based in Alameda, Calif., but also has
significant operations in Boston, is expected to be absorbed into
Lucent's data services business with Lucent's headquarters
remaining in Murray Hill, N.J. Mory Ejabat, the president and chief
executive of Ascend, will stay on through the transition, a person
close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Ascend stockholders will receive 0.825
share of Lucent for each of their shares. Based on Lucent's closing
price Tuesday of $107.875, that would value the offer at about $89
a share, or a premium of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The impending Ascend-Lucent announcement has drawn little awe
from analysts because the two companies have been talking on and
off for more than a year and a half. ``This has been the deal
Ascend has been talking about for months,'' said Kevin Slocum, an
analyst at Soundview Technology Group. ``Now the financial
community gets the deal and it's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for Lucent. It stands to benefit the most from the
combination. The move is necessary because, with Ascend's products,
the company will be more able to compete against rivals like Cisco
Systems, the data networking company based in San Jose, Calif. For
months, Ejabat insisted his company could go it alone and do battle
with bigger rivals. But, Slocum said, ``Ascend knew it needed a
partner to be a bigger player.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two companies started to come together over
the last couple of weeks. Richard McGinn, chief executive officer
of Lucent, is said to have worked out much of the details himself
with Ejabat. But much of the intense negotiating occurred over the
past few days as executives at the two companies worked out the
final details of a combination.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Lucent was
advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

NAKED COWBOY SINGS HIS WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RAD SALLEE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A tall, mysterious stranger in a black hat, black
boots and black Hanes undies, strumming a modestly positioned black
guitar, got some air time Tuesday on a breezy downtown sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Naked Cowboy, comin' to a town near you,'' crooned
John Robert Burck as passers-by looked on, alternately entranced or
askance.
</P>
<P>
   Burck, 28, was looking to get some exposure for a budding
career. He describes himself as a part-time model who had a photo
spread in the May 1998 Playgirl magazine, but he really wants to be
a singer and actor.
</P>
<P>
   His one-man, 40-city self-promotion tour started in Cincinnati,
his hometown, and will end in Los Angeles, where he plans to pick
up copies of his new CD and _ with luck _ a movie role.
</P>
<P>
   Two earlier trips yielded one appearance on ``Baywatch,'' Burck
said, but he figures the naked shtick might get the attention of
important people.
</P>
<P>
   It has already yielded two invitations to the ``Jenny Jones''
talk show. ``I've been to Nashville twice too,'' he said, ``but
you've got to have connections there.''
</P>
<P>
   Burck said he started taking voice lessons two years ago on his
agent's advice and learned the 12-string guitar through a
self-improvement regimen called neurolinguistic programming.
</P>
<P>
   He's also writing a book on how to become a celebrity in just
one year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that another cowboy celebrity, the late Roy Rogers, had
come to Hollywood from Cincinnati, Burck asked innocently, ``Who's
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He started out singing clothed and met with stark indifference.
Seven hours on Venice Beach, Fla., he said, netted only a couple of
dollars in charitable tips.
</P>
<P>
   But after a photographer recommended trying the same gig in his
underwear, Burck ``made more in one day that I had in a month,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Burck hopes his latest recording effort will prove he's no flash
in the pan. He spends about $2,000 to record his own songs, then
peddles the disks for $10 each.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he's been giving them away in hopes of building a name,
but by the time he got to Houston they were all gone.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his street sound, though, several listeners agreed that
Burck didn't sing at all badly. Some also praised the buffed-out
body with the devil tattoo on the right bicep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too cute,'' exclaimed Sheila Jackson, 35, after
spotting the thread-bare troubadour outside Foley's department
store in downtown Houston. ``He didn't look like a homeless
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion Dee Thomas agreed. ``He was nice and lean. He
looked like a Calvin Klein model, and he was color-coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Angie Adams, who came down from her office in a property
management firm to see what the excitement was about, pronounced
Burck ``very good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aww,'' he replied, ``You say that to all the guys in their
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was an instant fan, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he couldn't sing he'd be obscene,'' said Ron Allen, waiting
for a bus. ``If I did it, what would happen to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Burck said Houston is the 33rd city he has visited. Police ran
him out of tough, sophisticated Miami, he says, but he was welcomed
warmly in family-oriented Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at a popular Atlanta eatery with a rock music theme
invited him in to play, he said, but the manager found out and
quickly ejected him.
</P>
<P>
   Burck said Houston police detained him politely and called a
sergeant for advice. The sergeant, he said, took one look, laughed,
and said, ``You're on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in compliance,'' explained another officer. ``He wasn't
selling anything, and nothing was showing.''
</P>
<P>
   As noon approached, Burck moseyed off to the garage where a
black BMW with all his earthly possessions was parked.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, Austin.

CLINTON TO PROPOSE BENEFITS BILL FOR THE DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to propose a $2 billion
jobs and health-care program over five years that would make it
noticeably easier for the disabled to get a job without worrying
about losing their benefit checks, health insurance or prescription
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, if approved by Congress, would be the most
significant legislation affecting the disabled since President
George Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act into law in
1990, and its impact on disabled people similar to the 1996 welfare
law's effect on adding welfare recipients to the tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the plan, which White House and congressional
sources outlined Tuesday, is a $1.2 billion ``work incentives''
initiative that would provide grants to states that allow disabled
people who return to work to maintain their eligiblity for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The disabled whose earnings or assets are above federal income
limits would be able to buy health insurance through Medicaid. And,
for the first time, Medicare coverage would be extended to people
with disabilities who return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has bipartisan support from several
powerful senators, would revamp the Social Security Disability
Insurance and Supplemental Security Income program, whose
beneficiaries curently lose cash benefits and health insurance when
they become employed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of them must choose between working or keeping
their health insurance and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Though unemployment is at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent, the
jobless rate among working-age adults with disabilities is nearly
75 percent, according to figures provided by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 million working-age adults have a disability that
leads to functional limitations, and 14 million working-age adults
have less severe, but still serious, disabilities, including the
use of a wheelchair, a cane or a walker, or a developmental
disability. Many of them can work, if the incentive exists for them
to do so, said advocates for the disabled. Officials estimated that
the proposal could allow tens of thousands of people to return to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will start to move us forward,'' said Paul
Spooner, executive director of the MetroWest Center for Independent
Living in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more comprehensive than welfare reform and looks at
providing some reasonable options and opportunities for people with
disabilities,'' said Spooner, who also is vice president of the
nonprofit National Council on Independent Living. ``We're not
asking for a handout, we are just asking for a hand-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a program that offers Medicaid to
people who have physical or mental impairments that are expected to
lead to severe disability without receiving some medical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, which would be tested on a limited basis, would
include people with muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, HIV or
diabetes who may be able to function and work with appropriate
health care, but who, under current rules, get the care only after
their conditions have become severe enough to qualify them for
disability coverage, Medicaid and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Another facet of the ``work incentives'' program would make it
easier for the disabled to get the training and support needed to
go back to work and offer more choices of agencies to go to for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to unveil the proposal Wednesday at a White
House ceremony, as part of previewing his State of the Union
address next Tuesday. The plan also includes a $1,000 tax credit to
help cover costs associated with the disabled going to work, such
as special transportation, at a cost of $700 million over five
years. An extra $35 million would be spent to accelerate the
development of information and communications technology to improve
the quality of life for the disabled and enhance their
participation in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is take down those barriers and
provide incentives for people to work,'' said Chris Jennings, White
House deputy domestic policy adviser. ``There's a lot of bipartisan
momentum to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a product of a bipartisan proposal that will
be introduced late next week by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, a
Democrat from Massachusetts, and James Jeffords, a Republican from
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them as co-sponsors will be Senator William V. Roth Jr.,
a Republican from Delaware and chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the
committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill means long overdue justice for all Americans with
disabilities,'' Kennedy said Tuesday. ``A major obstacle will be
removed from the fulfillment of every disabled person's dream to
work, live independently and be a contributing member of society.''

CLINTON'S AFFAIRS CUT LIKE KNIFE THROUGH THERAPY SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A tear slides down the petite blonde's face and
dangles from her jaw for several seconds until a comforting hand
takes a tissue and wipes it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate President Clinton. I hate him. I hate him,'' she
tells the five women gathered in therapist Lisa Morgan's living
room in Chandler. ``I thought I was over the pain of my husband's
infidelities. Now, Clinton is bringing it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's affair, his lukewarm apologies and all the
sordid revelations have opened wounds for many women who have
walked in Hillary's shoes. Like these Phoenix-area women who gather
each month in Morgan's living room to discuss the pain of their
betrayal and their broken marriages.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Clinton and other philandering men are all they
can talk about.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde says she thought she had put the pain behind her. But
watching Clinton lie about his affairs and then admit he had
digressed reminds her too much of her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in his company knew about it. They knew he was
carrying on. I was the only one who didn't know anything,'' she
says. ``Just like Hillary. I had to go to banquets with him. I know
they were all whispering about us behind my back. It's so
shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   The blonde talks about the sexual harassment suit her ex-husband
fought with the help of his company. The evidence presented against
him was overwhelming. There were several cases of unwanted
advances. The women who worked with him discussed them in detail
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts even more, she says, were the women who talked about
the consensual affairs they had with her husband of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stopped going to the trial. It was more than I could
take. The lawyers told me they needed my support in the
courtroom,'' she tells the group. ``But they didn't need me. The
case got dropped and I filed for divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   The women want to know why men act like this. They struggle to
find the motive. They wonder how society can even debate whether
President Clinton's _ or any man's _ infidelity matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan throws the questions back out to the women, who are
seated on a beige Ethan Allen sectional, drinking tea and nibbling
on Pepperidge Farm cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did President Clinton, the most powerful man in the
country, who has everything he can want, cheat and risk losing his
job, his beautiful wife and his daughter? Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan then explains sexual addictions. Childhood problems that
could cause one to be self-destructive. The inability to recognize
bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think President Clinton could tell you why he did what
he did?'' she asks. ``I don't think he knows. People like him need
intense therapy to know why they keep traveling that road. That
could be the case with your ex-husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman is considering getting back together with her
ex-husband. She tells the group that he has been in counseling for
the past year. He understands now why he flitted from one woman to
another. He was repeating the pattern his father had set for him,
and before him, his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The news shocks the women. They want to know why she would want
to take a chance. They tell her she's so beautiful and could have
her pick of men. Hasn't she been through enough pain, they ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him,'' she confesses in a whisper. ``The children love
him. Isn't forgiving the Christian thing to do?''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues with her.
</P>
<P>
   The therapist just warns her to take it slow. Morgan asks her to
look for solid proof before she lets him move back in, to consider
couple therapy. Lastly, she asks her to look at other possible
reasons she would want him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be fear of being alone? Or maybe you feel you don't
deserve something better? Only you can answer the question,''
Morgan tells her.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman can't take it anymore. She's been through two
husbands who have strayed. She stands up and shouts:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stupid. They don't deserve to be forgiven. That's why
it happens again and again,'' she yells. ``Now we have presidents
doing it before the country. This is all simple. Bill Clinton is an
adulterous, lying pig. Why are we wasting so much time and money
considering whether to keep him?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Phoenix area. Do they
care about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.
Amparano can be reached at 444-8394 or at julie.amparano(at)pni.com

FOR CHICAGO, A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Inside Michael Jordan's Restaurant, there is a
basketball under glass, signed not by him but by one of his many
supporting players, guard Steve Kerr. The inscription, meant as a
joke, reads: ``Michael Who?''
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thought of Life After Michael, of the day when
some young basketball fan might ask that very question, swept
through this city like a cold wind down the Magnificent Mile as
news spread that the Bulls superstar would announce his retirement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the loss of Jordan will damage the reeling NBA and
his sponsors, nowhere will the effects be felt as profoundly as
here in Chicago, which has embraced him as not just an athlete but
a soaring symbol of the best of this storied city.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that kept haunting Chicago Tuesday was that this
retirement was for real _ as opposed to his respite five years ago
_ and Bulls boosters would soon suffer the fate of Celtic fans
after the loss of Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even think about how this city is going to
feel,'' moaned Eddie Rodriguez, bartender at Michael Jordan's
Restaurant. ``You're up, up for so long, feeling like champions,
and then you're Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is one more year,'' said cab driver Masook Malik.
Then, sheepishly, he admitted, ``If we got that, yeah, we'll
probably want one more and one more after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The laments echoed throughout Chicago Tuesday, but nowhere were
they heard more plaintively than in Jordan's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the roof is adorned by a huge basketball, and banners
on the building trumpet Jordan's feats. Inside are hundreds of
photos, most of Jordan, but also of celebrities from Oprah to Frank
Sinatra, as well as framed copies of the Wheaties cereal boxes on
which Jordan appeared. There also is a warmup jacket from the
Harlem Globetrotters, a fitting tribute to the basketball showmen
whose skills Jordan emulated, then exceeded, and who for decades
were barred from professional league play because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flocked to the LaSalle Street eatery hoping for a glimpse
of the flying wonder (he was nowhere in sight) or just wanting to
eat Michael's Smoked BBQ Chicken ($14.99) while watching the giant
screen behind the bar, where Jordan highlights play in a continuous
loop.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Paz and Cholo Nunez were on the last day of a three-day
trip to Chicago, and they couldn't bear the thought of leaving
without paying homage to the most famous athlete in their native
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody at home is a Bulls fan,'' said Nunez, nursing a beer
at the bar. ``Our whole country will become sad by his leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's gift shop did a brisk business Tuesday as fans
scooped up Jordan T-shirts, sweatshirts, sunglasses, and even his
signature cologne, which was on sale for half price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a little somber, but we're happy for him if this is
what he wants,'' said Laura Foxgrover, the restaurant's director of
marketing. ``Maybe we'll get to see him here a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been down a bit, she said, as a result of the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordan fans tried to put a brave face on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction is he is going to join the Blackhawks,'' said
Sharon Clark of Detroit. ``He'll prove that a black man can become
the greatest hockey player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion, David Mertens, thought even bigger: ``If Jesse
Ventura can be a governor, how could Michael Jordan not become
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Though most fans were focused on Jordan, a few sought to find a
villain in Bulls vice president Jerry Krause, with whom Jordan
feuded at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be the most hated man in Chicago, I guarantee you
that,'' said Joe Leahy, an information systems manager from
suburban Palatine who has a small shrine to Jordan in his den.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement dominated local sports radio and television,
where news anchors and sports reporters nearly ran out of
superlatives to describe Jordan. Reporters even brought up the
subject at an economic development news conference, where Mayor
Richard M. Daley wished Jordan the ``best of health'' and said the
people of Chicago should be excited for their hero as he enters a
new phase of life.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Jordan fans expressed sadness, few said the news
took them by surprise. A few even said Jordan had made the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Neil Fiorito, a bellhop in a
downtown hotel. ``A classy guy like him should go out in style, as
a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Others held onto hope, however faint, that Jordan would reverse
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll retire yet,'' said cab driver Ivan Matis.
``He's too involved in it, loves it too much, to leave. At least I
hope so.''

U.S GOVERNMENT JOINS ONEIDA INDIANS' SUIT AGAINST NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government has joined the Oneida Indians
in a lawsuit that contends the state and local governments
unlawfully acquired 270,000 acres of land in central New York from
the Indians nearly 200 years ago, whittling down what had been a
sprawling reservation into a meager 32-acre plot.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Oneidas' land claim has been wending its way through
federal courts since 1970, the victim of fruitless settlement
negotiations between the Indians and three different New York
governors, the invention of the Justice Department has galvanized
the attention of state and local officials on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, lawyers for the Justice Department and the
Oneidas have provoked widespread anxiety and anger among private
landowners by seeking to expand the suit to name not just the
state, but also some 20,000 property owners in central New York as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Oneidas adamantly maintain that
they have no interest in evicting people from their homes or
forcing them to pay rent to the tribe and say the suit really is
intended to pressure the state into reaching a settlement. But such
assurances have not stopped people from believing that their homes
and farms are in danger, that they will be unable to buy or sell
property or that banks will stop making loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very emotional issue and no amount of assurances are
going to completely allay people's anxieties,'' said State Sen.
Raymond Meier, a Republican from Oneida County. ``The only way to
do that is to bring this to a rapid and complete conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the suit to include individual land owners _
which would have to be approved by U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn
in Syracuse _ comes at a time of simmering tensions between the
Oneidas and some business owners, who contend the Oneidas' tax-free
status is putting them out of business. The Oneidas, who have
become one of the region's largest employers, run a casino and
hotel as well as several stores, restaurants and gas stations where
customers do not pay sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or twelve family-owned businesses are now gone because the
Indian businesses have an unfair advantage,'' said Assemblyman
David Townsend, a Republican from Oriskany. ``And they flaunt it in
people's faces by advertising tax-free goods.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department's involvement has now made the
Federal Goverment a target of the anger. ``It's amazing that they
basically sided with a foreign nation against us.,'' said Lisa
Jensen, a 31-year-old landowner. ``You hit yourself on the head and
you ask where do my tax dollars go? Against me?''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas contend that New York State violated the federal
Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibited states from
acquiring land from Indians without federal approval. They argue
that between 1795 and 1840, the state and local governments entered
into 26 treaties and several purchase agreements with the Oneidas
to acquire all but 32 of the 270,000 acres now in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of those transactions were approved by Congress,
lawyers for the Justice Department and the Oneidas say, making the
sales invalid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the Supreme Court upheld that argument in a ``test
case'' filed by the Oneidas that named Oneida and Madison counties
as defendants and claimed just 900 acres. At that point, the state
opened negotiations with the Oneidas and the litigation was put on
hold for the next 13 years, until the Oneidas and the Justice
Department moved to expand the case last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's actions have prompted finger-pointing
between the administration of Gov. George Pataki and the Oneidas,
with each side blaming the other for stonewalling the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office contends that negotiations have stalled
largely because there are three groups of Oneidas who are parties
to the lawsuit _ one in New York, one in Wisconsin and one in
Ontario, Canada _ and that they have often feuded over strategy and
goals. But aides to the governor contend that even fractured talks
with the Oneidas are preferable to the new legal tack chosen by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the federal government has turned its back on the
people of central New York,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for
Pataki. ``We think it would be much more productive if they played
a helpful role in negotiations rather than taking sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond Halbritter, the elected leader of the Oneida Indian
Nation of New York, asserted that Pataki had been poorly served by
his legal advisers, who did not recognize the Oneidas' frustration
with the turtle-paced negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that we have to litigate,'' said Halbritter, whose
grandmother, Mary Cornelius Winder, began advocating the land claim
more than 70 years ago. ``These are our neighbors and friends; we
would like a future here. We know they are angry. But we think that
most reasonable people, once they know the history, know we didn't
want to sue so many property owners. But we really had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, the federal government has resolved at
least 10 such Indian land claims suits in Connecticut, Maine and
other states, usually by creating funds with state and federal
money that allow tribes to purchase land in proscribed areas from
willing sellers, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lands acquired that way have then become part of their
federally recognized reservations, exempt from local sales and
property taxes and eligible for a variety of federal services.
Officials said they knew of no cases in which people who have
purchased land in disputed areas have been forced to give it back
to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Oneida and Madison counties, which contain the
270,000 acres, said there was no evidence yet that the suit had
caused title insurance companies to stop issuing policies or banks
to withhold mortgages. They also said there was no indication that
property values had been affected by the suit or that people were
having trouble selling land.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph J. Eannace, the Oneida County executive, said he had
heard of numerous cases of property owners canceling contracts to
expand or improve their homes or commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the uncertainty raised by the
possession claim is doing damage,'' Eannace said. ``It has worried
people, caused a great deal of anxiety and had a chilling affect on
our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Oneida officials have asserted that the land claim area has an
assessed value of more than $1 billion. But they have signaled a
willingness to accept less money than that in exchange for other
concessions from the state. For instance, Halbritter has floated
the idea of creating a large economic development zone, where the
Oneidas could use an array of tax incentives to attract large
manufacturers to the region.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Halbritter also suggested that the suit could be
resolved if the state allowed the Oneidas to open a casino at the
Monticello racetrack in Orange County. But Halbritter said the
Pataki administration demanded that 90 percent of the profits go to
the state, which the Oneidas rejected.
</P>
<P>
   State and Indian officials have also said privately that a land
claims settlement could be used to resolve several longstanding
issues between the Oneidas and the state. For instance, the Oneidas
have sought state approval to install slot machines and sell
alcohol in their Turning Stone casino in Verona. And the state has
been seeking Oneida approval for a system to collect sales taxes on
gasoline and other products sold on Oneida land to non-Indians.

</P>
<P>
   What is engendering some of the bitterness among property owners
toward the Oneidas now is the Indians' new affluence. When the suit
was first filed, the Oneidas had dwindled to a few hundred
families, many of them living in trailer homes on the nation's
32-acre plot.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation operates a successful casino, two hotels, a
convention center, a T-shirt printing plant, five gasoline stations
and eight restaurants. It employs 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But several local officials praised the Indians for bringing
jobs to the economically struggling region. And they said the
Oneida's latest legal maneuver had at least forced public officials
to focus on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very unhappy with the suit the Oneidas filed,''
Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, said.
``But the silver lining is that it has prompted everyone to pay
attention.''

JORDAN RETIREMENT LEAVES NBA WEAKER AT A BAD TIME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Michael Jordan's retirement from the National Basketball
Association will deprive the league of its most effective marketing
tool in a generation, just when the league needs him most.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with repairing the damage from a debilitating six-month
dispute between NBA owners and players over their share of $2
billion in annual revenue, marketing experts and observers of the
league said that the NBA's solution was Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His departure is likely to cost the league additional losses of
$200 million beyond the $1 billion the NBA has already bled because
of the shortened season, according to Rick Burton, director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And as if any more evidence of his transcendence were needed,
Jordan's prospective retirement affected even financial markets.
Shares of Nike, which holds his largest endorsement contract, fell
by 5.4 percent, from 44 3/8 to close at 42.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in other companies whose products Jordan endorses,
including Quaker Oats Co. (maker of Gatorade), MCI WorldCom Inc.,
and the battery-maker Rayovac, also declined, though less
dramatically. Quaker Oats dropped 3/4 to 59 3/16, WorldCom fell 2
1/2 to 72 1/2 and Rayovac declined 1/2 to 24 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's dramatic impact on the marketing and business of the
game is well documented. At the end of the last NBA season, Fortune
magazine pegged Jordan's contribution to professional basketball
over the course of his career _ from ticket sales; television
revenues; endorsement value; and the sale of sneakers, videos,
cologne, and even underwear _ at $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, observers and marketing experts were pondering plans
for an era of professional basketball that will forever be known as
``After Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have competed against companies that Jordan made
rich, almost single-handedly, were awestruck Tuesday at the very
concept of a world without him in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have suggested that the NBA is facing a big problem
even if Michael Jordan does not come back,'' said Peter Roby, vice
president for consumer marketing in North America for Reebok
International, a company that for years has tried to match Jordan's
Nike in the basketball shoe wars. ``And now they are facing coming
back from a work stoppage without the greatest player ever to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan melded a series of endorsements over the past decade with
the league's strategy of promoting the game by promoting Jordan.
When filmmaker Spike Lee shot Jordan leaping high in a swooshing,
slow-motion dunk, the caption read: ``Who said man wasn't meant to
fly?''
</P>
<P>
   But who was best served by the spot? Nike or the NBA? Marketing
experts suggest it was probably a tie.
</P>
<P>
   And the strategy fit perfectly, with the NBA's long-term concept
of promoting the major stars of the game as a means of promoting
the game. After the league struggled with incidents of player drug
abuse and arrests in the early and mid-1970s, Julius Erving, Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson, and Larry Bird had stepped into the breach of
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Michael.
</P>
<P>
   There was wide agreement among experts Tuesday that no single
star of Jordan's generation packs his selling power, and it is
unclear whether any star of the hip-hop generation of younger
players will assume his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of celebrity players _ whether it is David
Robinson or Grant Hill or someone else _ has to make the image that
the league wants to sell,'' said Larry Moulter, of Woolf
Associates. ``Even though the league is supported by corporations
that buy up a lot of the premium seating, the NBA must identify
with the middle class. And kids getting arrested with guns and
marijuana in their car just aren't going to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several marketing experts said that the league will now gather a
group of players _ Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, David Robinson,
Shaquille O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant among them _ who individually
have far less luster than Jordan, in the hope that as a group they
will shine brightly enough to help erase the impact of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NBA should take a very proactive tack and they
ought to assemble a team of stars that they can push,'' said Dean
Bonham of the Bonham Group, a sports consultancy based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bonham expressed confidence that the league will
prosper, others were doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have run its course,'' said Irving Rein, a Northwestern
University professor who has written a book on the use of
celebrities in advertising campaigns. ``Remember that boxing was
once the major sport of the early television era. Based on the
performances of fighters like Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Louis,
companies like Gillette with its Friday night fights made it an
enormous success. But then it faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball may return to its level of interest at the end of
last season,'' Rein said. ``But I would be surprised.''

REPUBLICANS SAY THEY CAN PURSUE AGENDA WHILE CONDUCTING IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-NYT) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearing a public backlash, Senate Republicans
insisted on Tuesday that they could pursue an ambitious legislative
agenda and conduct an impeachment trial at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Senators emerged in droves from an afternoon meeting to proclaim
this ``dual-track'' strategy, after a leading Republican strategist
showed them exit polling from the November elections that
highlighted the public's concern about the way Republicans have
handled the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they would introduce their first five to
10 bills of the new Congress next Tuesday and hold several
hearings, on tax relief to military spending. Eyeing a way to turn
a fallow time of any legislative session into a productive work
period, senators said they might even get more down this month with
the first impeachment trial in 131 years hanging over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this impeachment process is done,'' said Sen. Larry Craig
of Idaho, ``we will be able to tell all of you that the people's
business was advanced, maybe even more than it would have been in a
normal year, where Congress would not have been in session in the
month of January.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip, said that
Republicans were putting together an agenda that included shoring
up Social Security, providing tax relief, improving education and
bolstering the nation's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Nickles conceded that Republicans' failure to pass many
meaningful bills last year underscored the need for a bold agenda:
``We had a very productive '97 and we didn't have a very productive
'98.''
</P>
<P>
   In her far-ranging presentation and in a 24-page handout, the
strategist, Linda DiVall, warned senators ``to have a message in
all aspects of policy,'' Craig said. In one of her polls, those
questioned ranked the Republicans' handling of the Lewinsky affair
as their top reservation about whether Republicans should keep
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to continue to do the nation's business,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``There's no reason to think that
the country's business is just going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, senators added, they had to jump-start
the legislative process this year because Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist's Supreme Court responsibilities preclude him from
sitting in the Senate 12 hours a day, five days a week. The trial
resumes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Senate Republicans sought steadier footing under the
shifting ground of impeachment, the White House declared that the
prosecution document submitted by the House managers on Monday read
like a ``cheap mystery,'' deriding it as not only a literary
failure but also a legal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at times a hallmark of what's a weak factual and
constitutional case that the allegations continue to shift and the
rhetoric continues to be overblown,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White
House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart accused the House prosecutors of resurrecting an
article of impeachment that was voted down in the House last month.
That article accused Clinton of committing perjury a year ago in
his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is planning to send a detailed brief to the
Senate on Wednesday morning outlining the defense that Clinton's
lawyers will present.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as the House prosecutors prepared to present their
opening arguments on Thursday, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the
lead manager, dismissed Lockhart's remarks: ``I'll leave the
invective to Mr. Lockhart.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To avoid any appearance that the House managers were playing to
the cameras, Paul McNulty, a spokesman for Hyde, sent an e-mail to
managers' offices on Monday urging them to adopt ``a low profile''
this week and to ``not appear on television.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening arguments will feature a new technological twist for
the Senate. Four television monitors will be positioned in the
Senate chamber to allow the House managers and White House lawyers
to show videotaped testimony, said the Senate sergeant-at-arms,
James Ziglar.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking public comment again on the trial, Clinton took his Rose
Garden strategy on Tuesday to a different garden. With Vice
President Al Gore, he toured the National Arboretum and examined
some maple and elm trees, while reporters were kept at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, the president met with his senior advisers
to review a draft of his State of the Union Message, which his
aides said he still plans to deliver to a joint session of Congress
on Jan. 19. That date is also when Clinton's lawyers are to open
their defense.

JURY ACQUITS IN MAFIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a case highlighting one of the most violent
chapters in the history of the New England Mafia: a renegade mob
lieutenant and eight associates allegedly on a killing spree to
seize control of the family from an unpopular boss.
</P>
<P>
   But, after three months of testimony from a string of
wiseguys-turned-informants and 11 days of deliberating, a Worcester
jury Tuesday found only one man guilty, and that was for running an
illegal poker game in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury aquitted two men of all charges and others of
some, including attempted murder, in most cases it just couldn't
agree on who killed or tried to kill who. And jurors apparently
couldn't agree on whether there was a Mafia conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is an indictment of the informant system,''
said Peter Ettenberg, a Worcester attorney representing reputed mob
associate Michael Romano, of Wakefield. ``It shows that you just
can't simply buy testimony, which is what the government did here.
They paraded before this jury people who sold their souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial began last September, three men who were
initially charged negotiated plea deals and testified for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had alleged that convicted Mafia capo regime
Robert ``Bobby'' Carrozza, while serving a 19-year racketeering
sentence at a federal prison in Pennsylvania, enlisted eight
associates in a murderous plot to oust reputed Mob Boss Francis
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that the group formed a racketeering
enterprise that killed three Salemme loyalists _ including the man
Romano held responsible for the 1994 slaying of his son _ and
plotted to kill 14 men between 1989 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors acquitted Carrozza of a firearm charge and acquitted
Romano of an attempted murder charge, but were unable to agree on
numerous other charges against them, including racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The only man convicted in the case was Anthony Ciampi, of East
Boston, who was found guilty of illegal gambling. He was acquitted
of attempted murder and gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Marino,also known as Gigi Portalla, who the government
alleged was one of four triggermen who wounded Salemme during a
botched assassination in June 1989, was acquitted of gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Patti III, of Revere, was also acquitted of gun charges,
while the jury was unable to agree on any of the charges against
Eugene ``Gino'' Rida Jr., of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Nazzaro Ralph Scarpa, of Boston, was acquitted of being an
accessory after a murder and of fireamrs charges.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeCologero, of Burlington, and Christopher Puopolo, of East
Boston, were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant US Attorney Mark W. Pearlstein declined to
speculate Tuesday on what went wrong with the government's case,
saying, ``we will be analyzing within the next few weeks what
happened at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstein said the government plans to retry the defendants on
all of the counts the jury was unable to reach a verdict on.
Defending the prosecutors who presented the evidence at trial,
Pearlstein said Jeffrey Auerhahn and Cynthia Young ``did a terrific
job on this case and the outcome should not be construed as a
reflection on their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Martin G. Weinberg, who represents Ciampi, called the
verdict ``an eloquent demonstration of the jury's rejection of
coercive plea agreements with professional criminals who
constituted the cornerstone of the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Without electronic surveillance or wiretaps, the government
relied heavily on testimony from admitted criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used accomplice witnesses and the jury didn't believe
them and the government didn't give the jury enough
corrorboration,'' said Boston Attorney Thomas J. Butters, who
represents DeCologero.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some of the worst witnesses I've ever seen in my
entire life,'' said Boston Attorney Robert Sheketoff, who
represents Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Sheketoff recounted that one longtime FBI informant, Jerry
Matricia, testified that he launched his criminal career by
breaking into the homes of people attending funerals.

GOP SEEKS TO DIMINISH IMPEACHMENT FEVER IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Impeach-Brief)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anxious Senate Republicans, fearing a possible
backlash from the impeachment trial, braced Tuesday to resume the
potentially explosive proceedings Thursday, as President Clinton
continues to flourish in the arena of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a private conference with a GOP pollster, Senate Republicans
sought a strategy to counter the perception that they are consumed
by impeachment fever as Clinton seems to spend each day promoting
public policy and exploiting the Senate's apparent diversion from
legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the dilemma facing the Senate's GOP majority, House
managers are scheduled to begin their 24-hour opening argument for
removing Clinton from office Thursday, just hours after the Senate
formally invites the president to deliver his State of the Union
address next week to Congress on his policy agenda for the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
   The development unfolded as the White House publicly derided the
House case against Clinton and privately prepared to file a trial
brief Wednesday on why he should not be the first American
president to be forced from office for committing ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls released Tuesday showed broad disapproval for the Senate's
handling of the impeachment case even as Clinton's approval ratings
remained robust, ranging from 62 percent to 67 percent in various
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, in their weekly, closed-door conference,
were cautioned by Linda DiVall, a GOP pollster, about the possible
fallout from the impeachment trial if they permit Clinton to
control the policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, the message was, we ought to have a message in
all aspects of policy,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho,
chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Senate Republicans plan to introduce a flurry of
legislation next Tuesday, the same day Clinton delivers the State
of the Union speech and the president's lawyers begin their 24-hour
rebuttal, spread over several days, to the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recognizing that we have to do other things in addition
to the trial,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican
who invited DiVall to address her GOP colleagues. ``We have to
continue to do the work of this nation even as we fulfill our
constitutional responsibility in the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge intensified Tuesday, as the senators, who sit as
jurors in the case, began reviewing pretrial motions that were
filed on Monday by Clinton and the 13 House managers who will serve
as prosecutors. The House memorandum filled 105 pages, dwarfing the
White House's 13-page document.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who said they have been reading the material generally
reserved public comment. But the White House spokesman, Joseph
Lockhart, assailed the House document as a grossly exaggerated work
that ``reads like a cheap mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at times a hallmark of what's a weak factual and
constitutional case that the allegations continue to shift and that
the rhetoric continues to be overblown,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   House managers privately seethed, saying it was Clinton's sexual
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and his alleged attempt to cover it
up that created the saga's unseemly story line. Clinton faces two
articles of impeachment charging him with lying under oath to a
federal grand jury and obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the lead House
manager and House Judiciary Committee chairman, reacted to
Lockhart's broadside with a tinge of sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's so generous, kind, respectful and deferential,
just as we have come to expect,'' Hyde said. ``We're proud of our
brief. I'll leave the invective to Mr. Lockhart.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, a key potential swing voter in the impeachment process,
said she has begun reading the pretrial motions. And she said of
Lockhart's remarks: ``I think it's a mistake to get into any kind
of characterizations or name-calling. We need to honor the process
and do our jobs, and I expect the White House will do theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to wall himself off from reporters as he
unveiled the latest in a long series of policy priorities, this one
in a speech on the environment at the National Arboretum in
Washington. Lockhart said the White House deliberately was keeping
reporters from questioning Clinton. ``It's unproductive right now
for the president to get into a long Q and A on this subject,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House faces a deadline of 10 a.m. Wednesday to file
its full trial brief, which is expected to parallel much of the
written memoranda that Clinton's lawyers used in the House to
counter the four proposed articles of impeachment that were pending
there. The House rejected two of the articles, which charged
Clinton with lying under oath in a civil deposition and abusing the
power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Wednesday, the House managers face a deadline to give
the Senate all the material the House used to develop its case,
including transcripts of grand jury investigation by the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial resumes Thursday at 1 p.m., Hyde will begin with
brief introductory comments. He will be followed by most of the 12
other House managers in laying out the opening arguments against
Clinton Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a tentative schedule, the managers will present their case
Thursday and Friday from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Although that amounts to 19 hours, the managers are
expected to be given the full 24 hours over the three days if they
need it.
</P>
<P>
   For senators, the prospect of sitting silently, as the rules
require, through the lengthy presentation poses an additional
challenge. ``There have been lots of informal discussions about
whether we can sit still and silent for that long,'' said Senator
Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican. ``This is a new experience
for all of us, but I think we will probably manage to survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators abandoned hope that each team of lawyers would use
less than its allotted 24 hours. ``I never doubt the ability of
lawyers to fill 24 hours, by any stretch,'' said Senator Susan M.
Collins, a Maine Republican. ``They will probably wish they had
more time by the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as numerous GOP senators spoke with reporters Tuesday
after their conference, several of their colleagues complained that
the senators, who took oaths to serve as impartial jurors, already
were jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, news photographers suffered a setback, as the Senate Rules
Committee decided to continue the 210-year tradition of barring
photojournalists from working in the Senate chamber. The only
photos of the trial will be taken by an official Senate
photographer.

JORDAN RETIREMENT LEAVES NBA WEAKER AT A BAD TIME

<P>
   Michael Jordan's retirement from the National Basketball
Association will deprive the league of its most effective marketing
tool in a generation, just when the league needs him most.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with repairing the damage from a debilitating six-month
dispute between NBA owners and players over their share of $2
billion in annual revenue, marketing experts and observers of the
league said that the NBA's solution was Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His departure is likely to cost the league additional losses of
$200 million beyond the $1 billion the NBA has already bled because
of the shortened season, according to Rick Burton, director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And as if any more evidence of his transcendence were needed,
Jordan's prospective retirement affected even financial markets.
Shares of Nike, which holds his largest endorsement contract, fell
by 5.4 percent, from 44 3/8 to close at 42.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in other companies whose products Jordan endorses,
including Quaker Oats Co. (maker of Gatorade), MCI WorldCom Inc.,
and the battery-maker Rayovac, also declined, though less
dramatically. Quaker Oats dropped 3/4 to 59 3/16, WorldCom fell 2
1/2 to 72 1/2 and Rayovac declined 1/2 to 24 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's dramatic impact on the marketing and business of the
game is well documented. At the end of the last NBA season, Fortune
magazine pegged Jordan's contribution to professional basketball
over the course of his career _ from ticket sales; television
revenues; endorsement value; and the sale of sneakers, videos,
cologne, and even underwear _ at $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, observers and marketing experts were pondering plans
for an era of professional basketball that will forever be known as
``After Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have competed against companies that Jordan made
rich, almost single-handedly, were awestruck Tuesday at the very
concept of a world without him in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have suggested that the NBA is facing a big problem
even if Michael Jordan does not come back,'' said Peter Roby, vice
president for consumer marketing in North America for Reebok
International, a company that for years has tried to match Jordan's
Nike in the basketball shoe wars. ``And now they are facing coming
back from a work stoppage without the greatest player ever to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan melded a series of endorsements over the past decade with
the league's strategy of promoting the game by promoting Jordan.
When filmmaker Spike Lee shot Jordan leaping high in a swooshing,
slow-motion dunk, the caption read: ``Who said man wasn't meant to
fly?''
</P>
<P>
   But who was best served by the spot? Nike or the NBA? Marketing
experts suggest it was probably a tie.
</P>
<P>
   And the strategy fit perfectly, with the NBA's long-term concept
of promoting the major stars of the game as a means of promoting
the game. After the league struggled with incidents of player drug
abuse and arrests in the early and mid-1970s, Julius Erving, Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson, and Larry Bird had stepped into the breach of
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Michael.
</P>
<P>
   There was wide agreement among experts Tuesday that no single
star of Jordan's generation packs his selling power, and it is
unclear whether any star of the hip-hop generation of younger
players will assume his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of celebrity players _ whether it is David
Robinson or Grant Hill or someone else _ has to make the image that
the league wants to sell,'' said Larry Moulter, of Woolf
Associates. ``Even though the league is supported by corporations
that buy up a lot of the premium seating, the NBA must identify
with the middle class. And kids getting arrested with guns and
marijuana in their car just aren't going to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several marketing experts said that the league will now gather a
group of players _ Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, David Robinson,
Shaquille O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant among them _ who individually
have far less luster than Jordan, in the hope that as a group they
will shine brightly enough to help erase the impact of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NBA should take a very proactive tack and they
ought to assemble a team of stars that they can push,'' said Dean
Bonham of the Bonham Group, a sports consultancy based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bonham expressed confidence that the league will
prosper, others were doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have run its course,'' said Irving Rein, a Northwestern
University professor who has written a book on the use of
celebrities in advertising campaigns. ``Remember that boxing was
once the major sport of the early television era. Based on the
performances of fighters like Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Louis,
companies like Gillette with its Friday night fights made it an
enormous success. But then it faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball may return to its level of interest at the end of
last season,'' Rein said. ``But I would be surprised.''

WILLIAM H. WHITE, 81, AUTHOR OF `THE ORGANIZATION MAN'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Pa., N.J., Del.) (bl) 
By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William H. Whyte, the author who defined corporate
conformity and warned against its growth in the classic book ``The
Organization Man,'' died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 81 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte, who was an editor of Fortune magazine when he wrote his
best-selling 1956 work, went on to a distinguished second career as
a scholar of the human habitat, specifically as a close observer of
street life and urban space. As an urbanologist he wrote, taught,
planned and once spent 16 years watching and filming what people do
on the streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   He also conducted a study showing that a large percentage of
companies that moved from New York City ended up in locations less
than eight miles from the homes of their chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``The Organization Man'' that first brought him to
wide public attention. It was one of several works of literate and
provocative social analysis to appear in the '50s, among them David
Riesman's ``The Lonely Crowd'' (1950), which dealt with the
formation of values of the urban middle class; Vance Packard's
``The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957), which critically dissected
advertising and consumerism; and John Kenneth Galbraith's
``American Capitalism'' (1952), which emphasized oligopolies and
countervailing powers.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte's book challenged and refuted claims of entrepreneurial
vigor and daring in business by describing an ongoing
bureaucratization of white-collar environments _ board rooms,
offices, laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   C. Wright Mills, the sociologist whose own pioneering work,
``The Power Elite,'' appeared in 1956, said of Whyte in The New
York Times Book Review: ``He understands that the work-and-thrift
ethic of success has grievously declined _ except in the rhetoric
of top executives; that the entrepreneurial scramble to success has
been largely replaced by the organizational crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte wrote that corporate norms based on the pursuit of safety
and security and characterized by conformity had spread to academic
and scientific institutions and prevailed in the white-collar
suburbs then proliferating across America.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the bold visions of individualists had been
replaced by ``the modest aspirations of organization men who lower
their sights to achieve a good job with adequate pay and proper
pension and a nice house in a pleasant community populated with
people as nearly like themselves as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte observed that the suburban housing developments where many
organization men and their families were living were oriented
around children in what he called ``a filarchy.'' The age of a
couple's children, he wrote, was probably the most important factor
in determining which neighbors a couple would make friends with;
typically, he said, they made friends with neighbors whose children
were the same age as their own.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wives of organization men, Whyte said, ``Most wives
agreed with the corporation; they too felt that the good wife is
the wife who adjusts graciously to the system, curbs open
intellectualism or the desire to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our attention to making the organization work, we have come
close to deifying it,'' he said. ``We are describing its defects as
virtues and denying that there is _ or should be _ a conflict
between the individual and the organization. This denial is bad for
the organization. It is worse for the individual. What it does, in
soothing him, is to rob him of the intellectual armor he so badly
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte prescribed resistance. ``Fight the organization,'' he
wrote in his book. ``But not self-destructively.'' He added, ``I
write with the optimistic premise that individualism is as possible
in our times as in others. I speak of individualism within
organizational life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after ``The Organization Man'' appeared, Whyte
recalled how some of the people he had called organization men were
angered by the designation. ``They said I was calling them dirty
conformists,'' he said in 1986, ``But I wasn't. I was an
organizational man myself,'' referring to his work for Vicks and
Fortune magazine and in the Marine Corps, ``and I meant no slight.
Quite the contrary. My point was that these were the people who
were running the country, not the rugged individualists of American
folklore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite changes brought about by the countercultural 1960s, he
concluded that ``the organizational man is still very much alive.''
</P>
<P>
   William Hollingsworth Whyte was born on Oct. 1, 1917, in West
Chester, Pa., in the bucolic Brandywine Valley where his father was
a railroad executive. From childhood, his friends called him
``Holly.'' He attended St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Del., and
went on to Princeton where he graduated in 1939. He then attended
the Vick School of Applied Merchandising, which prepared him for a
junior executive position with Vick Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   World War II intervened and he enlisted in the Marine Corps in
1941. He was discharged in 1945 with the rank of captain and eight
months later he joined the editorial staff of Fortune. In 1952 he
wrote a book entitled ``Is Anybody Listening,'' which carried the
subtitle, ``How and Why U.S. Business Fumbles When It Talks With
Human Beings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Organization Man'' was published, Whyte was
assistant managing editor of Fortune, a post he kept until he left
the magazine in 1958 to devote his time to understanding how man
might best deal with living spaces, both urban and rural. In both
his analysis of the corporate environment and the urban landscape,
Whyte was a champion of spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   As a planner, he once said that planning the future more than
five or 10 years ahead was foolish and intellectually arrogant,
``like playing tennis without a net.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While working at Fortune he came to know and impress the
philanthropist Laurence Rockefeller, who had a keen interest in
conservation. Rockefeller became Whyte's patron, subsidizing
projects involving rural land use, beautification, reclamation,
city planning, the shaping of suburban growth and civic design.
Rockefeller said that Whyte ``changed the way Americans look at
themselves and their cities.'' He added, ``From Bryant Park in
midtown to many hamlets across the country, people are the better
for Holly's creativity and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte's work paralleled and complemented that of Jane Jacobs.
From her home in Toronto, Ms. Jacobs recalled that when Whyte was
at Fortune, he commissioned her to write an article on downtowns
for a magazine series that that would later appear as a book, ``The
Exploding Metropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful thinker about cities, both humane and
hardheaded,'' she said, adding that the article she wrote for him
led to her receiving the Rockefeller grant that enabled her to
write her major work, ``Death and Life of Great American Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Jacobs, Holly Whyte gained an understanding of how
people used cities by walking the streets, sitting on benches and
talking to people. In this way he gained many observations that he
applied to his urban planning. Here, for example, are some of his
perceptions on the life of urban plazas:
</P>
<P>
   ``The most used plazas are the most sociable. They have a
higher-than-average proportion of people in twos and threes and
larger groups; they also have a larger proportion of females, and
of females in pairs. . . Lovers, incidentally, are quite regular.
Contrary to plaza lore, they do not tryst mostly in secluded
places. They're right out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmoozing patterns are similarly consistent. When men gather
in groups to stand and talk, they show a distinct liking for
certain kinds of places. They are, for one thing, strongly
attracted by pillars and flagpoles, obeying a primeval instinct,
perhaps, to have something solid at their backs. They also favor
edges. Schmoozers do not stand often or long in the middle of big
plazas.''
</P>
<P>
   Such observations had a wide appeal. Margot Wellington, a city
planner and former executive director of the Municipal Art Society,
credited Whyte with both inspiring her to become a planner and then
teaching her how to observe urban life. She said that when she came
to New York, Whyte patiently taught her a methodology that combined
anthropology, sociology, art history, statistics and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd walk with him and he would show you tiny wonderful
things,'' she said. ``He spoke and wrote so clearly and he was the
best ethnographer. He told us to watch, to ask questions, and that
after we made some intervention, we had to go back and see how it
was working. It sounds simple, but before him nobody was doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte spent hours, days and years watching the world go by,
often filming the passing scene in time-lapse photographs or
charting pedestrian movement on pads of graph paper. He found that
the corner outside Bloomingdale's at 59th Street and Lexington
Avenue had the most daytime pedestrian traffic. He learned that
having peddlers on the street tended to increase sales in local
stores, particularly if the peddlers sold food.
</P>
<P>
   He said that what people wanted in the city was other people and
that the inner city was as safe as suburban parking lots. He
insisted that the best way to deal with undesirables was not to
bring in more police officers but to make the area in question as
attractive to as many other people as possible. This advice was
specifically followed in the design of many places, among them
Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   His study, ``Conservation Easements'' (Urban Land Institute,
1959) was credited with helping to gain open-space legislation in
California, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Among Whyte's
books on the environment were ``Cluster Development'' (1964), ``The
Last Landscape'' (1968), ``The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces''
(1980) and ``City'' (1989). He edited New York City's Master Plan
in 1969, acted as a consultant on many building and zoning
proposals, and was a Distinguished Professor at Hunter College of
the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was a trustee of the Conservation Foundation and was active
in the Municipal Art Society, the Hudson River Valley Commission
and President Lyndon B. Johnson's Task Force on Natural Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte is survived by his wife, Jenny Bell, a designer he married
in 1964; a daughter, Alexandra, and a granddaughter, Madeleine
Sperber, both of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend of cities, Holly Whyte warned against
``utopianism.'' He believed that the city ``has always been a mess
and always will be something of a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an enemy of what he called ``the fortressing of America''
_ windowless walls, forbidding cement courtyards, bewildering
tunnels, relentlessly grim megastructures and spikes that
discourage sitters. He was in favor of razzmatazz, good honky-tonk
and anything that invested sidewalks with hustle and bustle. ``Up
to seven people per foot of walkway a minute is a nice bustle,'' he
once decided.

 MARKET CORRECTS; NASDAQ off 2.7 PERCENT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- The US stock market took its steepest dive in a
month Tuesday as overseas problems began cropping up again and some
of the enthusiasm for Internet stocks seemed to cool.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 63.84 points, or
2.7 percent, to close at 2320.75. The index, which headed for the
sky during the first six trading days of the year, is now up only a
little more than 5 percent for 1999. Other market measures followed
the Nasdaq during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts traced the market tumble to investor jitters that
Internet share prices have outrun all logic and to news that
Brazil, a major US trading partner, may be headed back toward the
financial brink.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts cautioned against declaring the Internet mania
finally dead, noting that after the market's close several
bellwether technology companies reported strong quarterly profit
growth -- just the sort of thing to rekindle investors' love for
the wildly priced stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, said that
profits during the October-December quarter climbed 18 percent to
just over $2 billion, buoyed by strong personal computer sales in
December. Intel shares had fallen 4 3/16 to 135 9/16 in trading
before the profit announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Internet directory service powerhouse Yahoo Inc. also issued a
strong financial report, saying quarterly profits surged to $25
million from a mere $2 million a year ago. The company, whose share
price rose 13-fold last year, announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   As if absorbing the unexpectedly strong profit numbers were not
enough, investors were confronted with still other evidence Tuesday
of how unusual the environment in which they operate has grown.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced that prices at the wholesale level rose
0.4 percent in December, but that virtually all the increase was
due to higher cigarette prices. For 1998 as a whole, the wholesale
price index actually fell 1.2 percent, the second year in a row
that it has done so. Analysts said that the back-to-back decline
was the first sincee Washington began keeping wholesale price
records in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors turned a nervous eye to Brazil, where stocks
plunged to a four-month low on fear the government will not be able
to meet international aid agency demands to cut its budget deficit.
Some analysts far that failure to meet the deficit goal could
rekindle the kind of globe-girdling financial panic that roiled
markets last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of worries sent the Dow Jones industrial average
down 145.21 points, or 1.5 percent, to 9474.68 while pushing the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 24.37 points, or 1.9 percent, to
1239.51.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in th stock market helped fuel a boomlet in the bond
market, where US Treasury bonds posted thei biggest gain since
November. The rally sent the bellwether 30-year Treasury up 1 3/8,
or $13.75 per $1,000 bond, to 100 17/32, and pushed the yield or
market interest rate down 8 basis points to 5.22 percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: JIM BROWN HAS ADVICE FOR A RETIRING JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BKN-JORDAN-CHICAGO, BKN-JORDAN-AD-COLUMN,
BKN-ARATON-COLUMN, BKN-JORDAN-RDP, BKN-KNICKS-JORDAN,

(JT) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dying isn't hard; it's living that's difficult. That's what Jim
Brown is saying about the termination of Michael Jordan's
basketball life, apparently taking place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Michael could fake a pass, retain the ball in the
palm of his hand, and say in his mellifluous voice: ``Gotcha! Where
did you guys get this retirement rumor, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has imagined a fake-out, saying, ``If he changes his mind,
that's cool.'' Jordan did return once, after his mysterious
sabbatical as a minor league baseball player. But Brown, who
retired from pro football at 29, is totally in favor of Jordan's
retirement at nearly 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wise, it's impactful,'' Brown said Tuesday. ``You can
never top yourself. When it becomes the old you against the young
you, the old you always loses.''
</P>
<P>
   If the old Michael Jordan wanted, he could still be the greatest
player when basketball resumes in early February. Jordan has lived
for every new star, every criticism, every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has a Jordan memory, and I come up with the 1992
finals when the Trailblazers ceded the 3-point line to Jordan, who
never thought of himself as a long-range shooter. Mercenary that he
is, he made 6 of 9 in the first half, shaking his head as if
insulted by being given so much space.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan loved those visceral challenges, but Brown says the trick
is for Jordan to find something meaningful to do with the rest of
his life. Brown faced that in 1965, after being the greatest
running back in professional football for nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blanton Collier let me run outside and let me pass,'' Brown
said. ``I did everything I wanted, but I was a gladiator. The
owners had the money and the power. I was just passing through.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made his remarks Tuesday following the introduction of an
ambitious series by ESPN called ``SportsCentury,'' documenting 50
great athletes, to be presented through 1999. Although the list is
a secret, Brown is surely among them _ as one of the great lacrosse
players in history, the joke went Tuesday. Mark Spitz, Carl Lewis
and Gordie Howe were present Tuesday, and Chris Evert, officially
No. 50, was piped in from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Martina?'' Evert asked with arched eyebrows. (Answer:
presumably a few notches higher.)
</P>
<P>
   Evert said she had no ego problem going out at No. 4, but Brown
said with a throaty chuckle, ``I saw athletes who stayed too long,
but I didn't want to become a second-stringer, a role player. I
wanted to do something high-profile. I had my degree in four years
from Syracuse, and I felt like being an entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown never made Jordanian money as an athlete, and he made his
bundle from action movies. Over the years, he has become a
spokesman for African-American ownership, and claims he has been
responsible for thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been known to criticize Jordan over the years for not
buying a team or other businesses that would extend black
leadership, and Tuesday Brown said, ``I don't want to talk about
Michael Jordan personally, but let's talk about African-American
athletes in general.''
</P>
<P>
   It is great for athletes to receive adulation, Brown said, ``but
in a sense it corrupts the athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown added, ``They get to be entertainers, but some of them
wind up like Mike Tyson: unhappy, with tax problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking as if he could run for 100 yards in the Super Bowl,
Brown said: ``Michael has become the poster child for television,
but I think it's an atrocity, the tricks being played on blacks
today. They keep saying the owners should hire more black coaches,
but even if you had all black coaches, that's not helping black
people. The real problem is that the owners and the agents control
the black athlete. The athletes should take the bull by the horns
and have more control over their lives. Otherwise, they are fooled
into thinking they are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has often insisted that he makes his own contribution by
earning a fortune through endorsements. He has given $1 million to
the University of North Carolina, but he has also taken criticism
for his association with Nike, the manufacturer with plants in poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Jordan has deflected much of the expectations with
the weary reminder that he was merely an athlete, getting ready for
the next game. It was F.Scott Fitzgerald who wrote, ``There are no
second acts in American lives,'' a morbid thought for an athlete
retiring in his prime. It sounds as if Jim Brown, and many others,
will be eagerly monitoring Michael Jordan's attempt to find a
meaningful second act. &QL;

LONG TERM, ITS BEST FOR THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this, the first day in the rest of the NBA's life, it may
seem ludicrous to suggest that not having Michael Jordan is a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is.
</P>
<P>
   Having Michael Jordan for this truncated season would have been
nothing more than a placebo for a sick league. Why not simply
rename the sport ``Michaelball''?
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA is to be salvaged, it must, must, must be bigger than
one man. Having Jordan pegged as the absolute savior in the
aftermath of a damaging lockout would have proven a point, all
right. The point would have been that individuals are more
important than teams. I thought we were now going to get away from
all that.
</P>
<P>
   I've been praying for Michael to retire. A man such as Jordan
should go out with a game- and championship-winning shot. It is the
NBA answer to Ted Williams's home run on his final at-bat, except
that instead of coming in a regular-season game featuring a
second-place team and a seventh-place team, it came in the final
five seconds of the season's most important game. That is the way a
Michael Jordan should go out, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I would have been disappointed if he had come back, if only
because it would have made him a hypocrite. How many times during
the past two years did he say he wouldn't play for anyone other
than Phil Jackson? Fifty? A hundred? Ten thousand? I took him at
his word. There was sound logic involved in that statement, and I
have always had the utmost respect for the man's intellect and
integrity. If he had come back after all he had said, the only
conclusion would have been that he had done it for the money. That
would have meant he was either awesomely greedy or frighteningly
needy. Neither would have been a comforting thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan came along at a time when the league was making a
conscious decision to emphasize the star quality of individuals. No
matter how disproportionately great players had been in the old
days, it was always framed as a team game. It was always the
Minneapolis Lakers, featuring George Mikan. (Yes, I'm aware of the
famed Madison Square Garden marquee that speaks to the contrary.
That was one building.) It was always the Boston Celtics, featuring
Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Even Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were sold as perfect
representatives of their storied franchises. Magic was regarded as
the perfect Laker and Larry was seen as the perfect Celtic. But the
Jordan phenomenon was different. The Chicago Bulls had no great
national image. What would be a perfect Bull? It was very easy to
present the other players as an adjunct to the one great talent.
Hence, Michael and his Jordanaires. The Man himself even was heard
referring to ``my supporting cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was unique. He was a special player and he was a special
personality. I can't wait to read the forthcoming book by David
Halberstam, who spent most of last season with the Bulls and has
written a book that investigates what he calls ``iconization'' in
America. Halberstam is from a generation whose heroes were white
baseball players. He has watched a black man from Wilmington, N.C.,
become the most valued pitchman in American business history. It is
a story that far transcends sport.
</P>
<P>
   Such an original figure fosters admiration, awe, envy, and,
finally, imitation. But the Michael Jordan wannabes have not the
slightest idea what really inspires or drives him, nor do any
possess either his inherent wisdom or his astonishing energy. For
all the jokes about Michael's obsession with golf, he somehow
managed to find the time within our 24-hour living cycle to spend
the requisite time in the gym, didn't he? Never once did he
neglect, disrespect, or abuse either his game or The Game. That's
why he's Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has many long-range problems. Having Jordan to promote
and slobber over might provide a pleasant distraction for the
masses. If the miniseason ends and David Stern is once again
handing over the championship trophy to Jerry Reinsdorf, I'm quite
sure the league would be feeling good about itself, just the way
baseball does in the aftermath of the McGwire-Sosa Show. I'm sure
the TV ratings for a Jordan-driven championship run would be
excellent, but is that the sole criterion by which to judge a
sports league? I trust not.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to abandon the star thing. It is time to get back to
the idea of providing teams that can entertain us with good,
old-fashioned five-man basketball, teams that can actually run
and/or play creative half-court ball. The truth is that none of the
current crop of players has anything close to that
Magic-Larry-Michael appeal, anyway. There are no worthy stars
around whom to peg the next advertising campaigns, and Shaq me no
Shaqs. When a few emerge, perhaps we can talk.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan is around to prop up the league over the next five
months, the powers that be might be fooled into thinking nothing is
really wrong. The truth is that a great deal is wrong. Why did so
many people profess indifference during the lockout? The answer was
obvious to me, even though the league doesn't want to hear it.
People were indifferent because they had come to realize during the
past few years that the games were essentially boring. The
inactive, possession-oriented 80-76 games in which neither team
attempts more than 75 shots are a massive turnoff. If Jordan was
not there to author an athletic poem, the game lacked redeeming
social value.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get on with it. What lasting good would come of having
this abbreviated season once again constructed around Jordan? If
one man is so disproportionately important to the league's
financial health, then it cannot possibly be a league worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term, sure, having Michael Jordan back would be a good
thing. But long-term? Nah. He doesn't need the aggravation, and he
serves his league best by leaving it.

THE 100: A JURY NOT OF PEERS BUT OF KIN, FOE AND TALKING HEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-SENATE)

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the 100 men and women who will decide
President Clinton's fate is related to him by marriage, a
grandmother of the same 3-year-old boy who calls Clinton uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Two others campaigned fiercely against him in the Democratic
primary for the 1992 Presidential race. Another is the older
brother of one of the 13 Republican congressmen appointed to
prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   Three already weighed in on the merits of the case when they
voted on articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives
last month. And many are popping up on television freely and
frequently to discuss their evolving _ or, in some cases, fixed _
opinions on where all of this should lead.
</P>
<P>
   No one is pretending that the Senate trial of Clinton is a clear
mirror of what happens in a criminal or civil courtroom, nor is it
meant to be. But the multifarious connections between the accused,
some of his accusers and other parties show precisely how unusual
this particular proceeding is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unique,'' conceded Sen. Tim Hutchinson,
R &UR; - &LR; Ark., whose brother, Asa, is on the prosecution team. The
Hutchinsons share an apartment in Pentagon City, Va., where the
senator often sees the congressmen poring over trial-related
documents in the second bedroom late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Hutchinson said in an interview this week that the brothers
avoid discussions of evidence and that he is no less fit than any
of the other jurors to hear and evaluate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start down that path,'' he said, referring to the
raising of questions about jurors' impartiality, ``there are so
many unusual conflicts of interest in the Senate that you wouldn't
end up with many in the jury pool.''
</P>
<P>
   You might have to disqualify the judge as well. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, who swore in the senators as jurors last week
and will preside over the trial, played poker weekly with Robert S.
Bennett, one of the president's lawyers, until about two years ago,
when Bennett stopped attending the game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rehnquist participated in critical decisions that
helped bring the accusations against Clinton to light. He and his
fellow justices handed down rulings that permitted lawsuits based
on sexual harassment claims, allowed Paula Corbin Jones to pursue
her civil lawsuit against the president while he was still in
office and validated the authority of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also declined to hear appeals of lower court
rulings that held that executive privilege and attorney-client
privilege should not block several aides and Secret Service agents
who had worked for Clinton from being called before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is the virtual antithesis of what you would expect
in a traditional jury trial,'' said Jonathan Turley, a professor of
constitutional law at George Washington University. ``This is a
virtual rogues' gallery of conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other experts said that this was almost precisely
what the framers of the Constitution envisioned. After all, they
said, the stakes in a Senate trial are not criminal but
professional and political, so a lesser degree of objectivity was
considered acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, senators were expected to approach their jury service
in part as legislators, taking into account what was best for the
country and what their constituents desired.
</P>
<P>
   Senators in past impeachment trials have seldom recused
themselves because of personal connections to a case. One senator
who served as a juror in the trial of President Andrew Johnson a
century ago was his son-in-law, David Patterson, D-Tenn. Patterson
voted against Johnson's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the College of William and
Mary, said that the Constitution allowed senators to use their
discretion in making decisions about whether they could fairly
decide a case.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt said that those who recused themselves in the past did
so most often because they participated in an impeachment debate or
vote as congressmen, then won election to the Senate and took
office before the trial resulting from that impeachment began.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that three current Republican senators _
Connie Mack of Florida, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the majority leader _ recused themselves from the
1989 trial of a federal judge, Alcee L. Hastings, because they had
been in the House of Representatives when it impeached him the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that just as frequently, senators in their positions
have stayed on the jury. Sens. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., Jim
Bunning, R-Ky., and Michael Crapo, R-Idaho, have said they will act
as jurors in Clinton's trial, even though Schumer already voted
against impeachment in the House of Representatives and Bunning and
Crapo already voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer was one of
the most passionate and vociferous opponents of impeachment, and in
his Senate campaign last year, he benefited from four visits to New
York by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was transformed by her
husband's travails into a fund-raising diva and crowd magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that almost every senator has those sorts of
connections. He added that while he has staked out a position that
the wrongdoing attributed to Clinton does not warrant his removal
from office, he would be open to changing that stance if evidence
that was truly new emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Monica Lewinsky said in, say, a deposition in this trial
process, `When I said the president didn't pressure me, I was
making it up,' then of course I'd have to reassess,'' Schumer said
in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., ran against
Clinton in the 1992 Democratic presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   But the person perhaps most closely connected to him is Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., whose daughter, Nicole, is married to Mrs.
Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham. The couple has a 3-year-old son,
Zachary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boxer spends Thanksgivings with the president, and he made
an appearance on Saturday night at the restaurant here where Ms.
Boxer was celebrating the 60th birthday of her husband, Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Boxer said that in the political scheme of the Senate,
that is not so extraordinary. ``Many people have golfed with the
president, dined with the president, or lunched with Ken Starr,''
she said in an interview this week. ``None of us, according to
Senate rules, has to recuse ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Boxer did disqualify herself, it would make the jury even
more homogenous. With her presence, there are only nine women among
the 100 people sitting in judgment. There are no black or Hispanic
senators.
</P>
<P>
   In another oddity, these jurors regularly listen to the advice
of outsiders, and that is perfectly fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of us has hundreds of people calling and lobbying
us,'' Schumer said. ``If that were done to a typical juror, the
juror would be under an obligation to tell the judge and the judge
would replace them.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the impeachment trial of President Clinton
resumes on Thursday, the House and the White House will not only be
arguing over whether the president should be removed from office.
They will be trying to shape the outcome of a critical series of
votes later this month that could decide whether the impeachment
saga ends abruptly or ventures into uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike a normal courtroom drama, the trial of the nation's
42nd president will not necessarily take a steady and straight path
to an uncertain verdict decided by an impartial jury. In fact, most
senators think the verdict in this case is already known _ that the
Senate will never put together the two-thirds vote, or 67 senators,
needed to remove Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   What is in doubt is how long it will take the Senate to get to
the acquittal and at what cost to the Congress and to majority
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some answers will come in late January. Under the bipartisan
trial plan approved last week, senators face a pair of decisions
the week of Jan. 24 after the House and White House complete
opening arguments: First, whether by majority vote to make a quick
exit and simply end the proceedings, and next whether to vote to
open the door to sworn testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   No one now knows how those votes will turn out. ``It is really
way too early to tell,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, a
member of the Senate Republican leadership. Sen. Susan M. Collins,
R-Maine, said, ``The trial will have a dynamic of its own that
makes it unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the coalitions that are likely to form are uncertain, the
math of the Senate is clear. If the Senate trial is to end quickly,
Democrats need to hold all 45 of their own members and then draw
six of the 55 Republicans over to vote with them to dismiss the
case or to prevent witnesses from being called. A vote against
witnesses would likely clear the way for the final vote on the two
articles of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that possible converts could come from the ranks
of Republican moderates such senators as Ms. Collins, Olympia J.
Snowe of Maine, John H. Chaffee of Rhode Island, and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont. Another possible pool of support is from the
Senate barons who balk at the idea of sullying their institution by
having Monica S. Lewinsky testifying in the Senate chamber about
the nature of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This group could include such senators as Ted Stevens of Alaska,
or Pete Domenici of New Mexico or even Trent Lott, the majority
leader from Mississippi. Stevens said on Tuesday that ``I don't
think you make up your mind until you hear the very last word that
is said.'' But he showed some impatience with the case when he
noted that he had spent the weekend looking at 8,000 pages of the
record made in the House. ``There's enormous redundancy in that
record,'' he said, ``Enormous redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week Lott said of witnesses, ``I want somebody to show
me why X, Y and Z witness might be needed, what they might testify
to, and some justification.'' He added, ``And I have to tell you I
have to be persuaded because I'm not, you know, all that excited
about the prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that many Republicans do not want to undercut the
House Republicans, the vote on whether to just dismiss the case
after opening arguments is widely considered unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, however, think that it could be a useful test
vote. For if it shows that there is almost majority sentiment to
end the trial and that there is no way to reach the 67 votes needed
to convict Clinton, they argue it could persuade more Republicans
to vote against hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a motion to dismiss and you can't get 51 votes, the
question is how much short of that will you be?'' asked Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``Is it 48? 45? Is it 33? These numbers
can have a large impact on what will occur next.''
</P>
<P>
   But this could be wishful thinking. This case is not dividing
Republicans along ideological lines, and some of the moderates who
the Democrats hope will turn into allies have already staked out
positions in favor of hearing from some of the cast of characters
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some witnesses are desirable,'' Chaffee said in an interview.
``That doesn't mean an army.'' Ms. Collins has also been an avid
supporter of a limited number of witnesses to clear up conflicting
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some Republicans who are savvy about the internal
dynamics of their caucus say that if the motion to dismiss the case
fails, then it is only logical that the Senate will vote to allow
the trial to proceed with the questioning of witnesses. ``I'm very
confident that would be successful,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the January vote only allows the House and
White House to depose witnesses in private. New majority votes are
needed to bring any of the witnesses onto the Senate floor to
testify. ``What is very hard to handicap is a vote on live
witnesses,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes to allow witnesses to be deposed, it could
throw the chamber into an uncertain hiatus. For the deal struck
last week did not include any agreement or details on how much time
would be alloted for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have said they will be aggressive in any
discovery period. And Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from
South Dakota, warns that his party will not necessarily be pushing
any longer for a quick outcome once witnesses are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot of us will change our positions if the
senators chose to allow the House to bring witnesses,'' he said in
an interview. ``Then many of us would feel equally strongly about
the the White House's opportunity to bring witnesses. We want
symmetry, some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Republicans risk that uncertainty? No matter where they
stand on whether Clinton should be removed from office, Senate
Republicans do have an overriding goal. They want to come out of
the impeachment process with their chamber's dignity intact so they
do not risk their majority.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday they received a warning. As they caucussed in
private to plan a legislative agenda for the year, they received
polling data about the November election from Linda A. Divall, a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The data was a far-ranging assessment of where Republicans
should stand on issues, but it also contained the disturbing news
that voters most often mentioned the Republicans' handling of the
Lewinsky matterr as the factor that caused them the greatest
concern about continuing Republican control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So one by one, senators emerged from the caucus, insisting that
the ongoing trial does not mean that legislative work on issues
such as Social Security, Medicare and tax relief would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have the false assumption that while we're
dealing with the impeachment trial, that we can't also conduct the
nation's business,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``And I would say that's incorrect.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The first ``adventure'' you encounter upon
arriving at Tinseltown Studios, a new theme park and dinner-theater
complex near Disneyland here, is having your name on the guest
list. Next you walk to a large grated door, which opens to reveal a
red carpet and banks of klieg lights shooting into the sky. A
throng of teen-agers descends on you waving autograph pads,
followed by paparazzi setting off flash bulbs in your face,
reporters brandishing note pads and television news crews stopping
you for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And so begins one of the strangest and most revealing spectacles
the entertainment business has created in this decade. At
Tinseltown, customers and guests are the wrong words to describe
those who buy $45 tickets. Once inside the $15 million complex,
they are referred to by the employees as stars. Even the tickets
are designed to look like exclusive gala invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown is predicated on the fantasy of practically every
couch potato, moviegoer, music fan and tabloid reader: For one
night they can be their idols. Despite the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales, while fleeing paparazzi, and the endless intrusions into
the private lives of celebrities from Dennis Rodman to Bill
Clinton, the dream of being famous has hardly faded. Tinseltown is
the logical end point of the culture's increasing celebrity
worship, an answer of sorts to the riddle Woody Allen poses in
``Celebrity'': What would happen if everyone were famous?
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest definition, celebrities are those who are known
to people they do not know: whether an Academy Award-winning actor,
a high school track hero or a white-collar worker caught in an
affair that has the whole office abuzz. In general, the more
strangers who know who you are, the more famous you are. And this
is the basic tenet of Tinseltown. It centers on the ego, on vanity,
on the desire of human beings to prove their specialness to
strangers. There is no shortage of people who believe it is their
destiny to bask in the spotlight, to be the envy of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking up on the carpet, all these people coming up to you
and treating you like you're in real movies _ that's our dream,''
said Susan Scanaliato, a 17-year-old student of the musical theater
who visited Tinseltown recently with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Tinseltown, said Jim Garber, one of its
originators, was based on this desire. ``It started with the idea
that everybody would love to live that fantasy of being at the
Academy Awards, not just watch it on TV,'' he said, ``where you
could walk the carpet, be in the spotlight and, if you're lucky, be
on the stage winning an award.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening Tinseltown was nearly filled to its
700-person capacity, with families from the surrounding area,
groups of students who were friends of Tinseltown staff members,
and a few couples who dressed for the occasion in tuxedos and
evening gowns. Passing through the gates toward the mock movie
studio, the ``stars'' were ambushed on the red carpet as
celebrities at an awards show are accosted by E! Entertainment
Television, which is another symptom of a celebrity-obsessed
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Barraged by questions about who would share their next love
scenes, they improvised: Leonardo Di Caprio, Pamela Anderson,
Barney. Asked about her next movie, a 70-year-old woman replied,
``I only do Shakespeare now.''
</P>
<P>
   After running the gantlet, guests maneuvered through a bar
filled with glitzy blond women and dark-haired male hunks who
fawned over them, posed for photos (which were available for $10 at
the end of the night) and then ducked into a banquet room for a
faux awards show. The stars for a day were greeted by spotlights,
more cameras and excited applause from the servers. Since
Tinseltown is owned by Ogden Entertainment, which is also a food
and beverage company, it cost-effectively merged its businesses and
served dinner, with steak and salmon entrees included in the ticket
price but drinks extra (despite a Pepsi commercial shown on giant
television monitors during the meal).
</P>
<P>
   As they ate, the stars watched the reprise of their red-carpet
interviews. Some stars were ushered to a backstage studio and
edited (rather lamely) into movie scenes: opposite Anthony Perkins
in ``Psycho,'' Kathy Bates in ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' or Sam Neill
in ``Jurassic Park.'' These clips were shown to the audience, which
selected a winner, leading to the evening's climax in which awards
were given out for best actor and actress.
</P>
<P>
   In case the winners weren't creative enough, employees at
Tinseltown _ where the slogan is ``taking unknown people and
turning them into screen legends'' _ handed them a speech derived
from an actual Academy Awards thank you. In case anyone felt left
out, waiters came up to the tables and said things to plainly
dressed people like, ``Wow, look at all the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though this at times seems ludicrous, fame is changing in the
'90s. The multiplication of media has made it much easier and
faster to be a celebrity, whether by being on the Internet,
starting a public-access television show, getting on a talk show,
being selected for ``The Real World'' on MTV, advertising yourself
on billboards or doing something extraordinary or atrocious enough
to get noticed by a news outlet. And fame isn't just for 15 minutes
anymore. Celebrity can last for a lifetime, or even longer. Los
Angeles is full of people who will always be known as ``the guy who
sucked Fergie's toes,'' the granddaughter of Julie Andrews and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tinseltown has upped the ante in the fame game: being a
celebrity is no longer just an aspiration or an accident, it is
also something people do for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly went into Tinseltown with the expectation that it's
a concept that could be exported to other markets,'' said Tom Eder,
a senior vice president at Ogden. ``It's prudent to wait six months
to a year first, but right now the signs are positive. We've gotten
a number of inquiries from tourism commissions in places in Asia,
like Tokyo. But frankly I think there a number of other places in
the U.S. for Tinseltown.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Tinseltown, the aspect guests said they enjoyed
most, is simply seeing themselves and their friends on screen and
onstage. They poke and prod one another, laugh and applauding
whenever a friend appears on the video monitors. It is fame at its
most basic: being recognized and appreciated by a roomful of people
you don't know. The fundamental appeal of Tinseltown is not that
different from the desire to show guests home videos.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there is always someone who wants more. Employees at
Tinseltown constantly see people trying to use whatever means are
available _ usually looks or money, as in the real world _ to get
more attention than the other temporary stars. ``One of our
management people was approached by someone who said he'd pay
$1,000 if his wife could get onstage and sing the `Titanic' theme
song,'' Eder remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown may be just the beginning of an industry centered on
simulating fame. MTV's latest promotion, for example, is a contest
called ``Celebrity Skin,'' named after the album that the rock band
Hole recorded in Los Angeles. The lucky winner, MTV says, will be
transformed into a temporary star with first-class airfare to Los
Angeles, reservations in a trendy hotel, a meeting with a Hollywood
agent, a role in a film, an appearance on ``Entertainment Tonight''
and _ this is the best part _ the services of a personal assistant.
Magazines, radio stations and cable television shows routinely hold
similar contests, offering the chance to be in a television show or
movie or to be a magazine model, lending credence to the idea that
it takes no talent to be famous.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to Woody Allen's conundrum about a world where
everyone is famous may be that once everybody is a star, people
must do something more to stand out. That's why words like
superstar and megastar were invented. When that's not enough,
someone will start calling them planets and galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most celebrities will tell you that fame is a black hole.
In the same way that an amusement park ride turns mining or
mountain climbing into safe thrills open to everyone, Tinseltown
misrepresents fame.
</P>
<P>
   If it wanted to give guests a more accurate celebrity
experience, it would let guests punch the photographers. While the
stars ate dinner, people would bother them for autographs and hand
them scripts, business cards and affidavits. For dessert, the stars
would be served faux tabloid magazines with compromising cover
photographs of them and gossip about what they whispered at dinner.
By the end of the evening, the guests would just want to be alone
at home, where no one could bother them.

BOOK LOVERS GET A SECOND CHANCE TO CATCH TWO WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the winners of 1998's National Book Awards were announced
nearly two months ago, many dedicated readers were privately
embarrassed. Few had read Alice McDermott's novel ``Charming
Billy,'' or Edward Ball's nonfiction ``Slaves in the Family,''
though both titles had garnered substantial critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have so far passed on these two exceptional books,
perhaps through disdain for hardcover prices, both are now
available in paperback and are easily identifable by the gold foil
``National Book Award Winner'' stamped on their covers. Their
paperback prices do reflect their new-found notoriety; ``Charming
Billy,'' published in paperback by Delta, is $12.95; Ballantine's
``Slaves in the Family'' is a hefty $15.95. That still represents
some savings over their hardcover prices of $22 and $30,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those are also reasonable prices for two wonderful works that
will remain part of any discerning reader's permanent collection.
``Charming Billy'' and ``Slaves in the Family'' are both worthy NBA
winners, though in each case the choice has proved controversial.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's win is tainted in some eyes because the NBA panel of
judges selected ``Charming Billy'' over Tom Wolfe's tour de
literary force, ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, it is easy to understand why McDermott got the
nod. Wolfe's book had already received massive publicity, shooting
to the top of the bestseller lists the day it was released.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, among critics and publishing insiders, there was a
sense that McDermott, a fine writer, had paid long-term
professional dues without similar acclaim. Few recall that
McDermott was also an NBA fiction finalist in 1987 for ``That
Night,'' another splendid work that has long been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, it is assumed that NBA voters enjoyed reaction to
their 1997 fiction pick of Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' over
the heavy favorite, ``Underworld,'' by the better-known Don
DeLillo. The NBA awards have always lagged far behind the Pulitzers
in media attention; Frazier over DeLillo inspired a firestorm of
stories, just as McDermott over Wolfe has done. Over the next
decade or so, it's entirely possible that the NBA will
enthusiastically embrace a tradition of elevating little-known
writers.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McDermott's wonderfully crafted take on a dead
alcoholic and the people who love him anyway can certainly stand on
its own merits. McDermott especially excels at highlighting just
the right small details _ how a flower smells, the exact color of
bloodshot eyes. Her characters are never larger than life, just
absolutely true to life.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ball, on the other hand, has come in for some post-win
gibes for having the temerity to painstakingly describe his Anglo
ancestors' lordly attitude toward their African-American chattel.
Yes, those attitudes of the past are often offensive to read about
now. But honesty is not always politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   Ball would have earned all sorts of moral congratulations had he
insisted on tracking down survivors of Ball family slaves and
recording their words in ``Slaves in the Family'' just as often as
his own. But Ball's writing is exemplary, a real surprise because
he's never published a book before, having instead earned limited
literary credentials as a writer for The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   So, unlike Alice McDermott, we must wonder whether Edward Ball
will ever contend for another NBA award. He can write with
compassion and intensity about his own family; now he must prove he
can bring the same book-length writing fire to other, less personal
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But that question can be left for the future. Right now,
``Slaves in the Family'' is back on local bookstore shelves
alongside ``Charming Billy.'' For those who missed them the first
time around, it is better late than never.

HUMBLE START, PREMATURE END FOR JORDAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's ninth-grade coach cut him.
</P>
<P>
   His college coach kept him on a tight offensive leash.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career at North Carolina ended in gloom. Indiana
University dumped the Tar Heels in the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA
Tournament. Told by Bobby Knight just before the game that Jordan
was his defensive assignment, somebody named Don Dakich excused
himself, went to the locker-room john, threw up, and then held his
man to eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Redemption for Jordan was expected to come in the 1984 NBA
draft, and did. Kinda.
</P>
<P>
   Portland made a decision that lives in basketball infamy, taking
7-footer Sam Bowie with the second pick.
</P>
<P>
   Houston also bypassed Jordan, but since the Rockets used the
first pick on Hakeem Olajuwon, history is much kinder.
</P>
<P>
   A bad bunch of Bulls in Chicago then had Jordan fall their way,
except ...
</P>
<P>
   An up-and-coming Mavericks team from Dallas, on their way to a
first playoff appearance, played their worst game of the previous
season on Nov. 4, 1983, in Cleveland. The Cavaliers were awful, but
they trounced Dallas, 105-84.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, if the Mavericks had won that night,
Cleveland, not the Bulls, would have had the third draft choice in
the summer of '84.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pick was owned by the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Next question. Knowing what we now know about the Mavericks'
draft history, would they have blown the Jordan pick?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. At least, if they had heeded the astute advice of a former
Dallas sports page columnist. No name, please, but the guy has a
mustache and hooked nose spread across a radio face. Before that
draft, this idiot wrote the immortal words, ``the Mavericks need to
go big, bigger, biggest. Forget Jordan, just keep drafting big men
until you get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, the Mavericks already had Ro Blackman, Derek Harper
and Brad Davis in the backcourt. How could Jordan be an improvement
on that? How indeed.
</P>
<P>
   All factors considered, it amounts to rather humble beginnings
for what would become The Greatest Show on Earth, sports-wise.
</P>
<P>
   This time, without doubt, Jordan means it. He's retiring. The
other time, he was just recharging batteries while seeking to
solve, very unsuccessfully, the mystery of the curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Now we all lose. The Bulls certainly, but who cares? The NBA
certainly, but who cares? But what baseball had last summer with
McGwire-Sosa is what sports fans have had for years every time the
Bulls tipped it off. Jordan wasn't about a game, a team, or a
league. In sports, Jordan was today's Babe Ruth. How many more
years or decades until we find tomorrow's Michael Jordan? If ever.
</P>
<P>
   The ending is hardly a surprise, and based on the current
troubled state of the NBA, maybe it's the perfect time to walk.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who thought Jerry-Jimmy was the mother of
all ego blunders in sports, at least for this era, the retirement
of Jordan is now the topper.
</P>
<P>
   He does leave prematurely, with his game still intact, and the
probable reason centers on spite. Here's to you, Jerry Krause, and
you, too, Jerry Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Krause is the Bulls' general manager. Over the years, he has
done an excellent job of building the Bulls around Jordan, but that
also was his downfall. Krause has never been comfortable with the
obvious _ Jordan is the show. Jordan is the one current Bulls'
player Krause did not put on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf is the owner who allowed harsh feeling between Jordan
and Krause to fester and grow for years. Blame him heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Six world championships in eight seasons for Chicago, but with
each, the internal war escalated between Krause and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was last season, as the Bulls were headed for another
title, when Krause finally went off the deep end. ``Players don't
win world championships, organizations do,'' Krause said. He was
actually talking about the expected difficulty in re-signing
free-agent-to-be Scottie Pippen. But it was an insult to Jordan,
and Jordan knew it. So, be assured, did Krause.
</P>
<P>
   The pawn in their battle became coach Phil Jackson, Jordan's
guy. Krause constantly pushed for Jackson to retire. Jordan
repeatedly said if Jackson did, he would also quit. Jackson did.
Now Jordan will.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan performed his job better than anyone in NBA history.
Krause's front-office work complemented Jordan's greatness. How
could they not live happily ever after? Where was Reinsdorf when it
came time to personally put a muzzle on Krause?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's now a career for Michael Jordan, who, by the way,
the Mavericks could have used after all. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's
``Sports at Six'' can be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP
NewsTalk 820. \Ntagbottom:rgalloway\Nstar-telegram.com

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The first ``adventure'' you encounter upon
arriving at Tinseltown Studios, a new theme park and dinner-theater
complex near Disneyland here, is having your name on the guest
list. Next you walk to a large grated door, which opens to reveal a
red carpet and banks of klieg lights shooting into the sky. A
throng of teen-agers descends on you waving autograph pads,
followed by paparazzi setting off flash bulbs in your face,
reporters brandishing note pads and television news crews stopping
you for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And so begins one of the strangest and most revealing spectacles
the entertainment business has created in this decade. At
Tinseltown, customers and guests are the wrong words to describe
those who buy $45 tickets. Once inside the $15 million complex,
they are referred to by the employees as stars. Even the tickets
are designed to look like exclusive gala invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown is predicated on the fantasy of practically every
couch potato, moviegoer, music fan and tabloid reader: For one
night they can be their idols. Despite the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales, while fleeing paparazzi, and the endless intrusions into
the private lives of celebrities from Dennis Rodman to Bill
Clinton, the dream of being famous has hardly faded. Tinseltown is
the logical end point of the culture's increasing celebrity
worship, an answer of sorts to the riddle Woody Allen poses in
``Celebrity'': What would happen if everyone were famous?
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest definition, celebrities are those who are known
to people they do not know: whether an Academy Award-winning actor,
a high school track hero or a white-collar worker caught in an
affair that has the whole office abuzz. In general, the more
strangers who know who you are, the more famous you are. And this
is the basic tenet of Tinseltown. It centers on the ego, on vanity,
on the desire of human beings to prove their specialness to
strangers. There is no shortage of people who believe it is their
destiny to bask in the spotlight, to be the envy of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking up on the carpet, all these people coming up to you
and treating you like you're in real movies _ that's our dream,''
said Susan Scanaliato, a 17-year-old student of the musical theater
who visited Tinseltown recently with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Tinseltown, said Jim Garber, one of its
originators, was based on this desire. ``It started with the idea
that everybody would love to live that fantasy of being at the
Academy Awards, not just watch it on TV,'' he said, ``where you
could walk the carpet, be in the spotlight and, if you're lucky, be
on the stage winning an award.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening Tinseltown was nearly filled to its
700-person capacity, with families from the surrounding area,
groups of students who were friends of Tinseltown staff members,
and a few couples who dressed for the occasion in tuxedos and
evening gowns. Passing through the gates toward the mock movie
studio, the ``stars'' were ambushed on the red carpet as
celebrities at an awards show are accosted by E! Entertainment
Television, which is another symptom of a celebrity-obsessed
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Barraged by questions about who would share their next love
scenes, they improvised: Leonardo Di Caprio, Pamela Anderson,
Barney. Asked about her next movie, a 70-year-old woman replied,
``I only do Shakespeare now.''
</P>
<P>
   After running the gantlet, guests maneuvered through a bar
filled with glitzy blond women and dark-haired male hunks who
fawned over them, posed for photos (which were available for $10 at
the end of the night) and then ducked into a banquet room for a
faux awards show. The stars for a day were greeted by spotlights,
more cameras and excited applause from the servers. Since
Tinseltown is owned by Ogden Entertainment, which is also a food
and beverage company, it cost-effectively merged its businesses and
served dinner, with steak and salmon entrees included in the ticket
price but drinks extra (despite a Pepsi commercial shown on giant
television monitors during the meal).
</P>
<P>
   As they ate, the stars watched the reprise of their red-carpet
interviews. Some stars were ushered to a backstage studio and
edited (rather lamely) into movie scenes: opposite Anthony Perkins
in ``Psycho,'' Kathy Bates in ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' or Sam Neill
in ``Jurassic Park.'' These clips were shown to the audience, which
selected a winner, leading to the evening's climax in which awards
were given out for best actor and actress.
</P>
<P>
   In case the winners weren't creative enough, employees at
Tinseltown _ where the slogan is ``taking unknown people and
turning them into screen legends'' _ handed them a speech derived
from an actual Academy Awards thank you. In case anyone felt left
out, waiters came up to the tables and said things to plainly
dressed people like, ``Wow, look at all the stars.''

NAILON THE LIFE OF TCU'S PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Nailon says he's used to staying up until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Carroll, too.
</P>
<P>
   So when TCU's 92-79 victory against SMU ended slightly after 1
a.m. on Tuesday, both were claiming to have plenty of energy to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually getting my second wind at around 11,'' Nailon
said.
</P>
<P>
   With a raucous, fraternity party-like crowd looking on and an
ESPN audience looking in, Nailon assured that all eyes were looking
at him.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's preseason all-American looked like a whirlwind against SMU
at Moody Coliseum in Dallas, scoring 25 points and yanking down 22
rebounds in a game billed as a big ol' pajama party.
</P>
<P>
   TCU and SMU provided a good show, too.
</P>
<P>
   From stands packed with fans to chants hurled back and forth to
a fast-paced, back-and-forth game, TCU vs. SMU looked like a real,
honest-to-goodness college basketball rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs athletic director Eric Hyman said Monday's event
reminded him of North Carolina-North Carolina State games he
attended while serving as a Wolfpack associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is college basketball,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs were plentiful, with two about ESPN personalities _
``Impeach Clinton. We want Stuart Scott for President'' and ``Chris
Berman, be my Valentine,'' _ drawing plenty of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   And the boisterous crowd might have helped the undersized and
underdog Mustangs hang with TCU for a half, and a little longer,
even putting a little scare into the usually unflappable Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Billy Tubbs expected as much. He said coming in,
``Don't you figure we're going to get everyone's best shot?''
</P>
<P>
   Going undefeated through regular-season Western Athletic
Conference play last season hardly endeared Tubbs and Co. to the
rest of the WAC, and programs from as close as SMU to as far as
Nevada-Las Vegas want to be credited with stopping a streak that
has reached 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, meanwhile, is looking at something bigger than just keeping
a streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all of this as tourney preparation,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs players and coaches realize that a big stride needs
to be taken for TCU to become better than a one-and-done footnote
in March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   A hardly overpowering SMU team showed a couple of TCU
weaknesses: like depth and inconsistent perimeter play.
</P>
<P>
   When referees whistled Carroll for his fourth personal foul with
6:05 remaining, TCU had two guards with four fouls and a single
viable option to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd be going in,'' TCU swingman Derale Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem? Wilson had a cast removed from his left foot
Monday afternoon and was dressing for his first game since breaking
the foot against Oklahoma State on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had struggled at times with its outside game; the guards
have been an unstoppable-looking group when 3-pointers are falling,
a stoppable-looking group when they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   As the end drew near last night, though, that was forgotten
beneath chants of ``Crosstown whipping boys'' from Frogs fans and a
little casual conversation between Nailon and SMU's Damon Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him we were going to beat them again,'' Nailon
said. ``I guess I did have a pretty good time.''

 ANAHEIM, Calif.: the stars.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though this at times seems ludicrous, fame is changing in the
'90s. The multiplication of media has made it much easier and
faster to be a celebrity, whether by being on the Internet,
starting a public-access television show, getting on a talk show,
being selected for ``The Real World'' on MTV, advertising yourself
on billboards or doing something extraordinary or atrocious enough
to get noticed by a news outlet. And fame isn't just for 15 minutes
anymore. Celebrity can last for a lifetime, or even longer. Los
Angeles is full of people who will always be known as ``the guy who
sucked Fergie's toes,'' the granddaughter of Julie Andrews and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tinseltown has upped the ante in the fame game: being a
celebrity is no longer just an aspiration or an accident, it is
also something people do for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly went into Tinseltown with the expectation that it's
a concept that could be exported to other markets,'' said Tom Eder,
a senior vice president at Ogden. ``It's prudent to wait six months
to a year first, but right now the signs are positive. We've gotten
a number of inquiries from tourism commissions in places in Asia,
like Tokyo. But frankly I think there a number of other places in
the U.S. for Tinseltown.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Tinseltown, the aspect guests said they enjoyed
most, is simply seeing themselves and their friends on screen and
onstage. They poke and prod one another, laugh and applauding
whenever a friend appears on the video monitors. It is fame at its
most basic: being recognized and appreciated by a roomful of people
you don't know. The fundamental appeal of Tinseltown is not that
different from the desire to show guests home videos.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there is always someone who wants more. Employees at
Tinseltown constantly see people trying to use whatever means are
available _ usually looks or money, as in the real world _ to get
more attention than the other temporary stars. ``One of our
management people was approached by someone who said he'd pay
$1,000 if his wife could get onstage and sing the `Titanic' theme
song,'' Eder remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown may be just the beginning of an industry centered on
simulating fame. MTV's latest promotion, for example, is a contest
called ``Celebrity Skin,'' named after the album that the rock band
Hole recorded in Los Angeles. The lucky winner, MTV says, will be
transformed into a temporary star with first-class airfare to Los
Angeles, reservations in a trendy hotel, a meeting with a Hollywood
agent, a role in a film, an appearance on ``Entertainment Tonight''
and _ this is the best part _ the services of a personal assistant.
Magazines, radio stations and cable television shows routinely hold
similar contests, offering the chance to be in a television show or
movie or to be a magazine model, lending credence to the idea that
it takes no talent to be famous.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to Woody Allen's conundrum about a world where
everyone is famous may be that once everybody is a star, people
must do something more to stand out. That's why words like
superstar and megastar were invented. When that's not enough,
someone will start calling them planets and galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most celebrities will tell you that fame is a black hole.
In the same way that an amusement park ride turns mining or
mountain climbing into safe thrills open to everyone, Tinseltown
misrepresents fame.
</P>
<P>
   If it wanted to give guests a more accurate celebrity
experience, it would let guests punch the photographers. While the
stars ate dinner, people would bother them for autographs and hand
them scripts, business cards and affidavits. For dessert, the stars
would be served faux tabloid magazines with compromising cover
photographs of them and gossip about what they whispered at dinner.
By the end of the evening, the guests would just want to be alone
at home, where no one could bother them.

MCGWIRE'S RECORD HOME-RUN BASEBALL BRINGS $2.7 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the bidding reached $1 million, the giggling
broke out. At $2 million, a cheer went up. And when it closed at a
shade past $3 million _ $2.7 million plus commission _ the crowd
erupted with cheers, whistles, and a roar.
</P>
<P>
   The object of this auction-block frenzy: a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Mark McGwire's record-smashing 70th home-run
baseball, which he hit on the final day of a season that was
drenched in home-run fever.
</P>
<P>
   The 66th and final home-run ball hit by Sammy Sosa, McGwire's
cheerful rival, went for much less _ $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   But even that exceeded the $125,000 put up just a few months ago
for the first home run that Babe Ruth knocked out of Yankee Stadium
_ which, until Tuesday night, was the most that anyone ever paid
for a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the big winners phoned in their bids. Their identities
for the moment were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The record-busting _ which took place at a small, packed theater
inside Madison Square Garden _ came as no surpise to Arlan
Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, the auction house that ran the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably what people will think back on as the good old
days,'' Ettinger said of baseball's summer of '98. ``Everything was
joyful. This was an escape, a time that people loved. With every
home run, the hugging and the kissing in the stands, the fathers
embracing their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mix that with a strong economy, a terrific stock market,''
he added, ``and, well, things just take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports memorabilia has grown to a multibillion-dollar business
in the past decade, said Richard Simon, Guernsey's consultant for
this auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history, it's love of the game, it's memories,'' Simon
said. ``In my own collection, I have a seat from the Polo
Grounds,'' where the New York Giants played. ``I could have sat in
that seat when I was 10 years old. The times I went to the Polo
Grounds ... were the best memories of my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In Don DeLillo's great novel, ``Underworld,'' the hero, Nick
Shay, pays $34,500 for a baseball claimed to be the home-run ball
that Bobby Thomson hit in the Giants-Dodgers playoff game of Oct.
3, 1951 _ ``the shot heard 'round the world,'' as gleeful Giants
fans called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Thomson hit the homer,'' one character explains, ``people
rushed outside. ... Maybe it was the last time people spontaneously
went out of their houses for something. Some wonder, some
amazement. Like a footnote to the end of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo portrays the hunt for the vanished ball as a pursuit of
lost innocence, noting that, on the same day as the homer, the
Soviet Union exploded its first hydrogen bomb _ another sort of
shot heard 'round the world, and the real precursor to the end of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa homerun race might come to symbolize, in some
future novel, a time of outsized exuberance, when not just home-run
records but stock prices, buying sprees, political scandals _ and
sports memorabilia auctions _ ballooned beyond the breaking point,
then ballooned some more.
</P>
<P>
   If this celebration, too, ends up followed by a letdown, the
foreshadowing might be found in a news clipping.
</P>
<P>
   While researching his book, DeLillo discovered the coincidence
of the Thomson homer and the Soviet bomb-blast when he saw the two
headlines side by side on the front page of an old New York Times
microfiche.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the New York Times of Sept. 28, 1998, which
devoted two stories to McGwire's 70th homer, some future scribe
might be similarly struck by an adjoining headline that reads,
``Calibrated Risk: US and IMF Lead Push for Brazil Bail-Out Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the big deal over the home-run baseballs is, and always
will be, much simpler. On his final Saturday-morning radio program
of 1998, NPR's Scott Simon complained that McGwire and Sosa _ not
President Clinton and Kenneth Starr _ should have been Time
magazine's Men of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burly Cardinal and the sunny Cub, embracing at home plate
... handled their moments in history this year with humility,
humanity, grace, and joy,'' the radio host noted. ``Now that's
news!''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be why one ball fan laid out millions to preserve
such peaks close at hand.

GEORGE W. BUSH AND THE NATIONAL SPIN ON TEXAS STATE POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Legislature, which meets every other
year for only 140 days, cranked up for business Tuesday with the
prospect of a particularly lively stretch, even by Texas standards,
of political theater.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators assembled beneath the pink granite dome at the top
of Congress Avenue and were faced not only with a deliciously
tempting budget surplus but an extremely popular Republican
governor who, many believe, has a reasonable chance of becoming the
country's next president. Even the outgoing lieutenant governor,
Bob Bullock, a Democrat, introduced Gov. George W. Bush to the
legislators Tuesday as ``the future president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is far from alone in having a budget surplus. Building on
a strong economy and a steady migration off the welfare rolls,
states from the Atlantic to the Pacific find themselves with
coffers bulging. The National Conference of State Legislators
figures that state budgets are in their best shape since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   How Texas may be different is that the struggle over what to do
with that money _ how much will go to tax cuts and how much to
education, as the argument has nearly always broken down when
states have had surpluses in recent years _ will be played out
through the prism of a presidential campaign. And as governors from
Ronald Reagan to Michael Dukakis to Bill Clinton discovered,
actions taken at the statehouse level can cast a disproportionately
large shadow when refracted onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not decided if I'm running yet; I'm still thinking
about it,'' Bush said Tuesday morning, sipping coffee and trying to
shake the flu before Tuesday's inaugural address. One foot was
resting on the edge of his desk in the south wing of the old
capitol, a working copy of the inaugural address on top of the
stack of papers before him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he understands that the shadow of his potential
presidential bid will color much of what happens in Austin this
spring. But rather than trying to calculate how to capitalize on
it, he insists he is more concerned with minimizing the disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself, will it disrupt the session?'' Bush said. ``It
will only disrupt the session if I'm not around, if the head of the
appropriations committee wants to come meet with me and I'm off
somewhere campaigning. So that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The session is likely to end sometime in May, and he may well
make his decision about the presidency before then. But whatever
the decision, the governor said, he will not campaign until the
session has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm not going to leave the state, but I'm not
going to be campaigning,'' he said. ``I'm going to stay here and
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sometimes deflects questions about national issues by
saying, as he did Tuesday, that he has no opinion to offer because
``I'm not running for national office.'' But some national issues
he does not mind talking about.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly glad, he said, to see Republican and
Democratic senators standing side by side last week to announce
their compromise on the handling of President Clinton's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the Senate has got to fulfill its duty,
and they seem to be doing that in a very serious and proper way,''
Bush said. The president's actions must be accounted for, he said,
because the country will not be able to get out of its
sex-and-scandal morass ``as long as the current embarrassment is
still on the national scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not optimistic that, even if the trial is handled
fairly and fully, the country and its elected leaders will
immediately move on. ``I doubt it,'' he said. ``It's a cynical
world. This will just be Step One.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is a way to break the cycle of charges and
counter charges involving sexual indiscretions and other tabloid
topics, he said. ``I think it's time for everyone to take a step
back and say, is this really what we want to put our country
through?'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators gathering Tuesday in the marbled corridors
of the Austin capitol said they thought a potential Bush
presidential bid would have a marked effect on the outcome of the
session, either as political opponents try to make the governor
stumble or saddle him with a political albatross or as supporters
bend over backward to provide him with a strong springboard for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are interested in making the governor
look good,'' said state Sen. Bill Ratliff, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Bush was running for re-election, a race that he
won handily, he and other statewide candidates made promises based
on a projected budget surplus of $6.3 billion. Revised estimates
place the surplus at $5.6 billion, so the governor said some of
those promises may need to be trimmed back.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Ratliff said, is that expectations were raised too
high by the candidates. A significant chunk of that $5.6 billion _
about $3.3 billion _ will need to pay for the 70,000 new public
school students who arrive in Texas every year, before the
remainder can be allocated for new programs or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say it real fast, $2 billion sounds like a lot of
money, but when you talk about a state the size of Texas, that's
not as much money as you might think,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Other potentially contentious subjects in the session include
utility deregulation, school vouchers and limits on suburban
expansion. But most in the capitol said they thought that the
argument over the budget surplus would dominate the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a budget session,'' Bush said. ``And what happens
when you have this kind of a budget, with a surplus, is that people
start putting together a wish list. But there's not enough money to
make everyone's wish come true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the campaign last year, he proposed sending $1 billion back
to local school districts, with the ``hope it goes for teachers
salaries.'' Some opponents now are pushing for a direct,
state-mandated pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a suspicion in some people's minds that the money
will turn into Astroturf and administrators' salaries,'' said state
Sen. Teel Bivins, a Republican and the new president pro tempore.
Nevertheless, the governor said, he does not want to bypass the
local districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also wanted to commit $200 million to help pay for
the construction of new schools and for new textbooks and programs
to fulfill his goal of teaching every child to read by the third
grade.
</P>
<P>
   In tax cuts, while some are pushing for a drop in the state's
6.25 percent sales tax, Bush said he was more interested in
property tax cuts (he advocated $2 billion for that during the
election), state incentives for research and development, tax cuts
for small businesses and an end to sales taxes for diapers and
over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower surplus projections, Bush said he thought
there would be enough to address all of these promises, but maybe
with less money. ``I got elected on the basis of a tax cut,'' he
said, although ``all of the numbers I campaigned on may need to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower surplus projections should be taken as a warning, the
governor said, that perhaps the state's economy is not as strong as
some had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that in times of plenty, we should not
overspend,'' he said. ``We should do a few things and do them well.
We need to stay focused. This is no time to create a lot of
government programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that his inaugural speech next week would not
be ``a long-winded affair.'' He will try to use it to set the tone
for his second term rather than offer specific proposals. That can
wait for his State of the State speech to legislators later this
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my tone will be just about the same as it was in my
first inaugural address: optimistic and upbeat,'' Bush said. ``What
I am looking forward to is remembering this inauguration. The last
one went by so fast it was kind of a blur.''

AIR'S DEPARTURE LEAVES A VACUUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With next to nothing left for Michael Jordan in the NBA, Michael
Jordan left the NBA with next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement, which is expected to be announced at an 11
a.m. news conference today in Chicago, not only slam-dunks the
league's most popular and profitable Air-a, it leaves the NBA void
of a transcendent star for the first time since Magic Johnson and
Larry Bird breathed life into a suffocating league 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always used Mike as a kind of crutch,'' said Seattle
SuperSonics all-star Gary Payton. ``There may have been problems,
but when he went off for 55 points everything was all right again.
It's scary, but it's time we fend for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bird, now coach of the Indiana Pacers: ``Him leaving will
hurt the league and hurt it bad. But it shouldn't kill it. With all
the money we're throwing at guys these days, surely one or two of
them will step up and take the baton, carry the mantle. Ready or
not, somebody needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving
and Bird/Magic did before him, Jordan is reaching out to pass the
torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew one of these days that Michael would retire. It's a
sad but inevitable fact,'' NBA commissioner David Stern said. ``But
in a way, his greatness has been overshadowing the best of the
rest, if you will. There may never be another like him, but I know
we've got a lot of talented players itching for the chance to take
this league to new heights.''
</P>
<P>
   But can there possibly be another larger-than-life persona who,
like Muhammad Ali and Babe Ruth, transcends sports? Another star
who provokes casual fans to watch NBA games? Another icon who pumps
$10 billion into the league? Another player who can win 10 scoring
titles, five MVP awards and six championships?
</P>
<P>
   Without Jordan, will the NBA's torch be reduced to a match?
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you ever prepare for this?'' asked former Bulls
teammate Steve Kerr. ``There's never been a player like him, and
there's never been a void left like the one he's about to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the latest ``next Jordan'' is a prospective member of
the Billionaire Boys Club, a dynamic dozen that includes nine
all-stars and 11 members 25 or younger that could conceivably have
a combined salary near $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the most financially explosive era in league history,
five players have $100 million, multiyear contracts: Minnesota
Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett, Los Angeles Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal, Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning, Washington
Wizards forward Juwan Howard and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn
Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by their youthful talent, fan appeal and a
lucrative-yet-toned-down free-agency system, at least eight more
players could close in on membership by 2000: Detroit Pistons
forward Grant Hill, Vancouver Grizzlies forward Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, Orlando Magic guard Penny Hardaway, San Antonio Spurs
forward Tim Duncan, Boston Celtics forward Antoine Walker,
Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, Lakers guard Kobe Bryant
and New Jersey Nets forward Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   From that exclusive group, there is an anointed one: 20-year-old
Bryant. With eye-popping athleticism, Jordan-like hang time,
creativity and unbridled enthusiasm, Bryant is already popular
enough with fans to be voted a starter in last year's All-Star Game
despite coming off the bench for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming just to be on the court with Michael, now
I'm starting to be compared to him,'' Bryant said last year. ``But
I don't think we can replace him with just one guy. The whole
league has to take a step up. Can I do it by myself? Are you
crazy?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hill, knowing all too well the pressure of being a
former ``next Jordan,'' is throwing his support behind Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many `next Michael Jordans' I think we've
all lost count,'' said Hill. ``I think I've been pushed aside now
and it's Kobe's turn. I can tell him how it is; it's too much for
one man. We've got to gang up on Michael's image if we hope to
match what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who supplanted Johnson as the youngest All-Star starter,
averaged 18 points in 26 minutes per game and became the people's
choice by playing above the rim with a fan-friendly,
improvisational flair reminiscent of a younger, unpolished Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already got the young fans in his pocket,'' said Phoenix
Suns all-star Jason Kidd. ``When they grow up and really start
spending money on the game, they'll still be Kobe fans. Honestly,
he's got a chance to be bigger than Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan refuses to single out Bryant. He calls Bryant
``impressive,'' labels Payton ``maybe the best player in the
league'' and gave instant credibility to Cavaliers rookie Derek
Anderson, Sonics forward Vin Baker, Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen
and Mavericks guard Michael Finley by hand-picking them to wear his
new shoe for the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley often draws comparison to a young Jordan because of his
Chicago roots, gravity-defying dunks and explosive offensive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll never be another person like Michael,'' Finley said.
``With the combination of what he did on the court and off, there's
no way. He's that once-in-a-lifetime guy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal consistently fills arenas and has cross-over appeal
through movies and rap music, but he also constantly misses free
throws. After an impressive first two seasons in which he actually
got more All-Star Game votes than Jordan, Hill's play and
popularity seem to have hit a plateau. Garnett has as much physical
talent as any in the group, but he alienated some fans by turning
down a $121 million contract only to sign for $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just his physical ability, there would have been a
lot of Michael Jordans run through this league by now,'' Bird said.
``But talent's just part of it. Michael's such a competitor, such a
good ambassador. There's a reason his footsteps are going to be so
hard to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Duncan: ``We're 13 different people, but maybe we can
pull in the same direction. It's going to take that to replace
Michael.''

SALES OF HIGH-END CHIPS HELP INTEL BEAT ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by strong sales of its high-end
microprocessors and increased operating efficiencies, the
Intel &UR;  &LR; Corp. reported fourth-quarter financial results Tuesday that
substantially exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates. But Intel
advised analysts that sales for the first quarter of 1999 are
likely to fall, following a normal seasonal pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported its results after the market's close. After
touching a new high on Monday, Intel shares closed Tuesday at
$135.5625, down $4.1875, amid a broad drop in the technology-laden
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Intel reported earnings of $2.1 billion,
or $1.19 a diluted share, up 18 percent from $1.7 billion, or 98
cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues
rose 17 percent, to $7.6 billion, from $6.5 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Intel to earn $1.07 a share, according to the
First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Intel's strong fourth-quarter results reflected
the success of the company's strategy to segment the market, by
offering the Celeron chip at the low end, its mainstay Pentium II
in the middle, and the Pentium Xeon at the high end. Intel also
benefited from a major effort to improve manufacturing efficiency,
using a new process called .25 micron that squeezes more circuitry
onto a smaller piece of silicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had strong sales growth, but the real surprise is the
improvement in gross margins,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He credited the move to .25
micron, product mix and a focus on costs. ``Sales were up $883
million sequentially, but the cost of goods came down $16
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has made a rapid comeback from a weak first half of 1998,
when it was caught simultaneously by an inventory glut among major
personal computer manufacturers and the shift in demand to
sub-$1,000 personal computers, where its products fell short of
products from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have believed the company could have survived
the upheaval in the PC industry as well as they have,'' said Drew
Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen. ``They have done a spectacular job
in becoming a more efficient manufacturer and in segmenting the
market.'' However, he said it was not clear that strong sales of
the high-end Xeon product could continue to offset the relatively
lower-margin low end.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Intel reported earnings of $6.1 billion, or $3.45
a diluted share, down 13 percent from $6.9 billion, or $3.87 a
share, in 1997. Revenues rose 5 percent, to $26.3 billion in 1998
from $25.1 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it expects revenue for the first quarter to be down
from the fourth quarter's $7.6 billion because of seasonal factors.
The company also said it expects its gross profit margin percentage
in the first quarter to be down slightly from 58 percent in the
fourth quarter. Intel said its gross margin expectation for 1999
was 57 percent, compared with 54 percent for all of 1998.

MCGWIRE'S RECORD HOME-RUN BASEBALL BRINGS $2.7 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the bidding reached $1 million, the giggling
broke out. At $2 million, a cheer went up. And when it closed at a
shade past $3 million _ $2.7 million plus commission _ the crowd
erupted with cheers, whistles, and a roar.
</P>
<P>
   The object of this auction-block frenzy: a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Mark McGwire's record-smashing 70th home-run
baseball, which he hit on the final day of a season that was
drenched in home-run fever.
</P>
<P>
   The 66th and final home-run ball hit by Sammy Sosa, McGwire's
cheerful rival, went for much less _ $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   But even that exceeded the $125,000 put up just a few months ago
for the first home run that Babe Ruth knocked out of Yankee Stadium
_ which, until Tuesday night, was the most that anyone ever paid
for a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the big winners phoned in their bids. Their identities
for the moment were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The record-busting _ which took place at a small, packed theater
inside Madison Square Garden _ came as no surpise to Arlan
Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, the auction house that ran the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably what people will think back on as the good old
days,'' Ettinger said of baseball's summer of '98. ``Everything was
joyful. This was an escape, a time that people loved. With every
home run, the hugging and the kissing in the stands, the fathers
embracing their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mix that with a strong economy, a terrific stock market,''
he added, ``and, well, things just take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports memorabilia has grown to a multibillion-dollar business
in the past decade, said Richard Simon, Guernsey's consultant for
this auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history, it's love of the game, it's memories,'' Simon
said. ``In my own collection, I have a seat from the Polo
Grounds,'' where the New York Giants played. ``I could have sat in
that seat when I was 10 years old. The times I went to the Polo
Grounds ... were the best memories of my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In Don DeLillo's great novel, ``Underworld,'' the hero, Nick
Shay, pays $34,500 for a baseball claimed to be the home-run ball
that Bobby Thomson hit in the Giants-Dodgers playoff game of Oct.
3, 1951 _ ``the shot heard 'round the world,'' as gleeful Giants
fans called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Thomson hit the homer,'' one character explains, ``people
rushed outside. ... Maybe it was the last time people spontaneously
went out of their houses for something. Some wonder, some
amazement. Like a footnote to the end of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo portrays the hunt for the vanished ball as a pursuit of
lost innocence, noting that, on the same day as the homer, the
Soviet Union exploded its first hydrogen bomb _ another sort of
shot heard 'round the world, and the real precursor to the end of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa homerun race might come to symbolize, in some
future novel, a time of outsized exuberance, when not just home-run
records but stock prices, buying sprees, political scandals _ and
sports memorabilia auctions _ ballooned beyond the breaking point,
then ballooned some more.
</P>
<P>
   If this celebration, too, ends up followed by a letdown, the
foreshadowing might be found in a news clipping.
</P>
<P>
   While researching his book, DeLillo discovered the coincidence
of the Thomson homer and the Soviet bomb-blast when he saw the two
headlines side by side on the front page of an old New York Times
microfiche.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the New York Times of Sept. 28, 1998, which
devoted two stories to McGwire's 70th homer, some future scribe
might be similarly struck by an adjoining headline that reads,
``Calibrated Risk: US and IMF Lead Push for Brazil Bail-Out Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the big deal over the home-run baseballs is, and always
will be, much simpler. On his final Saturday-morning radio program
of 1998, NPR's Scott Simon complained that McGwire and Sosa _ not
President Clinton and Kenneth Starr _ should have been Time
magazine's Men of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burly Cardinal and the sunny Cub, embracing at home plate
... handled their moments in history this year with humility,
humanity, grace, and joy,'' the radio host noted. ``Now that's
news!''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be why one ball fan laid out millions to preserve
such peaks close at hand.

AETNA OFFERS OUTSIDE REVIEWS TO MEMBERS DENIED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with HEALTH-INSURANCE) 
(pr) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, the big managed care company, said
Tuesday that it would voluntarily offer an outside review to health
plan members in 30 states who say they were denied necessary or
experimental care.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Aetna health maintenance organizations could request
external reviews after being rebuffed inside the company. Aetna
promised the external cases would be decided within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna announced the program, which would take effect by June 30,
against a background of demands for tighter regulation of managed
care in Congress and many states. Insurance industry trade groups
oppose government regulations and support voluntary programs like
those of Aetna and a number of regional companies.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 states already require external reviews for some
types of medical cases, including terminally ill or badly disabled
patients. But the state laws were thrown into question last
September, in a lawsuit that Aetna brought against Texas
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Gilmore, a U.S. District Court judge, ruled that the
state's external review provisions were pre-empted by the Federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which bars state
regulation of most employer-sponsored health plans. In the same
case, the judge upheld a provision that opened HMOs to lawsuits
filed by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said that pending an appeal, it would continue to accept
the Texas reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said the company's new
program would be available to more than five million HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for consumer groups said stronger regulatory
protection was needed. ``It's a step, said Betsy Imholz, a senior
attorney of Consumers Union in San Francisco, ``but we view it as a
way to take the steam out of the movement for HMO reform here in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Scherzer, a lawyer for New Yorkers for Accessible Health
Coverage, said a review program sponsored by Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield had produced ``quite positive results,'' favoring
patients in half the cases. He said one reviewer had required
Empire to provide a liver transplant for a man with HIV and
hepatitis.

   INTEL REPORTS SOLID EARNINGS IN FOURTH QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by strong sales of its high-end microprocessors and
increased operating efficiencies, Intel reported fourth-quarter
financial results that substantially exceeded Wall Street analysts'
estimates. But Intel advised analysts that sales for the first
quarter of 1999 are likely to fall, following a normal seasonal
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Intel reported earnings of $2.1 billion,
or $1.19 a share, up 18 percent from $1.7 billion, or 98 cents a
share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent, to
$7.6 billion, from $6.5 billion. Analysts expected Intel to earn
$1.07 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate Technology, the No.1 independent maker of computer disk
drives, posted net income for its fiscal second quarter that beat
expectations as the company benefited from a surge in sales of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   SUIT AGAINST COLTEC DISMISSED
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Crane Co. seeking to
block Coltec Industries from merging with B.F. Goodrich in a deal
that gives Coltec shareholders substantially less than Crane had
offered to pay. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
White Plains allows Coltec and Goodrich to proceed with their deal.
It is unclear whether Crane will appeal.

   MARKETERS PONDER LIFE WITHOUT MIKE
</P>
<P>
   With the second and apparently final retirement of Michael
Jordan from basketball, which is expected to be announced today,
will Madison Avenue lose the most prolific, most richly compensated
and perhaps most effective endorser ever? Or can Jordan continue to
be a world champion pitchman in retirement?
</P>
<P>
   FEWER CHOICES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance industry is rapidly whittling itself down
to a few giant companies that dominate the health systems of some
of the country's biggest cities. Doctors and hospitals are
increasingly concerned, and the trend is also raising questions
about the cost and availability of care to millions of patients and
their employers.
</P>
<P>
   TESTIMONY BACKS MICROSOFT POSITION
</P>
<P>
   An economist testifying for the Government conceded that there
was scant evidence consumers had been harmed by practices that are
central to the Justice Department's antitrust case against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. MARKETS OFF SHARPLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks moved sharply lower in heavy trading as traders and
investors took profits on issues that have shot higher since the
start of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 145.21
points, or 1.5 percent, to 9,474.68. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 63.84 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,320.75.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian stocks plunged as rumors about devaluation and concern
about capital flight undermined efforts by the Government to calm
investors. The Bovespa stock index fell 7.62 percent and is off 13
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   FORD EXPRESSES INTEREST IN VOLVO
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has told Volvo that it would be interested in
acquiring the Swedish company's car division if it were put up for
sale, but no formal offer has been made nor has Volvo expressed a
desire to open formal negotiations, auto executives said.
</P>
<P>
   PRICING INTERNET STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in share prices for Internet companies like
Yahoo has analysts wondering whether financial performance is
irrelevant for many of the investors jumping in. Much of the fuel
for the growth in share prices appears to come from small investors
who trade rapidly, not the kind of long-term buyer willing to wait
years for Internet pioneers to deliver the huge profits implicit in
today's valuations.

   Another one of the many talents of  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; , a man who
finds that talking on the telephone is just not enough to keep him
fully occupied, is described in the latest issue of Brill's
Content:
</P>
<P>
   New York Times crossword puzzle-maker  &UR; Will Shortz &LR;  describes
interviewing candidate Clinton in a Manhattan hotel room in 1992.
``He says he does sometimes three (puzzles) in a day and on average
five to seven a week. And while I was interviewing him, he clicked
on his watch timer and started solving the puzzle.'' Halfway
through, when he was interrupted by a phone call, he clicked off
the timer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``goes over to the telephone and he's talking animatedly
and a few minutes into the call I hear his timer click on again and
I look over and, in astonishment, I see, while he's talking on the
phone, he's continuing to solve the puzzle.'' When it was done,
``it was absolutely perfect and he had finished it in six minutes
and 54 seconds. Whatever else you can say about Bill Clinton, he's
a very talented crossword solver.''
</P>
<P>
   (Warning to amateurs: Trying to measure your skills against
Bill's is difficult. As the week rolls on, each day's puzzle gets
harder, and Shortz didn't reveal what day the interview took
place.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The dessert at Monday night's state dinner for Argentine
President  &UR; Carlos Menem &LR;  was frozen dulce de leche, described as
``a confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh
coconut and red currant and topped with a couple made of chocolate
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree.'' After the meal,  &UR; Robert
Duvall &LR;  got some help from Clinton at the end of his tango
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR;  has sent 12-page letters to all her very best
friends asking them to chip in to pay more than $325,000 in legal
bills. What she wants, say the letters, is anything from $20 to
$1,000 to help her ``tell the truth about what I saw and heard in
Bill Clinton's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tripp earns more than $90,000 a year from her job at
the Pentagon, says the Washington Post, she sees herself as a
fragile victim. ``I have been in their crosshairs,'' she said of
the Clinton defense team, ``and I feel like David against
Goliath.''

   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Sean Connery &LR; , who complained in the Glasgow Evening Times on
Monday about his not having been knighted in England, seems to have
gotten real life mixed up with the movies. In Connery's recent
movie ``The Avengers,'' he played Sir August De Wynter, an
all-around bad guy. ``It makes you wonder at times what exactly are
the criteria to qualify'' for knighthood, he told the Scottish
newspaper.
</P>
<P>

Star's Police Log, which includes an incident that sounds like an
urban legend but turns out to be true. On December 27, an ambulance
was sent to a home where a woman was complaining of chest pains; a
second ambulance was summoned for the victim's husband; and ``a
third ambulance (was) requested when ambulance driver (was) run
over by rolling ambulance.''

the latest issue of Marie Claire, proves just how far women have
come from the days when they were dependent on the kindness of
strangers. When Spring, 46, began to lose the bruises and swelling
that made her look beat-up after the surgery, she writes, she got
``a lot of positive feedback from people I didn't know, especially
men. I noticed they stopped to talk to me more in stores. Before,
they used to just smile, but now they try to really engage me.''
She seems almost as pleased as if they'd wolf-whistled.

was invented in the 1890s, says  &UR; Joan Brumberg &LR; 's ``The Body

 &HT;    Perry has unsung GOP ancestor
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although Rick Perry made a cameo appearance at
the Senate's front dais Tuesday, his starring role comes next week
when he is sworn in as the state's 39th lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   And while he is scheduled to be the first Republican ever to
take the oath for that office, leave it to Texas history to deny
him the honor of being the first Republican elected to that office.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's sure place in history was cinched by an odd chain of
events that occurred in 1869, involving a Virginia-born lawyer
named James Winwright Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Though Flanagan has become little more than a missing footnote
to history _ his name isn't even on some lists of Texas' lieutenant
governors _ state archives and historical files tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan moved to Texas in 1843 and settled in a small community
called Slabtown near the Louisiana border. He quickly established
himself as a farmer and merchant who became a close friend and
supporter of Texas politician-hero Sam Houston when he served in
the state House and Senate in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan _ a staunch Unionist and Whig-turned-Republican, who
ironically retired to his farm during the Civil War and sold
leather to the Confederate Army _ was elected lieutenant governor
in 1869 under Reconstruction Gov. Edmund J. Davis, also a
Republican. At the same time, Flanagan's son was elected to the
Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Radical Republicans they were called in those days.
</P>
<P>
   When Flanagan was elected, Texas' No. 2 office had been vacant
for two years because the triumphant Union Army had given the boot
to George Washington Jones, a Conservative Union party loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   But Flanagan never took the oath of office and vacated the
lieutenant governor post a few months after his election when the
Legislature appointed him to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1967 book, ``There Shall Also Be a Lieutenant Governor,''
author-historian J. William Davis explains the events this way:
``Flanagan was appointed provisional lieutenant governor after his
election, pending the action of Congress on the newly adopted state
constitution. He presided over the Senate at the provisional
session of the Legislature but, being elected United States senator
at that session, was never inaugurated as lieutenant governor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Flanagan went to Washington, his son presided over the
Senate as the president pro-tempore.
</P>
<P>
   A twice-married father of 11 children, Flanagan eventually
retired to his farm outside Longview. He died in 1887 and is buried
at Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Before Flanagan, 10 other men served as lieutenant governor,
seven of them Democrats, one a Democrat-turned-Know Nothing Party
member, one an Independent and one a member of the Conservative
Union Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1855, candidates were nominated by caucus or by
themselves, without specifying a party affiliation. But historians
have generally characterized them all as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ward writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

STOCKS RETREAT AMID FOREIGN CONCERNS AND PROFIT-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
 (editors: in reference to E(ASTERISK)Trade, replace the word with
the symbol, no parentheses) 
 (bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks moved sharply lower in heavy trading Tuesday
as continued instability in key foreign economies provided a
helpful backdrop for traders and investors looking to take profits
on issues that have shot higher since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the steep, almost frenzied leaps in prices, particularly
in technology stocks, analysts have been expecting a pullback, if
not a full-fledged correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering how far we have run in the last two weeks, the
market needed a little rest,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment
officer at BankBoston. ``I am sort of surprised this downdraft was
as contained as it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The session's steepest selloff was in Nasdaq stocks _ the
securities that have run up the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which was up 9 percent for the year
through Monday, suffered its eighth-worst point decline ever,
falling 63.84 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,320.75.
</P>
<P>
   But other important market measures also suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 145.21 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,474.68. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
24.37 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,239.51. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller company stocks lost 5.77 points, or 1.3 percent, to
427.36.
</P>
<P>
   And Thestreet.com Internet index, a popular measure of Internet
stocks, tumbled 46.12 points, or 7.8 percent, to 542.07. The index
had tripled in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 800.2 million shares,
down from 818.4 million Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 1.1 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq
market. It was the fifth consecutive session in which volume
exceeded a billion shares on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the frothiness we have seen recently, a 5 percent
correction might not be a bad thing,'' said one block trader, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign markets also lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a potential default in Brazil pushed down prices on the
Sao Paulo exchange by more than 7.6 percent. Mexico's Bolsa index
dropped 3.7 percent. In Europe, market indexes on all major
exchanges moved lower.
</P>
<P>
   All but five of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow fell on
Tuesday. The Dow was led lower by IBM, which fell 4 3/16, to 185
1/16. Nervousness about Brazil hurt financial stocks like American
Express, down 3~, to 102], and J.P. Morgan, which fell 2|, to 111
13/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the session's most spectacular declines were recorded by
Internet stocks. Many of these stocks have seen their prices double
in a matter of weeks. For a day at least, that trend was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, which was offered to the public in September at $18 a
share, fell 51 Tuesday, to 240{. Broadcast.com slumped 62 1/16, to
223. Amazon.com fell 21\, to 163]. And Yahoo lost 13], to 402.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Internet stocks suffered.
</P>
<P>
   E(ASTERISK)Trade jumped 12 7/16, to 100 15/16, after it said it
planned to form an investment bank that would help companies raise
capital by selling securities to investors over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although further declines in technology shares are possible
Wednesday, the chances of a rout similar to Tuesday's dimmed after
the market closed.

   Another one of the many talents of  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; , a man who
finds that talking on the telephone is just not enough to keep him
fully occupied, is described in the latest issue of Brill's
Content:
</P>
<P>
   New York Times crossword puzzle-maker  &UR; Will Shortz &LR;  describes
interviewing candidate Clinton in a Manhattan hotel room in 1992.
``He says he does sometimes three (puzzles) in a day and on average
five to seven a week. And while I was interviewing him, he clicked
on his watch timer and started solving the puzzle.'' Halfway
through, when he was interrupted by a phone call, he clicked off
the timer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``goes over to the telephone and he's talking animatedly
and a few minutes into the call I hear his timer click on again and
I look over and, in astonishment, I see, while he's talking on the
phone, he's continuing to solve the puzzle.'' When it was done,
``it was absolutely perfect and he had finished it in six minutes
and 54 seconds. Whatever else you can say about Bill Clinton, he's
a very talented crossword solver.''
</P>
<P>
   (Warning to amateurs: Trying to measure your skills against
Bill's is difficult. As the week rolls on, each day's puzzle gets
harder, and Shortz didn't reveal what day the interview took
place.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The dessert at Monday night's state dinner for Argentine
President  &UR; Carlos Menem &LR;  was frozen dulce de leche, described as
``a confection of caramel and baked pineapple ringed with fresh
coconut and red currant and topped with a couple made of chocolate
dancing the tango beneath a palm tree.'' After the meal,  &UR; Robert
Duvall &LR;  got some help from Clinton at the end of his tango
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR;  has sent 12-page letters to all her very best
friends asking them to chip in to pay more than $325,000 in legal
bills. What she wants, say the letters, is anything from $20 to
$1,000 to help her ``tell the truth about what I saw and heard in
Bill Clinton's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tripp earns more than $90,000 a year from her job at
the Pentagon, says the Washington Post, she sees herself as a
fragile victim. ``I have been in their crosshairs,'' she said of
the Clinton defense team, ``and I feel like David against
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Sean Connery &LR; , who complained in the Glasgow Evening Times on
Monday about his not having been knighted in England, seems to have
gotten real life mixed up with the movies. In Connery's recent
movie ``The Avengers,'' he played Sir August De Wynter, an
all-around bad guy. ``It makes you wonder at times what exactly are
the criteria to qualify'' for knighthood, he told the Scottish
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Sampson Bowers &LR;  forwards a copy of the St. Helena (Calif.)
Star's Police Log, which includes an incident that sounds like an
urban legend but turns out to be true. On December 27, an ambulance
was sent to a home where a woman was complaining of chest pains; a
second ambulance was summoned for the victim's husband; and ``a
third ambulance (was) requested when ambulance driver (was) run
over by rolling ambulance.''

<P>
   &UR; LOOKS COUNT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Andrea Spring &LR; 's first-person account of her face-lift, in
the latest issue of Marie Claire, proves just how far women have
come from the days when they were dependent on the kindness of
strangers. When Spring, 46, began to lose the bruises and swelling
that made her look beat-up after the surgery, she writes, she got
``a lot of positive feedback from people I didn't know, especially
men. I noticed they stopped to talk to me more in stores. Before,
they used to just smile, but now they try to really engage me.''
She seems almost as pleased as if they'd wolf-whistled.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bang, the fringe of hair that covers a woman's forehead,
was invented in the 1890s, says  &UR; Joan Brumberg &LR; 's ``The Body
Project: An Intimate History of American Girls'' (Vintage; $13), to
cover blemishes. This development _ not coincidentally _ followed
the installment of bathroom mirrors, which came after the
institution of indoor plumbing, &LR;  in most homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping Connections Alive: The grandmother of  &UR; Ellen &LR;

Center, had the same Avon lady as  &UR; Priscilla Presley &LR; .

   _ Rep.  &UR; Dan Burton &LR; , R-Ind., takes along a ``private duffel bag
of tools, &LR; '' when he goes to the House barbershop, reports the

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Evidence is growing that President Saddam
Hussein has put off buying or distributing vital food and medicine
that he can import through limited oil sales, diplomats and U.N.
officials said on Tuesday. They spoke as pressure mounted to lift
economic sanctions on Iraq to improve the lives of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is childhood nutrition, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $25 million has been budgeted for high-protein biscuits
and fortified milk for children under 5 and nursing mothers since
last fall, but the Iraqis have not placed any orders for these
goods despite repeated urging for several months by U.N. officials,
including Secretary General Kofi Annan. At the same time the Iraqi
government publishes alarming figures of childhood deaths, for
which Saddam blames sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   An envoy familiar with Iraqi purchases, which must be approved
by a Security Council committee, said that drugs for treating
childhood leukemia were also not ordered, although Iraq has seen a
rise in the problem and had been given the go-ahead to buy
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also begun refusing offers of help from several Arab
nations trying to deliver relief goods, which are allowed under
U.N. sanctions. Furthermore, Iraq may be exporting grain illegally,
rather than using a bumper wheat harvest to bolster domestic food
stocks, some diplomats and officials suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts are relatively small parts of the budget that the
United Nations allows Iraq for imported food and medicine, and the
reasons for Iraq's inaction are unclear or in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is trying to assess the conditions faced by
the Iraqi people, who have been living under sanctions for more
than eight years. Restrictions on gathering information freely in
Iraq make this job difficult. The council is going to hear a
comprehensive briefing by the director of the Iraq program, Benon
Sevan. That meeting was postponed on Tuesday to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is trying to increase its revenues in other areas. Iraq
said on Tuesday that it is ordering that record amounts of oil be
pumped, more than independent experts think the dilapidated system
can easily produce.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say that in the last three weeks, Iraq pumped an
average of two million barrels of oil a day. On Tuesday in Baghdad,
an oil ministry official said that the country would try to raise
that to three million barrels a day in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A Mideast oil expert said in an interview that this is enough
oil to cause concern to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, now facing historically low oil prices. A few of those
countries, most notably Saudi Arabia, have been critical of Saddam,
and some diplomats suggest that the spurt in oil production may be
in line with Iraqi calls for uprisings against governments that are
critical of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The oil expert, Walid Khadduri, executive editor of the Middle
East Economic survey, based in Cyprus, said that the new Iraqi
projections run counter to previous claims made to the United
Nations as recently as last month that increased production was not
possible until wells were upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``oil for food'' program, Iraq is allowed to sell
$5.26 billion in oil every six months to raise money for civilian
needs, but current oil prices have kept Iraq below that target.
Some of the income goes toward paying compensation for the war over
Kuwait, but most goes to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan is expected to report on Thursday that the oil-for-food
plan, which Iraq long rejected, has begun to show improvements in
the health and nutritional levels of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest levels of success have been found in
government-controlled areas of central and southern Iraq, where
malnutrition rates have nonetheless leveled off, according to a
report now being finalized.
</P>
<P>
   In Kurdish areas of the north, where U.N. agencies like the
World Health Organization and the World Food Program _ and not the
Iraqi government _ are in charge of distributing food, medicine and
other goods, results have been better, with nutritional levels
rising and health standards improving.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic differences account for some of the reasons why the
more populated central and southern regions are not showing the
improvements measured in Kurdish areas. But questions remain about
the attitude of Saddam, who has never liked the limits on oil
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The government has resisted until this month adding whole-cream
milk and cheese to the monthly rations available to every Iraqi,
and Baghdad has also lagged at raising the caloric levels of those
rations as recommended by international experts.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicable delays hold up distribution of medicines that are
stuck in warehouses, officials say. Iraqi officials say that
imported medicines must pass through a lengthy quality-testing
process and that even then there is not enough equipment to move
the supplies out.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have refused to allow relief workers to see and
assess damage Iraq said was done to civilian sites by American and
British air strikes in December, a survey requested by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Only UNICEF has been able to collect information on a
substantial number of buildings reported hit. Its survey found
mostly shattered windows and some roof and exterior damage at
schools and clinics. The most serious destruction was a direct hit
on a water line to a Baghdad neighborhood, according to Iraqi
officials, and the bombing of an agricultural school in the town of
Kirkuk, which UNICEF verified.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program reported on one site: a rice warehouse in
Tikrit, Saddam home town, which was hit. Half the contents were
destroyed, but distribution continued, the agency said.

THE JORDAN REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At noon Wednesday, Michael Jordan, the most gifted and
wealthiest basketball player in history, will announce his
retirement from the Chicago Bulls. So, allow me to broker this
fitting and necessary historical introduction:
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jordan, please meet William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shakespeare, say hello to Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   I read that Shakespeare was given credit for bringing 23 new
words to the English language. Do something like that and people
will call you a revolutionary. Jordan did, so Jordan is.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived on the NBA planet in 1984. We should have known then
that he was already shaking it from its axis, rapidly sending it
into a new orbit. Fifteen years later, basketball has changed.
Because of Jordan. Twenty-three words for Shakespeare and a famous
No. 23 jersey for Jordan. Jordan's revolution is so obvious that
many of us take it for granted.
</P>
<P>
   He changed the way basketball players dribble. He changed the
style of their shorts from hip huggers to loose,
near-knee-touchers. Shoes went from bland athletic wear to glinting
personal statements. Socks went from knee-high to ankle-high. It
was cool to be bald. It was cool to be truly dark-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was so good at dunking _ so good at taking off 16 feet
from the basket and finishing his flight with a slam that was equal
parts force, funk, and poetry _ that he turned a sacred art form
into a cliche. Creative assaults on NBA rims used to be anticipated
events. But now the league has canceled the dunk contest that went
on during All-Star weekend because the act is so trite. That was
only after Jordan made the standard for dunks unreachable in 1988.
One of his dunks then was called his Superman slam. For obvious
reasons. The man truly appeared to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the days when Nike was just another in a line of shoe
companies? When the familiar swoosh did not trigger a whisper of
``Nike'' in your psyche? That was the case in the early 1980s,
until Jordan came into the league with his own brand of
multicolored Nike sneakers. The demand for the Oregon-based
company's sneakers, then $50, was born. Now you can pay nearly four
times that price for a pair of new Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't say all the changes were good. Revolutions don't work
that way. You concede that some of the alterations will not benefit
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the days when agents did not dominate your newscasts
and sports pages? That changed when Jordan signed his first
contract with the Bulls. He would not only play basketball, but he
would model. And sell shoes. And sell ads. The agent directing all
his activities was David Falk, who has now grown into the most
powerful sports attorney in the NBA. Give Falk credit for his
intelligence and creativity. But it is no coincidence that he rose
as Jordan rose. That was the case with everyone around him. They
immediately became credible from their Jordan associations.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on a television during any basketball game and you will see
Jordan's influence. Not just because he is a pitchman for
McDonald's, Nike, Gatorade, and Hanes. No, I'm talking about the
game itself. Jordan had two signatures: He would stick out his
tongue as he drove to the basket and he would carry the ball. If
anyone had handled the ball that way in the 1970s or the first
couple years of the 1980s, they simply would have been called for
traveling. Don't just take my word for it. Watch ESPN Classic. The
thing that is different about the game now compared with then is
that players dribbled conventionally. Jordan? He held the ball as
if it were a yo-yo. There was a split-second when the ball would be
suspended _ too high _ halfway between his palm and space. Then he
would put it down and make a move to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else Jordan did, that move was good. And
different. Everyone began to dribble that way, and referees allowed
it. It got so bad that Allen Iverson, the Philadelphia point guard
who has said he wants to be the next Jordan, had a memo sent to him
by the NBA. It said that he was too liberal. Not liberal in
lifestyle. Liberal in the dribble. Iverson's style was a severe
exaggeration of Jordan's.
</P>
<P>
   And that's part of the problem in a revolution: Everyone is not
going to understand your original intent. A lot of the innovations
Jordan brought to the game were taken from the path that he blazed.
Certainly he was a basketball artist, transforming courts the same
way Miles Davis coaxed beautiful blue notes from trumpets. But
Jordan was never a self-absorbed artist. He was a champion. He went
to the NBA Finals six times and was 6-0. He was a great passer,
rebounder, defender, and master scorer. And a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his followers viewed him in fragments. In a way, his
strength was also his curse. He was relevant in all fields, from
arenas, to academia, to nursing homes. So many people saw his parts
and not always his entirety. He was criticized by some for not
being more political. A former teammate, Craig Hodges, once
remarked that Jordan could change the economics of an impoverished
area by himself if he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan did not do what others wanted. You can see that from
his game. You can see that from his interviews, times when he never
slips you information he doesn't want you to know; it's always on
his terms.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how he left. Great players such as Oscar Robertson
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar stayed too long. An injury slowed Larry
Bird. Magic Johnson contracted HIV and volleyed between retirement
and the court for years. Not Jordan. He left the best in his field.
He also left us a game that he reshaped.

 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Ill. _ Out of respect, Michael Jordan first told Ron
Harper and Scottie Pippen, his two closest teammates, that he was
planning to retire. Harper and Pippen did not argue or plead with
Jordan to stay. They simply sat and reminisced, the way they would
in the workout room of Jordan's suburban Chicago home after every
championship season.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, those stories _ along with the scintillating
highlights, the six banners and his growing legend as the finest
basketball player ever _ will be committed to memory. In what may
amount to perhaps the largest press conference in modern sports
history, the incomparable star of the Chicago Bulls makes his
retirement official to the world.
</P>
<P>
   A day after numerous officials in the NBA have said Jordan is
retiring, confirmation still had not been made through the league,
team or through Jordan's agent, David Falk. But in the clearest
indication yet that Jordan is leaving the game for the second time
in five years, the team circulated a press release announcing an 11
a.m. press conference on the floor of the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on top,'' said B.J. Armstrong, one of several players
to work out at the Berto Center, the team's training facility. ``He
made the last shot, he made the right plays. He's had a fabulous
career, and everything you could ever ask of an athlete he's done.
He has a chance to leave and this was a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan's retirement significantly changes the way the Bulls
do business, it is also a league-altering decision that swings the
pendulum of power in the National Basketball Association away from
Chicago and toward any other playoff savvy team in desperate need
of a title.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz, which took the Bulls to six games in the finals
the past two seasons, and the Indiana Pacers, who stretched Chicago
to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals, will be the two
early season favorites along with Los Angeles, Seattle, New York
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open for the rest of us,'' said Chris Childs, the
Knicks point guard. ``I think our rivalry against Miami will mean
even more. They have been talking about rivalries, like people say
the Lakers and Boston in the past. With teams like ourselves, Miami
and Indiana, hopefully we can give the fans something like they had
when Chicago and Detroit had their rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   The next order of business in the NBA is finding a player to
elevate the game to a pinnacle somewhere not too far below
Jordan's. The likely cast of characters involve Grant Hill,
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett, though as Hill
said last year, ``Following Mike is like following Muhammad Ali.
We're all Larry Holmes. And that's not bad. It's just the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we have some teams and some guys who can
collectively carry the NBA,'' said Allan Houston, the Knicks
shooting guard. ``I don't think anyone is going to single-handedly
do what he's done from an individual standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I have enough confidence in the guys we have
to carry this league.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan's decision was made well in advance of Monday _ he
phoned Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and Stern after speaking with
Harper and Pippen _ the Bulls did not know about it.
</P>
<P>
   According to one team official on condition of anonymity, he
kept the franchise waiting until the last possible minute. They
were not stunned. Between reports of exotic golf outings and that
his workout room had been converted into a cigar-smoking room at
home, many in the organization sensed he was leaning toward
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 players who showed up for an informal workout Tuesday
afternoon, none of them held Jordan's decision against him. His
retirement frees up the Bulls to pursue other free agents and also
allows his teammates to seek employment with other teams through
their agents, should the franchise elect not to re-sign them.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bulls have only four players under contract and
appear headed for a massive rebuilding, the chances of Pippen's
return are good based on the fact that the Bulls can offer the
All-Star swingman a more lucrative pact than any other team _ based
on the rules of the new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Rodman's return is in jeopardy. As to whether the
rest of the championship cast will be brought back _ Steve Kerr,
Jud Buechler, Luc Longley, Scott Burrell and Bill Wennington are
all free agents _ was still up for debate. General Manager Jerry
Krause has spoken with representatives from each player and has not
given anyone a clear indication of the franchise's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr, Buechler and Longley have been perceived as having close
ties to former coach Phil Jackson. With Tim Floyd officially set to
assume the head coaching position after waiting for months in
limbo, it was unclear whether those players would be offered deals.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc, Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth are the only
four players under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls technically will remain over the salary cap until they
renounce their rights to Jordan. But once that happens, and if they
decide not to keep Pippen and Rodman, they will be in position to
immediately become a major player in a free-agent market that
includes Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire, Jerry Stackhouse and
Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Berto Center Tuesday amounted to a small dress
rehearsal for the media onslaught expected on Wednesday. A dozen
television trucks were parked outside the building and cameramen
and reporters were scattered throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials and favorite stories, though, were hard to come by
today. On the eve of his permanent retirement from the game, not
everyone wanted to believe the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to hold off on the soliloquys until I find out for
sure,'' said Kerr.

 &HT;    Jordan leaving on high note
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Turns out, Michael Jordan was waving goodbye when he
left his right arm extended, wrist bent, on the final shot of Game
6 of the NBA Finals last June in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The final shot, it turns out, of a fascinating career.
</P>
<P>
   After months of speculation, Jordan is scheduled to announce at
the United Center today that he will retire from the game he took
to spectacular and unprecedented heights. Appropriately, the news
conference is scheduled for high noon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan's retirement has been a distinct possibility
since he led Chicago to that sixth championship seven months ago,
the reality of it sends reverberations through both the Bulls and
the NBA. The charismatic Jordan _ who quits at 35 after 13 seasons
during which he averaged 31.5 points a game _ was the catalyst for
Chicago's half-dozen championships in the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1990-91, the Bulls took every title that Jordan
played the full season. Houston won successive crowns during
Jordan's 18-month ``retirement'' starting in October 1993, when he
attempted to play professional baseball in the Chicago White Sox
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his departure sets off what may be the most drastic
dismantling of a professional sports champion ever, rivaling the
quick demise of baseball's Florida Marlins with historic
salary-dumping after they won the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that all-star forward Scottie Pippen will return
to Chicago seems minimal without Jordan. Pippen, a perennial
all-star who was the 122nd-highest paid player in the NBA last
season, has had an acrimonious relationship with owner Jerry
Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen vowed while recovering from foot surgery last season that
he would never wear a Bulls uniform again. When Pippen recovered,
he returned to the team. Many people here think that Jordan
influenced Pippen's softened stance.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, it was thought that Pippen's decision
on his future would determine Jordan's return, that Jordan would
take it as a ``slap in the face'' to play without his sidekick. But
coach Phil Jackson apparently was more influential than anyone
else. Jordan said he would not play for another coach, and while he
might have hedged on that comment after Jackson refused a late
contract extension from the Bulls after the last title, Jordan did
not back away from it, either.
</P>
<P>
   When Krause named fishing buddy Tim Floyd from Iowa State as
Jackson's replacement, those close to Jordan thought then that he
would walk away, especially considering that he also had a strained
relationship with Krause and Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said Monday that his top priority was to bring back
Jordan; now, he and Floyd must decide which way to go. ``Our next
situation,'' Krause said, ''could be to become a player in the
free-agent field. We think that we have enough under the cap to go
out and compete for the outstanding free agents, and at that time
also . . . bring our own guys back.''
</P>
<P>
   With just four players under contract, the Bulls have 10 free
agents, including Dennis Rodman. The enigmatic forward, however,
probably will not receive an offer from the Bulls with Jordan gone.
Such free agents as Phoenix's Antonio McDyess and Minnesota's Tom
Gugliotta probably will be pursued feverishly by Chicago when the
NBA shopping frenzy starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final alternative and last resort for the Bulls would be to
go with a rebuilding movement of youth and draft picks. ``If the
first two (options) don't go on, then the third one, obviously,
would be one where we go towards youth,'' Krause said. ``The guys
we have back are basically young, and we could add more youth to
them and see where we go from there, to build another
championship-type team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that once before a number of years ago, when we got
here with youth, stayed with youth and added veterans as we went
along.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan was a part of that mix. Without him, Chicago seems
likely to plummet from champions toward the league basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael retiring affects us all,'' center Luc Longley, a free
agent, said Tuesday. ``But it's a scary prospect what (the Bulls)
could become.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as frightening is what the loss of Jordan means to the NBA,
which is coming off a protracted lockout that alienated its fans.
The one commodity that could have mended the sides was Jordan, the
league's marquee player for the last decade. He played before a
sold-out arena every night, even bringing out an NBA-record crowd
of 62,046 last season at the Georgia Dome against the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the league's immediate future is uncertain. Such
stars as Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Penny Hardaway, Tim Duncan
and others combined do not equal the appeal of Jordan.

   After the last championship, Jordan sent another message of the
future. He said: ``I have another life, and I have to get to it at
some time. I hope the fans understand that. Hopefully, I've put
enough memories out there.''

 &HT;    Jordan: League needs his presence
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The NBA will exist without Michael Jordan, but nothing
more. How can a car run without its engine?
</P>
<P>
   Already sullied after a six-month labor dispute that killed much
of the season and incensed fans, the league takes an even bigger
hit today, when Jordan announces his retirement after 13 years of
utter brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   He was a marketing phenomenon by his lonesome, packing buildings
at every stop and giving the fans style and substance on the court.
He was an ambassador for the sport, a beacon. Attending a game in
which Jordan played was an event , no matter the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real-life hero,'' former Bulls coach Phil Jackson called him
last June. And in many respects, Jackson was right.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's image was larger-than-life, attracting the casual fans
to the NBA and keeping them there. But will the fans stay now that
he is gone _ especially after the exasperating lockout?
</P>
<P>
   If an ESPN on-line poll taken Tuesday is an indicator, the
answer is a resounding no. Asked who would be the player to take
over as the league's high priest, two-thirds of the 38,000
respondents through 4 p.m. responded ``nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   For a league in desperate straits with an uncertain immediate
future, that has to be alarming. It's no wonder that commissioner
David Stern half-jokingly begged Jordan to delay his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Michael has to do what's best for him,'' former teammate
B.J. Armstrong said. ``He's going out at the top of the league, as
the ultimate winner. What better time to go than now?''
</P>
<P>
   If Stern had his druthers, it'd be any time other than now.
Ticket prices around the league have jettisoned to the point where
the average fan cannot afford them. Players have the public
relations savvy of ax murderers, saying all kinds of things that
alienated fans during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   And things did not get much better after it ended last week.
Indiana forward Antonio Davis said: ``We, as players, are going to
have to do things we don't like to do, like sign autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what fans needed to hear as they debated on whether to
spend their hard-earned money on tickets. Now, the product is even
more diluted.
</P>
<P>
   How the NBA overcomes Jordan's absence is a problem that will
not be solved anytime soon. The hope is that Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant of the Lakers form a duo that is both exciting and
effective. And that young guns Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and
Tim Duncan grow into starring roles. That Grant Hill improves his
jumper _ and the Detroit Pistons. That Penny Hardaway finally is
healthy and regains his game. That the New York Knicks and Miami
Heat's contentious rivalry continues _ without the fighting. That
Larry Bird's Indiana Pacers find a new intra-conference rival now
that the Bulls are done without Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But all those are hopes, not realities. The one reality is that
Michael Jordan _ his game, his appeal, his influence, his magnitude
_ is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The most the league can hope for is that, in this shortened
season of 50 games apiece beginning next month, the competition is
fierce for playoff positions and the postseason features star
players and quality play.
</P>
<P>
   The league cannot afford any more marijuana-related incidents
from Iverson, Chris Webber, Isaiah Rider, Clifford Robertson, et
al. And any action like Latrell Sprewell choking his coach would be
catastrophic. Many fans are wavering, and another public relations
gaffe could turn them away, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no replacing Michael Jordan,'' free agent Bulls guard
Steve Kerr said. ``Can the league go on? It has to. Will it be
better? No way. We're talking about the best, most charismatic
player ever. That's a lot to overcome.''

EX-N.H. GOVERNOR JOINS BOSTON LAW FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former New Hampshire Governor Stephen Merrill will head
a new international business consulting unit at the Boston law firm
Bingham Dana, the firm said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal arranged in part by Peter Berlandi, the politically
connected former fund-raiser, Merrill leaves a post at Choate Hall
&AMP; Stewart to be president of Bingham Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Steve for years,'' said Berlandi, who was
campaign chairman for former Republican Governor William Weld and
former Attorney General Francis Bellotti before joining Bingham
Dana in the consulting venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started talking about putting together a
consulting group, Steve's name naturally came up,'' Berlandi said.
``It just made sense that he would be the guy to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said he was looking for a way to spend more time on
international business consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be so blunt as to say that's the main reason,
but Bingham Dana has a much greater national and international
reach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new group will advise business clients in crisis management
and strategy, especially companies looking for help dealing with
deregulation in the energy and telecommunications industries.,
Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill was New Hampshire's attorney general from 1985 to 1989
and governor from 1992 to 1996. He joined Choate Hall shortly after
announcing he wouldn't seek a third term.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the Choate Group, that firm's government affairs
consulting arm.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, hiring Merrill was considered a coup for Choate not
only because of Merrill's name and political connections but also
because of his business experience, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Choate Hall played down the loss Tuesday, saying the consulting
business will be taken over by former state legislator and Suffolk
County Sheriff Dennis Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that business to continue to prosper,'' said John
Nadas, a Choate managing partner. ``We were delighted to get Steve
two years ago, but he wanted to pursue interests that are really
outside our core business.''

 &HT;    Henry flies on high hopes for ownership of Marlins
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Forty-one thousand feet in the air over
Texas, John Henry held an imaginary baseball and, through
wire-rimmed glasses, did his best imitation of a Hall of Fame
pitcher staring at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   As his private Falcon 900 jet streaked through the sky at 430
mph, Henry unleashed a fastball. ``One point one two in 1968!'' he
said over the engine noise, a reference to the ERA of one of
baseball's greatest pitching seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So just what kind of owner will Henry be if he is approved
today, as is expected, as the new CEO for the Florida Marlins?
Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the owners meetings here, where he will join an
elite club whose members include heavyweights like George
Steinbrenner and Jerry Reinsdorf, the 49-year-old millionaire from
Boca Raton, Fla. entertained three passengers by doing Bob Gibson
impressions 7 1/2 miles in the sky over West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were sportswriters from South Florida's three
major newspapers, all of whom Henry invited because he said he felt
``bad you guys have to pay for a plane ticket to go all the way out
there for this.'' (All three newspapers accepted Henry's invitation
only after insisting on reimbursing him for the fare.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a bit naive at this,'' Henry later said, admitting
that his invitation raised a few eyebrows from the Marlins'
front-office brass. Also aboard the flight were Marlins General
Manager Dave Dombrowksi, Vice President of Finance Jonathan Mariner
and public relations director Ron Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Henry's 12-seat plane taxied down the runway for
takeoff at Palm Beach International Airport, Henry could be heard
asking Dombrowksi: ``What kind of dress is it at these meetings,
anyway? Casual or suit and tie?'' Dombrowksi replied: ``Suit and
tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the air, Henry's stewardess served a lunch of
artichokes, butterscotch squash soup and bow-tie pasta _ all from a
health-conscious menu prepared by his private chef. After a dessert
of fresh fruit and fat-free pound cake, Henry left Mariner and
Dombrowski to nap in the front of the plane and walked to the rear
where he sat with Colangelo and the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about his idol, Stan Musial. About passing out
because of heat stroke on a sweltering day at Sportsman's Park in
St. Louis, where he was intent on watching both games of a
double-header. About his sidearm delivery as a Little League
pitcher. About playing softball in his Birkenstocks at a Dean
Witter company picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who has made millions as an international investment
trader, said he first considered buying the Kansas City Royals and
St. Louis Cardinals years ago, long before he bid $150 million in
August to buy the Marlins from Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   As for how he will run the Marlins, Henry was mum. But he did
let slip that he wants the Marlins to play one day in a beautiful
ballpark that he described as a sort of ``Wrigley Field under a
dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he moved closer to realizing his dream _ a dream that
could come true this afternoon _ Henry was careful not to divulge
any of his plans for the Marlins. He's saving that for a news
conference planned for next Tuesday, the day the transaction is
scheduled to formally close.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, as his jet approached Carlsbad International
Airport, ``I'm not even the owner yet.''

 &HT;    Opening day for the 76th Texas Legislature
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger and Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and lots of beaming parents,
wailing babies, and fidgety boys in blue blazers watched the
members of the 76th Texas Legislature take the oath of office and
officially open the 1999 session at the Capitol Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get started,'' House Speaker Pete Laney said minutes
after he was unanimously elected to a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, Mr. Speaker. Let's get started,'' echoed
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The opening day proceedings in the House and Senate are more
symbolic than substantive. Lawmakers won't get down to the serious
business of lawmaking for several weeks. In fact, representatives
and senators haven't even been assigned to committees, which means
they can't begin considering legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, much of the nearly two-hour ceremony was devoted
to speeches praising Laney, D-Hale Center, for his leadership,
bipartisanship, and efforts to make House deliberations more open
to the public. Three Democrats and three Republicans rose to praise
the 55-year-old West Texas cotton farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, Speaker Hastert has called on Republicans to
work with Democrats _ what an incredible concept,'' said Plains
Republican Gary Walker. ``Speaker Hastert has learned what Speaker
Laney has known for a long time: It doesn't matter what letter we
have behind our name, it's what we work together to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi Democrat Vilma Luna told her colleagues that
``Pete Laney believes in the importance of each of you, and he's
worked to open the process to give each member the opportunity to
participate in a meaningful way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the man of the hour was outgoing Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, who is retiring after more than 40 years in and around
state government. Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, said that Bullock,
Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn were the ``three giants of Texas
politics in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock also was hailed in the House, where Laney had him
administer the speaker's oath. Laney said Bullock ``has had more
impact on public policy in our state than anyone else in the last
half of this century.'' Laney, in his acceptance speech, said that
vibrant new industries, coupled with fiscal responsibility on the
part of the Legislature, have fueled Texas' transformation from an
economic basket case in the early 1990's into an economic
powerhouse. He urged lawmakers to continue to exercise fiscal
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large part of our current budget surplus is composed of
dollars that we deliberately and prudently chose not to spend in
the past,'' he said. ``If we continue on our course for economic
growth with responsible budget management, our state will enjoy
budget surpluses long into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Laney said lawmakers should spend much of the current
multibillion-dollar surplus on public education. He also called for
action to address ``the alarming and tragic increase in child abuse
and neglect in our state'' and suggested reforms to lessen the cost
of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry, who will take the office
Tuesday, also pointed to education as a top priority. He said he'll
do his best to measure up to Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Bob Bullock. I can't fill his shoes,'' Perry said.
``(But) I'm not nervous with the concept of working with these
senators. Not unlike that roping pony that is waiting to break out
of the shoot for the first time _ I'm ready to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry promised a continuation of the bipartisan spirit that
reigned under Bullock, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today begins the last legislative session of the 20th
century,'' Perry said. ``The time for politics is over. It's time
for all of us to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators also unanimously elected Bivins as president pro tem.
Though mostly an honorary position, the pro tem runs the Senate
while the lieutenant governor is out of the chamber. The pro-tem,
usually the most senior senator who has not held the job, also is
in the line to succeed the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The 76th Legislature's opening day proceeded according to a
script, but that didn't mean that it lacked drama _ particularly
for freshmen lawmakers and their families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year and one month ago if someone had said I'd be here I'd
have said they were crazy,'' said an excited Vicki Truitt, a
freshman Republican from Keller, near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   As a former legislative staffer, Houston Democrat Joe E. Moreno
has been on the House floor many times. But this time was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be on the House floor and know I'll have a
vote on the House floor,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott S. Greenberger and Juan B. Elizondo Jr. write for the
Austin American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

 McGWIRE'S 70TH HOME RUN BALL SELLS FOR $2.7 MILLION, BLEMISHES AND (See also BBO-AUCTION-MCGWIRE) 
 (nk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To begin with, this baseball that has been called the
Hope Diamond of sports collectibles, the Holy Grail, the fan's
equivalent of a Picasso or a Renoir is not even in mint condition.
It's defaced in two places, one where Mark McGwire's bat bashed the
ball for his record-setting 70th and final home run of last season.
The other bruise occurred when the ball hit a wall in a left-field
upper-deck box in Busch Stadium in St. Louis. And rumor had it that
someone was going to pay $1 million or more for this used ball?
</P>
<P>
   That was absolutely ridiculous. It defied common sense. So, of
course, someone last night paid $2.7 million for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a baseball memorabilia auction in the Theater in Madison
Square Garden, the bidding for this first of 41 items began at
$500,000 and arose in increments of $50,000 and $100,000 _ the
large crowd buzzing as it did _ to that king's ransom. The
recipient of the ball was ``Anonymous,'' who was bidding by phone,
perhaps with a team of therapists at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was struck on Sept. 27, the last day of the season and
McGwire's final at-bat, against Carl Pavano pitching for the Expos
against the Cardinals. It was nine homers beyond Roger Maris'
single-season record and 10 past the Babe. No. 70 was recovered in
that left-field box by a stocky, 26-year-old research scientist in
St. Louis named Phil Ozersky, who stands to take home all but about
$400,000 of the bid _ the auction house has to make a living, too.
Ozersky, sitting with a female friend, barely uttered a smile.
Maybe he was too stunned, since he earns $30,000 a year in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   This ball, which was encased, as were the others in the auction,
in glass, may very well drip with sentimental value for one so
inclined for such things.
</P>
<P>
   But on close observation it looks like any other of the 70,000
major league baseballs used last season _ white horsehide and red
stitching _ and one that you could pick up in any sporting goods
for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 70th home run ball is the most valuable sports artifact in
history,'' said Arlan Ettinger, the president of Guernsey's, the
Manhattan auction house running the event. He was also the one who
described the ball as the Hope Diamond, the Holy Grail, etc. He
might have added the Honus Wagner 1910 baseball card, which sold at
auction in 1996 for a sports collectibles record at the time of a
paltry $640,500 to an anonymous buyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction program, condition of McGwire ball No. 70 is
described as very clean, but with ``Two semi-circular marks
approximately 1/8 (of an inch) in diameter in clear area. Slight
smudge on lettering `Center' (Cushion Cork Center) and `s' (in
Rawlings logo.)''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky had attended the game that fateful night with about a
hundred people from his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went to see a baseball game,'' he said. ``I'm a fan. I
never dreamed of catching a home run ball. I'd never caught one
before, and I've been to many games.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's sitting up there enjoying things when suddenly this
missile is heading in his direction, and arrives in his group. One
of his fellows gets his hand on the ball, but it ricochets to the
back wall and then bounces under a metal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Young Ozersky then reaches down and plucks up the ball and the
rest is hysteria. He got an agent, he got a lawyer, he's made so
many media appearances for his 107 days and 15 minutes of fame that
on the morning of the auction he was an hour and a half late for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   If Ozersky is somewhat caught up in his brief prominence, he is
no financial dunce. The man who caught McGwire's 62nd _ the homer
that broke the record held by Roger Maris _ gave it back to the
slugger for some bats, balls and a jersey. Ozersky was able to
figure out _ maybe with the help of a newly acquired accountant _
that $50 worth of equipment was less than the estimated $1 million
plus.
</P>
<P>
   Others who experienced windfalls from McGwire's retrieved homers
Nos. 63, 67 and 68 suffered in comparison to Ozersky. The highest
of those three went for an embarrassing $50,000. Also sold was
Sammy Sosa's 66th and final homer in what was a remarkable slugging
tandem with McGwire last season. Sosa's ball went for $150,000.
Also up for bidding was a pair of McGwire's red ankle-high cleats
that were worn in a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   What size are they? Ettinger was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky's ball, however, was the star of the evening. The now
former proprietor of it said he plans to give some auction money to
his parents for retirement, some he'll save for his children when
he has them (and, presumably, a wife) and other money he will
donate to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding home run ball No. 70, the auction program also notes:
``The current owner of the baseball (that is, Ozersky) retains the
right to produce 70 Cibachrome prints and 7,000 posters of the
baseball, both numbered and signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A poster of that defaced baseball would match perfectly the
couch in my living room. Where do I line up to buy it?

MARKET PLACE: RARE FOR AN INTERNET FIRM, YAHOO REPORTS PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rare for an Internet company, Yahoo reports actual earnings. Not
that such things matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Inc., a bellwether Internet stock, released earnings
Tuesday confirming that it had surpassed Wall Street's financial
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter? The recent surge in share prices for
Internet companies has analysts wondering whether financial
performance is irrelevant for many of the small investors jumping
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how people are getting to these valuations,''
said Paul Noglows, an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San
Francisco. ``What's going on has nothing to do with fundamentals,
good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Noglows considers Yahoo _ a gateway for Web surfers for
information, electronic mail, shopping and other Internet services
_ one of the stars of his sector. He likes its strategy and
management.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, an announcement like Tuesday's might lead him
to urge investors to buy more shares. Yahoo, based in Santa Clara,
Calif., said that earnings in the last quarter of 1998 jumped to
$25.04 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, excluding one-time
charges _ more than 10 times the $1.91 million, or 2 cents a share,
a year earlier, and well ahead of the 16 cents analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp. had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's revenues topped $76.4 million, nearly triple the level
of a year ago and 40 percent ahead of the third quarter. In
addition, the company said it would split its stock 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also said that its number of registered users had grown to
35 million from 20 million a year earlier; the number of its
advertisers rose to 2,225 from 1,700 a year ago, Yahoo said, and
those advertisers were spending more and signing longer contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But Noglows is one of six analysts _ about a quarter of those
following Yahoo _ who rate the stock as a hold rather than a buy
because these are anything but normal times for the Internet
companies that trade publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Small investors, mesmerized by the rapid growth of Internet use
and commerce, have sent shares in a wide range of Internet stocks
rocketing to previously unimaginable heights in recent weeks.
Yahoo's shares rose more than $72, or 21 percent, on Monday alone.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fuel for the growth appears to come from small
investors who trade rapidly, not the kind of long-term buyer
willing to wait years for Yahoo or other Internet pioneers to
deliver the huge profits implicit in today's valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is on more solid ground than most Internet start-ups. It
has never underperformed analyst expectations in the three years
since it went public _ something few other Internet companies, most
of which have yet to earn a dime, can say.
</P>
<P>
   But can it really be worth more than Boeing Co., the world's
largest aerospace company, or more than twice the value of
Caterpillar, the multinational heavy-equipment maker, as current
market capitalizations suggest?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, short-term traders paused to look at what they had
wrought; many headed, at least temporarily, for the exits. Yahoo's
shares fell $13.375, to $402, in Nasdaq trading, then, despite the
strong earnings, dropped another $8, to $394, in after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet stocks fell even more sharply. Amazon.com, the
Internet bookseller, fell $21.25 a share, to $163.375. Lycos, the
second-most- popular Internet search company after Yahoo, tumbled
$26.50, to $104.50. Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet
browser pioneer, fell $4.4375, to $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   With such volatility, some analysts who continue to favor buying
Internet companies say that growth themes and performance trends
are more important than price targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given up establishing price targets,'' said Daniel King
at LaSalle Street Securities in Chicago. He rated Yahoo a long-term
buy but said he would hesitate to pay current prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's earnings were notable, he said, because the 36 percent
operating margins and tight rein on selling and administrative
costs provide further evidence that Yahoo's management is keeping a
close eye on its operations as well as its long-term vision. The
company ambitiously markets itself as ``the only place anyone would
have to go to find or get connected to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   King also noted that Yahoo was well positioned to grow through
acquisitions, with $482 million in cash, and that highly valued
stock. Yahoo is for ``conservative Internet investors,'' he said,
because it leads its segment, like Amazon in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he conceded, it might be a stretch to suggest that at
these prices there is such a thing as a conservative Internet
investor.

 &HT;    Ewing getting in shape with the Heat
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pat Riley has worked some surprising trades since coming
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But this would have the biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing arrived at the Heat's training facility Tuesday.
... to work out. Ewing was not traded to Miami and didn't find a
way to break his contract and join the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to just get away for awhile and relax,'' Ewing said
following the work out. ``It felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, the union president who was heavily involved in the
191-day lockout, arrived in a sports utility vehicle driven by
David Holcombe, Alonzo Mourning's body guard. Ewing and Mourning
are close friends, although Ewing is not staying at Mourning's
home. Ewing was vacationing in the Caribbean during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in New York, he mentioned he needed a break, he
needed to get out of New York,'' Mourning said. ``I (said), `Where
are you going?' He (said), `I don't want to go too far away but I
want to go to warm weather.' At the last minute he called me and
told me he was going to relax for a couple of days and work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent bad blood between the Heat and Knicks, Heat
coach Pat Riley welcomed Ewing. Riley and Ewing are friends since
their days in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless (General Manager) Randy Pfund was trying to pull the
wool over my eyes, I didn't know what was going on,'' Riley said.
``I was pleasantly surprised to see Patrick Ewing show up at the
Heat facility.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA opened every facility this week, allowing players
to work out as the new collective bargaining agreement was being
finalized, it said players could use any facility they preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said last week his duties as the union president cut into
his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of shape, but if he hangs around here with us, he'll
be in shape,'' Heat center Duane Causwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing joined a group of Heat players Tuesday night at the
University of Miami for a pick-up game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold as hell in New York,'' said Heat guard Tim Hardaway,
who as the team player representative dealt with Ewing during the
lockout. ``He did a tremendous job (as union president). He needed
to get away from the scene up there and start working out all day,
every day and get himself in shape. I don't care who works out with
us.

 &HT;    Hernandez refuses to play in Cuba
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If major league baseball is going to
start playing exhibition games in Cuba, Marlins pitcher Livan
Hernandez wants no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's something that Fidel Castro is going to profit from,
then I'm definitely not for it,'' Hernandez said Tuesday. ``I came
to this country to have freedom. I wouldn't want to go back to play
in Cuba and have part of my salary go to Fidel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins aren't making any such plans, but the Baltimore
Orioles are. As part of President Clinton's recently announced
proposal to relax long-standing trade restrictions against Cuba,
the Orioles are working on plans to play two exhibition games
against the Cuban national team _ one in Cuba and one in Baltimore
_ this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it wants the games only if
profits go to humanitarian efforts instead of Castro's communist
government, but Hernandez doubts that's how it would actually work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see doors open, and I'd like to see a lot of Cuban
ballplayers come to the U.S., as long as the money would be for
them or if they stayed in this country,'' Hernandez said. ``But
they would have to return to Cuba with the money, and then it goes
to Fidel. I know all about that situation, I came here and left my
family in Cuba just to escape from that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The last major-league team to play in Cuba was the Brooklyn
Dodgers, who trained in Havana in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 23, defected from Cuba three years ago and went on to
earn fame as the MVP of the Marlins' 1997 World Series victory.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tejera, 22, defected from Cuba five years ago and has
pitched in the Marlins' minor-league system for the past four
years. He was 15-6 with a 3.65 ERA last season in 28 games split
between Class A Kane County and AA Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's something that's going to benefit Castro, I
don't think it should be something the Orioles want to do,'' Tejera
said. ``As long as that communist government and Fidel Castro is in
there, it can't be good. People here have a lot of family members
who have lost their lives trying to escape from there, and that's
something that people don't forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play in Cuba when that communist government falls and
Fidel Castro is no longer there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Working Out: Hernandez and Tejera were just two of several
Marlins players in the Pro Player Stadium clubhouse Tuesday, using
the weight room and hitting in the batting cages. The Marlins also
let former players who live in the area come and work out. Jeff
Conine, Kurt Abbott and Charles Johnson have veen around lately,
and Edgar Renteria, who was traded to St. Louis last month, was at
the stadium Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria, who was at home in Colombia at the time of the trade,
said he was disappointed _ but not surprised _ to be shipped out of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of stuff that happens with the Marlins,''
Renteria said. ``I was kind of surprise, because I thought I would
be here forever. But when you see everybody else going, and I'm
thinking I'm the last guy here, I'm not too surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Renteria got the call from Marlins General Manager Dave
Dombrowski the night he was traded. Shortly thereafter, he heard
from Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who plans to bat Renteria
leadoff in a St. Louis lineup in which the pitcher bats eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading off, that will be good for me, because I can move
around the bases and be in front of Mark McGwire,'' Renteria said.
``I'm happy to be playing now for St. Louis, and it's a good team,
but I still love Miami and I still love the fans here. I always
will.''

AMGEN MAY GO SHOPPING FOR GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Amgen Inc. would consider buying another company
to boost its drug pipeline, said Kevin Sharer, president of the
biotechnology drug giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sharer's comments, made Tuesday at the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist biotech
investors conference in San Francisco, address a major criticism of
the company by analysts who say Amgen has too few products in
development to make up for the anticipated slowing sales growth of
its two blockbuster drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to bet Amgen on an acquisition,'' Sharer said,
``but we would not shy away from the right opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Amgen's two mainstay products, Neupogen and Epogen,
generates more than $1 billion in sales annually. And while the
company continues to find new uses for the drugs and to develop
newer versions of them, it has not yet found a third blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amgen's only other product, the hepatitis-C treatment
Infergen, generates less than one-tenth the revenue of either
Epogen or Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Amgen has shied away from buying other
companies for their pipeline, and a purchase now would be a
surprise, some analysts say. Analyst Craig Parker at Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in San Francisco said Amgen has been strongly
focused on in-house research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen spokesman David Kaye said Sharer's comments represented no
change in the company's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always looked at a variety of potential acquisitions,
whether licensing or possibly acquiring a company, and you aren't
seeing any divergence of strategy now,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares closed down $1.625 at $107 on Tuesday. Sharer's
comments came after the market closed.

AS THE ROSTER OF HEALTH INSURERS SHRINKS, COMPLAINTS WIDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Moves up 24th graph to create new 4th graf. In 5th graph,
``latest deal'' changes to `Prudential deal.'')  (fe) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The health insurance industry is rapidly whittling itself down
to a few giant companies that dominate the health systems of some
of the country's biggest cities. Critics warn that the trend no
longer is simply a threat to doctors and hospitals. It is
increasingly raising questions about the cost and availability of
care to millions of patients and their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism sharpened after the recent announcements of two
billion-dollar deals that would propel Aetna Inc. to first place
among the nation's health insurers. Last month, Aetna agreed to buy
Prudential Health Care, the No. 5 for-profit managed care company,
while it was still digesting its July purchase of Nylcare, No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Health Care would thus join a pantheon of insurers
swallowed in the last few years, including the health care
divisions of Metropolitan Life, Travelers, New York Life and John
Hancock. In only five years, a dozen companies have been scooped up
by six survivors: Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, Foundation
Health Systems, Pacificare and Wellpoint Health Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some health policy experts say they do not worry about big
companies getting bigger at the national level, if customers are
thinly scattered. But with the acquisition of Prudential, Aetna,
with 39 percent of the Philadelphia market, would take similarly
potent positions in numerous other markets. It would have nearly 60
percent of managed care members in Houston, nearly half in Dallas
and more than 30 percent in Atlanta, Philadelphia and the New York
area, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein, the Wall
Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Prudential deal quickly drew expressions of concern from
groups monitoring patients' rights and doctors' groups like the
American Medical Association and medical societies in a half-dozen
states. Executives of large employers were worried about the impact
on cost and quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that payments to doctors will be trimmed, leading
them to spend less time with each patient, and this could hurt the
quality of care. And patients fear that they will be forced to
switch doctors.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors and hospitals, the concern is not only that insurers
dictate prices, but that if one or two insurers dominate a market,
some doctors and hospitals will be left out in the cold. And
employers worry about having fewer plans competing for their
business, a trend that is already translating into higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage of Aetna and Prucare will result in one company
controlling over one-third of the New Jersey market,'' said Dr.
David Swee, a New Brunswick family practitioner, who is an official
of the Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And with about three of every 10 managed care members in
Atlanta, Aetna ``will be in a position to start dictating
reimbursement rates,'' said David Harrell, chief executive of the
Georgia Baptist Health Care System. ``That is extremely dangerous.
It ultimately has the potential of driving down quality'' by
pressing hospitals to discharge patients prematurely and skimp on
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry insists that these concerns are
groundless, assuring critics that small regional insurers, as well
as hospitals' own HMOs, will always be around to provide
competition. And they must be big in a given market, they say, to
keep costs from spiraling out of control _ and to afford extensive
information systems that may someday help improve patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismiss such arguments. The New Jersey medical society
called for ``appropriate action'' by state and federal antitrust
authorities ``to protect consumers, assure a vigorous market and
protect the patient-physician relationship.'' The New Jersey
Citizen Action Group has also asked insurance regulators in New
Jersey to investigate the Aetna-Prudential deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Prudential deal ``could endanger patient choices and impair
patient care,'' said Dr. Swee of the New Jersey society. The
American Medical Association made the same point in a letter last
month to the Justice Department's antitrust divison.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, even before the Prudential purchase, Aetna and
a local Blue Cross company, Keystone Health Plan East, together
controlled about four of every five members of HMOs and similar
networks. With Prudential, Aetna would be even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A marketplace this large should not be subject to a near
monopoly,'' said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, director of the University of
Pennsylvania health policy center. ``If one of the two starts to
gain a larger foothold, or the other one slips, we are going to
have a true monopoly situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national
health care consumers organization, said consumers ``would have
good reason to be concerned'' in markets where Aetna, which has
adamantly opposed patient protection legislation, took a dominant
position. ``Other HMOs have been much more forthcoming in trying to
be patient-sensitive and consumer-sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employers are also frustrated, said Charles Blankensteen, a
health care expert at William Mercer, a consulting firm. ``Choice
in the marketplace is rapidly diminishing, customer service and
value for the dollar are less than spectacular,'' he said. ``Who
bears the costs of these acquisitions? My bet is, it's the people
who buy the services.''
</P>
<P>
   But insurance executives say plenty of competition remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very fragmented industry,'' Richard L. Huber,
Aetna's chief executive, said in an interview. ``There's lots of
competition'' from Blue Cross plans and nonprofit HMOs. ``The
smaller regional guys will do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber predicted that there would be ``no more than three truly
national players'' _ Aetna, Cigna and Unitedhealth Group, which
until recently was called United Healthcare. ``We will compete with
each other and against the Harvard Pilgrims,'' he said, citing a
big nonprofit HMO with 1.3 million members in New England.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint Health Networks,
said, ``There will be fewer, bigger players and always an awful lot
of local and regional players.'' Hundreds of hospitals have their
own HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hanway, president of Cigna Healthcare, said: ``Size
matters. You need to have sufficient mass in major marketplaces.''
But he said he was ``not convinced that there is a significant
difference between 12 million members'' _ Cigna's customers _ ``and
20 million'' _ Aetna's and Prudential's.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said more consolidations were likely. Cigna,
No. 4 in managed care, has just agreed to sell its
property-and-casualty business to focus on health care and will
soon have $4 billion available for acquisitions. Humana Inc., No.
6, has also been seeking a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health system is stumbling toward a bilateral monopoly of
insurance companies and provider groups in every market,'' said Uwe
E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, already the largest insurers
in many cities, have also been consolidating, with mergers and
alliances in Connecticut and Indiana, central and western
Pennsylvania, California and Georgia, and Texas and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   If only one insurer is left to deal with local doctors and
hospitals, Professor Reinhardt said, ``They will send the bill to
the consumer'' by raising premiums. ``Then the government will say:
`You have converted health care into a public utility. We are going
to regulate you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross plans in some states are already closely controlled.
For instance, the Michigan plan, which has two-thirds of the
private insurance market in Lansing, is ``regulated by the state
and purchasers and unions on its board,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg,
president of the Center for Health System Change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives reject Reinhardt's argument, saying that
statistics commonly used on Wall Street do not give the full
picture, which should include not only managed care customers but
also fee-for-service insurance and employers that self-insure.
</P>
<P>
   By the more inclusive definition, Aetna is ``still only a
minority player, even in markets like New Jersey where we are the
largest,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Size may be a mixed blessing in some states. ``HMOs are
struggling in Texas,'' said Margaret Jordan, a hospital consultant
in Dallas, where hospital executives and doctors have loudly
criticized HMOs, starting with Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA, which has jousted with Aetna for months over harsh
restrictions in doctors' contracts, said the acquisition would
``create a dominant entity'' that would ``further diminish the
ability of patients to receive the quality of care they seek.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Justice Department, the Federal Trade
Commission and state insurance officials in New Jersey and
Connecticut, Consumers for Quality Care, a patients' advocacy group
in Santa Monica, Calif., urged regulators to ``disallow the
proposed buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With greater market share in key cities and states,'' it said,
``Aetna will have put itself in a position to offer more patients
less coverage for ever higher premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   AMA officials said last Friday that they had had preliminary
discussions with Justice Department officials and would provide
data to the government this week to support the doctors' charges.
In a rare indication of government concern three years ago, Justice
Department and FTC antitrust officials asked a federal appeals
judge in Chicago to leave the door open for future cases against
HMOs. Judge Richard A. Posner did so, remarking in his ruling that
health plans ``may vary in respects crucial to antitrust
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal antitrust officials declined to comment.

   Robert Leibenluft, a health care lawyer in Washington who
specializes in antitrust matters, said the federal agencies had
rarely, if ever, challenged HMO mergers.

<P>
   Leibenluft said it was unclear whether the managed care
consolidations were ``such that the HMOs would be able to raise
their prices and the buyers would not have an alternative.'' Even
if an HMO dominated a market, he said, the buyers might be able to
switch to other types of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A ``more serious issue,'' he said, would be whether doctors were
locked into exclusive arrangements with a particular HMO. In a 1995
ruling, Judge Posner held that although an HMO affiliated with the
Marshfield Clinic in rural Wisconsin was ``the dominant provider of
medical services'' in its region, the HMO was not a monopoly
because patients could consult the same doctors through other
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Several large employers said the merger trend had not paid off
in better care.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bradley, director of managed care plans at General Motors
Corp., said he was ``very concerned that the health care industry
is moving away from local delivery systems and HMOs are becoming
more and more like insurance companies,'' which mainly pay bills
without focusing on providing appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the managed care companies had the potential to
improve their information systems, attract ``good local physician
leaders'' and press them to treat patients according to ``best''
practices. ``The opportunities are good, but I haven't seen it
happen yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Peres, manager of benefit planning for Ameritech Corp.,
said employers wanted to see if Aetna could ``mesh these
organizations together without creating employee relations
nightmares'' involving poor service to customers and angering
doctors and hospitals by delaying payments.
</P>
<P>
   J. Randall McDonald, an executive vice president of GTE Corp.,
said GTE would consider the quality of service and costs in judging
the merged companies. ``If it works to our standard, we'll be a
good customer,'' he said. ``If it doesn't, as we have done with
others, we'll say they don't meet our criteria, and we'll move
on.''

U.S GOVERNMENT JOINS ONEIDA INDIANS' SUIT AGAINST NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: In 2nd graf, corrects to ``intervention'' sted ``invention.''
In 17th graf, removes the word ``suits.'')  (fe) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government has joined the Oneida Indians
in a lawsuit that contends the state and local governments
unlawfully acquired 270,000 acres of land in central New York from
the Indians nearly 200 years ago, whittling down what had been a
sprawling reservation into a meager 32-acre plot.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Oneidas' land claim has been wending its way through
federal courts since 1970, the victim of fruitless settlement
negotiations between the Indians and three different New York
governors, the intervention of the Justice Department has
galvanized the attention of state and local officials on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, lawyers for the Justice Department and the
Oneidas have provoked widespread anxiety and anger among private
landowners by seeking to expand the suit to name not just the
state, but also some 20,000 property owners in central New York as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Oneidas adamantly maintain that
they have no interest in evicting people from their homes or
forcing them to pay rent to the tribe and say the suit really is
intended to pressure the state into reaching a settlement. But such
assurances have not stopped people from believing that their homes
and farms are in danger, that they will be unable to buy or sell
property or that banks will stop making loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very emotional issue and no amount of assurances are
going to completely allay people's anxieties,'' said State Sen.
Raymond Meier, a Republican from Oneida County. ``The only way to
do that is to bring this to a rapid and complete conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the suit to include individual land owners _
which would have to be approved by U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn
in Syracuse _ comes at a time of simmering tensions between the
Oneidas and some business owners, who contend the Oneidas' tax-free
status is putting them out of business. The Oneidas, who have
become one of the region's largest employers, run a casino and
hotel as well as several stores, restaurants and gas stations where
customers do not pay sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or twelve family-owned businesses are now gone because the
Indian businesses have an unfair advantage,'' said Assemblyman
David Townsend, a Republican from Oriskany. ``And they flaunt it in
people's faces by advertising tax-free goods.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department's involvement has now made the
Federal Goverment a target of the anger. ``It's amazing that they
basically sided with a foreign nation against us.,'' said Lisa
Jensen, a 31-year-old landowner. ``You hit yourself on the head and
you ask where do my tax dollars go? Against me?''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas contend that New York State violated the federal
Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibited states from
acquiring land from Indians without federal approval. They argue
that between 1795 and 1840, the state and local governments entered
into 26 treaties and several purchase agreements with the Oneidas
to acquire all but 32 of the 270,000 acres now in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of those transactions were approved by Congress,
lawyers for the Justice Department and the Oneidas say, making the
sales invalid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the Supreme Court upheld that argument in a ``test
case'' filed by the Oneidas that named Oneida and Madison counties
as defendants and claimed just 900 acres. At that point, the state
opened negotiations with the Oneidas and the litigation was put on
hold for the next 13 years, until the Oneidas and the Justice
Department moved to expand the case last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's actions have prompted finger-pointing
between the administration of Gov. George Pataki and the Oneidas,
with each side blaming the other for stonewalling the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office contends that negotiations have stalled
largely because there are three groups of Oneidas who are parties
to the lawsuit _ one in New York, one in Wisconsin and one in
Ontario, Canada _ and that they have often feuded over strategy and
goals. But aides to the governor contend that even fractured talks
with the Oneidas are preferable to the new legal tack chosen by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the federal government has turned its back on the
people of central New York,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for
Pataki. ``We think it would be much more productive if they played
a helpful role in negotiations rather than taking sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond Halbritter, the elected leader of the Oneida Indian
Nation of New York, asserted that Pataki had been poorly served by
his legal advisers, who did not recognize the Oneidas' frustration
with the turtle-paced negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that we have to litigate,'' said Halbritter, whose
grandmother, Mary Cornelius Winder, began advocating the land claim
more than 70 years ago. ``These are our neighbors and friends; we
would like a future here. We know they are angry. But we think that
most reasonable people, once they know the history, know we didn't
want to sue so many property owners. But we really had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, the federal government has resolved at
least 10 such Indian land claims in Connecticut, Maine and other
states, usually by creating funds with state and federal money that
allow tribes to purchase land in proscribed areas from willing
sellers, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lands acquired that way have then become part of their
federally recognized reservations, exempt from local sales and
property taxes and eligible for a variety of federal services.
Officials said they knew of no cases in which people who have
purchased land in disputed areas have been forced to give it back
to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Oneida and Madison counties, which contain the
270,000 acres, said there was no evidence yet that the suit had
caused title insurance companies to stop issuing policies or banks
to withhold mortgages. They also said there was no indication that
property values had been affected by the suit or that people were
having trouble selling land.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph J. Eannace, the Oneida County executive, said he had
heard of numerous cases of property owners canceling contracts to
expand or improve their homes or commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the uncertainty raised by the
possession claim is doing damage,'' Eannace said. ``It has worried
people, caused a great deal of anxiety and had a chilling affect on
our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Oneida officials have asserted that the land claim area has an
assessed value of more than $1 billion. But they have signaled a
willingness to accept less money than that in exchange for other
concessions from the state. For instance, Halbritter has floated
the idea of creating a large economic development zone, where the
Oneidas could use an array of tax incentives to attract large
manufacturers to the region.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Halbritter also suggested that the suit could be
resolved if the state allowed the Oneidas to open a casino at the
Monticello racetrack in Orange County. But Halbritter said the
Pataki administration demanded that 90 percent of the profits go to
the state, which the Oneidas rejected.
</P>
<P>
   State and Indian officials have also said privately that a land
claims settlement could be used to resolve several longstanding
issues between the Oneidas and the state. For instance, the Oneidas
have sought state approval to install slot machines and sell
alcohol in their Turning Stone casino in Verona. And the state has
been seeking Oneida approval for a system to collect sales taxes on
gasoline and other products sold on Oneida land to non-Indians.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is engendering some of the bitterness among property owners
toward the Oneidas now is the Indians' new affluence. When the suit
was first filed, the Oneidas had dwindled to a few hundred
families, many of them living in trailer homes on the nation's
32-acre plot.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nation operates a successful casino, two hotels, a
convention center, a T-shirt printing plant, five gasoline stations
and eight restaurants. It employs 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But several local officials praised the Indians for bringing
jobs to the economically struggling region. And they said the
Oneida's latest legal maneuver had at least forced public officials
to focus on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very unhappy with the suit the Oneidas filed,''
Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, said.
``But the silver lining is that it has prompted everyone to pay
attention.''

 Use Taxes Are Most Overlooked  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My business buys goods for resale and our customers pay
sales taxes on them, but we sometimes keep some supplies for our
own use. Is there any tax liability for doing this?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  There sure is, and it's called a use tax. The state
Board of Equalization, which collects California sales taxes, says
purchases are subject to use tax under one of the following
conditions:
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is made for resale but used for another purpose or
it is made from an out-of-state retailer and never intended for
resale.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a seller's permit and purchase merchandise that you
intend to sell, the purchase is not subject to the 6 percent
California sales tax or up to 2.5 percent additional local sales
taxes until it is bought by the ultimate consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the wholesale customer decides to use the material
himself, then he is deemed the ultimate customer and has to pay a
use tax in the month or quarter they convert the product to their
own use,'' said Craig Malmgren, an accountant with Lautze &AMP; Lautze
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   That means if you operate a hardware store and use some of the
inventory for your own purposes or you sell furniture and take some
sofas to outfit your office, you are liable for use tax. What you
wind up paying is the same amount as sales tax, and the figure
should be entered on Line 2 of your return. (Using merchandise for
display or demonstration before resale is not generally considered
subject to use tax.)
</P>
<P>
   You also are supposed to pay the use tax if you buy something
from out of state for your own use, like an office computer, and
pay no sales tax. If you do pay another state's sales tax, you can
take that as a credit against your California assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of California businesses to pay use tax is the biggest
area of noncompliance, according to state Board of Equalization
audits. Each year, about 2 percent of the approximately 1 million
holders of California seller's permits are audited and about 30
percent of recovered revenues is from unpaid use tax, said Board of
Equalization technical adviser Laureen Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   She says one of the first things auditors do is compare purchase
invoices with sales receipts. If you get caught not paying use tax,
you will have to pay the amount due plus 12 percent annual
interest. If you didn't pay because of negligence, there is a
penalty equal to 10 percent of the base amount. If your behavior is
deemed egregious, the auditors might assert fraud and charge a 25
percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out the Board of Equalization's Web
site ( &LR; www.boe.ca.gov &LR; ). Relevant documents are Pamphlet 73 (Your
Seller's Permit) and regulations 1684 and 1685.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a Business
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to buy a small business that has had erratic earnings.
Last year, it had net income of $12,872 on $392,779 in revenues,
and &UR;  &LR; in the previous three years, it lost $2,403 and made $43,173
and $35,171, respectively, on slightly smaller sales. The business
has high cost of goods and other expenses, which I think I can
reduce, and I like the company's customer base and its expertise.
Can you suggest a basic formula to calculate the value of this
business based on its historical performance? And how does this
vary by type of business?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, figuring the value of a business is not like
computing the hypotenuse of a triangle. There are no easy formulas.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear from your question whether the income figures
are before or after you deduct your salary. That is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Van Dyke, vice president of ValueNomics Research in
Cupertino and co-author of ``The Business of Business Valuation,''
suggests that buyers of a business should figure income after first
deducting a ``living wage.'' This is based on the particular
business and their experience level. You can get a feel for typical
compensation by checking career ads, looking at trade publications
and interviewing people who do similar work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are no earnings left after you pay yourself for your
hours worked, you are basically buying a job and might be better
off avoiding the risks and working for someone else,'' says Van
Dyke. ``Being your own boss can be very satisfying but perhaps not
if you aren't making a living wage.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There are various business-plan handbooks and assessments of
typical costs, but no standard earnings models, not even for
businesses in the same industry. Van Dyke's research on
occupational medicine clinics, for example, revealed that these
clinics sold for three to six times their trailing 12-month
earnings before depreciation, interest and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a value on a business is like making minestrone. There
are a bunch of ingredients, and no two are exactly alike. Among the
factors besides income statement that usually are considered,
according to Van Dyke, are: the balance sheet, the history and
nature of the business, its future earnings capacity and prospects,
and the condition and outlook for the company's industry and the
economy, which could be the local, regional, national or
international.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the warnings on mutual funds, a company's past
performance may not represent its future potential. Before you buy,
you probably will want to thoroughly research the industry online
and at bookstores or libraries, and seek the advice of a valuation
professional or other business expert. The Service Corps of Retired
Executives sponsored by the Small Business Administration often is
available for free help.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the living wage, Van Dyke suggests that you
probably should expect at least a 17 to 20 percent annual return on
your equity investment to compensate for for the risk of buying and
operating your own business.

CLINTON DEFIES GOP, RENOMINATES HORMEL FOR LUXEMBOURG
AMBASSADORSHIP  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has defied senior Republican
lawmakers by renominating a prominent San Francisco philanthropist
as ambassador to Luxembourg, a post in which he would be the first
openly gay American envoy, White House and congressional officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the nomination of the businessman, James Hormel, 66,
was quietly resubmitted last week to the Senate, where it died last
year because the majority leader, Trent Lott, refused to put it
before the full Senate for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hormel is eminently qualified and he had solid bipartisan
support in the last Congress,'' a White House spokesman, Barry
Toiv, said. ``We were confident then and we are confident now that
if the nomination were brought to the floor of the Senate and there
were a fair up-or-down vote he would be confirmed. We hope that is
what will happen this year, and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Hormel, heir to the Hormel family
meat-processing fortune and a former dean at the University of
Chicago Law School, had received broad bipartisan support in the
Senate. Congressional officials agreed that he would have probably
been confirmed in a full Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which is led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is
generally considered no friend to the gay rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott, R-Miss., had no immediate comment on the
renomination.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's decided to refuse to allow a vote on the nomination last
year after an interview in which he described homosexuals as
sinners who like alcoholics and kleptomaniacs could overcome their
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's nomination was aggressively opposed by a conservative
religious organization, the Traditional Values Coalition, which
provided senators with copies of sexually explicit material from a
special gay-research center named for Hormel at the San Francisco
Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, who has said he had nothing to do with the selection of
books and magazine for the library, has long provided financial
support to gay-rights causes. He has also given large donations to
causes like breast-cancer treatment and the San Francisco Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Luxembourg, where discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation is outlawed, has said it would welcome
Hormel's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has refused to give interviews about the nomination,
Hormel answered some Republican critics last year in a letter to
the Senate in which he said, ``I will not use, nor do I think it
appropriate to use, the office of the ambassador to advocate any
personal views that I may hold on any issue.''
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans who know Hormel have been indignant over his
treatment by the Senate. George Shultz, who returned to San
Francisco after having been Secretary of State in the Reagan
administration, has said Hormel would be a ``wonderful
representative of our country.''

 Intel Tops Analysts' Forecasts  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Intel Corp. roared into 1999 yesterday, reporting record earnings
that surprised even optimistic Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter of Intel's 1998 fiscal year, the Santa
Clara chip giant reported net income of $2.1 billion on revenue of
$7.6 billion, gains of 18 and 17 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blowout quarter any way you cut it,'' said Ashok
Kumar, an analyst with Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's earnings of $1.19 per share beat the $1.07 per share
anticipated by a First Call Corp. survey of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest maker of microprocessors _ the brains
of personal computers _ showed not only that it increased sales for
the three-month holiday season, but also that it slashed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some downbeat news as well. After a yearlong slump
in the global semiconductor market, Intel's net income for the year
of $6.1 billion was down 13 percent from 1997, when the company
raked in $6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Intel told analysts not to expect continued
smashing success in the first quarter of this year. Sales usually
fall after the holiday season, Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant
told analysts in a conference call, and the company plans to boost
its marketing efforts to sell several new products it plans to
launch before March.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts didn't share Bryant's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're being extremely conservative, and you can
underline extremely,'' said David Wu, an analyst with ABN Amro in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very miraculous machine,'' Wu said, marveling at
how revenues grew while expenses declined, to the tune of a 58
percent gross margin. ``Gross margin is the key story here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu also said the strong earnings might signal the end of the
doldrums for the chip market, which has seen hundreds of layoffs in
Silicon Valley and elsewhere during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, the trade
group representing the chip equipment industry, was buoyant in a
conference at Pebble Beach this week. ``We believe we're on the
verge of an upswing,'' SEMI President Stanley Myers declared.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, the Piper Jaffray analyst, was not so sure. ``I don't
think it's a carte blanche recovery,'' Kumar said, noting that a
recovery for Intel doesn't necessarily spell good news for other
chipmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel recouped some market share it had lost to rival Advanced
Micro Devices in selling chips for inexpensive computers, Kumar
said. AMD reports its earnings results today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the year ahead is marked with uncertainty about how
concerns about the Year 2000 computer bug will affect personal
computer sales. Intel executive vice president Paul Otellini
yesterday refused to predict whether sales would go up or down as a
result of companies fixing their so-called Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   And while sales in Japan continued to lag, Intel reported record
sales in other parts of Asia, especially in Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock, which had fallen $4.19 to $135.56 yesterday,
surged in after-hours trading to as high as $139 a share.

 Brain Drain at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities'
Biotech  Practice  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities says it isn't pulling the plug on
biotechnology banking, but it isn't sure how long it will keep that
underwriting specialty alive on life-support either.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco investment banking arm of BankAmerica is
definitely pulling back from biotech investment banking, but
Montgomery officials say their firm still plans to underwrite
medical technology offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no change in our commitment to medical technology.
(But) in biotechnology, there have been some departures in both
corporate finance and research, which leads us to assess how to add
resources back to the group,'' a NationsBanc Montgomery Securities
spokeswoman says.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: We've lost key bankers and analysts in both biotech
and medtech. And while we still intend to underwrite medtech
stocks, we no longer have the candlepower to do biotech deals. We
aren't sure if we want to rebuild our biotech practice.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's column, Street Smarts reported that the annual
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist health care conference was abuzz with word that
its archrival Montgomery was pulling stakes on its biotech and
medtech underwriting businesses. Montgomery officials were unable
to respond before deadline for that article, but their boss,
BankAmerica Chairman Hugh McColl, indicated that such a move would
be news to him.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: The bank has lost more than half of the
analysts and bankers who specialize in the two disciplines. They
are either leaving the firm or getting reassigned to different
jobs, says a senior investment banker at Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The number of senior financial analysts devoted to medtech and
biotech has dwindled from four _ the size of the staff before the
firm was bought by BankAmerica _ to a single medtech analyst: Kurt
Kruger, the investment banker says.
</P>
<P>
   Already gone is biotechnology analyst Faraz Naqui, who quit
Montgomery last week to take a buy-side analyst job at Dresdner RCM
Global Investors in San Francisco. In addition, biotechnology
analyst David Crossen, who was somewhat infamous for his unabashed
endorsement of BioTime _ an East Bay favorite of short sellers _
left Montgomery last October. And in December, biotechnology
analyst Scott Sacaney, who was based in Montgomery's New York
office, also left the firm, the senior banker says.
</P>
<P>
   On the deal-making side, biotechnology banker Stuart Duty
departed from Montgomery earlier this year. And at least a couple
of other bankers are planning to quit (but have yet to tell their
staffs) or are getting reassigned within the firm, the banker says.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, suffice it say that Montgomery isn't making life-science
clients a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in an assessment stage, (but) I think we will
ultimately rebuild'' our biotech practice, says the senior banker.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; THE BOYS ARE BACK: Sandy Robertson returned to the business pages
with a bang yesterday, announcing his role in an E-Trade
affiliate's plan to underwrite stocks via the internet. But the
founder of investment firm BancBoston Robertson Stephens isn't
alone. His longtime rival William Hambrecht, co-founder of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, also is cooking up some kind of underwriting
venture for the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists close to Hambrecht say the visionary plans
to underwrite stock offerings for companies that might not
ordinarily get courted by traditional investment banks. These
initial offerings, in turn, would get distributed to investors via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman for his
new investment firm, W.R. Hambrecht + Co., said the financier isn't
prepared to talk about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   However, the spokesman released a statement saying Hambrecht
plans to launch his new venture ``sometime in the next several
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Hambrecht from taking a friendly stab at
his old adversary, Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can tell you is that what you will see from W.R.
Hambrecht + Co. will be different than anything occurring in the
marketplace right now,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy and Bill. At it again. Just like old times. It makes you
wonder what ever happened to civilized retirement activities like
golf and bridge?

 Investment Banking Next For E-Trade  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-Trade Group, the No. 2 online securities broker, said yesterday
it will help form an investment bank that will market initial
public stock offerings exclusively over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a burst of bold, high-visibility expansion
moves that have sent the Palo Alto company's stock soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on a half-billion-dollar cash hoard from offerings of
its stock and investment by Japan's Softbank, E-Trade in the past
few months has announced plans to invest in an all-electronic
options exchange and an electronic communications network that
allows trading of Nasdaq stocks outside the regular Nasdaq system.
</P>
<P>
   It also recently launched the first online bond-trading system
for individual investors on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While the market yesterday was sharply down, E-Trade stock
rocketed $12.44 per share to $100.94. That is more than twice what
it was selling for two weeks ago and eight times the price as
recently as last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to become the global leader in electronic personal
financial services,'' said Kathy Levinson, E-Trade's president and
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The new investment bank, to be called E-Offering, is scheduled
to start operating before the end of this year. E-Trade will buy a
28 percent stake in the firm for an undisclosed sum, with an option
to increase its ownership to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   E-Offering will be a full-service investment bank, marketing
IPOs in the $25 million to $50 million range, mainly from small,
high-technology companies, some of which have already expressed
interest. Only one other investment bank, Wit Capital of New York,
currently confines its operations entirely to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never did we think that we would remain alone in this
marketplace,'' says Mike Carbone, head of investment banking in
Wit's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Half of each E-Offering IPO will be offered to institutional
investors. The other half will be made available to E-Trade
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said any shares that aren't gobbled up by those groups
will be marketed through other online firms. E-Trade is in
discussions with several such firms, but hasn't struck any deals
yet, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said E-Offering will be able to charge IPO companies
substantially lower fees than most investment bankers do because
its electronic distribution system will be ``much less
labor-intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers typically charge their customers fees equal
to about 7 percent of the IPO offering price. E-Offering would
scale that down to about 4.5 percent, Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has only a minority stake, E-Trade has no plans to
actively manage the firm _ at least initially. However, Levinson
and Christos M. Cotsakos, E-Trade's chairman and chief executive,
will serve on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   E-Offering's chief executive will be another investor in the
firm, Walter Cruttenden 3rd of Newport Beach (Orange County). He is
the founder and former CEO of the Cruttenden Roth securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent investor will be Sandy Robertson, founder of
San Francisco's Robertson Stephens investment-banking firm. He quit
as chairman of Robertson Stephens last year after it was bought by
Bank Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he won't be able to take a role in E-Offering's
management for a year, because he signed a noncompete agreement
when he left his old firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this a very fine Internet investment, a good
business plan,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade offered its customers portions of 25 IPOs last year,
most of them underwritten by Robertson Stephens, with which it
struck an alliance. Almost all those offerings were
``oversubscribed,'' Levinson said, with many customers getting
fewer shares than they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers were telling us that they have an incredible
interest in IPOs,'' she observed. She said E-Offering should make
it easier to satisfy that interest.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Franco, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in San Francisco,
said he expects the E-Offering venture to draw many new customers
to E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs are ``by far the hottest product for the retail investor
that E-Trade caters to,'' he observed. ``Being able to provide
customers with high-quality IPOs is a huge differentiator for an
online broker. There are very few single products that would make
an individual open an account, and IPOs are one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ETRADE13 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman for Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the
largest online broker, said her company has no plans to create its
own investment bank, but ``we never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Schwab is ``pretty happy'' with its alliances with
Credit Suisse First Boston and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, which offer
portions of all their IPOs to Schwab customers.

 Kia Tops Lemon-Dispute Index  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Unhappy owners of new Kia cars last year sought ``lemon''
arbitrations over 100 times more often than Saturn owners,
according to an analysis of dispute records by two Sacramento
consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kia ranked worst and Saturn ranked best in a list that compared
the number of vehicles sold by 14 automakers in California with the
number of cases pushed all the way to state-certified arbitrations
by buyers who couldn't get satisfaction at the dealer level.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three did slightly worse in 1997 rankings than 1996.
General Motors dropped from third to fourth. Ford went from fifth
best to 10th place. Chrysler dropped from sixth to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crash-worthiness and safety should come first, when consumers
are deciding which car to buy,'' said Rosemary Shahan, executive
director of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, which
co-authored the study with CalPIRG. ``But this lemon-dispute index
is something people should definitely think about, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors did not consider cases resolved by auto
dealers or automakers at lower levels not involving arbitration.
Nor did they consider the 1,634 cases that went to arbitration but
were settled privately.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they dealt with 2,200 cases last year in which buyers
exhausted their last avenue of appeal, usually trying to get
arbitrators to order automakers to buy back defective vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers included in the survey all have complaint
programs certified by the Arbitration Review Program administered
by the state Department of Consumer Affairs and funded by a 35-cent
tax on each vehicle sold. Among other requirements, it says
consumers should receive a fair hearing and not have to wait more
than 40 days for their ``day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the chart, because they don't participate in the
program, are several big automakers including BMW, Mercedes and
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   At the extremes, Shahan said, there seems to be a correlation
between reliability and complaint handling. ``Saturn actually
solicits complaints instead of trying to discourage them like some
companies,'' she said. ``They're very democratic about wanting all
their customers to be happy, not just the ones who complain the
loudest.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Saturns also are economical cars, she said,
``means it's possible to offer first-class treatment even if you're
not charging the most money for your products.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Gorman, spokesman for the California Motorcar Dealers
Association, said consumers should make use of the arbitration
program if they can't get redress. In fact, dealers sometimes use
the program, too. ``It's there to be used,'' he said. ``Obviously,
these groups were created because there's a perception that
consumers' problems aren't being addressed. We think the industry
is doing better all the time, though.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, D-San Francisco, said he's
considering carrying legislation this year to tighten up the
definition of a ``lemon,'' particularly if a vehicle's steering or
braking systems are defective. A bill he carried last year, which
just took effect, outlaws gag clauses, formerly commonplace, in
which consumers were prohibited from telling subsequent buyers
about the problems they'd had with their cars as a condition of
getting their cars bought back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a ways to go to make arbitration more consumer
friendly and effective,'' Shelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Current law says a vehicle is a lemon if it has chronic problems
that result in ``substantial impairment to the use, safety or
value.'' Automakers must make ``reasonable attempts'' to fix
problems while the vehicle is under warranty. It's a lemon if it's
out of service for at least 30 days or if four attempts have been
made to fix a problem in the first 12 months of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey isn't comprehensive because it doesn't address the
settlements,'' said Amy Hasha of the Arbitration Review Program.
``But it's a helpful reference.''

 Online Drug Stores Outline Web Site Plans  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The biotech craze met Internet mania in presentations by rival
online drug stores at yesterday's Hambrect &AMP; Quist health care
conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of the allure of anything online, money managers in
suits overflowed the folding chairs and sat cross-legged on the
brocaded carpets to hear chief executives from PlanetRx and
Drugstore.com tout the potential of their Web sites entering the
$168 billion U.S. drug, vitamin and nutrition market.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that neither company has yet filled a single
prescription, sold a bottle of vitamins or shipped any of the
mineral supplements or shampoos they say consumers are salivating
to buy online.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each presentation, wannabe investors pressed
business cards into the hands of PlanetRx CEO Bill Razzouk and
Drugstore.com CEO Peter Neupert.
</P>
<P>
   That was a validation for Neupert, who had quipped at one point,
``I hope a lot of you are stock buyers because it's going to take a
lot of money to build a quality business.''
</P>
<P>
   Both prepublic companies have similar plans: to take orders by
Web site forms, e-mail, fax or phone and sell a combination of
prescription drugs, over-the-counter remedies and health products
online. But that's where the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   Razzouk, a former chief operating officer of Federal Express,
outlined his plans in a methodical style. While coy on certain
details _ he declined to say when the site would launch other than
``soon'' _ he at least revealed PlanetRx's plans for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetRx has already set up its order-fulfillment operation in
Memphis, Tenn., he said, to take advantage of nearby FedEx for
next-day delivery of most orders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hiring former FedExer John McAlpin to do
distribution, Razzouk said James Chong _ who designed the online
trading system at Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. _ has already created
PlanetRx's online order system.
</P>
<P>
   Neupert revealed fewer details, instead relying on his
self-assurance, a trait perhaps learned at his alma mater,
Microsoft Corp., where he built the MSNBC Web site. Teasing
listeners, he said they probably wanted to hear Drugstore.com's
operational plans, then added, ``It's too early for me to tell you
today for competitive reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   When a groan rippled through the room, he invited people to
leave. There were few takers, as Neupert explained why an aging
population, the American fascination with vitamins and similar
trends made ``lots of room for all the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendees who heard both presentations had their favorites.
Michael Goldberg, chief executive of a health firm in San Bruno,
called Drugstore.com's Neupert a Web visionary. Noting that Neupert
had also hired former FedEx executive Tracy Nolan to run
distribution, Goldberg said, ``That's where you need the FedEx
experience, not in the CEO's spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Anil Singhal, a doctor with a biomedical startup in Santa Clara,
said that while both presentations were heavy on the hype, PlanetRx
offered more facts.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Baumgartner, an investor with the Cypress Growth Fund
in Menlo Park, left shaking his head. ``Neither of them provided
enough details,'' he said.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ You can have all those muscular metaphors, those Big
Shoulders, that City on the Make. They were nice in their time, but
their time has long passed.
</P>
<P>
   Face it _ Chicago is the city of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any longtime Chicagoan what it has been like.
</P>
<P>
   When Eppie Lederer, alias Ann Landers, used to travel overseas
and mention she was from Chicago, she would get a response that
made her cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd go `Oh, Al Capone,' and make like they were putting
their finger to a gun,'' Lederer said. ``I was ashamed,
embarrassed. Who wants to come from a city that's known for the
worst gangster of all time, where they shot people like dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   His Airness changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when Lederer discloses her Chicago pedigree, people
use their trigger fingers to fake a turnaround jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they say, `Oh, Michael Jordan,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of reports that Michael Jordan is about to step down
as basketball's supreme deity, the Capone-Jordan transformation
story was told so often in Chicago on Tuesday that it must be at
least partly apocryphal. But that, of course, is not really the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Michael Jordan has given Chicago much more
than the chance to be home to perhaps the best basketball player
ever. He has salved this city's Second City complex, put substance
behind its bravado, and even, some people say, allowed Chicago to
slip free of the dusty harness of history and create a new sense of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer the hog butcher of the world,'' said the Rev.
Andrew Greeley, the Chicago priest and sociologist. ``We Chicagoans
like to think it's a classy city, a world class city with a lot of
style. Michael symbolized that.''
</P>
<P>
   With No. 23 expected to announce his retirement on Wednesday,
Chicago, chilled and submerged under nearly two feet of snow,
seemed on Tuesday to be steadying itself for a collective eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over now,'' sniffed a headline in The Chicago
Sun-Times. ``MJ Gone,'' mourned The Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, as a role model for children and for morality, we
will never be able to replace Michael Jordan,'' said Bev Mandolini,
48, a Chicago housewife eating lunch at Michael Jordan's, the
icon's downtown burger-and-crab-cake joint.
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby table, Brian Orlow, a 25-year-old accountant, was in
flat-out denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't believe this is for real,'' Orlow said. ``I
think even if he announces his retirement, the playoffs will roll
around, the Bulls will lose to the Knicks, and Michael's
competitive juices will start flowing and he'll decide he doesn't
want to sit around and smoke cigars all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the devotion Chicago feels for Michael Jordan, one
has to understand how much this city cares about competing, about
proving itself in every arena, especially in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The losing streaks in this town are legendary _ with the Bears
(who have been on the fritz since winning the Super Bowl in 1985),
the Blackhawks (who won their last Stanley Cup in 1961), the White
Socks (who have not won a World Series since 1917) and the Cubs
(who have gone 90 years without winning a World Series, Sammy Sosa
notwithstanding). The only glimmer of hope has been the Chicago
Fire, the soccer team, which won the national championship in 1998,
but, alas, too many people here still seem to have trouble getting
jazzed up about soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that he's a winner,'' said Studs Terkel, the
author and voice of Chicago's working class. ``It's a city that has
lost so often. Jordan represents a big moment in the city of
losers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just the sweet wine of victory. It's that
Michael Jordan charm, that ebullient charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a cult in the city,'' said Saul Bellow, who is
from Chicago. (``There was no public mourning when I left
Chicago,'' Bellow noted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's really a great figure,'' Bellow continued. ``He's
a beautiful athlete. He's an exceptional person. He conducts
himself like a real gentleman, one of the few gentleman
professional sports has produced. There's no skulduggery. There's
no underhandedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, of course, has benefited financially from the Jordan
phenomenon too. And not just from his enterprises - a golf store
and two restaurants. His image has been a magnet for tourists and
basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The chief economist for the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce once
estimated that Michael Jordan single-handedly added as much as $1
billion to the region's economy, taking into account everything
from T-shirt vendors outside the United Center to the business his
endorsements bring to area businesses, like McDonald's Corp. and
Quaker Oats Co., which owns Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this also being a town that likes to think of itself
as scrappy, it was still possible on Tuesday to find people acting
nonchalant, even blase.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the larger scheme of things it doesn't make much
difference,'' said Allen R. Sanderson, an economist at the
University of Chicago who specializes in the business of sports,
who had the temerity to suggest in an opinion piece in The Chicago
Tribune on Tuesday that fans just ``get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, a self-proclaimed Bulls fan, said, ``The most
favorite season I had was the season he was gone,'' referring to
the 1994-5 season when Michael Jordan left basketball for a stint
in minor-league professional baseball. ``The rest of the team was
out there scrapping it out every night. The games were exciting,
and one pulls for the players, now that they were abandoned by
their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow, too, has faith in the resilience of Chicagoans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll begin to say, `Those were the good old days, and
there's never been anybody like Michael before or after,''' he
predicted. ```The march of history continues. Let's turn our
attention to the commodity trade.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the second and apparently final retirement of Michael
Jordan from basketball, which is expected to be announced
Wednesday, will Madison Avenue lose the most prolific, most richly
compensated and perhaps most effective endorser ever?
</P>
<P>
   Or to paraphrase Porky Pig, one of Jordan's many commercial
co-stars, will he be able to proclaim ``That's not all, folks,''
rewriting the rules of peddling products after a sports career ends
in the same way that he has rewritten so much of the pitchman's
play book?
</P>
<P>
   As reports circulated Tuesday that Jordan had decided not to
return to the Chicago Bulls for the abbreviated 1999 season, many
executives said they thought he could remain a commanding presence
in campaigns for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than an athlete, he's a cultural icon, so associated
with our lives and times,'' said Bob Scarpelli, the vice chairman
and chief creative officer at DDB Needham Chicago. That agency,
owned by Omnicom Group, has produced Jordan-centric ads for
McDonald's Corp. and the Wheaties cereal brand sold by General
Mills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan the brand is much bigger than Michael Jordan
the basketball player,'' said Brad Burns, a spokesman in Arlington,
Va., for MCI Worldcom Inc., the telecommunications marketer that
has featured Jordan in advertising since 1996. ``He doesn't have to
be in a sports setting.''
</P>
<P>
   But some executives offered caveats about the shelf life of this
human brand, ranging from the fickleness of fame to a need for
Jordan to counter perceptions that his roster of sponsors is longer
than the list of his basketball records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It partly depends on what he decides to do now,'' said Tod
Seisser, the chief creative officer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New
York, a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC that works for advertisers
like Delta Air Lines and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he becomes nothing but a professional pitchperson,''
Seisser said disapprovingly, ``I don't think we need a 7-foot-tall,
black, athletic Ed McMahon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of those interviewed echoed the thoughts of David
Lubars, creative director at Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers will still want to use him because he has
transcended sport,'' said Lubars, whose agency produces ads for
brands like Lee jeans and Miller Lite beer.
</P>
<P>
   By accomplishing that, Lubars said, Jordan is like Muhammad Ali.
And in being famous for being famous, he added, Jordan is
comparable to an Elizabeth Taylor, a Beatle or a Steve Jobs of
Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at another Babe Ruth,'' said Mark Roseler, the
chairman at CMG Worldwide in Indianapolis, which licenses to
advertisers the likenesses of celebrities, living and dead,
including Ruth, Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally with sports stars who retire, their endorsement work
gradually goes away,'' he added. ``But 40 years from now, you will
be able to envision Jordan flying through the air, dunking a
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been called the ultimate pitchman for his
overwhelming success in selling products despite what had once been
considered barriers to lucrative endorsement deals: being black,
being a professional basketball player and being on a team outside
of Los Angeles or New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last June, The Sports Marketing Letter, a sports
business newsletter, projected that Jordan would make $42 million
from his sponsors over the next 12 months. That was, as usual, by
far the fattest figure on the newsletter's annual ranking of the
``10 most wanted'' sports spokesmen, well ahead of the golfer Tiger
Woods, at $30 million, and the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal,
at $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ridiculously handsome, tremendously articulate and has a
great screen presence,'' Seisser said. ``As long as he retains
that, people will want to `be like Mike.'''
</P>
<P>
   That final remark is of course part of a slogan that has been
featured in campaigns for the Gatorade sports beverage sold by
Quaker Oats Co., one of Jordan's most prominent marketing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not about what Michael is doing, it's about who he
is,'' said P.J. Sinopoli, a spokeswoman in Chicago for the Gatorade
unit of Quaker, ``embodying the attributes of a quintessential
champion: will and perseverance and discipline and excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``we don't think the image of him with the sweat pouring
off his brow will fade quickly,'' she added, Quaker will
``absolutely'' honor a 10-year contract with Jordan that expires in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gatorade commercials for 1999 that feature Jordan will
continue to run, Ms. Sinopoli said. Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in
Chicago, a unit of True North Communications, is the Gatorade
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the most celebrated celebrities capitalize on
their popularity by signing multiple, multiyear,
multimillion-dollar endorsement contracts, Jordan's stand out for
their sheer number and variety.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisers that have visited the land of Jordan include
Nike Inc., for the Air Jordan and Jordan brands of footwear and
apparel; the Sara Lee Corporation, for Ball Park Franks and Hanes
underwear; the General Motors Corporation, for Chevrolet vehicles;
the Rayovac Corporation, for batteries, and Bijan, for the Michael
Jordan fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was borderline overexposed in terms of his
endorsements,'' said Jamie Barrett, the creative director for the
New York office of Fallon McElligott, ``which will become more of a
problem if he's not performing daily heroics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he kept topping himself, you kind of excused the
occasional lame Ball Park Franks spot because he was delivering the
goods on the court,'' said Barrett, who before joining Fallon
McElligott New York City was a leading creative executive on the
Nike account at the longtime Nike agency, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy Inc. in
Portland, Ore. ``But if he can't reinforce his star status on the
court, maybe he should be a little more selective.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and other executives agreed that how Nike decides to
portray Jordan from this moment on would significantly influence
his post-basketball marketing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael believed that once he stopped playing, his endorsement
career may become dated,'' said Andy Berlin, the chairman at Berlin
Cameron &AMP; Partners in New York, an agency that once worked for the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's popularity is still enormous,'' Berlin said. ``He's
intelligent, he's legitimately nice, he's handsome and he's
arguably the best basketball player of all time. Maybe he will be
with us in a different form.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nike's plans, Vizhier Mooney, a spokeswoman in Beaverton,
Ore., said, ``We're refraining from comment until Michael
announces.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan first retired from basketball, to play baseball in
1994, Nike incorporated that startling switch into a campaign story
line. And when he returned to the NBA in 1995, that, too, became
fodder for Nike ads. A television commercial by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy
from the fall of 1997, promoting Nike's Jordan brand product line,
may offer a preview of Jordan's persona after he stops running with
the Bulls. The spot portrayed him as ``CEO Jordan'' in a stylish
business suit, working hard in a corporate office.
</P>
<P>
   At Gatorade, ``we don't envision a Michael not in motion,'' Ms.
Sinopoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpelli, the DDB Needham Chicago executive, offered what may
be the best turn of events for advertisers. ``We're all hoping that
he buys the Bulls,'' he said, laughing, ``and runs the team.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Mandatory school Spanish proposed
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A border lawmaker said he intends to file a bill
tomorrow requiring every Texas high school student to take two
years of Spanish to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Rene Oliveira, a Brownsville Democrat, wants Spanish
to be a part of the core curriculum in public schools, along with
English, math, science, history, government and geography. The bill
would make Spanish mandatory starting with the 2000-2001 school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Oliveira, the chairman of the House Economic Development
Committee, said Texas needs more bilingual workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign language is routinely part of course work in Europe,
Asia and Latin America from the time students enter school,'' he
said in a written statement. ``Texas students should not receive
less than the best preparation to successfully deal with a changing
global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Oliveira's bill, students could study other languages as
elective courses. Schools that did not comply with the law would
lose their state accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Roussos, a spokeswoman for the state Board for Educator
Certification, said Texas doesn't have enough foreign language
teachers as it is.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to science, math, and special education, the state
has a critical shortage of foreign language, English as a Second
Language and bilingual teachers, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gray, Oliveira's legislative assistant, said the intent is
to spur debate on the subject. Finding enough teachers can be
worked on in committee.

 &HT;    With Jordan gone, what will we do? Watch tennis?
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Compared to the sad news we're likely to
officially hear today, a lockout sounds pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   If Michael Jordan isn't going to play any more, what's the
point? Without the greatest basketball player to ever lace up a
pair of sneakers, we are now left with NBA Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, MJ put on wings, not shoes. Now he leaves a league of
Jordan wannabes, a bunch of preadolescent Kobe Bryants and Allen
Iversons who lack Michael's charisma and presence and otherworldly
game. Rumor is that NBA Commissioner David Stern will even schedule
the playoffs in May and June, for what purpose we're not sure.
</P>
<P>
   But there will never, never, never be another Michael Jordan. So
let's put a stop right now to that nonsense that there might be.
There won't. It's ridiculous to put anybody in his realm, his
stratosphere. Not Grant Hill, not Tim Duncan, not even Kobe. MJ is
unique, one of a kind, irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   MJ will forever be the standard by which all future players are
measured. Six NBA finals MVP trophies, five regular-season MVP
trophies. He is a walking, talking, tongue-wagging MVP trophy. Not
bad for the third pick of the 1984 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron busted Babe Ruth's career home-run record, but
slugger Mark McGwire is compared to the Bambino, not Hammerin'
Hank. Tiger Woods is good, but he'll have to measure up to Jack
Nicklaus. Barry Sanders can dip and feint, but even his dad thinks
Jim Brown was better. In each and every sport, there's one and only
one who has climbed the mountaintop and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   I'd trade the 50-game charade the NBA will be perpetrating upon
the public this year to watch one more playoff game with Jordan. My
favorite moment will always be game five of the 1997 finals, when
he came off his sickbed to score 38 points. He willed that win.
</P>
<P>
   But until the words float out of his mouth today, we have to
wonder why. Did he run out of challenges after winning six titles
in eight years, beating five different teams? Is he retiring out of
disgust over the labor negotiations? Or because Phil Jackson's on a
goat ranch in Montana? Was he worried he might fail and not live up
to his own legend? Or does he ever consider failure?
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do now? Open a fantasy basketball camp for
50-year-old geezers? Start an afternoon talk show? Join the Nike
Tour? Try baseball again? Surely he's good enough to make the White
Sox roster now. Of course, so is Luc Longley. Guess he could
endorse the products of every Fortune 500 company. Or buy Bolivia.
Or the Bulls. Or sit around in his Hanes all day and watch ``Space
Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Where else can he possibly find contentment? Maybe nowhere.
Perhaps he'll realize that and return for the 1999-2000 season.
Possibly, he'll come back and he and Jackson will take the Lakers
to the title.
</P>
<P>
   In all seriousness, it's a tremendous blow to a league that's
already under the gun. The public will be asked to swallow a league
without its ranking superstar. Could MJ be orchestrating his
retirement to get back at the league for those acrimonious labor
talks and that deal heavily weighted toward the owners? Maybe this
is his way of thumbing his nose at Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf for
running off Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Bulls have sold every ticket for this
mini-season. And if MJ is gone, Reinsdorf saves $33 million. And he
might not even pay Scottie Pippen $14 million because he can say
Pippen never proved he could win without MJ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NBA will surely take its lumps and hope MJ gets
bored sitting around his home as a hostage of his own celebrity.
The NBA will continue, but it won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax left the game early, and baseball survived. Joe
Montana directed his last miracle, and the NFL went on. McEnroe and
Connors quit tennis and . . . well, that's a bad example. Tennis is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   MJ certainly didn't overstay his welcome. He's got plenty left.
Maybe he still will after watching Oprah for six months. Sure,
we're sorry we had to see Willie Mays not get to fly balls as a New
York Met and Johnny U. drop back as a San Diego Charger. But MJ's
not human. And he's just 35.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he changes his mind, well, we'll have to be content with
that last jump shot from the top of the key to haunt the Utah Jazz
one more time. I saw one of Michael's last games weeks afterward,
maybe his final one. It was a meaningless exhibition, a charity
game in Strahan Gym at Southwest Texas State last June.
</P>
<P>
   He played every minute of the game. How many superstars would
have done that?
</P>
<P>
   Michael, sitting around in your Hanes all day is vastly
overrated. Besides, you can always come down to Austin and play in
our Old Guys Basketball League on Thursday nights at Shepherd of
the Hills Lutheran Church. I think you can still take Pastor Steve.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CHANCES FOR HOTEL ROOM UPGRADES IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Mass.)  (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code) 
 (bl) 
By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers have a far greater chance Tuesday to obtain a
room upgrade at hotels than they've had in many years, a prominent
industry analyst believes.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, hospitality industry chairman for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that based on a recent informal survey
of hoteliers, he has concluded that business travelers now have
three times as good a chance as they did 10 years ago to get a room
upgrade. This is true in part, he said, because overall U.S. hotel
occupancy rates are expected to decline this year to 63 percent,
down from a peak of 65 percent in 1996. ``Typically, hotels fill
rooms from least to most expensive, which means a lot of the empty
rooms that will be available will be the special rooms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, according to Hanson, is the widespread adoption
by many hotel companies of the concept of ``empowerment'' for many
of their front-line employees. ``If a guest is unhappy because his
room has a problem, desk clerks can generally make a bad situation
favorable by giving the guest an upgrade,'' Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Greater public ownership of hotel companies is also a factor,
Hanson suggested; according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, 17 percent
of all U.S. hotels are now publicly owned, compared with 2 percent
10 years ago. To woo guests, Hanson believes public hotel companies
would rather compete on service than on price, which probably would
make them more responsive to upgrade requests. ``If these companies
have to compete, they'll find things that don't cost them
profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said it was appropriate for travelers to ask for an
upgrade if they encountered any problem with their room. He said
desk clerks might also be receptive if a traveler was staying for
more than one night, or if a traveler wanted to use the room to
entertain clients. ``It will be more common than not that if an
upgrade request is nicely made, and there is availability, it will
be granted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also suggested that travelers who participated in hotel
company loyalty programs stood a better chance of obtaining an
upgrade than those who did not. But he predicted that visitors to
New York, Boston and Chicago _ where occupancies are expected to
remain high _ would have a harder time getting upgrades than in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Conner, vice president of communications for Marriott
International, whose hotels include Marriott, Renaissance and
Ritz-Carlton, said, ``We appreciate Hanson's thinking, but at
Marriott we already upgrade frequently and plan to continue at
these same levels in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Dieter Huckestein, president for hotel operations at Hilton
Hotels, said, ``We try to upgrade loyal customers as much as
possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These are other hotel developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leading Hotels of the World, the hotel booking organization,
has set 1999 corporate rates, discounted an average of 15 percent,
at 156 of its 315 hotels worldwide. All business travelers are
eligible for the rates, whose availability is not limited; most
rates are offered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Four Seasons Hotel in New York is reducing rates on
superior and deluxe rooms by 25 percent, through March, to $415 and
$495, respectively. Availability is limited; taxes are not
included.
</P>
<P>
   _ B&AMP;V Associates, a New York-based booking company, is offering
a rate of $145 a night at 100 Abotel boutique hotels in Paris
through March 31. The rate includes tax and breakfast. Orion
Apartment Hotels, also represented by B&AMP;V and owned by Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., is offering rates of $100 to $350 a night at its 40
hotels in 8 European cities, including London, Paris and Brussels.
B&AMP;V's toll-free number is (800) 755-8266; bookings can also be made
through its Web site (www.apartmenthotels.com).
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it would install defibrillators for
passengers suffering from heart complaints on all of its aircraft,
starting in April. The carrier is also studying the possibility of
installing heart-monitoring equipment, linked to a satellite
communications system, that would enable doctors on the ground to
monitor ill patients in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines has added a $1 surcharge on most of its nonstop
one-way domestic tickets in what the company said was an effort to
offset climbing ticket-distribution costs. The surcharge _ which
will be $2 on round-trip tickets _ does not apply to international
tickets or domestic tickets sold over the Internet. &QL;

occupancy rates are expected to decline this year to 63 percent,
down from a peak of 65 percent in 1996. ``Typically, hotels fill
rooms from least to most expensive, which means a lot of the empty
rooms that will be available will be the special rooms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, according to Hanson, is the widespread adoption
by many hotel companies of the concept of ``empowerment'' for many
of their front-line employees. ``If a guest is unhappy because his
room has a problem, desk clerks can generally make a bad situation
favorable by giving the guest an upgrade,'' Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Greater public ownership of hotel companies is also a factor,
Hanson suggested; according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, 17 percent
of all U.S. hotels are now publicly owned, compared with 2 percent
10 years ago. To woo guests, Hanson believes public hotel companies
would rather compete on service than on price, which probably would
make them more responsive to upgrade requests. ``If these companies
have to compete, they'll find things that don't cost them
profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said it was appropriate for travelers to ask for an
upgrade if they encountered any problem with their room. He said
desk clerks might also be receptive if a traveler was staying for
more than one night, or if a traveler wanted to use the room to
entertain clients. ``It will be more common than not that if an
upgrade request is nicely made, and there is availability, it will
be granted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also suggested that travelers who participated in hotel
company loyalty programs stood a better chance of obtaining an
upgrade than those who did not. But he predicted that visitors to
New York, Boston and Chicago _ where occupancies are expected to
remain high _ would have a harder time getting upgrades than in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Conner, vice president of communications for Marriott
International, whose hotels include Marriott, Renaissance and
Ritz-Carlton, said, ``We appreciate Hanson's thinking, but at
Marriott we already upgrade frequently and plan to continue at
these same levels in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Dieter Huckestein, president for hotel operations at Hilton
Hotels, said, ``We try to upgrade loyal customers as much as
possible.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These are other hotel developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leading Hotels of the World, the hotel booking organization,
has set 1999 corporate rates, discounted an average of 15 percent,
at 156 of its 315 hotels worldwide. All business travelers are
eligible for the rates, whose availability is not limited; most
rates are offered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Four Seasons Hotel in New York is reducing rates on
superior and deluxe rooms by 25 percent, through March, to $415 and
$495, respectively. Availability is limited; taxes are not
included.
</P>
<P>
   _ B&AMP;V Associates, a New York-based booking company, is offering
a rate of $145 a night at 100 Abotel boutique hotels in Paris
through March 31. The rate includes tax and breakfast. Orion
Apartment Hotels, also represented by B&AMP;V and owned by Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., is offering rates of $100 to $350 a night at its 40
hotels in 8 European cities, including London, Paris and Brussels.
B&AMP;V's toll-free number is (800) 755-8266; bookings can also be made
through its Web site (www.apartmenthotels.com).
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it would install defibrillators for
passengers suffering from heart complaints on all of its aircraft,
starting in April. The carrier is also studying the possibility of
installing heart-monitoring equipment, linked to a satellite
communications system, that would enable doctors on the ground to
monitor ill patients in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines has added a $1 surcharge on most of its nonstop
one-way domestic tickets in what the company said was an effort to
offset climbing ticket-distribution costs. The surcharge _ which
will be $2 on round-trip tickets _ does not apply to international
tickets or domestic tickets sold over the Internet. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Polites, owner of a Nine West store in New Jersey, slashed
the price of a popular, smart-looking women's shoe last winter,
knowing he would attract many more customers _ and still earn a
smooth 60 percent profit on each pair.
</P>
<P>
   But Polites' sale irritated some managers at large department
stores down the hall in the Mall at Short Hills. One Nordstrom
manager, he said, walked into Polites' small store, picked some
shoes off the shelf, looked at the prices, slammed them down and
left without a word.
</P>
<P>
   Polites said the Nordstrom manager later explained that the
flats that Polites had reduced to $49.99 from $60 were included on
a confidential list of styles _ known as the ``off-limits list'' _
whose prices Nine West Group Inc. rarely, if ever, lets stores mark
down.
</P>
<P>
   Polites' low prices also maddened executives at Nine West, the
footwear giant that says it sells one out of every five pairs of
shoes sold to women in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West chief executive Vincent Camuto called Polites
(pronounced po-LEE-tus) and demanded that he end his sale. When
Polites refused, Camuto told him that in that case, ``We can't ship
you those shoes.'' Polites taped his phone conversations with
Camuto and other Nine West executives because, he said, he felt his
store, which sells only Nine West shoes, was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   He and two other owners of small Nine West stores, who have
fought with the company over other business issues before, say the
incident helped them solve a puzzle they had been piecing together
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to information gathered by the three store
owners, is that for years, Nine West and major department stores in
the United States, which sell millions of pairs of the company's
shoes, have worked together in an elaborate and secret system that
almost guarantees that women, no matter how many stores they shop
in, will always find the same prices for most Nine West styles.
</P>
<P>
   The store owners say they have talked to regulators at the
Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the antitrust laws, about
the pricing practices and have given them copies of the so-called
off-limits list, as well as memos by Nine West employees and tapes
of phone conversations with Nine West executives.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Bedol, Nine West's general counsel, said, ``We have been
cooperating fully with the Federal Trade Commission and intend to
continue our cooperation,'' adding that ``we do not anticipate that
the preliminary inquiry will result in a material adverse effect on
the company.'' He said the company would not comment further on its
pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   According to the store owners' information, the system works
like this: Nine West and some department stores agree on minimum
prices; Nine West employees patrol all stores to insure that prices
are not lowered; if a department store finds another store charging
prices below the minimums, it complains to Nine West; and Nine West
warns stores that shipments will be delayed or even ended if prices
are too low.
</P>
<P>
   If Nine West stopped enforcing the minimums and allowed stores
to compete on price, women would almost surely find lower prices,
saving as much as $10 or more on many styles. Nine West prices most
of its shoes from $50 to $90 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   So are Nine West's pricing practices illegal? That is not clear.
Ken Peterson, a lawyer in Wichita, Kan., who represented the three
store owners last year, wrote a letter to Nine West in February
saying he believed that its practices violated federal antitrust
laws. Peterson's letter received no response.
</P>
<P>
   And Peterson warned his clients, who all still have Nine West
shoes marked down, not to acquiesce to company demands that they
raise prices. If they did, Peterson said, they themselves could be
found guilty of conspiring to fix minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor who is an
antitrust expert, said it is illegal for a distributor and a
company that sells its products to agree on minimum retail prices,
though it is legal for a distributor to demand that its price list
be followed. The federal laws are technical and ambiguous,
Hovenkamp said, and they have been weakened over the years by court
decisions. He said it was unclear whether Nine West and the
department stores were breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the legalities, the details unearthed by the three
small store owners offer a rare glimpse into just how far some
retail companies and department stores will go to keep shoppers
from finding better prices elsewhere. The details also show just
how quietly Nine West and the department stores have stepped to try
to keep the pricing practices private.
</P>
<P>
   The three store owners, who also include Richard Reichle, owner
of a Nine West store in the Galleria in Houston, and Sandy Ruback,
who owns one in the Dadeland Mall in Miami, said they decided to
talk about what they had found after more than 10 years of buying
shoes from Nine West because they were bitter and frustrated with
the way the company repeatedly made their day-to-day operations
difficult. The three became partners in a joint venture with Nine
West in 1984, and recently filed an arbitration complaint against
the company over the prices it was charging their stores for shoes.
In that case, arbitrators awarded the three stores $4.5 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nine West's current objections to his sale price,
Polites said the company was continuing to ship him shoes, though
sometimes they were delayed. Reichle (pronounced RYE-cul), who said
he had also been told by Nine West employees to raise his prices,
said the company was delaying shipments to his Houston store.
Ruback said he had experienced no delays.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC lawyer said it was the commission's policy to neither
confirm nor deny whether it was investigating a specific company.
</P>
<P>
   Several department store companies, including Nordstrom Inc. and
Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's
and other stores, said they had strict policies prohibiting any
agreements with a manufacturer or competitor on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Broderick, general counsel for Federated, said he was not
aware of any meetings between Federated and Nine West at which
minimum prices might have been agreed on. He said that Nine West
asks department stores to follow the price list, and that if they
do, Nine West gives them financial incentives or discounts for
expenses like advertising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They say if you want our promotional assistance, you'll get it
if you follow this pricing,'' Broderick said, adding that this was
a common practice between many companies and department stores.
``This is not price-fixing,'' Broderick said.
</P>
<P>
   (The store owners say that in addition to financial help with
promotions, Nine West has agreed to take back unsold shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for May Department Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP;
Taylor and other department stores that carry Nine West products,
declined to comment on the pricing issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., caters mostly to women
who do not want to pay $100 to $200 for a pair of designer shoes,
yet do not want to buy the cheaper shoes offered by discount
stores.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs low, the company buys most of its shoes from
factories in Brazil and China, where labor and leather are cheaper
than in the United States or Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, it acquired the footwear business of United States Shoe
Corp.; it now offers 12 brands and takes up large sections of the
women's shoe departments at major department stores. The brands _
Nine West, Enzo Angiolini, Easy Spirit, Evan Picone, Selby,
Pappagallo, Bandolino, Amalfi, 9 &AMP; Co., Calvin Klein, Calico and
Westies _ are marketed individually, and women may not know they
are buying two pairs from the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shoes
to department stores each year. While it does not disclose sales to
each store, it did say in its 1997 annual report that Federated was
its largest wholesale customer, making up 12 percent of its net
revenues, or about $224 million.
</P>
<P>
   With such large purchases from Nine West, the department stores
have grown increasingly dependent on the company, and any shipping
cutoffs or delays would quickly eat into their profits.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Nine West has also built hundreds of its own
retail stores. In many shopping malls, Nine West's stores are
located near the department stores, making the shoe company and the
big stores direct competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West wholly owns most of its retail stores. The exceptions
are the very few stores, like those owned by the three store
owners, that it operates through joint ventures with partners.
</P>
<P>
   It also sells millions of shoes at wholesale prices to
independent shoe stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to information the three store owners have gathered
and their sworn affidavits detailing the discussions they have had
with more than a dozen Nine West employees, Nine West's pricing
system involves several steps.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Nine West displays its new styles at shows in New
York City and Las Vegas. Through the years, the three store
managers have found, Nine West's sample shoes at the shows often
have no suggested retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the store owners asked about this, they said, they were
told by several Nine West employees that representatives from the
company and the department stores would later meet to discuss the
shoes and to agree on prices. At those private meetings, the
``off-limits,'' or ``protected,'' list is drawn up, Nine West
employees have told the store owners.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the minimum prices on dozens of styles. It
also includes the specific dates, if ever, that the shoes can be
put on sale and what the minimum sale price should be.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the lists, dating back several years, show that some
of the company's most popular styles have had similar minimum
prices for years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the shoe that Polites had put on sale _ the Liberty
style, sold under the Enzo Angiolini brand _ has been priced at
$59.99 to $62 for as long as eight years, Reichle said.
</P>
<P>
   Three major department stores in New York City _ Macy's,
Bloomingdale's and Lord &AMP; Taylor _ are selling the Liberty at
either $59.99 or $59.98.
</P>
<P>
   While women may find sales on shoes in shades of purple or
green, the prices of the company's most popular shoes in the most
sought-after colors _ black, brown and navy _ rarely fall below the
minimums.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reichle's sworn affidavit, in February 1997, at a
shoe show in Las Vegas, Maura Martin, a Nine West analyst,
described a ``wrap-up'' meeting that she said was attended by Nine
West employees and some department stores. ``The purpose of the
meeting is to finalize the wholesale cost, suggested retail price
and the off-limits list for all Nine West Group products and
lines,'' Ms. Martin told Reichle and Ruback, according to Reichle's
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   When the two men asked Ms. Martin what would happen if a
department store did not follow the off-limits list, she replied,
``We would make threats such as cutting off their open stock
reorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reichle said he did not believe that Nine West's current pricing
practices were good for its bottom line or its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   He said his lower prices helped him sell more shoes last year
and make more in profits, which he shares with Nine West, than in
any year since his store opened. In comparison, Nine West reported
last month that sales at its own retail stores were slipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never made business sense,'' Reichle said, ``but yet the
madness continues to march on.''

<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ For years, Michael Jordan shimmered like a
hologram before the Knicks, a magical vision of multiple dimension
and surreal form that they could never grasp. Obsessed with
catching Jordan, the Knicks kept reaching and falling short until
they viewed Jordan as a force field between themselves and a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter if the Knicks had grown less threatening to
the Bulls over the last four years, becoming second-round playoff
dropouts since 1995. Jordan was stuck in the back of their heads.
``I'll see you in Chicago,'' Patrick Ewing once chimed before his
chance to meet Jordan ended with the Knicks' playoff elimination in
Miami two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Real or imagined, Jordan has been the Holy Grail of obstacles
for the Knicks. Conquer Jordan and stake your flag on top of the
world. But the Knicks will never know that high now, not with
Jordan scheduled to announce his retirement Wednesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left with the championship,'' said Chris Childs, who joined
four other Knicks in an informal workout Tuesday at SUNY-Purchase.
``You're not fulfilled without beating the team that had it before
you. That'll be the question for the ages. Nobody ever beat the
Bulls with Jordan. If anyone wins it, they'll be faulted because
they didn't win it against Chicago, but it's still a championship.
I guess it'll come with a question mark by it.''
</P>
<P>
   A title this year by anyone, including the Knicks, would be
diluted by the absence of Jordan and dotted by an asterisk because
of a lockout-shortened season. Still, a title is a title. And the
chase for such a prize is a lot less clear without the
inevitability of facing Jordan in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it raises expectations for our team,'' said Dave
Checketts, the chief executive officer of Madison Square Garden.
``And I hope our guys know that the road there is not quite as
blocked. I hope as much as our guys admired him, they see this as
an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would like to think of themselves as a favorite. But
so do the Indiana Pacers and the Miami Heat. Without Jordan, the
mad scramble to gain an edge on the Eastern Conference is on. All
three teams, the Pacers, Heat and Knicks, have expressed interest
in making a deal for Golden State's outcast guard Latrell Sprewell.
Although all three teams are limited to using salary exceptions to
sign free agents, names like Charles Barkley and Loy Vaught have
been bandied around.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was the last time Jordan retired. When he bowed out
of the league in 1993, the coast was clear for the Knicks to bully
their way to the finals, only to lose to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever we won one, I wanted it to be because we beat Jordan
along the way,'' Checketts said. ``That would make it sweeter.
Unfortunately, we ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if the window has shut on the Knicks even with
Jordan out of the way. To compete for Jordan's vacancy, Ewing has
weight to lose and a touch to regain in his surgically repaired
shooting wrist. The Knicks also have to gel quickly, re-sign
Charlie Ward and stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, the Knicks were left as extras in Jordan's
theatrical productions. He opened the curtain after an 18-month
sabbatical with a 55-point spectacle at Madison Square Garden in
March 1995. Treating him like a heckler, Jordan shot back at Coach
Jeff Van Gundy's reference to him as a con man by delivering a
51-point punch line in January 1997. In what became his Madison
Square Garden finale last season, Jordan shrugged off the blisters
from a tight pair of 1985 vintage Nikes _ a pair he said he wore
when he lit up the Knicks for 42 points in his rookie season _ and
defied logic once again. Quickly, this image of a Jordan flashback
was flooded by flashbulbs as he caught a lobbed pass over the
defense of John Starks, and turned into the chest of a looming
Terry Cummings, 3 inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan left his feet, hovered over the Garden floor like a
hummingbird, and with his back to the basket, flipped the ball over
his head. It caressed the rim and fell into the net amid gasps from
the crowd. One last Garden photo-op of a superstar who always set
the bar well beyond the reach of everyone, including the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Jordan's apparent decision was made public, Ewing
said, ``I told Michael that I want to beat him to get my
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, neither Ewing nor the Knicks will ever have that chance.

DENVER HAS CASE OF BRONCOS   FEVER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Todd Tilghman is just starting to get his voice back.
The Denver real estate broker says he went overboard last Saturday
cheering as the Broncos overwhelmed the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after the game, people thought I was sick,'' Tilghman
said. ``They said, `What's wrong with you?' I said, `Broncos
fever.' I can't wait till Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Reid, a bartender at the Denver Chop House and Brewery, a
popular hangout for Broncos players, is also particularly excited
about Sunday's American Football Conference championship game
between the Broncos and the Jets. Monday night a co-worker whose
wife works for the Broncos came through with two tickets to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Broncos fan since I was 5 years old, when my
father sat me in front of the television and told me about
football,'' Reid said. ``I feel so lucky to have gotten tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   And well she should. The 2,700 tickets not swallowed up by
season ticket-holders disappeared in six minutes on Sunday,
according to Broncos' publicist Jim Saccomano.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Broncos will have their 232nd straight nonstrike
sellout at Mile High Stadium. Two replacement games during the 1987
strike are the only blips on Denver's attendance screen.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wellington Webb will be at Mile High. He describes himself
as an avid Broncos fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably a dent in the hotel room credenza where the
TV happened to be when I was watching that regular-season game
against Miami,'' he said Tuesday, referring to Denver's 31-21
defeat in Miami on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Webb likes to think he is part of a new, winning regime here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the mayor of Green Bay called to remind me that we'd
lost two Super Bowls,'' Webb said. ``I told him I wasn't mayor
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barrel Man will undoubtedly be taking some bows of his own
for the Broncos' success. He shows up in the south stands at Mile
High, where the rowdies sit, wearing only an orange barrel. He
stokes the fans around him with his yells and gestures, a visible
symbol of Bronco Mania.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause to reflect on Denver's crush on the team, Webb
said: ``We're a smaller city, but we have a first-class team and
first-class people. We have a lot to be thankful for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' presence in this game, compounded by the distinct
possibility that this could be John Elway's final home game after
17 seasons as Denver's quarterback, has increased the premium some
people are willing to pay for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 13 years I've been here, this is the biggest I've ever
seen it,'' a ticket broker named Steve, who declined to give his
surname, said at Center Stage, a company in Englewood, Colo. ``The
demand is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   All that demand and all those fans figure to rattle the girders.
``There was a consistency to the loudness for the whole game last
week,'' said Steve Antonopulos, the Broncos' trainer for 23 years.
``But I think Sunday could be even louder.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver embraces all its professional teams, except perhaps the
hapless Nuggets in basketball. But the Broncos enjoy a special
distinction. Almost everywhere you go, the Broncos are visible. On
clothing. On cars. On storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we've won one Super Bowl and have the potential of
winning another one right away has made this city just electric,''
said Andrew Hudson, the mayor's press liaison. ``And there's a lot
more about the dynamic of the city that lends itself to that. When
you talk about how well things are going in the city, from
employment to the economy, an overall sense of satisfaction and
opportunity, the Broncos just play right into that.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Hudson said he did not know how many
transplanted New Yorkers were living here. Nor, he said, did he
particularly care. ``Five is too many,'' Hudson said. Then he
chuckled softly. ``Just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, voicing the confidence of a defending Super Bowl champion
city, said, ``The only celebration we'd have is after winning the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less,'' the mayor said, ``would mean we didn't
complete our agenda.''

THIS TIME, SHARED REINS DIDN'T WORK AT GOLDMAN SACHS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. has often been managed with a
simple idea: As Wall Street's largest investment banking
partnership, it ought to have partners at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last 25 years a pair of men have run the firm
together, a symbol of consensus for the sometimes feisty general
partners. Two leaders have often meant two personalities _ a
Republican and a Democrat; a banker and a trader; a consummate
insider teamed with a public face.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory, and it has worked wonderfully at times. But
it requires at a minimum that the two leaders genuinely like each
other. And many at Goldman believe that Jon Corzine and Henry
Paulson, for seven months the leading investment bank's co-chairmen
and co-chief executives, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the two was one factor that led to Monday's
surprise announcement that Corzine would relinquish his day-to-day
management responsibilities in favor of Paulson, people who work at
the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership was rarely acrimonious, even in private. But
some who have worked with the two said it was clear early on in
their reign as co-leaders that they would not remain ``co'' for
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest single factor here is that the two guys really did
not get along with each other,'' said one partner who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``Hank and Jon are not friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the future direction of Wall Street's most respected
banking franchise. With Paulson now in sole executive control, many
there expect the firm to move more quickly to emphasize the banking
side of the business over the trading side, where Goldman had
losses in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson is seen as a fan of a tighter, corporate-style
management structure with clear reporting lines. The firm may
emerge from the recent leadership shake-up looking more like Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., with their
well-defined executive hierarchies. Some say that such an evolution
is essential as Goldman becomes a publicly owned company with
15,000 employees worldwide. But others see the leadership change as
a sign that Goldman's intuitive management style and risk-taking
culture are fading, potentially threatening some of the factors
that distinguish it from its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Corzine and Paulson to bond together and become a
close team, in Goldman's traditional style, ultimately became a
liability, bankers there said. Paulson said this week that an
offering of shares will almost certainly take place this year, and
Goldman's top executives felt that they could not risk management
instability while they were trying to sell the firm to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an easy change to make but this was the best time
to make it _ from a position of strength,'' one senior Goldman
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed stressed that Corzine and Paulson
maintained an effective working relationship and never allowed
their differences to become personal or public. But they were
obviously much less close than their ``co'' predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Robert Rubin, now the treasury secretary, paired
with Stephen Friedman, first as Goldman's co-chief operating
officers and then, in 1990, as co-chairmen. They were described by
one Goldman executive as ``like an old married couple,'' so
familiar with one another that they could communicate through body
language.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead and John Weinberg, who ran the firm together from
the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, worked side by side in the same
trading bullpen from their first days at Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine and Paulson did not have that kind of camaraderie.
Meetings of the top executive committee became more heated in the
half-year that the two shared the top offices. Some also said that
Corzine could not control the committee's six members _ one
recently retired, making it five _ and sometimes found himself
holding a minority view despite his seniority.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue dividing the two was whether and how Goldman
should end its partnership and go public. Paulson, who until May
was a vice chairman and chief operating officer reporting to
Corzine, was a longtime holdout on a public offering and only
pledged his support when Corzine agreed to make him his full equal.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the partnership voted to issue shares in June, the
two did not see eye to eye on carrying out the move. One issue:
Whether Goldman should use up to $350 million in proceeds from the
offering to establish a charitable foundation, a cherished goal of
Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   The two also disagreed about what share of Goldman's profits
should come from trading securities on behalf of customers and for
its own account, people at the firm said. Corzine, who hails from
the trading side of the business, was more comfortable with
carrying a hefty balance sheet and deriving a large chunk of
profits from taking risks in financial markets. Paulson was more
attuned to the banking side of the business, where the firm earns
high fees but risks less of its own capital, and he had long pushed
for a reduction in the amount of money Goldman devoted to trading.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were also stylistic. The two men have
glass-walled offices just a few feet apart at Goldman's Broad
Street headquarters in downtown Manhattan. They are both early
risers, and were regularly spotted in each other's offices. But the
similarities ended there.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is described as partial to easygoing and freewheeling
discussions, and is often ready at the conclusion to make quick
decisions. Paulson is more deliberative and by-the-book, partial to
delegation and longer-term study. Corzine cut a higher public
profile. But Paulson forged tighter alliances with several other
top executives that proved crucial in the final weeks, when
discussions on how to revamp the firm's management reached a
climax.

ARIZONA HAS LIST OF LANDS TO PRESERVE WITH CLINTON'S ANTI-SPRAWL
MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A rare year-round creek, the foothills of the
Superstition Mountains, a scenic mountain with prehistoric
archaeological sites _ Arizonans have a shopping list ready to
preserve precious corners of the state, and on Tuesday, President
Clinton got out the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plan to fight urban sprawl, Clinton's budget
proposal for fiscal year 2000 includes $1 billion to expand federal
protection of sites across the country and to help states and
communities preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear, clear signal that land preservation has
become a mainstream issue,'' said Carla, the administrator of the
McDowell Sonoran Land Trust, who uses only her first name. ``It's
not just fringe environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a reality check: Maricopa County alone could easily
use up the entire wad of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a trio of high-profile projects. Phoenix is looking for
$225 million for a new desert preserve in the northwest. Scottsdale
wants $150 million for the Granite Mountain area, which offers a
combination of recreation, wildlife habitat and traces of
prehistoric settlement. And the tab for scenic Spur Cross Ranch in
Cave Creek is estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had a double-header of preservation
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Vice President Al Gore announced a program to curb
urban sprawl through a $10 billion bond program, supported with tax
credits, that would help create suburban parks, greenways and other
open space.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dubbed his own proposal the ``land-legacy initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   It calls for spending $442 million to expand federal land, with
priorities that include areas of the Mojave Desert, parts of the
Everglades and Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also asking Congress to give permanent wilderness
protection to back-country areas of 17 national parks and
monuments, none of them in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton wants to earmark nearly $600 million for a variety
of state and local land-preservation programs. Much of it would be
available as matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be more than happy to try and figure out how to get some
of that money,'' said P.A. Seitts, executive director of the Desert
Foothills Land Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Her top candidates: Go John canyon, 500 acres of lush desert
near Cave Creek, and a 25-acre parcel along the creek itself, one
of the few places in the county that still has water running
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Seitts is pleased that under Clinton's proposal, non-profit
groups such as land trusts are eligible to apply for funding.
</P>
<P>
   But she points out that most of the money isn't really new.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is simply committing to provide full funding for the
Land and Water Conservation Fund, which draws revenues from
offshore oil sales. Congress has shortchanged the conservation fund
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not breaking new ground,'' Seitts said. ``A lot of it
seems to be re-energizing existing programs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, environmentalists and others have lobbied
intensely to get money restored to the conservation fund.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, it helped pay for 270 major recreation projects
in Maricopa County alone, including footing part of the bill for
South Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Arizona State Parks has been in charge of
distributing conservation money within the state. Renee Bahl,
assistant director, doesn't want any tampering with that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the federal government telling us what our
priorities are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix area is known,
people have ambitious plans that could use a booster shot from
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Valley, there's a push to protect farmland around
Luke Air Force Base to provide a crucial buffer and make sure the
facility isn't pushed out of business by complaints about noise.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Creek residents would like to shield a bit of farmland
from development, keeping some of the history and character of the
community, Mayor Mark Schnepf said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also working with residents who hope to save a saddle of
land by San Tan Regional Park that offers spectacular views to the
north and south.
</P>
<P>
   The foothills of the Superstition Mountains are vulnerable
because they're state land that's slated for development.
</P>
<P>
   But saving them will cost a bundle, when lots are going for as
much as $250,000 an acre, says Rosemary Shearer, president of the
Superstition Area Land Trust.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, three major projects deserve federal support, Mayor
Skip Rimsza argues.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a new 15,000-acre desert preserve in the north, the city
is planning the Rio Salado project, which will gussy up a stretch
of the Salt River with trails and small lakes. It's proposing a
wetlands project at the 91st Avenue wastewater treatment plant,
which would also clean up chlorine from the discharge.
</P>
<P>
   But Rimsza has a word of caution: ``Remember, the initiative is
poorly defined still, and it has to go through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be hot competition for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Pima County, for instance, has a sweeping desert conservation
plan that includes such pricey goals as saving ranches, restoring
river areas and expanding its mountain parks.
</P>
<P>
   And there are 49 other states with long lists of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to get in line,'' Carla said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, she's happy there's a line to get in. &QL;

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ No one expects pristine purity from the
waterways of Providence. They are urban rivers in an old factory
city that is trying hard to get born again, and for all their
recent beautification _ the new embankment parks, promenade,
popular summer night ``WaterFire'' displays, even a gondola _ they
are still tainted by decades of industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Two environmental groups said Tuesday that one area of the
Woonasquatucket River in North Providence was so worrisome that
they would file legal petitions to federal authorities calling for
an emergency investigation and cleanup of the area. In those spots
near dams upstream of Providence, the groups say, testing has
turned up the second-highest level of the environmental poison
dioxin ever found in river sediment _ surpassed only by the Passaic
River in New Jersey near the factory that produced Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that this is very bad news to a community that is
devoting substantial resources to improving a polluted urban river
environment,'' said Todd Robins, general counsel of Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a whistle-blowers'
group that acts on inside reports from government agency employees.
``But I think the responsibility of the Environmental Protection
Agency, if they determine such incredibly high levels of dioxin, is
to take more stringent steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday evening
that it had done just that. The EPA said that preliminary results
of its latest testing showed high dioxin levels in the river
sediment near homes and a ball field where Little Leaguers are
known to jump into the water. It said it would immediately begin
warning residents door to door, putting up fences in some places
and developing a cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   John DeVillars, the EPA's New England administrator, denied
Tuesday night that it was reacting to the emergency petitions,
which The New York Times had sent to it for comment Monday. And he
defended the agency's record on the Woonasquatucket while refusing
to respond directly to the petitions' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually initiated the sampling and public health awareness
campaign and have worked with great intensity and energy to move
forward on those,'' DeVillars said, ``and there's no more immediate
evidence of that than that on the day we receive sampling results
from our laboratory _ i.e., today _ that show cause for public
health concern, we move forward in a New York minute to protect and
inform the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those new measures, the public employees' group and
Rhode Island Clean Water Action still planned to file three
petitions Wednesday. One asked the EPA in Washington for an
emergency investigation and cleanup. One asked an agency ombudsman
to look into whether the regional EPA played down the danger and
dragged its feet when river renewal projects were bringing more
people in contact with the water. And one asked the assistant
surgeon general for an assessment of health risks.
</P>
<P>
   They accused the agency of underestimating and understating the
risk for residents and failing to inform the public promptly and
broadly of the danger, as well as failing to move quickly enough to
determine the dioxin's source and clean it up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Vanderslice, chief of the office of environmental health
risk assessment for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said
government agencies had already taken several measures to counter
the main threat posed by dioxin: that people would ingest it by
eating fish from the river. An inter-agency ``urban rivers team''
has put on slide shows about the danger and put up warnings about
the fish in English and Spanish, Vanderslice said, and it plans to
distribute brochures to warn schoolchildren and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are concerned both about the dioxin and about
the more short-term danger of bacteria and viruses from the sewage
overflow that enters the rivers after heavy rainfall, he said. When
the dioxin testing results were confirmed last summer, he noted,
federal and local officials issued news releases recommending
against swimming and wading in the river. There have been
informational meetings with residents as well. And there are plans
to put up more warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups, however, complain in their petitions
that residents should have been informed months earlier. Some
foot-dragging, they say, could have come from reluctance to face a
new obstacle to the rebirth of Providence's rivers, after so much
work and millions had gone into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's certainly the idea of you don't want to scare
people away from the river and go back on all the great progress,''
said Aimee Tavares, Rhode Island director of Clean Water Action.
``But that's an excuse always used before any agency gives
information to people, that everyone will run screaming and sell
their houses. They don't give the average person enough credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins are chemical by-products of industrial processes using
chlorine. Though there is still some debate over just how dangerous
they are, it is clear that they are one of the most potent
cancer-causing agents, said Tom Webster, a dioxin researcher now at
the Boston University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   They are also believed to harm reproductive systems, immune
systems, nervous systems and more. No neighbors of the river have
reported health problems that they believe stem from the dioxin,
the environmental groups say.
</P>
<P>
   The exact source of the dioxin is unclear, Robins said, but
scientists say the likeliest explanation is that industrial waste
was dumped in the river by a barrel cleaning plant owned by a
long-since-defunct company.

ABC LOCKOUT NEARING END, UNION SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill., D.C.)  (bl) 
By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's 10-week-old lockout of its 2,200 behind-the-scenes workers
appeared near an end Tuesday, as union leaders said they would
agree to the network's no-strike provision in order to return to
work and would most likely move by week's end to send the company's
latest contract offer to employees for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, after two months, we want to shorten the period
that our members remain without a paycheck and health care
benefits,'' said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. ``The ball is
in ABC's court.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for the network, said that while no
deal had been finalized, the company remained willing to end the
lockout if it could insure that there would be no disruptions to
programming.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The potential end of the labor dispute comes in the midst of
growing protest from the union's rank and file, particularly in Los
Angeles, where two small units have moved to drop their affiliation
with the union, known as Nabet. The contract proposal reflects few
gains by the union, and was roundly denounced by labor leaders when
first proffered by ABC on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   For example, before the union's one-day strike Nov. 2, which
triggered the lockout, ABC had offered a three-year contract with 3
percent raises each year; the current offer stretches over four
years, with two 3 percent raises and two 3.5 percent raises.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than immediately push the cap on the number of
temporary workers allowed in the behind-the-scenes job to 35
percent from 14 percent, as previously proposed, the new deal would
phase in increases, making the cap 26 percent this year and
increasing it in steps to 45 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the union would lose its grip on certain equipment
and procedures _ engineers would no longer be the only people, for
example, allowed to plug in a videocassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company made some marginal improvements _ in some cases,
it's almost cosmetic,'' Donahue said. ``What's different about it
is that it's their final offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, editors, graphic artists, news writers, camera
operators and others represented by Nabet in New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Washington have been working without a
contract since March 1997. Donahue said that the negotiating
committee would probably send the contract to the membership this
week, but that the ratification process could take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Capitano, president of New York's Nabet Local 16, said that
his 1,000 members had read the proposed contract and ``think that
it's terrible.'' Gena Stinnett, president of Local 57 in Los
Angeles, which has 600 members, said, ``The general consensus was
it was a lousy offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Christmas, union leaders have been under increasing
pressure from members to take action on the latest offer, which
Robert A. Iger, the chairman of ABC, has vowed will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met over the weekend with federal mediators to
hammer out details of a companion agreement, which covers
logistical issues relating to employees' return to work after the
lengthy lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The union did win several concessions in the back-to-work
agreement: ABC promised that despite the disruption in health care
benefits, no employees would be denied medical coverage because of
pre-existing conditions. The company also said that workers would
get all their 1999 vacation days as long as the contract vote was
complete by Feb. 7. And the network agreed to have independent
arbitrators decide the fates of a half-dozen people who were
dismissed during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little movement on the substantive issues of the
contract itself, leaving many in the union unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nothing less than a request to help destroy the union,''
Clif Brown, a member of Chicago's Local 41, wrote in a letter to
his fellow workers posted on a union Web site. ``The company is
offering a beautifully decorated cake inside of which is a hand
grenade.''
</P>
<P>
   While union leaders say the lockout has exhibited their strength
and crimped ABC's broadcasts with a string of technical glitches
and a growing boycott by celebrities and Democratic politicians,
network insiders say it has simply shown that the company can
remain on the air with or without the union's technical workers.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: FINALISTS SCOUTED EACH OTHER EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football players are told to make one block at a time, one
catch, one play, one practice, one game. Never look too far ahead.
Stay in the moment. All eyes on today.
</P>
<P>
   Their coaches preach that but do the opposite. They always look
for what lurks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets fly to Denver and the Falcons travel to Minnesota
for the conference championship games Sunday, their meetings will
be their first eye-to-eye encounters of this season. But despite
the coaxing to not look ahead, the players in both games have been
thinking about these opponents for the last several weeks. So, too,
have the coaches, who have implored their scouts to study and
report their opponent's strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be living in space to not know about what
Minnesota has been doing,'' said Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle.
``You notice their guys, especially their impact players. All
season long they've been on the highlights. They were a 15-1 team.
You notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Dolphins were tripping Denver in the regular
season in Miami on Dec. 14, some of the Broncos' thoughts, even
then, were fixed on the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   It was late on that Monday night when the Broncos kick returner
Vaughn Hebron said: ``This was a game where Miami had everything to
gain, the playoffs and all, and we've already clinched our spot.
They had more fire and more desire and they won. But that's OK.
We'll probably see them again, in the playoffs, and we're not
worried. You know the team we see coming? It's the Jets. Now,
that's the team to watch. The Jets are playing tough. They're
building something. They're getting confidence. I think somewhere
along the line, we're going to have to deal with the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Denver destroyed Miami, 38-3, last Saturday in playoff
action at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Next it's the Jets vs. Denver for the American Football
Conference title and a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII. Hebron certainly
has vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-Minnesota matchup will decide the National Football
Conference representative in the Super Bowl. Like the AFC matchup,
it features teams who gained byes during the playoffs' first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta coaches probably spent half of their playoff bye
week preparing for the Green Bay-San Francisco wild-card winner and
then half preparing for Minnesota, especially since they knew the
49ers, a Falcons divisional opponent, so well. But very seldom
would a coach present all of that material to the players at once.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Robiskie, the Washington Redskins receivers coach,
remembers how teams used to prepare for the 1985 Chicago Bears and
for the 46 defense, the creation of Buddy Ryan, the Bears'
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would go into training camp preparing for that defense,''
Robiskie said. ``Even if you were playing the Bears in November or
December, you would begin breaking it down in June in training camp
because it was so new and so complex. And because it was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan, the Denver head coach, is a guru of offense today
on the level of what Ryan was on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan made no secret even before the Jets beat Jacksonville
that he was studying the Jets. He was already looking for that edge
in homework, that jump-start.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what Denver has done _ won the last Super Bowl, and
this year ripped teams offensively with big plays and the terrific
Terrell Davis running _ it would not be surprising if the Jets have
been studying Denver in some fashion since training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get to the Super Bowl and you know you probably
have to go through Denver in the AFC to get there, you are looking
for any edge,'' Robiskie said. ``Knowing the detailed guy that Bill
Parcells is, I would not be at all surprised if the Jets had a
scout at one of Denver's open scrimmages against another team way
back in training camp. No kidding. I wouldn't be surprised if a
Jets scout wasn't sitting right up there in the stands, perfectly
legal, of course, scouting the Broncos back then.''
</P>
<P>
   In most instances among these finalists' last four games, scouts
have been watching closely, preparing for what we will see Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells, the learning process does go all the way back to
the last two times his team played Shanahan's clubs. As Patriots'
coach, Parcells' teams lost by 37-3 to the Broncos in 1995 and by
34-8 in 1996. Parcells says his Jets should forget that, that those
were different teams in different situations on both sides. Partly
true, partly not.
</P>
<P>
   Because a sly coach looks for tendencies, for style, for an edge
to use later. Especially in a game where his team is being whipped.
</P>
<P>
   The conference championship games Sunday will be decided by the
best players performing at elite levels complemented by cunning
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Productive and imaginative homework sets the stage.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: FINALISTS SCOUTED EACH OTHER EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football players are told to make one block at a time, one
catch, one play, one practice, one game. Never look too far ahead.
Stay in the moment. All eyes on today.
</P>
<P>
   Their coaches preach that but do the opposite. They always look
for what lurks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets fly to Denver and the Falcons travel to Minnesota
for the conference championship games Sunday, their meetings will
be their first eye-to-eye encounters of this season. But despite
the coaxing to not look ahead, the players in both games have been
thinking about these opponents for the last several weeks. So, too,
have the coaches, who have implored their scouts to study and
report their opponent's strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be living in space to not know about what
Minnesota has been doing,'' said Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle.
``You notice their guys, especially their impact players. All
season long they've been on the highlights. They were a 15-1 team.
You notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Dolphins were tripping Denver in the regular
season in Miami on Dec. 21, some of the Broncos' thoughts, even
then, were fixed on the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   It was late on that Monday night when the Broncos kick returner
Vaughn Hebron said: ``This was a game where Miami had everything to
gain, the playoffs and all, and we've already clinched our spot.
They had more fire and more desire and they won. But that's OK.
We'll probably see them again, in the playoffs, and we're not
worried. You know the team we see coming? It's the Jets. Now,
that's the team to watch. The Jets are playing tough. They're
building something. They're getting confidence. I think somewhere
along the line, we're going to have to deal with the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Denver destroyed Miami, 38-3, last Saturday in playoff
action at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Next it's the Jets vs. Denver for the American Football
Conference title and a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII. Hebron certainly

JETS' OFFENSIVE LINE IS NO LONGER AN ATROCITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this season of surplus scoring, surprisingly strong defense
and attitude adjustment that has taken them 60 minutes from
revisiting the Super Bowl, there has been one unit more constant
than any other on the Jets _ the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   And if the once-derided Jets are to upset the favored Broncos in
Sunday's American Football Conference championship, it will start,
as these things always do, no matter how dramatic or flamboyant the
skill players, in the depths of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line has come a long way from obscurity to Denver.
But it has also been fortunate to remain healthy with brand-new
players making up 60 percent of the line.
</P>
<P>
   There is this remarkable fact about the unit: Of approximately
1,100 offensive plays this season, including the playoff victory
over Jacksonville last Sunday, the line has missed about 20 plays
together. And practically all of those came at the end of a rout.
</P>
<P>
   The only rookie starter on the Jets squad, the offensive right
tackle Jason Fabini, is surprised, and proud, he missed only one
play all season. He couldn't get his shoe on. He had to come off
the field until he could.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he had trouble with the shoe? He was unable to tie
the laces _ because of the cast on his broken hand. This is beyond
dedication. This has become a tough group of guys.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they will have to be to protect Vinny
Testaverde, who has been sacked only four times the last seven
games (one of those times he ran out of bounds). But the Broncos,
who usually have the lead, tee off and have dumped quarterbacks an
average of three times a game. The Jets' offense will be geared to
prevent that from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Testaverde's well-documented heroics in this season of
his lifetime (well, maybe the Heisman year was better in 1986),
Curtis Martin has run more often than any running back in team
history. He has carried more than 400 times, including his 36
rushes against Jacksonville last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Testaverde and Martin, every play, has been the
line: Jumbo Elliott, the left tackle, whom coach Bill Parcells once
believed was Hall of Fame material; Todd Burger, one of the
bargain-basement free-agent pickups who left the Bears; right guard
Matt O'Dwyer, who led the Jets in penalties last year and who would
get weekly scoldings from Parcells for his emotional outbursts;
Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick from Cincinnati, whom Parcells
once labeled ``false-start Fabini'' for jumping offside, and the
center, Kevin Mawae.
</P>
<P>
   Something changed on the line when the Jets brought in Mawae,
who had been a free agent after playing with Seattle. Mawae
immediately took part of his $5 million signing bonus and bought
classy chairs for his 300-pound linemates to sit in. Instead of the
those metal-framed chairs that most players shift around on
uncomfortably in their meeting rooms, Mawae spent thousands of
dollars for real furniture with comfortable backs.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive still, Mawae then went out on the field and
roared through defenses. The Jet players marveled that they had
never seen a center barreling over players more than 10 yards
downfield. Martin knew that if he could get past the first line of
defense, Mawae would still be in front of him, knocking down the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Mawae did not make the Pro Bowl. He is an alternate. One of his
teammates described him as ``annoyed'' that he did not make the
team, although Mawae said: ``Don't say that. Just say I was
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowls were somewhere in the future, though, when the second
half of the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! Parcells was furious. Curtis Martin wasn't gaining
yardage _ he had picked up only 52 yards in a victory over Buffalo
_ and his offensive line wasn't blocking well.
</P>
<P>
   So during practice, Parcells threatened to yank O'Dwyer and
Burger and replace them with a pair of fellows named Alex Bernstein
and Doug Karczewski. The names would have made a great combination
for a show tune about New York. They even got to rotate in practice
with O'Dwyer and Burger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who Bill gets on every week,'' said Burger, who was
becoming accustomed to Parcells' threats over losing his job.
O'Dwyer, meanwhile, declined to discuss his play with the news
media. He has always been concerned that too much attention has
been paid to his penalties and his fighting with teammates in
practice. He says his mother in Chicago subscribes to the New York
papers and gets the wrong idea.

EDITORIAL: OPEN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, the Senate
has conducted its debates on procedures and even the final verdict
of impeachments in closed session. The time has come for that
tradition to be altered, at least for the trial of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have
announced that they will seek to change the rule on closed debates
after the opening presentations begin Thursday. Whatever would be
gained by allowing senators to deliberate privately, the overriding
requirement is for the American public to see and judge firsthand
whether justice is being done.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators argue that the closed session last Friday, at
which Democrats and Republicans worked out a compromise on trial
procedures, showed that privacy can serve a constructive purpose.
But the Harkin-Wellstone proposal would not preclude the Senate's
adjourning and meeting outside the chamber at caucuses like the one
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The principle that should prevail is simply that proceedings
that could lead to the removal of a president should be conducted
in open session, especially since many Americans have questions
about the fairness of the House impeachment proceedings. Closing
the Senate's deliberations on so grave a matter would undermine
public confidence and be an affront to citizens' rights to observe
the operations of government.
</P>
<P>
   Senators love their customs and ceremonies, but their
institution's commanding trend has been toward openness. At the
time of the nation's founding, all Senate sessions were closed.
Until 1929, the Senate debated nominations and treaties in closed
sessions. Until the reforms of the 1970s, many congressional
hearings and meetings were in closed session. No one would
seriously argue that these old practices should have been
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   As for impeachment trials, it is worth noting that they were
open most of the 19th century. Privacy was adopted only for the
trial of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators seem to believe that they should be regarded as
jurors in a trial, and therefore allowed a measure of
confidentiality. But the senators have privileges not available to
regular juries. They may ask questions, speak publicly about the
process and make motions. It is within their power to change the
rules on closing the session, which would take two-thirds of a
majority to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   If openness drives senators toward partisanship or prolixity, as
some fear, let public scrutiny serve as the governor on their
excesses.

HINES OUT WITH BROKEN FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In recent years, a severe injury to a top reserve
would have put the Bruins on yellow alert. The starters regularly
played 35-40 minutes, the reserves were often nonscholarship
players and sometimes UCLA didn't have enough bodies to scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of no depth are over. Tuesday, when the Bruins
announced reserve guard Rico Hines will miss four to six weeks with
a broken foot, it barely registered. Not that Hines' tenacity and
defense won't be missed. It's just that UCLA has a plethora of
talented bodies waiting to absorb his 16 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   One option is freshman guard Ray Young, a McDonald's
All-American who has emerged as one of the Bruins' best defensive
players.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the versatile Matt Barnes, a 6-foot-8 freshman
forward who has played four positions. Barnes missed several
post-Christmas practices with an ankle injury and has struggled to
reclaim his spot in the rotation. This is his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wanted to get Matt more playing time,'' said coach Steve
Lavin, whose Bruins host Cal and Stanford this week.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Hines fractured the fifth metatarsal bone in
his right foot. (It's on the outside, near the little toe.)
Believing it bruised and not wanting to lose his spot in the
rotation, he kept playing. Saturday, when an Oregon player stepped
on his foot, Hines finally gave in. X-rays confirmed the fracture
and he'll have surgery Thursday. He hopes to return in late
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it was broken,'' said Hines, who was averaging
3.3 points and 2.1 rebounds. ``It was painful to run on, but when I
walked it was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quote of the week: As the Oregon fans fired invective at
UCLA, freshman forward Jerome Moiso, a native of Guadeloupe slowly
adjusting to Pac-10 rivalries, asked his teammates: ``Do we hate
this team, too?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clank city: The Bruins have made 51 percent of their 2-point
shots and 28.6 percent of their 3-point attempts, worst in the
Pac-10. Among the dullshooters are Baron Davis (16.7 percent),
JaRon Rush (20.5 percent) and Earl Watson (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hoisted 27 shots from 3-point range at Oregon State
and made four. They showed better judgment at Oregon, attempting 13
3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us shooting 27 3's,'' Lavin said. ``But if we
shoot 10-15 3's, I can probably live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our shots have been short. Some of that's legs, but
it's also being conscious of technique and getting lift.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Bruins are second in the Pac-10 in
turnover margin, plus-2.36. Yes, second. ``In my eight years here,
we're usually at the bottom of the barrel,'' Lavin said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is sixth in the Pac-10 in field goal defense (40.6
percent), seventh in 3-point defense (33.7 percent) and ninth in
free-throw shooting (61.8). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game has special significance for Young, an Alameda
native who chose UCLA over Cal. His parents wanted him to attend
Stanford. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Dan Gadzuric did not practice Tuesday to rest
his tendinitis-riddled knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that will be there the entire year,'' Lavin
said. ``He has to cope with it and fight through.''

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE MAJOR FUNDING TO SAVE SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is expected soon to
propose major federal funding to save salmon runs up and down the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the details become public the plan is drawing
skepticism from the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and the Sierra Club each are
expressing concerns that the program is ill-defined and could
easily turn into a sinkhole for money that many believe
characterized the federal government's effort to restore salmon
runs on the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   But they cite opposite reasons for distrust. Gorton equates
federal control with waste, while the Sierra Club fears waste would
stem from an absence of federal or state standards.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the program _ including the White House, Washington
Gov. Gary Locke, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., _ say the concerns are unfounded, and pledge to make sure
the money is well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and the governors of California, Oregon and Alaska have
requested $200 million a year for each of the next six years to
help the four states cope with the expected listings of numerous
salmon runs under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the size of the program unclear, so is how the money
would be spent. State and local governments are only beginning to
develop plans for restoring salmon habitat or protecting it from
damage. Federal cash could go to direct improvements such as fixing
culverts that block salmon from spawning streams, or to indirect
expenses such as research, planning or law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, with an eye on his environmental record in anticipation
of a re-election bid next year, demanded even more money than the
governors requested, suggesting in a letter to Clinton last week
that he propose $310 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Murray said the senator expects Clinton to propose
about $100 million for the first year _ money that would be split
evenly among the four states and then matched by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been engaged in a direct dialogue with
the governors and other elected officials over the past several
months, and we are very optimistic that we will be able to commit
significant new resources to address coastal salmon issues,'' a
White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon runs from California to Canada have been declining for
decades due to overfishing, damming of rivers, destruction of
streams, wetlands and shorelines, misuse of hatcheries and a
cyclical shortage of food in part of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast salmon plan _ which Clinton could mention in his
State of the Union address next week but is more likely to detail
in his budget proposal next month _ will be a region-wide effort
comparable to the federal government's effort to assist communities
hurt by the listing of the spotted owl as an endangered species,
according to Dicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, most endangered species work has been done in
rural areas, but now we're going to be working right in the main
urban part of the state, and it's going to be a major challenge to
see if we can keep people working together as we have plans that
affect growth and development,'' Dicks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are going to be putting up
some of their own money, and unlike the timber companies and timber
communities that were in denial, these people recognize that
(endangered species) listings are coming,'' he said. ``But there's
going to be a lot of pain out there when this pinches development
projects that the business community and others want.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the concerns are being expressed. Gorton, long an
advocate for local control on many fronts, says that the federal
government wasted $3 billion trying unsuccessfully to restore
salmon on the Columbia River, and that in the Puget Sound the
federal government should, essentially, pony up and get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``More centralized federal top-down decision-making will not
work _ nor will Congress support funding such an ill-advised
scheme,'' Gorton warned in a letter to Clinton. Gorton said he
supports the program, but that the money should be given to local
groups, not federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club believes too much local control could lead
to endless planning, uncoordinated efforts, and low standards for
results. The group wants either the federal or state governments to
set standards for protecting habitat. In exchange for the money, it
says, local communities should have to stop landowners from
continuing such habitat-damaging practices as building walls along
shorelines to prevent land erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a money train, but it's not clear where the
train is going,'' said Bill Arthur, Northwest regional director of
the Sierra Club. ``We don't want this money just to go into a
series of ongoing planning processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosters of the salmon plan say there will be both local control
and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Locke is adamant that we have to show the public this
money is going to things that will actually contribute to salmon
recovery,'' said Curt Smitch, Locke's top salmon adviser. He said
the money should be spent by local governments and agencies but
that the state, along with the federal government and Indian
tribes, should scrutinize the scientific value and financial
effectiveness of the restoration projects. ``What the senator is
saying is consistent with what we're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   And Metropolitan King County Councilman Larry Phillips, in
Washington last week to lobby for the salmon plan, said local
officials are determined to show they can spend the money
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Puget Sound are very much trying to separate
ourselves from the Columbia River experience,'' he said. ``We don't
have dams, so we have a better chance to see some recovery. They
spent $3 billion and have not a lot to show for it. We hope to
spend less and have a lot more to show.''

BRADLEY OFFICIALLY BECOMES DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley officially became
a Democratic candidate for president Tuesday, and told a Seattle
luncheon he would offer a ``a fresh start'' after the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a shot, I have more than a shot. ... I think
the country will be ready for me,'' said Bradley, a former star
forward with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also took several well-aimed shots at the Democrats'
front-runner, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a life before the Senate and I have a life after
politics. ... Essentially, the vice president's whole life has been
in Washington, D.C.,'' said the 55-year-old Bradley, who since
leaving Washington, D.C., has taught at Notre Dame and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley described Gore as a politician ``who has played cautious
his whole life'' and as a symbol of the status quo. While
indicating he will not run against the Clinton administration,
Bradley said Gore's role may put him at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of his Clinton negatives, I don't have to say
anything about that,'' Bradley added. ``The case for a new
beginning is self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley spoke to Democratic leaders at the Seattle Hilton,
his exploratory committee in Washington, D.C., officially changed
its name to the Bill Bradley for President Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although facing an uphill run against Gore, who visited the
state four times in 1998, Bradley made a strong impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be looked at seriously. He would make an outstanding
nominee for the Democratic Party, and he's prepared for the job,''
said former Washington Gov. Mike Lowry.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Seattle Mayor Charles Royer was impressed at Bradley's
decision to make widespread poverty among America's children a
centerpiece issue of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley brings to the race a self-depreciatory wit and talent
for understatement not seen on the presidential trail since the
anti-war campaigns of Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley poked fun at Clinton's wordiness when asked what
differences would be apparent if he were in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I would do is not talk as much,'' Bradley
said. ``Now you have the president driving the evening news
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley delivered a scorching send-up on the scandal
preoccupations of Washington, D.C., media pundits. He noted that
the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke last year just as TV network
anchormen were prepared to cover the historic visit by Pope John
Paul II to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the scandal broke, they left Havana in half-an-hour,''
Bradley said. ``The premise seemed to be: The pope visits Castro?
Happens every day of the week. Sex? Once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told his audience that a serious presidential candidate
must ``get through the screen that the media has set up.'' He
suggested new techniques, such as mailing videos to voters and use
of the internet, to outflank the politics of TV sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he will campaign for ``team leadership'' in the
White House, with genuine delegation of authority to cabinet
officers. He promised renewed attention to such issues as nuclear
proliferation. On environmental issues like global warming, Bradley
said: ``If the United States does not lead, it's not going to get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will devote much of 1999 to raising the $25 million
to 30 million he estimates will be necessary to make the
presidential race. He will deliver a series of speeches to define
what would be the agenda of a Bradley administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Democratic) race will be decided on March 7 (2000) when
38 percent of the delegates to the convention will be chosen,''
Bradley said. ``A big win on that day changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of the nation's biggest states, California and New York,
have moved up their presidential primaries to that date. Several
other states, including Washington, are likely to vote on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is so far the only top-name Democrat to take on Gore.
Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, have
taken themselves out of the presidential race. Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts is still exploring a run. House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt promises a decision fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   Royer said of Bradley: ``He's obviously one of the most
thoughtful guys in politics. You see him and think, `Gee, I don't
want to see him beat up'.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley showed yesterday that, a quarter century after the
end of his pro basketball career, he can still use the elbows.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled co-sponsoring legislation that authorized removal of
two aging dams from Washington's Elwha River, pointedly adding that
``Slade Gorton stuck it in my back.'' Late last year, Gorton
blocked the money to remove the first of the dams.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley conceded that Gore will probably have ``more of the
traditional apparatus,'' but said he hopes to draw new people into
the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore had a life before politics, as an Army enlistee in
Vietnam and an investigative reporter with the Nashville
Tennessean, Bradley depicted the vice president as a creature of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his close ties to the Washington establishment, in
a time of incredible partisanship, it will be more difficult for
(Gore) to get the independent vote,'' Bradley said.

COFFEE, TEA MARRIAGE LOOKS SWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - The nation's tea industry has seen its great, shining
hope - and thinks it might be Starbucks Coffee Co.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet aroma of opportunity wafted through the tea business
Tuesday as it absorbed the stunning news that Seattle's gigantic
java retailer plans to purchase the highly respected, quirky tea
maker Tazo, of Portland, Ore., for an undisclosed amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this marriage is gigantic for the world of
specialty tea,'' said Joe Simerini, president of the Tea
Association, a New York-based trade group. ``What it pretty much
tells you is Starbucks has made up their mind that they want to be
in the world of the specialty tea business, and they want to be in
it in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks remained largely mum on its plans this week, saying
only that it planned to develop new products under the Tazo name
and possibly create a new retail format around the brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the universe of tea brewing, that's practically cause for
celebration. U.S. tea makers have spent most of the 1990s watching
themselves get almost totally eclipsed by their highly caffeinated
brethren. While Americans slowly clued in to the joys of herbal
infusions and the fine nuances of specialty tea blends, they
embraced espresso drinks with an enthusiasm that left the quietly
prospering tea market looking like an also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo was born five years ago in the midst of America's
blossoming love affair with lattes. Founder Steven Smith, formerly
of Portland-based Stash Teas, drew on years of experience in the
industry to create a line of high-quality, high-priced products
that stood out both for their funky marketing (names like Awake and
Om) and distinct flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially thought we needed to change the way people
perceived tea,'' Smith said in a telephone interview Monday
afternoon. ``We bet on the fact that the tea category was not price
sensitive. We thought if we made better products, people would buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand quickly became one of the major players in the
specialty tea market, which the Tea Association describes as one
that emphasizes the quality and integrity of the ingredients. Other
specialty tea makers, according to the association, include
Bigelow, Twinings and the Republic of Tea.
</P>
<P>
   Of an overall annual tea market of $4.5 billion, specialty tea
sales accounted for about $500 million last year, Simrany said.
That's double the figures of a decade ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks alone reported $1.1 billion in retail sales for fiscal
1998. Tea sales made up only 1 percent of that total, chief
executive Howard Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo's impending sale to Starbucks - the deal is set to close at
the end of this month - catapults the niche tea maker into the
realms of such household names as Lipton and Celestial Seasonings,
said Brian Keating, owner of the Teacup, a retail teahouse and shop
on Queen Anne Hill and publisher of ``U.S. Tea Is `Hot,''' an
annual report on the tea industry.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also gives Starbucks the foothold it has sought
for years in the specialty tea market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks has been floundering,'' Keating said, testing out a
slew of items from chai tea to the iced blended drink Tiazzi this
summer to various takes on its in-house hot tea brand called
Infusia, all to mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo gives the company a proven brand with a built-in cache.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business analysis standpoint, I couldn't think of a
better marriage,'' Keating said of the Starbucks-Tazo deal. ``It
was like two people you wanted to introduce and never thought about
introducing them to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Rasmussen, executive director of the Long Beach,
Calif.-based American Premium Tea Institute, was a bit more
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on this purchase and it's absolutely fabulous news for
my industry or it's really sad news,'' she said. ``It's not one of
those gray things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks is going to take a mover and a shaker in my industry
and either really, finally do something with tea - or Tazo's going
to become this dusty, back-of-the-shelf product in Starbucks
stores, and that's going to be a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impetus for Starbucks to take the Tazo purchase
seriously must be pretty strong, given recent trends in the
specialty coffee business, Rasmussen said.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Specialty Coffee Association trade show, for
instance, Rasmussen noted, at least 50 percent of the vendors
devoted half their exhibit space to tea products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have reached their limit with coffee in terms
of their experience with it,'' she said. ``It's `What's the next
thing?' I don't want to say they're bored. But they are looking for
the next new beverage.''

 &HT;    Barr gets equal time on CNN, defends himself against Flynt
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was Bob Barr Night on CNN Tuesday as the
Republican congressman from Smyrna made three separate appearances
on the network to defend himself against allegations of hypocrisy
from Hustler publisher Larry Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, at times combative, said he would not give up his role as
one of 13 House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton that is scheduled to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He called Flynt's actions ``a thinly veiled effort by the
president's defenders'' to divert attention from the pending
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Both White House spokesman Joe Lockhart and Flynt, who also
appeared on CNN Tuesday, denied any White House involvement in the
pornographer's investigation into the private lives of prominent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt on Monday produced an affidavit he obtained for an
undisclosed sum from Gail Vogel, Barr's second wife, in which she
said that Barr was having an affair with Jerilyn Dobbin, his
current wife, before his 1986 divorce from Vogel was final. In
sworn testimony as part of the divorce proceedings, Barr refused to
answer questions about his alleged infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt said Barr is a hypocrite because he has accused Clinton of
employing evasive, legalistic answers when Barr has done the same
thing himself.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews on Crossfire, Larry King Live and Late
Edition, Barr said both he and Clinton had the same choices when
they testified _ tell the truth, invoke legal privileges against
self-incrimination or lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the differences between the two of us is he chose the
last one,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Barr insisted that he is not concerned
about the president's personal behavior in his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Rather, employing the distinction that
Republicans drew in the House impeachment proceedings, Barr said,
``My concern with the president is his abuse of the office,
obstruction of justice, perjury in his capacity as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel's affidavit also claims that Barr was aware of an abortion
she had in 1983, when they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Barr would not address the issue, other than to say, ``I have
never suggested, urged, forced, or encouraged anyone to have an
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt said the abortion incident is another instance of Barr's
hypocrisy because he is an avowed opponent of abortion rights.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 13,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   For selfish reasons, we wish that Michael Jordan had stayed on.
His absence denies us the pleasure of watching one of the world's
great athletes and surely the most accomplished basketball player
in the history of the game. His presence might have redeemed this
sadly truncated season and restored some of the affection we had
for the game before the owners and players almost took it away. It
will not be easy to replace a global icon.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to fault his decision to retire or its timing. He
is 35 years old. He does not, by his own admission, have the
physical and mental edge that he has always required of himself.
Our one hope is that this time he does not un-retire, as he did in
1995 after flirting with professional baseball. He should honor the
tradition of Sandy Koufax and Jim Brown and others who retired at
the pinnacle, leaving us with our memories of unambiguous
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   As Magic Johnson once said, ``There's Michael, then there's all
the rest of us.'' The numbers tell only part of the story, but a
few bear repeating. Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times, the
most ever. His 31.5 points a game over his 13-year career is the
highest regular-season average in the history of the National
Basketball Association. He led the Bulls to six championships.
</P>
<P>
   His athleticism _ the soaring leaps, darting fakes, flawless
ball handling _ was almost poetic. But what made Jordan special was
his demanding code of personal excellence. He worked as hard in
practice as he did in games. When critics complained that all he
could do was score, he became the most dominant defensive player in
the game at his position. When opponents clogged the middle, he
developed a deadly jump shot. He was also fiercely competitive.
There were many important games where his singular determination
seemed to will the Bulls to victory, but the memory that will
endure is of a flu-ridden Jordan driving the lane against Utah in
the 1997 championships, then leaning on his teammates for support
so he could play some more.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of Jordan's autobiography, ``For the Love of the
Game: My Story,'' he says that ``the evolutionary process never
ends. Somebody is going to improve on my game.'' Perhaps so, but it
is likely to be a long wait.

EDITORIAL: `NUMBERS' AT LINCOLN CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 13,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts have been a vital part of Lincoln Center since
its inception, not only as an onstage accompaniment to the
performing arts but as a defining element in a visitor's experience
of Lincoln Center itself. Marc Chagall's murals in the Metropolitan
Opera House, Henry Moore's ``Reclining Figure'' in the reflecting
pool, Jasper Johns' ``Numbers, 1964'' in the New York State Theater
_ these and other works are as inseparable from Lincoln Center as
Eero Saarinen's design for the Vivian Beaumont Theater or Philip
Johnson's design for Lincoln Center Plaza itself.
</P>
<P>
   The difference of course is that a mural or a sculpture or a
painting can be removed from its setting and sold outright, and
that is precisely what Lincoln Center's board of directors has said
it will consider doing to Johns' ``Numbers, 1964.'' One or more
potential buyers have made unspecified offers for the painting,
perhaps as much as $10 million or $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers, 1964'' is Johns' only publicly commissioned work,
created for its State Theater site at the request of Johnson, the
theater's architect. In itself, ``Numbers, 1964'' suggests the
marriage of the performing and visual arts that Lincoln Center
embodies, for the grid of numbers in the painting is based on the
foot length of Merce Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The board has an obligation to discuss the offers, but it should
reject them. Lincoln Center was meant to be a place where the
visual and performing arts sustain each other, but not by selling
the one off to support the other. At Lincoln Center the public
should be able to witness the vitality, the primacy of the creative
imagination, not its vulnerability to enticing bids.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT WILL THE INTERNET ECONOMY LOOK LIKE?
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is the wonder of the era, the tool that is expected
to change everything. On Wall Street, Internet stocks are
superstars. Amazon.com, the bookseller, now trades for more than 50
times the price at which it went public in 1997. Ebay, an auction
house, is valued at 13 times what investors paid four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   These prices reflect huge amounts of money. Amazon.com is valued
at around $26 billion, about the same as CBS and nearly three times
as much as Federated Department Stores, the largest department
store chain. Yahoo, the Internet search engine that went public
almost three years ago, is valued at about $39 billion, nearly 100
times its valuation when it went public and more than Boeing or
Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   There are two possible explanations for those valuations. The
market might be telling us that economic activity will soon come to
be dominated by the Internet. Or the market moves could be evidence
of speculation gone wild, of a great bubble that will inevitably
burst. Those two explanations are not mutually exclusive. The
Internet could be all that its fans expect, and some stocks could
still be ridiculously overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But what would the 21st-century economy look like if only the
first explanation proves accurate?
</P>
<P>
   Retail activity would increasingly be dominated by Internet
sales, to an extent hard to imagine. Federal Express would be an
immediate beneficiary, assuming that Star Trek technology _ ``Beam
me up, Scotty'' _ will not be perfected for packages. But while its
stock did well last year, FedEx has slipped a bit this year, even
as Internet stocks have zoomed. While Amazon.com fell 12 percent
Tuesday, it is up 53 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation would be likely in the new Internet economy. It is
much easier to compare prices on the Internet, a fact that will
tend to force prices _ and profit margins _ down on items that are
easily comparable. One of the wonders of the performance of
Amazon.com is that it specializes in just such products. A book
from one store is no different than a book from another.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, service will also count. Getting a great price on
something that does not get delivered for months is hardly a
bargain. Brand-name images of quality could, if anything, become
more important in a world where shoppers cannot examine the item
before buying.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores no doubt will continue to prosper. Lettuce does not
age well, so food stores are an obvious candidate. For clothes,
where fit is important, many will prefer to shop where they can try
on before buying. No one will want to wait for mail delivery of a
new car battery.
</P>
<P>
   But overall the demand for stores would fall, creating a glut of
retail space and falling rents as Internet sales represent
transactions not made in stores.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the stock market does not seem to have anticipated that.
While companies that own shopping malls have seen their stock
prices slip a bit, the falls have been nowhere near the magnitude
that would be expected in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the market anticipated the economic dislocations that
would come along with such a huge change. A recession could easily
result just from the upheavals created by failing retailers and
plunging commercial real estate values. To say the least, the
overall level of stock prices now does not reflect a recession
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely outcome is that the Internet will grow to be a
much larger economic force than it now is, but that the stocks of
Internet companies will nonetheless prove to be horrid investments
for those who buy at current prices. Those who are buying do not
really expect such an economy. They are just betting that this
mania will not end soon.
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent. In the 1920s, the great speculative stock
was Radio Corporation of America, which took six years to rise
100-fold, twice the time Yahoo required. As the bulls forecast, RCA
became a dominant player in an industry that revolutionized
American life. But those who bought the stock in 1929 still lost
nearly all the money they invested.

   IMPEACH _ When the impeachment trial of President Clinton

arguing over whether the president should be removed from office,
they will be trying to shape the outcome of a critical series of

saga ends abruptly or ventures into uncharted territory. What is in

and at what cost to the Congress and to majority Republicans.

   IMPEACH-JURY _ No one is pretending that the Senate trial of
Clinton is a clear mirror of what happens in a criminal or civil

complex, they are referred to by employees as stars. Even the

   HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-I (New York) _ Organizing high school sports
in a city like New York has never been easy, but for most of this
century, the idea of high school sports at least had a firm place
in the roster of what public schools were meant to do. But in the
last quarter century, public school sports in the city have been
devalued and cast adrift. Interviews with more than 200 current and
former coaches, teachers, administrators and students, lay bare
what happened: at a time when medicine and sociology were
establishing as never before the benefits of physical activity for
young people and as an obsession with sports was growing across
much of the rest of America, the nation's largest public school
system all but walked off the field. First of three parts. By Kirk

macadamias, the world's richest tasting, most expensive nuts and a
food as closely associated with Hawaii as the pineapple. The
discovery that the trees were more than just ornamentals had to be
sheer happenstance, because the luxury they produce is one hard nut
to crack. Still, once the secret was out, every effort was made to
turn the trees into tidy profit centers. It took a long, long time.

Chinese menus: Steamed tiny buns, juicy dumplings and
crabmeat-and-pork soupy buns are just some of the terms for what
the Chinese call xiao long bao, and for what Americans know as soup
dumplings. The soup dumpling is a Shanghai specialty, a flowery
little packet of delicate dough twisted up at the top. It usually
contains some combination of minced pork, shrimp or crab, and a
final touch that gives this dumpling its identity, a spoonful of
hot broth. It is hard to eat a soup dumpling without leaving a
trace on your shirt. Nonetheless, New Yorkers have fallen in love
with the soup dumpling, willingly sacrificing their garments in
pursuit of a mouthful of pleasure. By Eric Asimov.

   RETRO-STYLED-TOASTERS (Undated) _ It's big, it's chrome and it's
a beaut. It lights up, sports a lever, and has a timer. And for
just $369, it makes toast. Good toast. That is, bread that is
evenly browned and crisp on both sides, still soft in the center
and warm throughout. Butter melts on contact. But there must be
something more about this retro-styled Dualit toaster, sold by
Williams Sonoma, that draws people to it. What that something was,
would reveal itself by testing it against other retro-styled
toasters: a DeLonghi Classica, a Russell Hobbs Classic Coolwall, a
Cuisinart Classic and an original 1950s vintage Toastmaster. By
Amanda Hesser.

COME CLEAN AND STAY CLEAN, KEY SPONSOR WARNS THE IOC
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., one of
a dozen worldwide corporate sponsors of the Olympic movement,
Tuesday sternly admonished the International Olympic Committee to
extend its investigation of irregular bidding practices beyond Salt
Lake City and the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fail to do that and something else comes up, the rings
won't be tarnished, they'll be broken,'' said David D'Alessandro,
the president and chief operating officer of John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Boston, D'Alessandro urged the IOC to expand its
examination of cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts
acknowledged by Salt Lake City officials to include the bidding
procedures of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the 1998 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan, as well as the coming 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, and the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, they will stay ahead of the curve,'' said
D'Alessandro, who is highly regarded in sporting circles for having
revived the Boston Marathon. ``We'll know they are demonstrating
they do indeed stand for what the definitions of the rings are. If
they attempt to simply line up 12 IOC members and shoot them and
think they can go back to Switzerland, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 12 IOC members are expected to be asked to resign at a
meeting Jan. 23 and 24 at IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland. Currently, four investigations _ by an internal Salt
Lake City ethics panel, the United States Olympic Committee, the
IOC and the U.S. Justice Department _ are being conducted into
allegations that Salt Lake City won the 2002 Winter Games by
bribing IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the sponsors can't afford is a year from now, for the
press or the Justice Department to find a series of aberrations
about Atlanta, Sydney, Nagano or something else,'' D'Alessandro
said. ``If that happens, the IOC would have lost its window of
opportunity it had to purge itself. They got a pass the first time.
How can any of the sponsors stand up if there is a second
scandal?''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, an Olympic sponsor since 1991, is committed to its
global sponsorship of $40 million through the 2000 Sydney Games.
Negotiations are under way to extend the contract, D'Alessandro
said, adding that the company remains committed to the Olympic
movement with the understanding that the IOC will clean its own
house.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to do so will cost the IOC its ``golden aura,''
D'Alessandro said, and the Olympics will become a ``mere mortal''
like the National Basketball Association and the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices will come tumbling down,'' D'Alessandro said.
``Corporations will not easily marry their logos, especially new
companies. All indications are that the IOC is going to do thorough
investigations, past and present. If they do, they will survive and
do extraordinarily well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, D'Alessandro also said, he expected that
sponsorship deals with the IOC would contain the equivalent of
morals clauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get one bite of this apple,'' Hancock said, referring
to the IOC. ``They can't come back a year from now and say, `Oops,
here's another one, there was a leak and we happened to hear about
it.' Scandals are never about what happened. All this Mickey Mouse
stuff about $5,000 payments and escort services, no one really
cares about what it was. Credibility is not made or broken on that.
Credibility is made or broken on how you handle it. No one cares
about Monica Lewinsky. Why is President Clinton in trouble? Because
of the way he handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boardrooms will shake if this is mishandled,'' D'Alessandro
said. ``That includes NBC's boardroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The network has agreed to pay $3.5 billion for the television
rights to all five Winter and Summer Games to be held between 2000
and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tuesday, Pirjo Haggman, an IOC member from Finland,
told reporters in Helsinki that she did not know whether her former
husband, Bjarne, had worked briefly for the Salt Lake City bid
committee. The New York Times reported Tuesday that he had been
hired to conduct an environmental study.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came as a big surprise for me,'' Haggman said. ``In my
opinion, I have not at any time done anything contrary to the IOC
rules.''

CHANGING OF THE GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The man who last beat Michael Jordan in the
playoffs and the man who could BE the next Jordan paid their
respects to basketball's retiring king Tuesday _ even as they
prepared to snatch his vacated throne.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant saw the
NBA's balance of power tilt hard in their direction in the wake of
Jordan's imminent announcement. But the news is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can't beat Jordan, can't measure themselves against his
greatness. Now they, like fans around the world, have to settle for
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to compete against him. . . . I kind of wanted
that chance again,'' said O'Neal, whose Orlando Magic bested
Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the 1995 Eastern Conference finals, two
months after Jordan came out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   No one has beaten Jordan in the postseason since. Now, no one
ever will again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the game has always been funny,'' O'Neal said.
``When I started paying attention to the game, it was (Larry) Bird
against Magic (Johnson), Bird had it and Magic beat Bird. And Isiah
(Thomas) beat Magic. And Michael beat Isiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have that opportunity. He's the greatest
player in the game, and now it's wide open for another team to just
take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Another team, perhaps the Lakers. And another icon, perhaps Kobe
Bryant. Even as he dismisses talk of being the next Jordan, Bryant
regrets losing the chance to learn from the master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to learn so much playing against him,'' Bryant
said. ``Guarding him different ways and seeing how he guards me, I
learned a lot. When you go up against the best, that's when your
adrenaline starts running, starts pumping, because you're playing
against the best basketball player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant tested himself against Jordan three times last season _
first in a celebrated showdown at the United Center, then in a
megahyped, virtual one-on-one contest during the All-Star Game at
Madison Square Garden, and finally in a rematch at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Bryant-Jordan was the drawing card. Each time Bryant
rose to the challenge with the style and class he saw in Jordan,
even as Jordan won the individual battles.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Bryant would like to ignite a rivalry for the ages,
he doesn't begrudge Jordan's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's concerned with what we want as people and as fans.
We want to see him come back,'' he said. ``What it boils down to is
what he wants to do. And he wanted to retire, so I'm happy for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, who's drawn the assignment of covering Jordan often
in his four years, knew the announcement was coming. A Jordan
associate dropped the hint last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Jordan made the right call: He's leaving at the top
of his game, draining the last jump shot of his career to win the
1998 NBA Finals, the Bulls' sixth title in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way to go out is that way,'' Jones said. ``A lot
of guys try to stick around so long, when they really tarnish their
careers. But Michael, the way he went out, he went out on top, he
went out the best player ever, no doubts. He went out with class,
saying, `Hey, I beat you with the J.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Into the vacuum will step several teams, and Jones said to
pencil in the Lakers at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's us, and we just have to go out and be that tough
mentally, that tough physically, to win a championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the next NBA champion _ be it the Pacers, Jazz, Lakers or
Sonics _ will be the first of the post-Jordan era. To critics, a
season already asterisked for its brevity will get another black
mark to diminish the new champion's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, the fact that nobody ever really beat him,'' Jones
said. ``Mike can say he beat everybody to win a championship. And
we can't say we beat Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   But is a Lakers title a diminished title?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not,'' said Bryant, ``if we win seven or eight of them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Three more Lakers _ Bryant, Corie Blount and Tony
Battie _ attended voluntary workouts Tuesday, bringing the total to
eight. Still missing were rookies Ruben Patterson and Sam Jacobson,
who are expected by today, and veterans Robert Horry and Elden
Campbell. The absence of Campbell, an L.A. native, is noteworthy,
coming at a time when it's widely assumed he will be traded next
week. ``I don't know, maybe the rumors are getting to him,'' Jones
said of Campbell's absence. Said O'Neal, ``I'm not worried about
people that's not in the gym. He should (be here). I guess the
people that didn't come are the people that don't need this
workout. But they better be ready on the 18th (for training
camp).''

COURT DISMISSES SUIT BY CRANE AGAINST COLTEC
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Ohio, Conn.) (Eds.: This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge late Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by Crane Co. seeking to
block Coltec Industries from merging with B.F. Goodrich, a deal
that gives Coltec shareholders substantially less than Crane had
offered to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in White Plains,
N.Y., allows Coltec and Goodrich to proceed with their deal.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's lawsuit, filed last month, contended that Coltec, by
agreeing to be acquired by Goodrich, broke a 1995 promise to notify
Crane of any offers to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec, a leading maker of aircraft landing gear, says that the
1995 agreement with Crane did not require it to notify Crane if a
third party expressed interest in buying the company, nor did it
prohibit Coltec from negotiating an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In December the court denied a request by Crane to expedite the
evidence-gathering stage of the case until it had ruled on Coltec's
motion to dismiss. In her ruling Tuesday, Judge Jones said,
``Coltec was not required to notify Crane of B.F. Goodrich's bid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm persuaded that clear and unambiguous language supports the
defendants' views,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday night whether Crane, a maker of airplane
brake systems and other aviation equipment, would appeal the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Crane had said it was interested in acquiring Coltec only if it
could use its shares in a stock-for-stock deal in what is called a
pooling of interests transaction. Such transactions are less
expensive and usually tax-free because of the big amount of shares
used by the acquirer to purchase the target company.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the Goodrich offer was worth about $1.4 billion,
excluding debt, valuing Coltec stock at $19.95 a share. Crane's
offer was worth about $1.8 billion, excluding debt. It values
Coltec stock at $23.90 a share, almost a 20 percent premium over
the Goodrich bid.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, before the judge's ruling was handed down, shares of
Coltec rose 25 cents, to $19.50. Crane's shares closed at $29.875,
up 6.25 cents. Goodrich fell 43.75 cents, to $35.625.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec is based in Charlotte, N.C., Crane is based in Stamford,
Conn., and Goodrich is based in Richfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely followed by many on Wall Street
because of the recent popularity of pooling transactions and the
difficulty of conducting successful hostile pooling bids.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any merger may signal further consolidation in the
aerospace parts industry. All three companies are suppliers to
Boeing, the world's leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, which
has been hurt by Asia's financial problems and foreign competition
as well as its own production problems. As a result, Boeing has
said it will scale back production and cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec, with an offer of 0.56 share
of Goodrich common stock for each Coltec share. The deal also calls
for Goodrich to assume about $610 million in debt and move its
corporate offices from Ohio to Charlotte.

CLINTON ASKS FOR $1 BILLION TO BUY LAND FOR U.S. PARKS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked Congress on Tuesday to
spend $1 billion in the year 2000 to buy more land for national
parks and other conservation purposes, possibly including private
holdings within public forests and refuges in New York state and
the northern New England states.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal included the purchase 450,000 acres in and around
Mojave and Joshua Tree national parks in California, in the Florida
Everglades and at various Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   If the request is approved by Congress, the expenditure would be
the federal government's largest for land purchases in any single
year, more than double what the government is spending this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is growing, our cities are growing, our
commitment to conservation must grow as well,'' the president said
in a speech at the National Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a series of disclosures by Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore to highlight the administration's budget request,
which will be sent to Congress next week.he preside
</P>
<P>
   The land program would be paid for from an existing trust fund
financed by royalties from offshore oil and natural gas leases.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Congress has never spent as much on land
purchases as the trust fund brings in. The administration's
proposal would set up an automatic financing mechanism that would
do more to guarantee a steady flow of money for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Besides expanding federal land purchases by $442 million, the
administration's program would provide $588 million to state and
local governments, private land trusts and other nonprofit
organizations to buy land, protect farms from development and
conserve endangered species and their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   It would also pay to expand marine sanctuaries, protect
coastlines and estuaries and restore coral reefs and other ocean
resources.
</P>
<P>
   And the administration asked Congress to grant permanent
wilderness protection to five million acres of land in the back
country of Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Great Smoky
Mountains, Cumberland Gap and other national parks. This would give
them the highest level of federal protection available, putting
them off limits to roads or other development and prohibiting the
use of snowmobiles and other machines there.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore proposed a separate program that would use $700
million in tax credits to finance a $10 billion bond program aimed
at preserving open spaces in cities and suburbs. Tuesday, the vice
president announced several new administration initiatives intended
to promote lifelong learning for workers. They included a $60
million plan to help regional leaders identify needs of their area
and create educational programs to satisfy them.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc. is expected to announce Wednesday that
it is acquiring Ascend Communications Inc., the data networking
company, in a deal valued at about $20 billion, people close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of Lucent, the leading telephone equipment maker, and
Ascend both approved the deal Tuesday, those people said. Any deal,
of course, would have to be approved by the shareholders of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, which is based in Alameda, Calif., but also has
significant operations in Boston, is expected to be absorbed into
Lucent's data services business with Lucent's headquarters
remaining in Murray Hill, N.J. Mory Ejabat, the president and chief
executive of Ascend, and other executives will stay on through the
transition, a person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a logical business fit,'' said Alfred Tobia, a data
communications analyst at Nationsbank Montgomery Securities. ``For
months there have been rumors, and when there is that much smoke,
there is fire.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Ascend stockholders will receive 0.825
share of Lucent for each of their shares. Based on Lucent's closing
price Tuesday of $107.875, that would value the offer at about $89
a share, or a premium of roughly 19 percent for a total of about
$20 billion. Ascend shares closed Tuesday at $74.9375, down $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   The impending Ascend-Lucent announcement has drawn little awe
from analysts because the two companies have been talking on and
off for more than a year and a half. ``This has been the deal
Ascend has been talking about for months,'' said Kevin Slocum, an
analyst at Soundview Technology Group. ``Now the financial
community gets the deal and it's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for Lucent. It stands to benefit the most from the
combination. The move is necessary because, with Ascend's products,
the company will be more able to compete against rivals like Cisco
Systems, the data networking company based in San Jose, Calif. For
months, Ejabat insisted his company could go it alone and do battle
with bigger rivals. But, Slocum said, ``Ascend knew it needed a
partner to be a bigger player.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two companies started to come together over
the last couple of weeks. Richard McGinn, the chief executive
officer of Lucent, is said to have worked out many of the details
himself with Mr. Ejabat. But much of the intense negotiating
occurred over the last few days as executives at the two companies
worked out the final details of a combination.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Lucent was
advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

 HIV SELF-TEST KITS WORRY HEALTH EXPERTS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Do-it-yourself test kits for HIV are
proliferating through Web sites that promise instant results and
absolute privacy _ but which also raise fears about a potential
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say they are becoming increasingly concerned about
the questionable reliability and potential misuse of self-test kits
for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Only one test for the home-use market, called Home Access, has
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But dozens
more can readily be found on the Internet, offering quicker results
for less money.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a clue as to how many people might actually be
relying on such tests. But even if the customers are few, experts
view do-it-yourself HIV tests as one of online medicine's more
hazardous sub-specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know much about a lot of these tests,'' said Dr.
Bernard Branson, an HIV-testing specialist at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``Some of them may be
OK. Some are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the growing underground Web trade in health
products came to the forefront last year when several sites began
offering the impotence pill Viagra without requiring prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Viagra, customers at least knew what they were
getting. That's not necessarily true when you order a self-test for
HIV from unknown providers online.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a test gives an accurate result, users may have trouble
evaluating what it really means. Someone newly infected, for
example, may not realize a negative test means only that antibodies
haven't had a chance to develop _ and may go on spreading the virus
to others.
</P>
<P>
   Growing access to do-it-yourself HIV tests ``raises several
concerns,'' said Dr. Herminia Palacio at the San Francisco
Department of Health. ``People may be led to assume they can go
ahead and have unsafe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, which share
jurisdiction over health-related marketing practices, are taking a
keen interest. However, many of the internet merchants appear to be
based overseas, and come and go too fast for regulators to keep
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real problem,'' said Richard Cleland, an assistant
director at the FTC's consumer protection branch. ``It's a public
health problem, and we're very concerned about it. But there's no
easy answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   All the kits are designed to pick up antibodies to HIV, which
can be found in samples of blood or, less reliably, in saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Kits can be ordered on the Web for about half the price of the
only  &LR; FDA-sanctioned kit, a $49.95 ``test system'' called Home
Access Express.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle reporter was mailed one of the nonapproved HIV test
kits after placing an order online and agreeing to a $24.95
credit-card charge, plus $3.95 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   The test came with an English-language label pasted on top of an
original label printed in Russian. The package was shipped from
Malta by a European company, Health Diagnostics Ltd., with offices
in London, computer equipment in France and a Belgian president,
Charles Dupont, who said he was in Monaco when he was interviewed
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing a needed service,'' Dupont said, calling his
Web site an electronic evolution of border-town pharmacies in
Mexico, which may legally sell drugs to U.S. citizens for personal
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no law preventing us from responding to an order,''
he said, ``as long we are not importing in bulk or using a
distribution center in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   His Web site promotes the kit as offering ``extremely accurate''
results almost instantly, ``equal to, or better than, FDA-approved
laboratory assays.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the test kit included no details to back up the
reliability claims. Independent experts noted that FDA-sanctioned
test systems actually provide much more reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other kits, the FDA-approved Home Access product
limits what is done at home to collecting the blood sample. The
testing is done at the company's lab, using an identifying code to
protect anonymity. You call in for results three days later.
</P>
<P>
   You can get counseling or service referrals over the phone
should you test positive. That's not the case with the online
competitors, which emphasize fast, private results but leave the
consequences up to the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Dupont claimed his company's test has been proven reliable after
extensive use in several countries, including Russia, where some
``pick-up bars'' offer customers bowls full of HIV test kits to
take along with a potential new partner.
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that it's legal for him to promote the product
on the Internet and to fill orders placed by U.S. residents. The
FDA, he said, has no control over such private matters.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of government AIDS policies maintain the real issue
is that officials are not meeting the demand for reliable,
confidential HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
   That's what fuels the online market, said Daniel Zingale,
executive director of AIDS Action, a Washington, D.C., advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he saw nothing wrong with the idea of making test
kits more widely available, including through the Internet, as long
as regulators ensure the tests are reliable and make adequate
services available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals should not be left on their own,'' Zingale said.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the Internet's potential as a public-health tool
worry that shady operators will touch off a backlash that may help
``demonize'' the Web. But they say the above-board providers should
prevail if they market their products wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Tests for the AIDS virus, in particular, would seem to be little
use if the customer lacks confidence in the results. Dupont
admitted that sales have been minimal so far in the United States _
only about 800 kits in the first few weeks the Web site was up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers are educated to understand why FDA approval is
important and what it means, then it shouldn't be such a hard
sell,'' said Dr. Helga Rippen, director of the Health Information
Technology Institute, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' she added, ``is that many companies are not
comfortable using the Internet and may not know how to effectively
use it to market and sell their products while complying with FDA
rules on advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, meanwhile, are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the number of people using the Internet is projected
to hit 233 million by next year, up from just 12.6 million in 1995.
Find /SVP Inc., a consulting firm, estimates that 36.7 percent of
Internet surfers are looking into health matters such as AIDS and
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the flourishing online competition is a big
concern to Home Access, maker of the FDA-approved test kit. The
company claims it spent about $20 million and more than three years
to get its product on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's frustrating to us,'' said Michael Wandell,
chief scientific officer. ``What concerns me more is that a lot of
people are going to get results from unapproved tests that lead
them into thinking they are not infected, and go on infecting
others, or they will be convinced they have a horrible disease when
they really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wandell declared the proliferation of bogus tests for the AIDS
virus ``a threat to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Internet,'' he added. ``But the danger is when you
have immediate access to products and services like this, the
consumer has to be that much more informed.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has issued detailed warnings to consumers against
relying on unapproved do-it-yourself tests to determine something
as important as HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who takes to the Internet for information about such
matters would be hard-pressed to find the FDA warnings _ buried
deep within the agency's web site.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it took less than five minutes for a reporter to
find more than a dozen sites touting ``fast,'' ``easy,''
``painless'' and ``accurate'' tests that have never been evaluated
by the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Lenore Gelb, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said that HIV test kits
are considered medical devices subject to the agency's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the FDA advised pharmacies to pull from their
shelves two ``unapproved, fraudulently marketed'' home-use test
kits for the AIDS and hepatitis A viruses. The company involved had
listed a Bay Area address but quickly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for those charged with enforcing the laws is a lack
of victims willing to step forward and complain. At the same time,
the mushrooming Web sites are a fast-moving target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has a big task trying to control this,'' Wandell said.
``I think they're aware of many of these things that are going on.
But it's like a floating crap game. It's a big test to keep up with
somebody operating in the Bahamas who's sneaking things into the
United States.''

GAVIN RELLY, 72, DIES; HELPED END APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Gavin W.H. Relly, the retired
chairman of the Anglo American Corp. who in 1985 led a delegation
of business leaders to meet the banned African National Congress in
Zambia, died on Sunday in Hermanus, South Africa. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications of cardiac surgery, a
spokeswoman for the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Relly's meeting with exiled leaders of the congress was
important in efforts to end apartheid and the world sanctions that
were slowly strangling the economy. Anglo American, then as now,
was the largest conglomerate in South Africa and at the time
accounted for more than half the market capitalization of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Its eagerness to talk to the congress signaled that business
here was tentatively willing to defy the white government and
pursue a negotiated transition to black power and majority rule. At
the time the National Party government was killing ANC advocates at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Relly, following the lead of the Oppenheimer family, which
founded Anglo American and its sister companies De Beers
Consolidated Mines and Minorco, was a critic of apartheid and
endorsed creating opportunities for black South Africans, who were
barred by law from the better-paying mine jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he could be a tough executive. Beginning in the
1970s the Oppenheimers and their companies favored recognizing
black trade unions. But in 1987, when the National Union of
Mineworkers struck Anglo, whose gold, diamond, platinum and coal
mines employed nearly 40 percent of the miners here, Relly
dismissed 20,000 workers. Some were later rehired.
</P>
<P>
   His successor as chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, noted this
week that Relly had run Anglo's copper interests in Zambia from
1965 to 1970, building up a relationship with President Kenneth
Kaunda of Zambia, who became the chief protector of the ANC in
exile. After that Relly worked for three years in Toronto as North
American chief of Anglo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he brought back a clear understanding that South
Africa was on the wrong course and ought to be on the right
course,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Nelson Mandela was released from prison in early 1990,
Relly spent 40 minutes talking with him at his house in Soweto. In
May 1990 the two led a joint business-ANC conference on the
economic shape of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Relly had opposed sanctions in the apartheid era, arguing that
they hurt blacks, as well as business, a view that the ANC opposed.
But Relly, who had watched Kaunda seize the company's rich copper
mines and bleed them dry, also argued forcefully against
nationalization as a means of redistributing wealth.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994 the ANC had dropped its socialist platform in favor of
aggressive free-market capitalism, fiscal prudence and
privatization as the engines of job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Relly was born in Cape Town in 1926. He attended private schools
there. In World War II he served with the South African Army in
Italy. Like many Anglo executives, he then studied at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   After working for Sir de Villiers Graaff, leader of the
opposition United Party, he joined Anglo American in 1949. He was
private secretary to Harry Oppenheimer, the heir apparent, and then
to the company founder, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Relly helped develop gold mines so far south of Johannesburg
that the company built a whole city, Welkom, to support. He oversaw
the creation of the Highveld Steel and Vanadium subsidiary. After
running other divisions at home and overseas, he succeeded Harry
Oppenheimer as chairman in 1983 and retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He was a trustee of several South African universities, as well
as a board member of the Worldwide Fund for Nature.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jane; three children, Janis,
Georgina and Giles, and four grandsons.

<P>
   His college coach kept him on a tight offensive leash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career at North Carolina ended in gloom. Indiana
University dumped the Tar Heels in the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA
Tournament. Told by Bobby Knight just before the game that Jordan
was his defensive assignment, somebody named Dan Dakich excused
himself, went to the locker-room john, threw up, and then held his
man to eight points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redemption for Jordan was expected to come in the 1984 NBA
draft, and did. Kinda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portland made a decision that lives in basketball infamy, taking
7-footer Sam Bowie with the second pick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston also bypassed Jordan, but since the Rockets used the
first pick on Hakeem Olajuwon, history is much kinder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bad bunch of Bulls in Chicago then had Jordan fall their way,
except ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An up-and-coming Mavericks team from Dallas, on their way to a
first playoff appearance, played their worst game of the previous
season on Nov. 4, 1983, in Cleveland. The Cavaliers were awful, but
they trounced Dallas, 105-84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, if the Mavericks had won that night,
Cleveland, not the Bulls, would have had the third draft choice in
the summer of '84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pick was owned by the Mavericks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next question. Knowing what we now know about the Mavericks'
draft history, would they have blown the Jordan pick? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes. At least, if they had heeded the astute advice of a former
Dallas sports page columnist. No name, please, but the guy has a
mustache and hooked nose spread across a radio face. Before that
draft, this idiot wrote the immortal words, ``the Mavericks need to
go big, bigger, biggest. Forget Jordan, just keep drafting big men
until you get it right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, the Mavericks already had Ro Blackman, Derek Harper
and Brad Davis in the backcourt. How could Jordan be an improvement
on that? How indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All factors considered, it amounts to rather humble beginnings
for what would become The Greatest Show on Earth, sports-wise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, without doubt, Jordan means it. He's retiring. The
other time, he was just recharging batteries while seeking to
solve, very unsuccessfully, the mystery of the curveball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we all lose. The Bulls certainly, but who cares? The NBA
certainly, but who cares? But what baseball had last summer with
McGwire-Sosa is what sports fans have had for years every time the
Bulls tipped it off. Jordan wasn't about a game, a team, or a
league. In sports, Jordan was today's Babe Ruth. How many more
years or decades until we find tomorrow's Michael Jordan? If ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ending is hardly a surprise, and based on the current
troubled state of the NBA, maybe it's the perfect time to walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who thought Jerry-Jimmy was the mother of
all ego blunders in sports, at least for this era, the retirement
of Jordan is now the topper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He does leave prematurely, with his game still intact, and the
probable reason centers on spite. Here's to you, Jerry Krause, and
you, too, Jerry Reinsdorf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krause is the Bulls' general manager. Over the years, he has
done an excellent job of building the Bulls around Jordan, but that
also was his downfall. Krause has never been comfortable with the
obvious _ Jordan is the show. Jordan is the one current Bulls'
player Krause did not put on the roster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf is the owner who allowed harsh feeling between Jordan
and Krause to fester and grow for years. Blame him heavily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six world championships in eight seasons for Chicago, but with
each, the internal war escalated between Krause and Jordan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was last season, as the Bulls were headed for another
title, when Krause finally went off the deep end. ``Players don't
win world championships, organizations do,'' Krause said. He was
actually talking about the expected difficulty in re-signing
free-agent-to-be Scottie Pippen. But it was an insult to Jordan,
and Jordan knew it. So, be assured, did Krause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pawn in their battle became coach Phil Jackson, Jordan's
guy. Krause constantly pushed for Jackson to retire. Jordan
repeatedly said if Jackson did, he would also quit. Jackson did.
Now Jordan will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan performed his job better than anyone in NBA history.
Krause's front-office work complemented Jordan's greatness. How
could they not live happily ever after? Where was Reinsdorf when it
came time to personally put a muzzle on Krause? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's now a career for Michael Jordan, who, by the way,
the Mavericks could have used after all. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of worry and feverish cramming, fourth
graders across New York state finally filled in the blanks Tuesday
on the first section of an innovative new reading test. But the day
was marred by distribution problems that delayed the exam in dozens
of schools and prompted school officials to warn of widespread
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   The test has been closely watched by educators across the
country because of its emphasis on listening, note-taking and
writing skills, and because New York plans to use it in future
years to decide whether fourth graders will be promoted to fifth
grade. The state has emerged as a leader in the national movement
to establish stronger curriculums and create tests to measure their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the vast majority of the state's 4,000 public and
private elementary schools were able to proceed with the first day
of testing as scheduled. But 50 to 60 schools, mostly in
Westchester and some upstate counties, had not received their test
materials by Tuesday morning, according to the state Education
Department. Those schools were forced to tell already nervous 9-
and 10-year-olds that they would have to wait yet another day.
</P>
<P>
   And state officials acknowledged that many teachers knew the
titles of two of the three reading passages that are a focus of the
test as early as Dec. 17, when they were drilling students daily in
how to write essays about literature, a main section of the test.
The titles were part of an instruction manual distributed to
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In districts where the tests were delayed, school administrators
said the confusion heightened the possibility of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how really reliable or valid the results can be,
given the situation,'' said Diane DiMaria, who was overseeing the
testing for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative
Educational Services. ``As soon as one of these test packets is
opened, it's no longer a secret test. Kids will talk. It's a shame,
because it was a good test.''
</P>
<P>
   The new test has been so closely watched because it is in the
forefront of a national movement back to teaching basics like
writing, spelling and grammar, and to do it by fourth grade,
provoking widespread anxiety among those who have grown used to a
more relaxed approach to learning. It is to be given over three
consecutive days, beginning Tuesday to about 250,000 fourth graders
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are particularly high for New York City, which has 97
of the state's 101 failing schools, and where 35 percent of
students failed a state test taken in the spring of 1998, compared
with just 6 percent of students statewide. Last week, New York City
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew urged state Education Commissioner
Richard Mills not to use results of the new test to determine
failing schools, saying the test was still an unknown quantity and
schools needed more time to adjust to it. Mills refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility that students could get an advance peek
at tests taken by fourth graders elsewhere in the state, Chris
Carpenter, a spokesman for Mills, who introduced and orchestrated
the new test, said state officials were counting on tight security
and the honesty of teachers and principals to prevent that.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that the delay in the test delivery was
``inexcusable,'' and that he would take steps to see that it is not
repeated next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the test was given during winter flu season, students
in New York City confounded expectations by showing up in greater
numbers than usual. Fourth-grade attendance in the city was 95.8
percent Tuesday, compared to an average of 92 percent, the Board of
Education said.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from filling in little answer bubbles to writing and
spelling led to a frenzy of cramming.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's portion was considered by many to be the easiest part,
because it was the most familiar _ 28 multiple-choice questions.
</P>
<P>
   The essays, which are timed at about 50 minutes each, begin
Wednesday and continue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At PS 129, a Harlem school that is on the state's list of
failing schools, the principal, Beverly Lewis, and fourth-grade
teachers ate breakfast Tuesday with about 100 of the 110 children
who took the test. Children have been practicing for the test since
last summer, Dr. Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   To create a peaceful climate, Dr. Lewis administered
standardized tests to every classroom from third to sixth grade
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Celeste Frazer's fourth grade, three girls brought good-luck
stuffed bunnies to school Tuesday. Clutching a bunny named
Buttercup, Aisha Smith admitted that, ``At first I was nervous,
because it's not the practice test, it's the real test.''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out, she said, that the test was easy.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who predicted that scores would be low, in part because
this is an unfamiliar test and in part because it is harder than
past tests, said he saw a positive side to the anxiety. It has
raised expectations, and children will rise to meet them, he
contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the supper table and in casual conversations at work, the
whole state has taken up this issue,'' he said. ``Often, children
are listening, and I think that's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   As ill luck would have it, Tuesday's delays resulted from the
state's efforts to maintain security by delivering the test
packages as close as possible to the test date.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the tests were to have been shipped to New York from
Iowa printing plants in December. But just before Thanksgiving, New
York state Education Department officials said they were concerned
about security because the tests would be sitting in schools for
weeks before the scheduled exam date.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery date was moved two dates later, to last Wednesday,
but printing delays over the Christmas holidays, and then
snowstorms that closed airports, prevented tests from being sent
out until Jan. 8, said Michael Kean, a spokesman for CTB-McGraw
Hill, the Monterey, Calif., company that helped the state develop
the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anyone responsible, we are the ones,'' Kean said.

FOR SOME 4th GRADERS, THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN A TEST 
(with NY-READING-EXAM) 
 (bl) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ It was undeniably a stressful day in Janet Ryan's
fourth-grade classroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   As the teacher read aloud from Katherine Paterson's ``Bridge to
Terabithia,'' the novel they have been sharing as a class, the 25
children learned Tuesday that one of their favorite characters, a
young girl named Leslie, had died in a freak accident while trying
to ford a creek. ``She was like a friend,'' said Tatiana Lyons, 9,
after the gasps quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   But there was hardly time to mourn. The children also had their
times tables to master, a task Mrs. Ryan cloaked in a game called
``multiplication baseball,'' in which a roll of two dice, their
dots multiplied together, yielded anything from an out (1 to 9) to
a home run (36). With a schoolwide celebration of writers coming up
in less than two weeks, there were book reports to polish, too.
</P>
<P>
   So it was little wonder that the first installment of the Test,
the new three-day state reading exam that has preoccupied students,
parents and teachers for weeks, seemed a distant memory by late
morning at Public School 124.
</P>
<P>
   As the children in Mrs. Ryan's class were only too happy to tell
a visitor, there is a lot more to life in the fourth grade than a
standardized test, even with two more hours of testing still to
come during the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't judge a book by its cover,'' said Ashlee
Mellowes, 9. ``If people come into PS 124, they'll see we don't
always take tests. We have parties. We have math. We have our
silent reading notebooks. We have our regular lives.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the citizens of Room 301 were casual
about the biggest test of their lives so far. Beginning in
December, though not a day before, Mrs. Ryan began putting them
through two to three hours of drills a week, with a heavy emphasis
on skills like note taking and essay writing, which will be tested
on the second and third days. Tuesday's installment, based on four
short passages and a poem, was all multiple choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ryan made it clear to her students, almost all of them
Hispanic and many of them born in other countries, that their
scores on the test could well make a difference in their
applications to middle schools in their district (No. 15) a year
from now. Moreover, they were told, the scores would tell the
outside world how good a job the teachers at their school were
doing. (Last year, the school ranked 453rd out of 676 elementary
schools citywide based on its performance on the city's third-grade
test.)
</P>
<P>
   But though they slept restlessly the night before in
anticipation _ Victor Rios, 9, dreamed that the murderous clown in
the movie he watched at bedtime wound up giving him the test, and
failing him _ they were only too happy to move on to other things
after 11 a.m. Tuesday, when Mrs. Ryan concluded a half-hour
post-mortem on what they had thought of Day One. (``It was hard,''
was the consensus.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, the children said, they have their own goals for the
year, beyond just passing a test and being promoted to the fifth
grade, as most surely will be.
</P>
<P>
   Victor said one of the things he hoped to accomplish this year
could hardly be measured on a piece of paper. ``My mom wants me to
make good friends, to comfort me when I have bad feelings,'' he
said. ``My mom always says, `With friends, there is confidence.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ashlee said her focus was on ``all the fourth grade standards''
that Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew had set forth, especially the
requirement that she read 25 books this year, with a concentration
of at least four books by one author.
</P>
<P>
   She is halfway to 25, and already on her third by James Howe,
``The Celery Stalks at Midnight,'' about a posse of talking
household pets who get together to solve a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ryan, 42, who is in her 20th year as a teacher, has goals,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary focus,'' she said, ``is to make our children
literate. For them to be able to read a piece of literature and
respond to it in a thoughtful way, to be able to write about what
the story meant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why she puts much of her emphasis on her students'
writing journals, collecting them often and responding to each
entry with personal notes. When, for example, Ashlee wrote that she
thought it was ``not fair'' for Joshua, the main character in ``The
Flunking of Joshua T. Bates,'' to be held back in third grade, Mrs.
Ryan wrote back: ``Maybe it is fair, Ashlee. Maybe Joshua didn't
work hard at all to make his reading better.''
</P>
<P>
   She signed the note, as she does to all her students, ``Love,
Mrs. Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ryan says the very skills Ashlee demonstrated in responding
to that passage are captured by the test, skills she would have
taught her children anyway, test or no test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my primary focus to teach for the test, especially
with it coming in January,'' she said. ``I have a lot of teaching
time left this year.''

RECORD PRICE FOR MCGWIRE'S RECORD 70

   NEW YORK _ The bidding started at $400,000 and shot upward to
$1.2 million. There was another pause at $1.7 million, and then the
bidding rolled ahead to $2.6 million. A long pause. A gasp or two.
Then an anonymous voice on the telephone offered $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Sternberg, a necktie manufacturer, gave up. ``I thought
the person at the other end of the line might not have a bottom
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball of the kind available for $10 in any sporting goods
store had just sold for $3,005,000, when the commission of the
auction house, Guernsey's, was added in. The baseball was the 70th
home run hit by Mark McGwire, and was described by Arlan Ettinger,
the auction house owner, as ``without doubt, the most significant
baseball in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt about that on Tuesday night. The ball fetched
a price that was 23 times the highest amount ever paid for a
baseball ($126,500), the one Babe Ruth hit for the first home run
in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The sane anonymous caller who purchased the McGwire ball also
bought the final home run hit by Sammy Sosa, No. 66, for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases marked one of the most spectacular baseball
seasons ever, as McGwire and Sosa engaged in a jubilantly
good-natured race. The previous high price for sports memorabilia
was $640,000 paid for a Honus Wagner baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Ozersky, who earns $30,000 as a medical researcher, sat
expressionless as he watched the ball he caught on Sept. 27 in
Busch Stadium in St. Louis make him a millionaire, as the numbers
rolled ever upward. His arm remained snuggled around his
girlfriend, Amanda Abbott, who works in the same laboratory at
Washington University. His family sat around him, sometimes
giggling but mainly staring intently.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky insisted there would be no changes in his life. He does
expect that more people he doesn't know will claim to be his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll settle in in a couple of weeks,'' he said. ``I'm ready
to get back to St. Louis to get on with my normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   He had turned down $1 million immediately after catching the
ball, and his lawyers had floated rumors that he had been offered
as much as $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Did the final price exceed Ozersky's expectations? ``Oh yeah,''
he said. ``Oh yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abbott was less restrained. ``It's incredible,'' she gushed.
`It's beyond my wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger said he had not recognized the name of the winning
bidder when he registered, but that others in his company had.
``He's apparently well known,'' he said. He expected the purchaser
would identify himself soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The auction, in the Theater at Madison Square Garden, had the
look and sound of the circus. Beforehand, speakers played ``Take Me
Out to the Ball Game,'' and Abbott and Costello's famous routine,
``Who's on First?''
</P>
<P>
   Other sale items included Mickey Mantle's 500th home run ball
and a number of Babe Ruth home runs balls. There were 12 of the
original architectural drawings for Yankee Stadium. There was the
ball Hank Aaron hit for his last homer, No. 755, the career record.
</P>
<P>
   Other items were a ball autographed by Cy Young; a ball
autographed by the 1927 Philadelphia Athletics, including Ty Cobb,
and a ball autographed by both Ruth and Roger Maris, the previous
single-season home run champion, with 61 for the Yankees in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger said the response to the 41 lots of baseball treasures
exceeded his house's auction last year of 600 items from the
Kennedy White House. He said that many people had registered to bid
more than seven-figure sums, and a few had proved able to bid into
eight figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people registered with more money than I've
ever seen before,'' Ettinger said.

CLIPPERS SET TO INTRODUCE FORD

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the risk of underscoring the obvious, it should
be noted that timing is not on the Los Angeles Clippers' side.
</P>
<P>
   The day after their franchise-salvation draft pick skipped off
to Italy, the NBA found a key to ending its lockout. Now, on the
day the Clippers are introducing Chris Ford as their 10th coach
since moving from San Diego to Los Angeles only 15 seasons ago,
Michael Jordan is scheduled to make an official commitment to golf.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have scheduled a press conference for 3 p.m. at the
Convention Center but remain mum on just who will be the star of
this show.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a team source said Ford, who was fired after leading
the injury-riddled Milwaukee Bucks to a 36-46 record last season,
is the choice over former Clippers assistant Jim Brewer. Ford and
Brewer could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The only Clippers employees willing to discuss the coaching
situation on the record were players who showed up for the second
day of workouts at Veterans Park Recreation Center in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Pooh Richardson, a fan of Brewer, also endorsed the
expected hiring of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Chris Ford personally,'' said Richardson, ``but I
know he played the game and is an experienced coach. They had a lot
of injuries in Milwaukee. If we had the same contract last year
that we have now, he'd have been sitting on high cheese back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be sitting on the bench with a team that hasn't identified
its starting point guard and must wait until its center, draft pick
Michael Olowokandi, returns from Italy in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   For any coaching choice, such timing presents a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we were looking at the strong possibility of not
having a season,'' said a team source, defending management's
decision to wait before making a hire. ``Paying someone a year for
nothing isn't very smart either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner, the better,'' said Richardson. ``It wouldn't be
bad to get someone in here and get ahold of the system.''
</P>

showed up for Tuesday's workout, making it seven signed Clippers
reporting for duty. Free agent Brent Barry, an ex-Clipper who
finished last season with the Miami Heat, returned, and was joined
by free-agent point guard Darrick Martin. . . . The Clippers on
Jordan's retirement: ``He took the game to another level by far,''
Robinson said. ``But I think the NBA will survive. The first time I
played against him was when I was with Portland. They put me in the
game to guard him. He looked over at Scottie (Pippen) and said,
`Bring it over here, I got a short one.' ''

MYLES TIERNEY, 34, A JOURNALIST WHO SPECIALIZED IN AFRICAN WAR 
</HEADLINE>

   Myles Tierney, the Associated Press newsman who died Sunday
after being shot by a Sierra Leone rebel while covering the wars,
famines and riots of West Africa, was living precisely the life he
had sought, according to his mother, Hanne Tierney of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He was 34 and was stationed in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he and two other A.P. journalists were
being escorted by soldiers of a West African peacekeeping coalition
into downtown Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, where a civil
war is raging. A rebel fighter approached their station wagon and
opened fire, killing Tierney instantly; the other journalists were
wounded, one seriously, the other superficially.
</P>
<P>
   According to several journalists and friends, Tierney loved
traveling through remote and inhospitable areas, videotaping the
chaos and massacres, and transmitting the news to London and New
York, where it was distributed to television stations throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to be on the road,'' said Jean-Marc Bouju, an A.P.
photographer who worked with Tierney in West Africa. ``He could get
as excited doing a feature on Somalia as a war in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   But wars were more plentiful, said Karin Davies, an A.P.
reporter who also worked with Tierney. ``Africa is difficult,'' she
said. ``We saw the grimmest things. Rwanda in 1994 _ the
genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Tierney, his mother said, always loved reading and writing and
adventure. He grew up in Manhattan, ``a real New York kid,'' said
Mrs. Tierney, a performance artist who is divorced from his father,
Myles Tierney, a mathematics professor, for whom he was named.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother and father, Tierney is survived by a
sister, Lorin Tierney, and two brothers, David Guthrie and Shawn
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   After some time at Rutgers University, he dropped out to
concentrate on becoming a video producer. A few years later, he
moved to Berlin, just before the destruction of the Wall, and
survived by selling freelance news articles to the A.P. and other
news organizations. In 1994, the A.P. hired him to produce news
video, and in 1997 it assigned him to the Nairobi bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest struggle in covering West Africa was traveling to
war zones and then finding gasoline to power the generator to
transmit the videotapes on satellite phones.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in a village in Congo, he persuaded 30 local people to
lift his Land-Rover, which was stuck in the mud, Ms. Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the first TV journalists to master new, sophisticated
electronic equipment, he was able to write and edit in the field.
``He'd be in the middle of nowhere,'' Ms. Davies said, ``no
electricity, no running water, and he'd been sitting in the mud hut
piecing together a story.''
