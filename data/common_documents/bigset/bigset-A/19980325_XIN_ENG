<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Outlines Cross-Century Tasks Facing State Council (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At the first plenary meeting of
the new State Council, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today urged
State Council members to treasure power entrusted by the people
and perform their duties in line with the Chinese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Zhu outlined the major cross-century tasks of the State
Council, and stressed the need for further emancipating the mind,
seeking truth from facts, deepening reforms and expanding opening
in order to promote the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics as the 21st century approaches.
</P>
<P>
The members approved the Plan for the Establishment of
Operational Units of the State Council and Restructuring
Coordinating Bodies, as well as the revised Working Regulations of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the State Council will solve a number of social
and economic problems over the next five years. The future is
bright and full of hope, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the proper management over the next five years will
raise China's reform and development efforts to a new level.
</P>
<P>
He praised the achievements of the previous government led by
former premier Li Peng, and noted that progress resulting
therefrom has established a solid foundation for the future work
of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China's material and technological base has been greatly
enhanced, with the nation's foreign exchange reserves and grain
storage reaching record highs.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, we have a complete set of theories, guiding
lines, principles and policies which have been proved to be correct
in practice," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party with Jiang Zemin at the core is full capable of managing
various difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
"We have braved various domestic and international challenges
and tests over the past years, and we will undoubtedly win victories
in the face of new challenges and tests," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He added that 1998 will be a key year for his government to
achieve various objectives.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the government will strive to ensure an eight-percent
national economic growth rate, keep inflation at below three
percent and maintain a stable exchange rate for the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
He also called for stimulating domestic demands and giving full
play to the vast potential of the domestic market.

<P>
China plans to increase investments in fixed assets, with
priority placed on inputs to agriculture, forestry and water
conservancy projects, as well as infrastructure construction in
the railway, highway, telecommunications and environmental
protection sectors, and new and high-tech programs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for accelerated housing reform and construction to
established a new growth point in economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to promote agricultural development
and enhance poverty relief efforts, with an additional 10 million
rural residents expected to shake off poverty in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On restructuring China's economy and government institutions,
Zhu said that the reforms of State-owned enterprises, the
financial system and government bodies are vital to the overall
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC Central Committee has set goals for the reforms
and the State Council must achieve them within the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The system of appointing supervising commissioners for
State-owned enterprises will be established, Zhu said, adding it
will be an important measure to separate government functions from
enterprise management.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the need to make greater efforts to restructure
the financial system and noted that the order in the financial
sector must be rectified with a focus on strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory role of the Central Bank and
accelerating the independent operation of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also addressed reforms of the grain circulation
sector, and the investment, housing, medical care, social security
services and taxation systems. He noted that reform efforts should
be well coordinated and managed in line with China's economic and
social development.

<P>
Zhu said the State Council also plans to place priority on
reemployment projects so as to ensure the basic subsistence
requirements of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should provide professional training
courses and introduce correct employment concepts in order to
create more job opportunities, while encouraging laid-off workers
to employ them by themselves, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that great importance will be placed on
restructuring government institutions and realizing the separation
of government functions from enterprises management, instead of
simply shifting power from one government department to another.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ministries and commissions under the State
Council will be streamlined and the number of public servants
reduced. Zhu added that restructuring programs should be
properly arranged to prevent negative impacts on the normal work
of the government.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged departments concerned to improve training
programs to sharpen the competitiveness of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that the staff of the State Council should be
fully cognizant of their position as public servants and should
work whole-heartedly for the people, adhere to the truth even at
the expense of personal interests, and devote themselves to the
battle against corruption and the establishment of a clean and
honest government.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed with Zhu's call for future work
inspection tours to strictly adhere to the principle of frugality
and scheduling work conferences in sites other that resort areas.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials with the State Council will attend major
activities organized by the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China and the State Council, but will refrain from
attending various other events such as ribbon-cutting and awards
ceremonies in order to concentrate fully on study of major issues.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stocks Slide Due to Renewed Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi shares index went
down slightly Tuesday amidst increased violence in the Pakistan's
biggest city which has left 20 dead.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between members of the Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)
and its splinter group, the MQM (Haqiqi), has also made the main
shopping and commercial areas of the city remain closed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks market analysts say that trading volumes were also down
Tuesday as the city was not fully functional and the main
commercial areas were shut.
</P>
<P>
The 100-Index of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) ended down 2.07
points to close at 1512.25 with a trading volume of 43.4 million
shares as compared to Friday's close of 1514.32 on 54 million

<HEADLINE> Israeli President: Compromise on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
on Tuesday expressed his confidence that a compromise can be
reached over the scope of Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank
between the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with the United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Weizman told reporters there are proposals that Israel
withdraw from 9 or 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
All the parties concerned, the Israelis and the Palestinians in
particular, will reach a compromise in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly outlined an initiative that
Israel should pull back its troops from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank in several phases over 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has said the withdrawal scope is "unacceptable" and
"damaging Israel's security interests" and asked the U.S. not to
go public with it. The Jewish state insists that it will withdraw
from no more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president voiced his concern about the situation in
the Middle East and asked the U.N. chief to exercise his personal
influence to prevent it from exploding.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) secretary general has made great contributions in
helping solve the Iraq crisis and so he can do his best in
preventing the situation here from exploding," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan reached an agreement on U.N. weapons inspections with
Iraq a month ago after tough and successful mediation, which
averted a possible military attack on Iraq by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Weizman, Annan told reporters that the
Mideast peace process is facing trouble and all parties concerned
should make efforts to put it back on track.
</P>
<P>
"During my tour of this region, everyone that I have met has
spoken about the strategic decisions to achieve peace, which will
help move the peace process forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here on Tuesday on the last leg of his regional
trip, which has taken him to Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and the
Palestinian self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Scholars Seek Deeper Understanding of China (1) (by Li Xiguang and Chen Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- "I am at the beginning of a
voyage of discovery -- one I have looked forward to for many
years," said Harvard President Neil Rudenstine, who is visiting
China.
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine made the comments during an address to 800-odd
Beijing University teachers and students Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it was in 1877 that Mr. Francis Knight -- an American
who had been living for years in China -- returned to his home in
Boston for an extended visit. He suggested -- and Harvard agreed
-- that our University should hire its first teacher of Mandarin
Chinese. Mr. Knight returned to China and engaged the services of
Mr. Ko Kun-hua of Ningpo, who came, very bravely, to the
wilderness of Harvard in 1879 -- with his wife and six small
children -- to begin instruction in the elegant intricacies of
your venerable language."
</P>
<P>
Some 100-odd years have passed and Rudenstine and his wife are
currently visiting China. "I come to you in the spirit of
friendship and learning," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although this is the first visit to China for my wife and me,
I have seen a lot and learned a lot. I cannot wait to anticipate
another trip to China," said Rudenstine, who arrived in Beijing
on Saturday and will depart for southern China on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and China are different in culture and
tradition, and have a lot to learn from each other," said
Rudenstine, a scholar of Renaissance literature. "I have visited
the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, and I feel very
excited."
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine is the first sitting president of Harvard to visit
China, a fact which indicates that the university, a highly
prestigious Western academic institution which directly influences
the attitudes major U.S. sectors hold concerning China, is in the
process of expanding its recognition of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Early in this century, when scholars at Harvard first began to
study China in a serious way, questions were raised about whether
the University was using its resources wisely," according to
Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
"Now at the end of this century, in our increasingly
interconnected world, it is impossible to imagine how China could
not be a significant focus of study at American universities. It
is hard to imagine anyone questioning the importance and
even 'usefulness' of studying China."

He pointed out that one of Harvard's most significant research
projects is an ongoing collaborative effort focused on the
"complicated interplay between economic development, energy use
and environmental protection." The project involves more than 100
scholars from both China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rudenstine said Chinese scholars working with the Harvard law
faculty a number of years ago helped the university establish the
first Chinese law program in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This shows how strongly we are committed to a wider
understanding of China, and to a broader dialogue with colleagues
in China on other matters of common interest.
</P>
<P>
"How can we manage rapid changes in the global economy? How do
we prevent the spread of terrible infectious diseases? Given the
major changes in the international landscape in recent years, how
can we build a framework for a durable peace in the future? These
and many other questions can be intelligently addressed only if we
strengthen our capacity to work together across traditional
academic borders, and across traditional national and regional
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"All of us will need to consider how to incorporate and
accommodate a greater diversity of people, and a greater variety
of attitudes, customs, and ideas. We will have to learn how to
sustain our own deepest cultural and human values, while also
living more closely with -- and learning from -- others who have
different values," said Rudenstine.

Several thousand scholars in the United States are engaged in
Sinocology, including influential scholars Ezra Vogel and William
Kirby who are visiting China along with Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
Vogel, director of the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research
and director of the Harvard University Asia Center, speaks fluent
Chinese. His published works include "Japan as Number One: Lessons
for America," "One Step Ahead in China: Guangdong Under Reform"
and "Four Little Dragons."
</P>
<P>
Vogel, who refers to himself as "a student of Japan and China
for 40 years," told Xinhua that "it is as comfortable as at home
to be in China."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Fairbank was unable to get used to the changes
and was "somewhat uncomfortable" during his 1972 visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century, the most important force will be in
Asia. China has the most rapid economic growth rate in the world,"
said Vogel, who hosted Chinese President Jiang Zemin during a
visit to Harvard in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Living With China," which he recently edited,
provides an avenue for all sectors in the United States to reach a
consensus and live with China.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st century will face many problems. The US and China
should learn from each other and understand each other. The US
should open up more to China, and American scholars should inform
the American people of China's progress," said Vogel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that interest groups and the bias of the
U.S. media have deprived the American public of access to detailed
information concerning changes which have taken place and are
still taking place in China, including the emergence of private
enterprises and government efforts to decontrol prices.
</P>
<P>
William Kirby, a senior faculty member with Harvard's Asia
Center and the Fairbank Center for East Asia Research, has worked
as a Visiting Professor at both Beijing University and Nanjing
University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has a great and continuous
civilization. "Every time I come to China, the change is so fast,
and I don't think you can see any part of the world that is moving
so fast. That's very exciting."
</P>
<P>
Kirby, who initiated his studies of China during the Vietnam
War Era, said that one of his research projects focuses on
"watching the change of China."
</P>
<P>
Kirby is currently working on three books related to China --
"The International Development of China," "China and the World in
the 20th Century" and "A World Transformed: A Global History of
the 20th Century."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Economy Is Resilient, says minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa Tuesday said the country's economy is resilient and will
survive the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The minsiter siad that the market is poised for better
prices of some exports with flue-cured tobacco prices expected to be
fairly bouyant this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of heads of Christian denominations,
Murerwa said there were already signs of
recovery, with the strengthening of the Zimbabwean Ddollar from about
18 Zimbabwean Dollars in January to 16.5 against one U.S. Dollar in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
''Horticultural exports are also doing very well and have
therefore contributed to the firming of the Zimbabwean dollar,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the agricultural sector would experience a modest grow
th,
which should bring about stability in prices of food, in addition to
the foreign exchange earning from exports, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the economy was estimated to have grown by 3.7
percent in 1997, a weak performance compared to 1996 when the economy
grew by 7.2 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the weak performance to lower production by the
agricultural and mining sectors which declined by two percent and six
percent respectively in real terms during 1997.
</P>
<P>
''The decline in agricultural activities was due to excessive
rains which reduced production volumes of the major agricultural
crops. Maize production declined by 15.9 percent, cotton by 7.5
percent and tobacco by 7.1 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''The mining sector suffered heavily from depressed international
prices of our major minerals such as gold, nickel and chrome,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
But the manufacturing sector was estimated to have experienced an
impressive growth of 8.5 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the balance of payments problem, the minister said the
government was currently involved in discussions with the IMF on a
stand-by agreement with a view to increasing foreign currency
reserves and ensuring stability of the Zimbabwean Dollar.

<HEADLINE> S. African, Russian Diamond Giants Set Up Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- De Beers, South African
diamond giant, has concluded a 50-50 joint-venture agreement with
Russia's Soglasiye gem miner to exploit the rich Lomonosov
deposit near Arkhangelsk, northwest Russia, a De Beers official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The venture will be the first to allow a foreign company to
mine diamonds on Russian soil, said Raymond Clarke, the Head of
De Beers in Moscow, the capital of Russia.
</P>
<P>
De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer, said the the
latest Russian government shake-up by President Boris Yeltsin
should have no immediate effect on the company's gem sales
agreement with Russia.
</P>
<P>
De Beers signed an agreement last October, which expires at
the end of this year. Under the agreement, Russia will sell at
least 550 million U.S. Dollars in rough Russian gems a year to De
Beers.
</P>
<P>
Officials at De Beers and Almazy Rossi-Sakha, the Russian
diamond monopoly, expect the total to exceed the minimum.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Announces New Era in Vehicle Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) - Nissan's US carmaker Infiniti is
launching an in-car satellite system that automatically calls for
help in an accident, tracks down car thieves and even eavesdrops
on their conversation.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the company here Tuesday, the
"Infiniti Communicator" can also be sued for touch-of-a-button
breakdown and medical assistance and will remotely open car doors
in the event of a lock-out.
</P>
<P>
The system features two buttons and a microphone located in a
console above the driving seat. It uses Global Positioning System
(GPS) and cellular phone technology linked up to a 24 hour
Infiniti Response Center (IRC).
</P>
<P>
If a collision sets off an air-bag then the Infiniti
Communicator automatically alerts the response center. The
operator attempts voice contact, calls the emergency services and
identifies the vehicle's exact position with a GPS readout.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency the driver can summon the breakdown or
emergency services at the touch of a button. One button identified
with the picture of an ambulance is for high priority situations
such as an accident or medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
The other button marked with a circle "I" for information is
for lower priority calls such as roadside assistance or general
travel information. The IRC operator can identify the vehicle's
position and summon the relevant service, even if voice contract
is not possible.
</P>
<P>
If the vehicle's security system is triggered by a thief the
Infiniti Communicator automatically calls the response center. The
operator immediately notifies the local police and calls the
owner's emergency number.
</P>
<P>
The response center provides the police with tracking
information if the vehicle is stolen. Staff inform the police of
vehicle location, direction, speed, licence number, colour and
vehicle identification number. When the ignition is on, the police
can monitor the thief's conversation.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a lock-out, owners can request remote door
unlocking immediately or at a specified time by calling a free
phone number and providing a personal password.

<HEADLINE> Museum Receives Precious Manuscript of Mathematician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The widow of the late Chinese
mathematician Chen Jingrun donated Chen's manuscript of the
thesis, the Proof for "Goldbach's Conjecture 1 + 2," to the Museum
of the Chinese Revolution today.
</P>
<P>
The manuscript was about Chen's work on Goldbach's conjecture,
which proved that "each large even number can be expressed as the
sum of a prime and an integer that is the product of at most two
primes."
</P>
<P>
A national science magazine published the digest of the
manuscript in 1966. Chen advanced the proof in 1973, and a theorem
has been named after him.
</P>
<P>
The manuscript was found in the Mathematics Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) last year, where Chen, a former
academician of CAS, had been working.
</P>
<P>
"The manuscript is one of the most precious cultural relics the
museum has collected these years," said Dong Baohua, deputy
director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, adding that it
will soon be put on show in a large exhibition about the
development of modern China, sponsored by the museum.

<HEADLINE> China Announces New Interest Rate Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), the nation's central bank, has announced that the interest
rates on bank loans and deposits will be lowered effective
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also decided to begin reform of the
deposit reserve fund system on March 21, and will reduce interest
rates on loans and deposits granted to financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates for deposits and loans will be reduced by an
average 0.16 and 0.6 percentage points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark interest rates for one-year deposits will drop from
5.67 percent to 5.22 percent, with the rate for two-year deposits
falling from 5.94 percent to 5.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on demand deposits, as well as three-month,
six-month, three-year and five-year term deposits, will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Six-month lending rates will be lowered from 7.65 percent to
7.02 percent, with reductions also set for longer term lending
rates.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of interest rate reductions, which follows
reductions in October last year, is in response to sharply
declining prices.
</P>
<P>
Interest payment burdens on borrowers, especially state-owned
enterprises, will be eased somewhat since interest rates for loans
will fall more than rates for deposits.
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of reform of the deposit reserve fund
system, the central bank will combine two existing reserve fund
accounts, and will reduce the legal ratio of deposit reserve funds
from 13 percent to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank has decided to lower annual
interest rate on the deposits of financial institutions from 7.35
percent to 5.22 percent. And, annual interest rates on loans to
financial institutions will fall from 9.19 percent to 7.43
percent.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Circular Bans Illegal Deposit encouragement Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
issued an urgent circular today, demanding that the practice of
attracting deposits through high interest rates should be firmly
stopped and seriously punished, so as to consolidate financial
order and protect the authority of the official interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the PBOC said the circular is targeted at some
commercial banks, urban and rural credit cooperatives, trust
investment companies and postal deposit departments which recently
used high interest rate to attract deposits. Their practices run
counter to the state's official interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
A PBOC spokesman stressed that the interest rate published by
the PBOC is the state's official interest rate and should be
strictly obeyed. Practices run counter to the official interest
rate should be punished in accordance with the state's laws,
regulations and the PBOC's financial rules.
</P>
<P>
The circular demanded all related financial institutions carry
out self check-ups, examine and correct their self-styled
provisions which encouraged illegal deposit practices.
</P>
<P>
The circular also detailed the measures to punish illegal
practices which encourage deposits.
</P>
<P>
The central bank today also announced new interest rate
reduction effecting on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's national
tuberculosis and leprosy control program announced Tuesday that
close to 250,000 people in the country are infected with the
virus that causes tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
At a panel discussion held here to observe this year's World
Tuberculosis Day which falls on March 24, head of the program
Aleminesh Wolde said that up to 100,000 cases are registered
yearly in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
She said that tuberculosis which has been identified in
Ethiopia 40 years ago, has now become the leading killer disease
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The low awareness of the public about the contagious nature of
tuberculosis and the spread of HIV/AIDS aggravated the incidnece
of tuberculosis across the nation, she said, adding that
tuberculosis patients often tend to disrupt the treatment against
the disease, leading to the fast spread of tuberculosis
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occassion, representative of the World Health
Organization's tuberculosis and leprosy control program, Peter
Finstra said that tuberculosis victimizes one-third of the
world's population and that every 10 seconds one person loses his
life to tuberculosis in the world.

<HEADLINE> Syrian PM Demands Israeli Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi Tuesday demanded Israel to pull out immediately from all
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the opening ceremony of the Near East
ministerial session of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), which opened here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi said the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338
stipulates the full withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab
territories and its return to the June 4, 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
The resolution 425 definitely calls for immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi reiterated Syria's stance on the issue, saying that
Syria has proclaimed its adherence to a just and comprehensive
peace in the region in line with international resolutions, the
Madrid decisions, and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian prime minister also called upon the U.S. and Russia,
the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, to deal with
Israel's rejection of any serious approach to a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the FAO meeting, which was attended by agriculture ministers
from the Near East countries, Zouebi called for promoting
economic, cultural and technical cooperation among the FAO member
states.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of both the proposed Arab common
market and the Arab free trade zone in view of the fact that they
are the proper way for Arab economic intergration.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the agriculture ministers of the Near East
FAO member states would discuss a report by the FAO director
general Jacques Diouf, on the organization's activities in the
Near East and the FAO emergency plan for protection from animal
diseases and plant pests.

ATHENS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday called for a
speedy solution of the Kosovo problem through dialogue between
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with visiting
Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, Greek Parliament
President Apostolos Kaklamanis said that steps should be made as
soon as possible to seek a political solution of the Kosovo issue
and for a message of commencement of dialogue to be sent outwards.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Kosovo issue was an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, saying that Greece opposed the creation of "a separate
state entity" in Kosovo because such an eventuality would not
concern only Yugoslavia, but also all countries in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bulatovic, who arrived here Sunday for a three-day
official visit, said that Belgrade was willing to provide all the
minorities including the ethnic Albanians with all guarantees for
civil rights and freedoms, within the framework of Yugoslav
constitution and international treaties.
</P>
<P>
He condemned "foreign powers" for encouraging the ethnic
Albanians to seek Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia, saying
that the development of Kosovo's situation depended on whether the
ethnic Albanians would come to the negotiating table with
Belgrade.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) - British car manufacturer
Rolls-Royce has produced the first new Rolls-Royce called "Silver
Seraph" for nearly 20 year, the company announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Silver Seraph, an entirely new motor car built with the
latest proven technology, uses the finest quality materials,
timeless craftsmanship and classic styling.
</P>
<P>
Exterior styling is an update of classic Rolls-Royce themes.
Its new V-12 engine, 5-speed automotive adaptive transmission and
new suspension have been developed for a swift, refined and
controlled driving experience.
</P>
<P>
The Seraph's new platform provides significantly increased body
torsional rigidity. New braking and traction assistance systems
also contribute to increased levels of driver control.
</P>

The new interior styling has equal impact, with careful detail
design complementating flowing shape and form. It features new
seats and trim, a new climate control system, new instruments and
controls.
</P>
<P>
Complex curvature has been applied to the fascia, console and
waistrails which unbleached burr veneers continue to be
individually mirror-matched throughout each motor car.
</P>

Graham Morris, Rolls-Royce Chief Executive, said that the
Silver Seraph would go on sale soon and it was "the dawn of a new

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland will hold
a national referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty -- the new European
Union Treaty -- in May, according to press reports from Dublin
early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government spokeswoman said that the referendum, on
whether to forge closer relationship with the 15-nation bloc, will
be held on May 22.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty, which replaced the Maastricht Treaty of
1992 to become the new EU Treaty, aims to enhance cooperation on
crime, health, unemployment, consumer protection and the
environment within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the Irish referendum was designed as a
safety measure to avoid any potential legal challenges to the
Treaty in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, the result of the national referendum is likely to be
a strong "yes" vote as a European Commission survey last November
revealed that more than 80 percent of Irish voters supported the
country's EU membership.

BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany's export boom is set to
continue with an expected growth of 11.5 percent in 1998 after a
remarkable 10.5 percent rise registered last year, the German
Wholesale and Foreign Trade Association BGA said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to BGA president Michael Fuchs, Germany's exports are

</P>

The BGA estimate is much more optimistic than that of the

7.5 percent.

<P>
According to the BGA, Germany's imports would also expand by

<HEADLINE> Arafat Open to U.S. Initiative, Says Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat is keen to discuss the new
U.S. proposal to revive the Mideast peace process, Egyptian
Presidential Advisor Osama el-Baz said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here
Tuesday, Arafat expounded his vision regarding the current
U.S. initiative as well as his readiness to meet with U.S. Mideast
Peace Envoy Dennis Ross on Thursday, Baz told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat expressed keenness to discuss everything to be proposed
in this connection," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to advance the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, the U.S. has called on Israel to carry out a 13.1 percent
second withdrawal in the West Bank linked to the fulfillment of
Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinians and Israelis have expressed reservations over
the plan. Israel said it can afford to pull out from no more than
10 percent of the territories while the PNA demands at least 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to persuade Israel and the Palestinians to accept
the new initiative, Ross will visit the region this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also wants to maintain impetus of a mediation drive by
foreign powers concerned especially the U.S. and Europe in the
Mideast peace process, Baz added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Washington will maintain its
interest in the peace march and offer proposals that could be
accepted especially by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Baz described the Palestinians as the party which has been so
far adversely affected by the stalemate in the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
He said any U.S. initiative should take into consideration the
basic demands and requirements of the Palestinians and not just be
a "mere refection of the Israeli point of view."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here early in the day on a few hours' visit
to Egypt, had talks with Mubarak and addressed the opening session
of the 109th Arab League Council meeting.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Airlift Food for Children in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) will start on Wednesday an airlift of food for
37,000 malnourished children in nutritional centers throughout
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here on Tuesday, WFP said that a
Boeing 707 would deliver 34 tons of powdered milk on Wednesday
morning to Bujumbura airport.
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 days, WFP will airlift to Burundi a total of
600 tons of sugar, powdered milk, oil and other relief supplies
which will be used in 111 feeding centers in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Jean Siblot, WFP's Country Director for Burundi, was quoted as
saying "malnutrition in this country is on the rise and some
300,000 people are facing major food shortages."
</P>
<P>
As a result, the press release said, WFP has given priority to
nutritional feeding programs for 37,000 children in centers run
by non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
WFP has to resort to an urgent airlift of food as the El
Nino-induced heavy rains and flooding destroyed the roads and
rail networks from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, only 1,500 tons of food have
been delivered to Burundi every month against the required 5,000
tons monthly need for some 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Siblot noted that "our stocks of food aid in Burundi have hit
rock bottom" and "we are only receiving a fraction of what we
need."
</P>
<P>
The WFP airlift has been approved by the Regional Sanctions
Coordinating Committee as shipments of humanitarian supplies into
Burundi require clearance from national and regional sanctions
committees.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions against Burundi were imposed by countries
in east and central Africa in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> UK Drug Users Need Help for Treatment: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A paucity of treatment for young
drug users in Britain led to a seven-year gap between the age they
started taking drugs and when they tried to get treatment for
their addiction, says a survey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out among some 500 drug users aged 14-59
found that addicts started to take drugs at 15 on average,
recognized they had a problem at 17, but did not seek help until
they were 22.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the gap to a lack of treatment for young
drug users for whom there are only a handful of specialist
detoxification centers.
</P>
<P>
Peter Martin, chief executive of the drugs agency Addaction,
which carried out the survey, called on the UK government to
address the problem in its new strategy on drug prevention.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are getting to a point of crisis. There's a
paucity of services. The whole policy area needs to be thought
through," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health said that it was aware of "a problem
with the number of services for young people" and it would spend 37
million pounds (61 million US dollars) on drug treatment this
year.

<P>
The Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia Meghji,
reiterated Monday that local and international experts will
closely monitor the environmental impact of the multi-million U.S
Dollars project.
</P>
<P>
"Two commissions have been formed to monitor the development
of the project to ensure that there is no environmental
destruction of the the project site," Meghji told reporters in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the project has six sites, the sixth of
which is the largest covering about 6,000 of a total of 10,000
hectares, and that it will not adversely affect the environs
since it is out of the mangroves program area on the delta.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have expressed fears that the project will
destroy a large tract of mangrove trees along the coast. In
addition, they claimed that pollution, coastal deforestation,
soil erosion, the collapse of fisheries and social conflicts over
land are some of the common consequences of commercial
aquiculture.
</P>
<P>
In response, Meghji said the investor of the proposed project,
Messrs African Fishing Company, has already been notified of the
government's conditions to ensure there will be no destruction of
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The company intends to cultivate over 20,000 hectares of land
on the delta for development of ponds for prawns farming.
</P>
<P>
The minister also assured that the investors are going to
engage in extensive farming instead of intensive farming of the
prawns. "Extensive farming is one of the conditions we have
agreed upon since it is widely known that intensive farming of
prawns required a lot of compounds which normally lead to rampant
prawn diseases," Meghji said.
</P>
<P>
Meghji also insisted that the investors will be prohibited to
use destructive chemicals in the project.
</P>
<P>
The company has yet to embark on the project and the
government is still waiting for its program of action for
evaluation, she said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rules Out Bicommunal Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has ruled out talks with his rival Greek Cypriot
community counterpart, saying no U.N. resolution would make him
return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's comments came only a few days after top U.N. envoy
for Cyprus Diego Cordovez announced that he would seek guidance
from the Security Council on demands by Denktash to change the
basis of the negotiations to "state-to-state" talks instead of an
intercommunal dialog.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez was in Cyprus last week for meetings with President
Glafcos Clerides and Denktash, in a bid to break the deadlock and
revive the peace process on the island.
</P>
<P>
Denktash told the Turkish Cypriot newspaper Kibris, published
Tuesday in Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia,
that he would outline his views to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan at a meeting in Geneva on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan-Denktash meeting was confirmed Tuesday by Acting
U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt in New York. During the meeting,
the Turkish Cypriot leader is expected to raise his demand to
change the status of the interlocutors in Cyprus peace talks,
demanding for recognition of his breakaway Republic in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash was quoted by the paper as saying that he did not
believe the Security Council would modify its attitude toward the
Turkish Cypriots and adopt a resolution in their favour.
</P>
<P>
"We have made it clear that we are ending the talks. Why should
we talk, since the (EU) accession process (with the Cypriot
government) is continuing? If they insist too much we shall bring
back to the foreground integration with Turkey," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has hardened his stance on Cyprus issue following the
European Union (EU)'s decision to start accession talks with the
Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in November 1983, only recognized by
Turkey.

<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (EB), which has been
considered a disease of the past, emerged again as a major public
health threat and has been declared a global emergency, a World
Health Organisation (WHO) official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at a meeting marking the World TB Day
in Harare, WHO regional representative in Zimbabwe, Levon
Arevshatian said, ''It is estimated that TB kills some three
million people per year, representing more than five percent
deaths globally,'' the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said although TB largely affected poor people, it was also
growing in industrialised countries.
</P>
<P>
''It is now recognised that there is a strong relationship
between TB and HIV infection. HIV damages the immune system and
TB progresses to a life-threatening disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Arevshatian encouraged TB sufferers not to stop their
treatment once it started.

<HEADLINE> EU Plans Action against French Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Commission
Tuesday planned action against the French organizers of the 1998
World Cup for rejecting demands to sell all remaining tickets
outside France.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, commissioner in charge of market competition,
said the commission had to take a last-minute decision on sending
France a letter of warning prior to taking the action it was
planning.
</P>
<P>
A fine of up to 10 percent of the turnover from what the
commissioner described as wrongly-sole tickets was among a couple
of measures the commission was planning.
</P>
<P>
But Van Miert said that it was impossible now to calculate the
number of the wrongly-sold tickets.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also did not rule out the possiblity of taking
the French organizers to the European court of justice in that he
argued selling the remaining tickets to French residents only was
a discrimination running against the Article 86 of the EU
cmpetition law.
</P>
<P>
The French organizers have so far received 2 million ticket
request for the 64 games to be played during this year's grand
finale in France.
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining 160,000 tickets, 50,000 have been promised to
the football associations of the European Union nations whereas
the remainder will be sold to French supporters, according to the
organizers' planning.
</P>
<P>
The EU has demanded to sell the remaining tickets on a
first-come-first-serve basis and yet the French organizers did not
heed the demand.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert said that the commission had been promised a final
reply by the French organizers for mid-last week but did not get
any word until late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The French did not even make a sporting gesture by allowing
non-resident supporters to have enve a phone call chance,"said Van
Miert, "It would be fair for others to have some chance at least."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the EU would have respected the
organizers' rules shoule they have accepted the EU proposal and
redressed the issue.

<HEADLINE> Militiamen in Somalia Attack UN Relief Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 24 (Xinhua)-- At least three people were
killed and more than five wounded on Tuesday when heavily armed
militiamen attacked a convoy of food aid in Mogadishu, capital of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses Said that both the deceased and wounded are innocent
civilians caught in the cross fire. The deceased includes a
shopkeeper who tried to flee the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The shooting began when a convoy of more than 40 trucks of
food aid were attacked by unidentified gunmen on ex-21 October
road, said the eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
They said that cross-shooting between the armed escort of the
food aid and the attackers has resulted in the looting of three
lorries from convoy, while the rest are still being protected by
the escort.
</P>
<P>
The food, nearly 570 tons of porridge, lentils and cooking
oil, was on its way to the flooded regions of Southern Somalia
especially to the town of Buale and parts of the Lower Shabelle
region.
</P>
<P>
Food convoy from the World food Program of the United Nations
was halted Tuesday for security reasons, but will proceed to its
destination on Wednesday,said one of the food aid delivering
contractors who remained anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The lawlessness, killing, looting and burglary continue in the
Somali capital and its surrounding areas despite some political
developments among the faction leaders in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the militiamen in the area attributed the
attack to an earlier dispute between the two groups over a
contract for the transportation of the food aid to the flood
stricken regions of southern Somalia. Contract disputes often
lead to armed confrontations between the rival contractors.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Briefs Annan on Israeli Initiative on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai on Tuesday briefed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on his initiative about Israeli unilateral withdrawal from
South Lebanon based on U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after his meeting with Annan,
Mordechai said that it was a "good meeting" and he believed Annan
has gained a "whole idea" on Israel's initiative on a unilateral
Lebanese withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reiterated that Israel urges the Lebanese government
to take responsibility in South Lebanon in the event of Israeli
pullout and fight against militant organizations like the
anti-Israeli Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the Lebanese government and forces protect
the safety of the pro-Israeli forces South Lebanese Army (SLA) if
Israel withdraws from the area. Israel is worried that the SLA,
which is accused by the Lebanese government of collaborating with
Israel, could turn their guns around against Israel if they are
abandoned by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, Israel is ready to withdraw from South
Lebanon. We are in the area of South Lebanon only for one
reason: for the security of northern Israel," he said. Israel has
been fighting a tough guerrilla war against Hezbollah forces in
South Lebanon since 1985, paying a heavy price of annual high
death toll of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with Mordechai, Annan headed directly for
a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai did not disclose what response he got from the
U.N. chief during their one-hour meeting, but he called for help
from all friendly countries led by the United States to solve
the issue of South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He warned that it is better to solve the problem before the
situation in South Lebanon worsens and before it is too late. He
was referring to the possible escalation of the fighting between
Israeli troops and the Hezbollah fighters, which will lead to
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will leave for Washington Wednesday for talks with
U.S. officials in an attempt to win the U.S. support for his
Lebanese withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
Annan is visiting Israel on the last leg of his first Middle
East tour since he took office in January 1997, which has
taken him to Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian
self-rule areas. He has repeatedly stressed that he came to
the region not as a mediator but to learn about the situation in
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel pinned high hope on Annan to play a crucial role in
helping solve the Lebanese problem based on the U.N. resolution
425 that calls for Israeli unconditional withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Annan is to stay in Israel for another day Wednesday to hold
more talks with Israeli leaders before concluding his current
Middle East tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is going to launch a
13.1-million-dollar plan to fight increasing forest fires across
the country before summer, a statement from the Agriculture
Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministry will join hands with the
Interior Ministry to lead this campaign and submit the plan to the
council of ministers for approval.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which is to be partially funded by the French
government, 15 fire-watch stations will be set up and 150 water
storage tanks, three helicopters, a number of fire engines and
communications equipment will be available.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that through the campaign it wants to reduce
the forest fires and increase the percentage of land covered by
forest from an estimated 6 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's statistics, the number of fires
fell from 112 in 1995 to 79 in 1996, but jumped significantly to
127 last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these forest fires were caused by carelessness, the
statement said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A government and business
delegation led by Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin will
leave for China at the weekend for a week-long trade and
investment tour, South Africa Press Association (SAPA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trip is aimed at selling South Africa and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and attracting investment in
the region, ministry spokesman Themba Rubushe said.
</P>
<P>
The focus would be on sectors such as agro-processing,
chemicals, mining and machinery, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the PRC (People's Republic of China) is more
developed than South Africa, there are sectors where South Africa
believes it has an upper hand in mining technology, the banking
industry and energy," Rubushe was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would also discuss the possibility of
establishing a trade and economic joint committee and expect to
sign an agreement on trade, economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations with China on
January 1 opened doors for South Africa to enter the Chinese
market, Rubushe said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's economy was growing at eight percent per year.
Its import was growing by 10 percent and its export by five
percent per year.

<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Remnants of the dislodged military
junta in Sierra Leone and rebel allies have fought back in the
east of the country two weeks after the comeback of the
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing forces took over three towns by Monday, defeating
the pro-government civil defense group known as Kamajors there,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people, including women and children, were killed by
the junta forces, the report said, quoted people fleeing from
that area.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajor commander confirmed that they were repelled from the
area after running out of ammunition during the four days of
battle with the junta forces.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the Kamajors' failure to lack of food and
logistics, adding that they were now regrouping for another
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which seized power in a coup last May, was driven
out of the capital Freetown in mid-February by the west African
peace keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led sub-regional force has vowed to clean up the
remnants of the junta forces and the rebel Revolutionary United
Front. But lack of international assistance has affected its
operations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Stresses Implementation of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said here Tuesday that he will work with Israel and all the
parties concerned to ensure the U.N. Resolution 425 will be
implemented effectively.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Annan told a joint press conference with Netanyahu that
all Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 425 which
calls on Israel to withdraw from South Lebanon, must be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the only way this region must go is to advance
the peace process, adding that he will do whatever he can to
assist pushing this process forward.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel is willing to pull back its troops
from South Lebanon, noting that the Israeli Cabinet will continue
discussions on the issue and make a formal decision.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is currently studying the plan put
forward by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, under which Israel
would withdraw from South Lebanon after getting security
guarantees from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the discussions on the issue will take some
time, but it is the step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Lebanese government is capable of making
independent decisions without Syria, Annan said that there is an
effective Lebanese government and professional Lebanese army,
which are credible.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has been trying to
link any Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon with a comprehensive
accord that would ensure an Israeli pullout from the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Netanyahu also stressed that the U.N.
can encourage concerned parties to make decisions, but only direct
negotiations can lead to agreements. He denied that there was
some special withdrawal plan that Mordechai had sent to Annan.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Netanyahu stressed that
every inch territory in the West Bank is tied to Israeli
national interests, and Israel could only carry out the second
redeployment without endangering its security.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the land of the West Bank is also important to
the Palestinians and the U.N. will help the Palestinians fulfill
their commitments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses U.S.-African Trade Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pledged Tuesday to enact Africa trade bill which had been passed
by the U.S. Congress on March 11, according to a release from
Uganda presidential office.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni,
Clinton said he would seek support from multi-national financial
institutions for crucial development sectors in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under the African trade bill, the total sub-Saharan Africa can
export up to 1.3 billion Dollars of textiles annually to the U.S.
up to 2005. The amount consists of two percent of U.S. textile
import a year.
</P>
<P>
Museveni hailed the U.S. African trade bill as a positive step
in the right direction in the improvement of African access to
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Ugandan president also briefed Clinton
on the democratization and governance in Uganda as well as the
country's economic performance with a growth rate of 6.5 percent
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He assured Clinton of Uganda's commitment to regional
stability, cooperation and integration, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also asked Clinton to support Africa in its efforts
to attract private businessmen to invest in Africa's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
William Daley, the U.S. Secretary of State for Commerce who
was present at the meeting, expressed appreciation over
Museveni's effort to invite investors to Uganda, pledging that
Clinton's visit to Africa would lead to have interest in
investing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Daley called for the establishment of a technology transfer
center in Uganda. According to him, the United States is
interested in developing air communication in Uganda as an
important aspect of the development of non-traditional export
products.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, U.S. investment in Uganda is centered on
non-agriculture sectors including tourism, mining and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here early Tuesday morning for a two-day
official visit to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the first sitting U.S. president to visit Africa in
two decades, is scheduled to attend a summit Wednesday with 10
regional leaders on peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the second leg of his six-nation African tour, which
will also take him to Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Privatize National Bank of Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to
privatize the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) by October, the
bank's public relation manager Ngalimecha Ngahiyoma said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) has already
started handling procedures and looking into the best way to
privatize the bank, Ngahiyoma told reporters in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said the P.A. Consultants of the United Kingdom who are
engaged in operational matters, Dar es Salaam-based Advocate
company that is responsible for legal matters, and Messers
Masteller of the United States that is in charge of public
relations, have almost completed their missions.
</P>
<P>
Messers Price Water House of the United Kingdom still retains
some officials at the NBC head office but their mission will end
up soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Matters of privatization of the NBC are being handled by
Andrew Chenge, the attorney general, who said advisory ideas will
be forwarded to higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to 1996/97 review and the action plan for 1997/98 of
PSRC, the National Micro Financing Bank will also be privatized
by June this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Increase in Trade with Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has recorded increasing
trade with Brazil, with a favorable balance of 311 million U.S.
Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Nigeria exported 560 million Dollars'
worth of goods to Brazil last year and imported products valued
at 249 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure also represents a sharp contrast to that of
bilateral trade in 1996, when Nigeria's imports reached 275
million Dollars and exports at 253 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, crude oil, animal hides and skins, cashew nuts and
natural rubber constituted Nigeria's main export products to
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil accounted for about 98.6 percent of Nigeria's
exports to the south American country, the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries recorded the same trade volume of 528
million Dollars in both 1995 and 1996. But while Nigeria
benefited a favorable balance of 40 million Dollars in 1995, it
posted a deficit of 22 million the following year.

<HEADLINE> Insurgents Free 5 Nuns in Northwest Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Five of the seven nuns who were
abducted Sunday night in Rwanda's northwestern Gisenyi prefecture
by armed Hutu "Interahamwe" militiamen have been released,
official sources in the prefecture said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The five released are Rwandese, the Spaniards are still held
at an unknown location," the office of the Episcopal Conference
of Rwanda (CER) told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The CER office, however, declared that it did not have any
clue about the two Spanish sisters who are still in captivity,
the RNA said in a special dispatch to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
There has been no details about the circumstances in which the
five Rwandan nuns were set free.
</P>
<P>
The seven nuns were abducted Sunday night at Kivumu parish, 10
km southwewt of Gisenyi town, near the border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) by suspected armed "Interahamwe" militia.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Gisenyi have indicated that the gang that
abducted the nuns came from neighboring Kanama commune, which is
considered a hotbed of the die-hard Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen reportedly burnt two vehicles, looted the
health center where the nuns were working, and killed seven
people.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen also killed eight people, including two local
government officials.
</P>
<P>
There has been rampant insecurity in northwest Rwanda which is
blamed on Hutu extremists who stand accused of the 1994 genocide
of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams British Allegation of Flooding West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday slammed British
allegation that it has tried to flood Britain with the lethal
anthrax bottles disguised as duty-free goods should the country
be under military attack by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that "an all ports warning" was issued by the
British Home Office on the prime minister's orders.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the British allegations, an Iraqi official
spokesman said that Britain which admitted last Monday its forces
used depleted uranium missiles against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War
is trying today to mislead the public opinion with its
fabrications that Iraq has biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are ridiculous, unfounded and a product of
a diseased mentality," Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has become typical of Britain and its officials to
fabricate lies against Iraq from time to time in order to appease
the United States in its attempt to prolong the sanctions against
Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such claims and falsities could no longer fool anyone as
they lack wisdom, logic and reason," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted after U.N. inspectors
verify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had threatened to launch military strike
against Iraq to force entry into Iraqi presidential palaces for
U.N. inspectors. The crisis was defused by an agreement worked out
by U.N. chief Kofi Annan a month ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has given up efforts to win
the approval of the U.N. Sanctions Committee to fly 22,000 Iraqis
to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to make a pilgrimage early next month, the
Iraqi News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon said in a
letter sent to the committee recently that there was "no longer
any practical usefulness in continuing the discussions of this
matter," because it was too late.
</P>
<P>
He said that since March 23 was the deadline set by Saudi
Arabia for Iraq to notify whether the pilgrims would go by air,
Iraqi pilgrims had no other choice than taking the land route this
year.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon expressed hope that "beginning from next year Iraqi
pilgrims will be able to perform the rites of their religion
without restrictions."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf put forward the
request to let Iraqi pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia by air in a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on January 11.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee has approved to allocate each
Iraqi pilgrim 2,000 U.S. dollars from the proceeds earned by Iraq
under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to sell a
limited amount of oil in every six months to afford humanitarian
needs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban flights to and from Iraq and
oil exports, its main revenue earner.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Aid Programs for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday proclaimed three new initiatives for improving
African children's education, nutrition and health during a
speech at a school in Mukono District, central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The United States will provide about 120 million U.S. Dollars
in 1998 and 1999 to fund for African Education Initiative which
consists of community resource centers, public-private
partnerships and educating and empowering girls in Africa,
Clinton said at Kisowera Primary School in the district.
</P>
<P>
He explained that community resource centers will provide
education materials and serve as bases to improve local teacher
preparation and training for out-of-school youths.
</P>
<P>
School-to-school partnerships between the United States and
Africa, as well as among African schools will also be promoted,
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. president, the education initiative will
fund partnerships between U.S. and African government
institutions and among African government institutions and civil
society organizations.
</P>
<P>
Securing Better Nutrition Initiative, Clinton said, is
designed to assist African countries to strengthen and protect
agriculture and food security in a number of key areas.
</P>
<P>
Implementing this initiative, the American government will
supply 61 million Dollars in the first two years and the fund
will be channeled to the appropriate government and private
sector organizations, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Also announced Tuesday was the Infectious Disease Initiative
for Africa, for which the U.S. will grant 16 million Dollars in
the ongoing financial year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Clinton claimed that these initiatives are designed to
underscore the new U.S.-African partnership.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the partnership, Susan Rice, the Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs, said on a U.S.
Information Agency World-net TV broadcast on March 19 that it is
suitable to the needs of both Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here early Tuesday morning for a two-day

<HEADLINE> Deported Aliens Could Face Longer Sentences on Re-Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court Tuesday made
it easier to impose longer prison sentences on some aliens who
illegally re-enter the United States after being deported.
</P>
<P>
In a 5-4 ruling, the court said aliens who were convicted of a
crime before being deported can be given a longer sentence upon
re-entry even if the previous conviction is not charged and proven
in a new trial.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld a seven-year, one-month prison sentence
ordered for a Mexican citizen, who pleaded guilty in Fort Worth,
Texas, to illegally re-entering the United States in 1995 after
having been deported three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Federal law sets a maximum two-year sentence for most people
who re-enter illegally after a previous deportation. But another
section of the law allows longer prison terms for those who were
convicted of a crime before their deportation.
</P>
<P>
As Almendarez-Torres had been convicted of burglary three times
before his 1992 deportation, he was given the longer prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
He appealed, saying prosecutors did not charge him with having
previously been convicted of a crime. He said prosecutors must
charge and prove such convictions beyond a reasonable doubt before
a sentence of more than two years can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument,
and Tuesday's decision upheld the appeals court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Extend State of Emergency in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey decided on Tuesday to
extend the state of emergency in southeastern Turkey for another
four months starting on March 30 in a bid to fight against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Six provinces, namely, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Siirt, Sirnak,
Tunceli and Van, are under the extended emergency rule. The
extension was proposed by the Prime Ministry and approved by the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Emergency rule has been imposed in Turkey's nine southeastern
provinces since 1987, giving soldiers and police more extensive
powers of arrest and detention in the fight against the PKK. Last
October, three provinces were excluded from the list.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting an almost 14-year-old separatist war
for autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed
more than 28,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 to 3,000 PKK militants, who have sheltered
themselves in northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, often cross
into Turkey from northern Iraq and attack military and civilian
targets in the country.

<HEADLINE> Another Evaluation Meeting on Iraq's Chemical File </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz agreed on Tuesday that another technical evaluation meeting
on Iraq's chemical file will be held soon, UNSCOM spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zlauvinen Gustavo told Xinhua that Butler and Aziz held their
third and final round of talks Tuesday and discussed the outcome
of the technical evaluation meetings held early February.
</P>
<P>
The previous two rounds of talks were held Monday.
</P>
<P>
Technical evaluation meetings, which are intended to iron out
the differences between the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) and Iraq, have achieved much progress in files of missile
warheads and chemical agent VX.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo said that another technical evaluation meeting will
focus on VX and its production facilities.
</P>
<P>
Butler did not discuss with Aziz the inspection of Iraq's eight
presidential sites as they will be inspected by a special group
headed by Commissioner Jinayatha Dhanapala, Gustavo said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed last month by the U.N. chief Kofi
Annan and Aziz, Iraq will open the presidential compounds to the
group comprising senior diplomats and experts from the UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
But according to the timetable of Butler, who arrived here last
Sunday on a five-day visit, he will discuss the inspection of the
presidential sites with Dhanapala on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Butler told reporters upon his arrival that there are 1,058
buildings in the presidential sites, and the inspections "will not
take a long time."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range
missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons before the
U.N. can lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Yeltsin Dismisses Government, Aims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed his entier government Monday, firing his loyal Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, immediately after returning to work
in the Kremlin at the end of a week recovery from a throat
infection.
</P>
<P>
This seems to have happened all of a sudden, but the new task
for Chernomyrdin and the quick nomination by the president of the
acting prime minister and acting interior minister have indicated
mature deliberation.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the dismissal was in preparation for the 2000
presidential elections. "The presidential elections of 2000 are of
primary importance to us. The fate of the country is at stake,"
Yeltsin stressed while announcing the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The traces are evident. Neither the president nor fired Premier
Chernomyrdin and First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais
expressed regret over the dismissal. Chernomyrdin said this is a
natural process of a renewal of authority. He disclosed that it
was his decision to tender resignation and to concentrate on
preparations for the 2000 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"Slightly over two years are to go before the presidential
elections. I can't remain indifferent to the future of the
country," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's decision was "strongly supported" by the
president, who announced Monday that the resigned prime minister
must "concentrate on political preparations" for the 2000
presidential elections. Meanwhile, Yeltsin awarded his trusted
premier a second class order "for services to the fatherland."
</P>
<P>
Chubais was even satisfied with his discharge, saying, "I'm
glad that the president has granted my request for quitting the
government service with which I addressed him last month."
</P>
<P>
According to Chubais, the decision taken by the president to
dismiss the Cabinet has been prepared long. He said that he will
still be in the team of Yeltsin no matter in which capacity and
where he works.
</P>
<P>
Soon after announcing the dismissal of the government, Yeltsin,
on the same day, appointed 35-year-old Sergei Kiriyenko, the
former fuel and energy minister, acting prime minister and Pavel
Maslov, the former first deputy interior minister and chief of
staff of the Interior Ministry, acting interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has repeatedly criticized the government's ministers
for failure to pay pensions and wages on time. The president in
his state-of-the-nation speech on February 17 said that if the
wages and pensions payment -- one of the top priorities -- wasn't
fulfilled, "we will have a new government."
</P>
<P>
The firings were "an effort to bring more energy and efficiency
to economic reforms, to give them additional impetus," said
Yeltsin after the government was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The "key social problems" might seriously shake the government
and then the presidential throne so that the political and
economic orientation held by the Russian leadership would be
altered.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the Trade Union and the Communist Party are
preparing a nationwide protest to place a no-confidence motion
before the government.
</P>
<P>
Leader Gennady Zyuganov, knowing the government's dismissal,
said that if the government had not resigned, the trade union and
the left-initiated protest actions scheduled for April 9 would
take its resignation as their main slogan.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov, during an
all-Russia action of protest set for April 9, "most working people
would have demanded the resignation of the government."
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, it was wise for Yeltsin to dismiss the government
ahead of time, and with the situation developing, there will be a
possibility of dismissing the Communists-dominated State Duma. If
it failed to approve a new prime minister for three times running,
new parliament elections would be held. Then, it might be easier
to win the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of the president's plan remain a mystery
as to whom Yeltsin wants to run for the presidency in the 2000.
Chernomyrdin remarked he had not decided about the presidential
run.

<HEADLINE> Former FBI Agent Claims Possession of Documents on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A former Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent who impounded James Earl Ray's car after the
1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
said Tuesday he kept two slips of paper from the car that may
bolster Ray's claim of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Donald Wilson discussed the documents Tuesday with District
Attorney Paul Howard of Fulton County, Georgia, and later told
reporters he wanted to give them directly to U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Wilson, then an agent with the FBI office in Atlanta, was one
of the two agents who impounded Ray's white Ford Mustang at an
Atlanta housing project on April 10, 1968, six days after King was
assassinated in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday that one of
the papers he found is an itemized list of names, locations and
figures that appear to be dollar amounts. At the bottom, the
figure 450,000.00 is written along with a date and a word that
appears to be Raul.
</P>
<P>
The other contains a telephone number and the name Raul, the
newspaper said. The newspaper did not give any of the other names.
</P>
<P>
Ray, who pleaded guilty in 1969 but then recanted and has been
seeking a trial ever since, has claimed he was set up by a shadowy
gunrunner he knew only as Raoul. No independent evidees in the Chicago area, sai
d he had the original
documents in a vault there.
</P>
<P>
The Journal-Constitution said Wilson did not pass the documents
to his superiors in 1968 because he did not believe they were
conducting a serious investigation and did not trust them. He said
he decided last year to share them with King's relatives, who are
supporting Ray's efforts to win a trial.
</P>
<P>
Wilson was accompanied to the courthouse by William Pepper, an
attorney trying to win a trial for Ray. Pepper said he urged
Wilson to come forward now because Ray is seriously ill from liver
disease and may not live much longer.
</P>
<P>
Cartha DeLoach, who was assistant to FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover in 1968, said he was not aware of Wilson's evidence.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very seriously that is true," he told the newspaper
from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where he lives.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Expert Arrest Shows Iraqi Attempt to Hide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Tuesday that the arrest of an Iraqi biological weapons
expert by the Iraq government indicated Iraq's attempt to hide
weapons information.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iraqi scientist Nassir
Hindawi was arrested because he had planned to defect.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon as
saying that Nassir Hindawi, one of the founders of the Iraqi germ
warfare program, was in an Iraqi prison after he was found with
documents relating to the country's biological weapons program and
evidence that he was about to leave Iraq illegally.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Iraq's step to arrest Nassir Hindawi might be
further evidence "that there is an attempt on the part of (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein to continue to hide and prevent UNSCOM
inspectors from receiving information that would help them in
their business."
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who spoke to reporters at the Pentagon, said the Iraqi
action could make it even more difficult for Iraq to convince the
United Nations of its full compliance with weapons inspections and
to win a lifting of sanctions imposed after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Iraq must provide not only claims but concrete
evidence that Iraq has ended a program to develop chemical and
biological weapons before U.N. sanctions against Iraq are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Cohen declined to say whether U.S. intelligence organizations
had assisted the Iraqi expert in his attempt to leave his country.

Neither would he comment on whether the arrest of "this
particular individual would be an intelligency loss to the United
States."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Receives Compensation Money for Loss in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 170 million
U.S. dollars of compensation money has been transferred to Kuwait
from the United Nations Compensations Commission (UNCC) for loss
during the Gulf crisis from 1990 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and State Minister for Cabinet
Affairs Nasser Abdallah Al-Roudhan said Wednesday that the money
would be used to cover compensation due to the third group of
claimants under categories A and C.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Public Authority for the Assessment of
Compensations (PAAC) would transfer the money to the bank accounts
of those entitled as specified in the applications submitted by
them earlier, he added.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries would be the third batch of claimants under
category A who left Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion of the
country in 1990 and category C whose individual loss caused by the
Gulf War in 1991 was below 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan said payment would start after coordination with
the parties concerned, but he did not give the number of people to
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the second batch of a total of 224,841
claimants, among them 42,148 Kuwaitis, were benefited from a 105
million dollars compensation out of a total of 596 million dollars
compensation funds set aside from Iraq's oil exports revenues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait received the first batch of compensation money, about
123 million dollars, from the UNCC for its categories A and C
claimants at the start of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The money was obtained after Iraq started selling oil under the
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal, which allowed it to sell 2 billion
dollars worth of oil over six months for humanitarian purpose.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the Iraqi oil sales proceeds was paid into
the compensation fund run by the Geneva-based U.N. Compensation
Commission which in turn transferred the money to Kuwaiti as well
as other claimants.
</P>
<P>
So far Iraq has provided about 1.2 billion dollars to the
U.N. compensation fund under the deal.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 men and women from 78 countries were
demanding a total of 3.2 billion dollars in compensation stemming
mainly from lost wages, damages and injures.
</P>
<P>
As to the whole compensation demands, Kuwait alone had filed
claims totaling 130 billion dollars, including the costs of
extinguishing oil well fires that had been set by Iraqi troops
before a U.S.-led military coalition chased them out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Corporations from around the world were seeking another 80
billion dollars in compensation.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations set by the commission, the claims were
divided into six categories.

Hariri's visit will serve to promote the existing cooperation
between the EU and Lebanon and seek financial contributions to the
country's reconstruction projects, observers said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chronic Diseases: Biggest Killer in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- About 13,000 people are killed
every day in China by cardiovascular and cerebral diseases,
cancers and diabetes, the Chinese Ministry of Health announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The illnesses, defined as "non-infectious chronic diseases",
have become the biggest killer in the country, causing 70 percent
of its total death cases, the ministry said in a report.
</P>
<P>
"China has at least 90 million hypertension patients, 20
million diabetes patients and six million sufferers of
stroke. Cancer cases are increasing by 1.6 million a year," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Incidence rates of the diseases in urban and rural areas were
28.6 percent and 13 percent respectively, a rise of 14 percent and
44 percent over the levels of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that medical expenditures would surpass 120
billion yuan (14.4 billion US dollars) by the year 2000, compared
with 41.9 billion yuan (five billion dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
They blamed the rapid epidemic of the diseases on
hereditary reasons, environmental pollution, some
improper life styles and behaviors, such as smoking, excessive
drinking, and the lack of physical exercises.

<HEADLINE> Romania Hopes to Gain More From Trade With Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Romanian businessmen are
scrutinizing Asian markets in the hope of boosting trade with the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong political willingness to strengthen
relations with the Asian countries", said Nicu Manolache, who is
in charge of Asian affairs in the Romanian Ministry of Industry
and Trade.
</P>
<P>
"Asia could become Romania's most important commercial partner
and offer it a solution for boosting its export trade", he said in
the latest Economic Truth weekly.
</P>
<P>
Manolache admitted that the Asian financial troubles have
stripped Romanian products of a sustainable market and that many
Romanian companies have brought their production to a halt to
reduce further losses.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of this, he noted, Romania scored a noticeable
rise in trade with Indonesia, with exports totalling 53 million
U.S. dollars in 1997, up from 16 million dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Chemical products, bearings, machinery, chassis, tractors and
Dacia-brand cars all contribute to Romanian export trade with
Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Several Romanian companies have entered partnerships with the
Japanese to engineer projects for building cement and glass mills
in Pakistan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Government also plans to strengthen cooperation
with Hanoi authorities by setting in place a refinery in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to gain at least 10 percent more from our trade with
Asia, which compels us to diversify", Manolache said, citing that
wine, furniture and paper as new products bound for Asian
markets.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Meets Again to Mull Solutions to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the six-nation
Contact Group met Wednesday in Bonn trying to seek new approaches
to end the conflict in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in Bonn, the meeting has a main
objective to urge the federal Yugoslav leadership, not just
Serbia, to begin a political dialogue with Kosovo Albanians on the
future status of the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks have been overshadowed by difference in
opinions among the Contact Group members consisting of Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proposes to
tighten sanctions on Belgrade, most other group members is said to
favor "maintaining pressure" on Belgrade to enter talks.
</P>
<P>
Although some economic and diplomatic sanctions were already
decided at the Contact Group's last meeting in London on March 9,
Russia disagrees to go ahead with them for reasons that Belgrade
has already made some progress to meet the demands raised by the
London meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Bonn meeting, Albright and her Russian
counterpart Yevgeni Primakov met in Cologne Tuesday evening trying
to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also held separate talks
with Albright and Primakov earlier Wednesday to prepare for the
group's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is also due to hold consultations on the same
day in Bonn with foreign ministers from eight nations in the
neighborhood of Yugoslavia to discuss how to maintain stability in
the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Kosovo Albanians gathered meanwhile also gathered
in Bonn to protest what they called "the police terror" in renewed
fightings in Kosovo on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 11 EU Member States Recommended for EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
recommended 11 European Union member states for the founding of
the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made during a special meeting of the
European Parliament, to which the commission, the executive body
of the 15-nation union, presented its report on economic
convergence.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland were recommended as
having met the necessary conditions to adopt the single currency,
the Euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Britain, serving the six-month rotating presidency of the
union, and Denmark exercised their right under the Maastricht
Treaty to opt out of the first wave for the Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) while Greece and Sweden were judged by the commission
not economically ready to join.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the final stage of EMU, European Union member
states must attain a high degree of sustainable economic
convergence.
</P>
<P>
Progress is measured against key criteria covering inflation,
government deficit and debt, exchange rate stability and long-term
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Member states must also meet other conditions such as central
bank independence.
</P>
<P>
The commission already adopted the recommendation of the 11
countries on the initiative of Commission President Jacques Santer
and Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy who is responsible for EU
economic, monetary and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The European Union heads of state and government will confirm
the list of the first-wave of EMU countries on May 2 during their
summit for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Their confirmation will be made on the basis of the
commission's recommendation and its convergence report along with
another convergence report prepared by the European Monetary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be taken on a recommendation from the
EU Council of Economy and Finance Ministers after consulting the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
When the 11 recommended countries are confirmed for
participation by the EU summit in Brussels, this will create a
Euro-zone with nearly 300 million inhabitants accounting for 19.4
percent of world gross domestic product (GDP) and 18.6 percent of
world trade.
</P>
<P>
This compares with 19.6 percent of world GDP and 16.6 percent
of world trade for the United States and 7.7 percent of world GDP
and 8.2 percent of world trade for Japan.

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday announced its recommendation of 11 European Union member
states as likely founder countries of the single currency.

Britain, which is serving the six-month rotating presidency of
the union, together with Denmark opted out of the first wave for
the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) while Greece and Sweden were
judged by the commission as not economically ready.
</P>
<P>
Commission President Jacques Santer described the announcement
as something impossible to think of a year ago while Yves-Thibault
de Silguy, commissioner responsible for economic, monetary and
financial affairs, said that the announcement of the list was not
the result of coincidence but results of political will and hard
work for the past few years.

head of the future European central bank and fill the seats on its
executive committee as well.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: EMU Convergence Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union defined five
key criteria for the economic convergence for Economic and
Monetary Union at its Maastricht summit in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
The criteria are: inflation; budget deficit as against gross
domestic product (GDP); public debt as against GDP; exchange rate
stability; and long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The reference values for each criterion, except for deficit and
debt, is calculated in accordance with certain formula.
</P>
<P>
The criterion for inflation or price stability is calculated by
adding to the average of the three EU member states with lowest
figures two percentage points. The current reference value for this
category is 2.7 percent for January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty has laid down a constant
three-percent-of-GDP target for budget deficit and a constant
60-percent-of-GDP ratio for public debt.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has devised an average currency for the
purpose of reviewing exchange rate stability. The average is the
one that may be found at any time in the middle of the fluctuating
band that can vary over time.
</P>
<P>
All currencies except for Irish punt have fluctuated within a
band of 2.25 percent either side of the parity throughout the
EU-designated consideration period from March 1996 to February
1998.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Sweden are not taking part in the exchange rate
mechanism of the European monetary system.
</P>
<P>
The reference level for long-term interest rates cannot be two
percent more than the average inflation rate achieved by the three
best-performing EU countries. This criteria is set at 7.8
percent for January this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Speaker Accuses U.N. of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Dan Tichon accused the United Nations of adopting a
hostile policy towards Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Knesset special session organized for visiting
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Tichon said that the U.N. has
taken a biased hostile approach towards Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has never agreed to the establishment of
the Jewish state," Tichon said, adding that "the United
Nations did not play its role in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Tichon was the first Israeli politician to criticize the United
Nations during Annan's current visit to Israel. The attack caused
angry responses from the Knesset opposition members who charged
that Tichon has humiliated Annan in public.
</P>
<P>
Tichon's remarks reflected Israel's angry towards the U.N.'s
criticism of Israel's settlement activities in the occupied
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly on March 17 voted 120-3 a resolution
condemning Israeli settlement activities in the occupied
Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Annan later told reporters that he would ask Israel to change
its hostile attitude towards the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"I will reply to Tichon's remarks later in the evening in my
press conference, but I would like to point out that Israel must
learn how to make rooms for the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In today's interdependent world, without making rooms for the
others, there will be nothing," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel must open its mind to the relationship
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here on Tuesday from Gaza for a three-day visit
and had already held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on how to move
the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's current Middle East tour has taken him to
Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> French LDP Leader Calls for Leaders to Quit Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The President of France's Liberal
Democratic Party has called on five right-wing politicians to
resign from regional council presidencies they won with votes from
the far-right National Front (FN) party.
</P>
<P>
Alain Madelin said Wednesday that the five presidents, all from
the centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), should resign
because they cannot govern "with efficiency and serenity".
</P>
<P>
The regional presidents risk being hostage to the FN, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Madelin made the call after refusing to sign an ultimatum on
Tuesday by UDF leadership to the five regional leaders, which
threatened to expulsion from the party if they did not resign.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democratic Party, established by Madelin after the
failure of the right-wing parties in the legislative elections
last year, continues to be an affiliate party of the UDF.
</P>
<P>
All the UDF politicians elected as council presidents,
including former Defense Minister Charles Millon who was
re-elected to the presidency of the major industrial base of
Rhone-Alpes, are very close with Madelin, a rising star in the
French right-wing.
</P>
<P>
Madelin, who served as finance minister under the government
of Edouard Balladur, sent his congratulations after Jacques Blanc
became the first right-wing politician to be elected regional
president of the southern Rousillon-Languedoc region with FN votes
last Friday.

<HEADLINE> EU Nations Urged to Continue Fiscal Austerity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Monetary Institute
(EMI) on Wednesday urged EU nations recommended for the single
European currency next year to continue their fiscal austerity in
order to ensure a strong Euro.
</P>
<P>
"Despite recent success, further intensive fiscal consolidation
is required in almost all member states," said the EMI in a report
on the Euro candidacy presented Wednesday in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The EMI report followed another issued by the European
Commission in Brussels earlier Wednesday which recommended 11 EU
countries for next year's launch of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The list includes all EU members except Greece, which is far
from reaching the fiscal standards required by the Maastricht
Treaty for Euro membership, and Denmark, Britain and Sweden, who
all opted not to join the Euro in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
The EMI, which is the frontrunner for the planned European
Central Bank, also expressed particular worry about the fiscal
fitness of Italy and Belgium, noting that their high debt levels
were "a cause for concern".
</P>
<P>
Italy and Belgium had national debts of over 120 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) last year, more than double the
60 percent limit set by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The EMI said that in order to cut their debt levels, Italy
would have to start showing significant and sustained budget
surpluses while Belgium should have to achieve a budget surplus of
at least six percent of GDP every year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U. S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed regret for the role of
the United States in African slavery, but stopped well short of
the formal apology that some in the United States had urged.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel sent President
Clinton a compromise offer on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. Under the plan, which follows months of stalemate and
pressure by the Clinton Administration, Israel would cede more
land it was willing to give up in the past, and it would offer the
Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, more adjacent land.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A sober forum on the issue of racial stereotyping turned
into a raucous protest in Denver Tuesday after President Clinton's
race advisory commision came under attack for not including
Native Americans on its board.
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the Pentagon's missile defense effort said
Tuesday he had ordered a review of all programs after an
independent report warned of a "rush to failure" in plans to
create systems intended to protect the United States and American
troops abroad from missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- OPEC oil ministers plan a meeting to endorse temporary
reductions in output, but some industry experts believe that the
supply cuts will prove to be far smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
-- Smoking costs the U.S. about 130 billion U.S. dollars a year
in shortened working lives and added health-care spending, says a
new Treasury analysis that is part of a White House effort to push
tobacco legislation through Congress.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Asia Striving to Control Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South Asia, a region most
vulnerable to the attack of tuberculosis (TB) in the world, is
striving to get rid of the scourge, where the seven countries have
all identified TB control as a priority area.
</P>
<P>
According to the estimates by the World Health Organization
(WHO), more than three million new TB cases occur in this region
every year with an annual death of one million patients.
</P>
<P>
And 40 percent of the 1.2 billion population in the region, one
of the poorest in the world, is infected with TB bacillus.
</P>
<P>
This situation will worsen further with the emergence of TB/HIV
co-infection and multi-drug resistant TB, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind the huge burden of TB, the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been according a
high priority to TB control and established the SAARC Tuberculosis
Center in 1992 in Bhaktapur, one of the three cities in the
Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the center is to work toward prevention
and control of TB in the region by coordinating the efforts of the
national TB programs of the member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The center collects, analyzes and disseminates all relevant
information regarding the latest development and findings in the
field of TB in the region and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It also conducts survey, research and training programs for the
purpose of TB control and strive for adequate supply at low cost
of anti-TB drugs and other related supplies in all the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to cure 85 percent of the cured at least and
find out 70 percent of the existing cases, and of course to
implement DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) in each
level everywhere," said Dr. Dirgh Singh Bam, the center's
director.
</P>
<P>
DOTS now is proved the most effective means to control TB, he
said, adding that it is being implemented in all the seven SAARC
member countries though in limited areas.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of DOTS along with national TB programs and
political commitment in the member countries and a cure rate of
more than 85 percent were listed by Dr. Prablad Kumar, deputy
director of the center, as the three achievements made in the
region in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kumar attributed the high incidence of TB cases in the
region to overpopulation, high illiteracy rate, poverty and poor
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
He said in efforts to fight TB, the SAARC TB Center has
developed cooperation with the WHO and the International Union
Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, a non-governmental
organization based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said the biggest problem facing the region is the dropout of
patients. He explained that the DOTS required a long duration, but
when they feel better, some patients discontinue the treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to change the behavior of the patients by
strengthening the information, education and communication
system," he said. "Literacy rate is not very high in the region."
</P>
<P>
But he said the rate of dropout has dropped from 50 percent to
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Practical measures, strong commitment of governments, good
training system, good logistic system, and monitoring and
supervision system are all necessary for effective control of TB,
Dr. Bam added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the region there are many big countries and so
many problems including political problems, so the SAARC has set
no deadline for wiping out TB from the region. "It's very
difficult," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Venezuelan Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian met today with Raul Salazar, chairman of the Venezuelan
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the two countries share many things in common and are
free of conflicts concerning fundamental interests. He noted that
the two nations pursue independent foreign policies of peace,
cherish a peaceful international environment, and propose a
multipolar world.
</P>
<P>
The similarities have enabled the two countries and their
citizens to establish close contacts, said Chi, who also serves as
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and State
councilor.
</P>
<P>
He noted the smooth development of bilateral ties since the
establishment of diplomatic relations some 20-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the exchange of visits between leaders of the two
nations and their armed forces has greatly promoted bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>

military-to-military relations to a new plateau.
</P>
<P>
Chi also expressed appreciation for Venezuela's adherence to
the "one China" policy, and briefed Salazar on the first session
of the Ninth National People's Congress, as well as China's
defense policy.
</P>
<P>

citizens firmly believe their country can learn from China's long
history.
</P>
<P>
Salazar also praised the high quality of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), and expressed confidence that the
Chinese army will achieve even greater progress.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Venezuelan government attaches great
importance to developing relations with China, and that the
Venezuelan armed forces hope to establish even closer ties with
the PLA.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is to expand its oil
exploration area this year, the official newspaper People's Right
quoted an oil official as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official from the Oil Management Agency, 1998
would see a big rise in foreign investment on Mongolia's oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts will explore 11 zones, covering a total area of
155,596 cubic kilometers.
</P>
<P>
He said Mongolia was not ready to build an oil refinery because
its oil exploration and exportation were still in their primary
stages.
</P>
<P>
It would consider a refinery when the reserved oil resources
were finalized and oil output increased to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
He said exports to China were going smoothly since they started
last month.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary oil reserves of the country are set at about 400
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Optimistic Outlook for 1998 Exports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Zhou Zongmin and Wang Weiping
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Opportunities provided by the
ongoing financial crisis in Southeast Asia far outweigh challenges
China faces in boosting exports.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of tangible measures will ensure bright
prospects for the export trade," said Zhao Jinping, a
professor with the State Council Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that priority should be placed on optimizing the
export commodity structure, expanding exchanges with traditional
customers, especially those in European and American countries,
and developing new markets in Latin America, the Middle East and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
East Asia and Southeast Asia are regarded as major export
markets for China, with exports to the regions accounting for more
than 30 percent of the annual total.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis which has engulfed Southeast Asia since
July last year and accompanying currency devaluations have created
tense financial conditions and economic difficulties causing many
countries to limit imports and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yanfen, a researcher from the International
Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute, notes that China shares
similar export structures with many countries affected by the
crisis. China will thus face fierce competition in terms of export
markets.
</P>
<P>
Declining worldwide economic growth represents yet another
negative element affecting China's exports, and China must adopt
flexible industrial, product and enterprise development policies
to offset the adverse influences, according to Zhang Hanlin, a
professor with the University of International Business and
Economics.
</P>
<P>
Export trade is a major factor for China's economic growth. It
added two percentage points to China's GDP growth last
year. Therefore, experts say, the performance of export trade will
be an important factor for China to achieve the eight-percent
economic growth rate set for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Optimistic Outlook for 1998 Exports (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Zhou Zongmin and Wang Weiping
</P>
<P>
China was one of the world's top ten trading nations in
1997, with the total import-export volume of 325 billion US dollars,
including exports of 182.7 billion US dollars, up 21 percent on
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 target has been set 345 billion US dollars, an
increase of 20 billion dollars on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Many economists predict that this year's exports will grow by
10 percent, a level which they say is possible despite the
decreasing export growth rate.
</P>
<P>
They point out existing difficulties, but also cite increasing
chances for promoting exports.
</P>
<P>
"Advantages continue to hold a dominant position," said Zhao
Jinping. Firstly, according to Zhao, China's major export markets
will continue to enjoy brisk demands in 1998, with the U.S. economy
expected to grow 2.7 percent and the European economy 2.5
percent. Secondly, Chinese enterprises, in face of sluggish
domestic demands, will continue to increase exports. Thirdly,
relatively low inflation will limit the chances for significant
cost increases for export products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fact that the exchange rate for the Renminbi
will remain relatively stable will enable Chinese entherprises to
increase exports and focus direct investments in areas such as
Latin America and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage which will help expand exports lies in
China's high-quality, low-cost labor force.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already introduced a series of
policies to encourage exports, including increased export
credits and simplified export procedures.
</P>
<P>
The first two months of this year witnessed strong momentum in
export increases, especially to the European and American markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts also note that interest rate reductions for bank
deposits and loans, announced yestherday by the People's Bank of
China, will help enterprises boost exports.  Endithem

<HEADLINE> EU Launches New Policy on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
proposed on Wednesday to hold annual summit meetings with China as
part of a new policy to strengthen relations.
</P>
<P>
The policy outlines summit meetings involving China, the EC
and the EU presidency, and regular meetings of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The new EU-China policy was deemed by EC officials to be a
wide-ranging reappraisal of bilateral relations in view of China's
growing importance on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
EC Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said: "China's growing
economic and political self-confidence is an overwhelming positive
development.
</P>
<P>
"It should serve as an incentive for the European Union to
engage the country more fully, not as a threat from which to
retreat."
</P>
<P>
The EC agreed to elevate EU's political relations with China to
the status accorded to Beijing by the United States, Japan and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The new policy took its form in an EC document entitled
Building a Comprehensive Partnership With China. The document was
approved by the commission in its weekly meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that Europe has everything to gain and nothing to
fear from a strong, open and prosperous China.
</P>
<P>
The key was to ensure the successful and lasting integration of
China as an equal partner in the world economy, coupled with an
active commitment to creating a strong and open civil society, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners also agreed that the scale and speed of
China's economic growth are making the country one of Europe's
major economic partners.
</P>
<P>
The EU, therefore, should assist the process of China's global
integration through a mixture of trade policy and tailored
cooperation initiatives.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that the EU should continue supporting
China's transition to an open society through promoting the rule
of law and strengthening civil society.
</P>
<P>
The EC believed it was necessary to improve the efficiency and
impact of EU funding in China without increasing the budget. The
EU should consider greater involvement of the European Investment
Bank in China.

<HEADLINE> China's World Cup Champion Kicked out of National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Yang Ming
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Yongsheng, winner of the
 men's 50-kilometer event at the 1995 World Cup Walking
Championships, was kicked out of the Chinese national track and
field team and lost his right to compete in this year's Asian
Games after breaking disciplines and rules.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Athletics Management Center, the national governing
body of the sports, made an official announcement here on
Wednsday, saying that Zhao's registeration as an athlete has been
suspended and his right to compete in the 12th Asian Games this
December in Bangkok has been stripped off.
</P>
<P>
CAMC said:" Zhao has refused to compete in any races since last
July. He even skipped the Eighth National Games. Moreover, he
broke the team's disciplines by signing contracts in secret with
three different clubs for higher salary and better fringe benefit."
</P>
<P>
"He even instigated reveral team members to escape from the
team. His actions violated the rules and regulations he should
obey," the announcement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, 28, twice national champion and the Asian record holder,
led most of the race in the 1995 World Championships, but
eventually collapsed with heat exhaustion in the final stage. He
didn't finish the race again in the Olympics last year.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Gao Hongmiao, women's 10 kilometer winner
of the 1995 World Cup Walking Championships, also followed Zhao in
sneaking out of the national team last year to pursuit higher
salary and extra housing. But the 24-year-old Gao has escaped
from the punishment.
</P>
<P>
Zhao told the other side of the story by saying that he left
the team only because his previous coach Wang Kui set up an
international walking club last year. After Wang retired, Zhao
showed his concern for the old man, so he joined him.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the registeration is all about. I didn't
realize that I infringed some regulations. I only heard that if an
athlete quits competition for a whole year, he will be free to go
wheresoever he like, " Zhao argued.
</P>
<P>
In China, an athlete must be registered in the Chinese
Athletics Association. Without it, he or she has no right to
compete in any races both domestic and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's External debt Manageable: Bank Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will be able to
meet its external financial obligations from export earnings
although debt in ringgit terms has increased significantly as a
result of the weakening of the local currency, the State Bank said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's total medium- and long-term external debt at the end
of 1997 was 32.5 billion U.S. dollars or 34.7 percent of gross
national product (GNP) in US dollar terms or 48 percent of GNP in
ringgit terms, which is low by international standards due to the
low external indebtedness of the federal government, the central
bank said in its 1997 annual report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Including the short-term external debt of both the banks and
non-banking private sector, Malaysia's external debt amounted to
42.7 billion U.S. dollars or 45.6 percent of GNP in US dollar
terms or 63.2 percent of GNP in ringgit terms, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's debt service ratio was 5.7 percent in 1997 compared
with 6.1 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The short-term debt, meanwhile, remained small at about 24
percent of total debt, reflecting the low reliance on short-term
borrowing by the non-banking private sector, it said, adding "The
bulk of the short-term debt was borrowing by the commercial banks,
and for the most part was fully hedged against contracts with
their exporting clients."
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1997, total external debt that is due in 1998
would amount to 57.7 billion ringgit or 14.4 billion U.S. dollars,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Mountainous Parts of Southern China Getting Away From Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province has
one of China's seventeen poverty-stricken areas, which is trying to
eliminate poverty completely.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area in the northern part of the province,
mainly near the city of Qingyuan, had a GDP in 1997 that was more
than three times that of a decade ago. Qingyuan now has six pillar
industries in porcelain, building materials, textiles,
electricity, foods, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong established Qingyuan in 1988 from the poorest
counties. By using mountain agriculture, the city has developed
agriculture centers for grains, fruits, and vegetables, and had an
output that was 67.8 percent more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The Qingyuan government has made an effort to develop the
mountain area by improving the investment conditions and the
opening-up policies. By 1997, it increased the length of roads by
2,728 kilometers as compared with 1987 and opened trade relations
with the United States, Japan, and European countries. Exports and
actual foreign investment in 1997 were 38.5 and 78.5 times that of
1987, respectively.
</P>
<P>
It established a poverty-relief zone that was listed by the
State Council as an experimental zone for agriculture reform. By
1997, it had 90 enterprises and eight projects, and 20 townships
established 70 projects, providing 3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
After four years of work, 28,000 buildings and 800 villages for
migrant workers have been built, with an average annual income per
person of 1,380 yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The average GDP of Qingyuan was over 300 US dollars in
1994. Half of the million people living in poverty in Guangdong
escaped poverty by 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Spreading in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide spread of
tuberculosis has hit Vietnam where the number of patients has
jumped by almost four percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients has shot up to more than 73,000 last
year from 70,000 in 1995, according to figures released on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of people infected each year was around
130,000, meaning that half have not been diagnosed and receive no
treatment, said Nguyen Viet Co, director of the Tuberculosis and
Lung Diseases Institute of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Co said the number of patients who could not be cured was also
rising due to their uninformed abuse and overuse of medicines such
as antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Tuberculosis Control Program had been
successful in 1997 in protecting 98 percent of the population from
the disease.
</P>
<P>
But the spread of TB increases in some remote and mountainous
areas with an infection rate of 200 people per 100,000, compared
with the rate of 48 per 100,000 in Hanoi and 93 per 100,000 in Ho
Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had set targets to curb the spread of TB up to the year
2000, added Co. It aimed to cure 85 percent of patients, diagnose
at least 70 percent of those infected, reduce the mortality rate
and prevent the misuse of antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Development Zone in Eastern China to Help Get Rid of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- What was previously the poorest
county in China's Zhejiang Province, Pan'an, has found a better
life with the help of a development zone in the nearby city of
Jinhua.
</P>
<P>
This new method of poverty-eradication focuses on using local
economic potential. Pan'an is in a mountainous area without good
transportation and information services, which were impossible to
provide in the short run.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Jinhua, its well-developed neighbor, set out to lend a
hand by giving it a two-square-kilometer piece of land to the
south of the city at a low cost. For the past two years, it has
worked with the county to build a development zone here, whose
industrial and trade revenues it controls.
</P>
<P>
The zone benefits from preferential government
policies. Investors in the zone have tax exemptions for the first
three years. Businesses mainly employ people from Pan'an and some
manufacturers have set up plants in the county to get access to
local natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Granite and Xianggu mushrooms from Pan'an do well both at home
and abroad and it has become China's largest mushroom exporter
with a quarter of the country's Xianggu exports, adding 200 yuan
per capita annually to the county.
</P>
<P>
Its per capita annual income in 1997 exceeded 1,000 yuan, well
above China's official poverty-line of 500 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP to Grow Slightly in 1998: Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's real gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1998 fiscal year will inch up 0.1 percent, a private
research institute predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the GDP for 1997 is expected to shrink 0.4 percent,
according to the institute, which is affiliated to the Nomura
Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
The forecast included an inflation-adjusted GDP growth rate of
0.5 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey takes into consideration additional public projects
and tax cuts totalling five to six trillion yen (about 38.5 billion
to 46.2 billion U.S. dollars) in each fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 fiscal year which is to start on April 1, Japan's
domestic demand will drop but not as severely as in fiscal 1997,
the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's personal spending, which is an important force in the
economy, has been sluggish since the government raised the
consumption tax rate from three percent to five percent last
April.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Balance of Payments to Improve in 1998: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's overall balance
of payments is expected to improve significantly in 1998 with the
current account deficit projected to narrow substantially, the
State Bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit was projected at 1.4 billion
ringgit (about 386.526 million U.S. dollars) or just 0.5 percent
of gross national product (GNP) in 1998 against the deficit of
13.4 billion ringgit (about 3.699 billion U.S. dollars) or 5.1
percent of GNP in 1997, the bank said in its 1997 annual report
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 projection is well below the government's target of
3.0 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said a large surplus is expected in the merchandise
account, which is anticipated to increase markedly to 27.6 billion
ringgit (about 7.62 billion U.S. dollars) from 11.1 billion
ringgit (about 3.064 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 mainly because
of a more rapid expansion in exports (36.6 percent) against
imports (30.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
The bank said adjustment measures, particularly fiscal
cutbacks, deferment of several large projects and reduction in
credit growth for less productive sectors had contributed to a
contraction in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
These measures would result in a significant improvement in the
balance of payments position as well as greater efficiency in the
allocation of resources towards higher value-added activities, it
added.
</P>
<P>
It said that overall, the depreciation of the ringgit exerted
some positive impact on the balance of payments for 1997, which
was most evident in the-better-than expected performance of the
trade account.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports in 1997 amounted to 218.7 billion ringgit
(about 60.381 billion U.S. dollars at the present rate) against
193.1 billion ringgit (about 53.313 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996,
it added.

<HEADLINE> WHO Criticizes S. Africa for Failure to Curb TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) has been highly critical of South Africa for
losing the battle against tuberculosis (TB), The Citizen daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest estimates by South Africa's Medical Research Council
are that by the year 2005, about one percent of all South
Africans, will be infected with TB.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more than 103,000 TB cases were registered. In 1997,
the figure rose to 160,000. In addition, 1.4 million South
Africans are infected with both TB and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 South Africans are killed every month by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Following the WHO statement Tuesday, World TB Day, Democratic
Party healthcare spokesman Bukelwa Mbulawa introduced a motion in
the National Assembly calling on the government to halt the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the WHO finding that South Africa had one of the
highest rates of TB infection in the world, Mbulawa said TB
killed more South Africans than AIDS, malaria and murder
combined.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, it was estimated that 3.5
million South Africans would be infected by the year 2006, many
of them incurably infected with new drug-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
Mbulawa blamed the growing infection on failure of the
government's primary healthcare program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Call for Measures to Protect Qinghai Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'NING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts warned that the
fish population in Qinghai Lake, China's largest saltwater lake,
will decline and birds will disappear if nothing is done to stop
environmental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the Northwest Plateau Ecological Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have called for immediate
measures to protect Qinghai Lake from further pollution, which is
a key point for the ecological balance of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
the lake abounds in huso sturgeon, a rare species of fish, and
rare birds that co-exist peacefully with the fish.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake is drying up and grassland around it is in
danger of desertification, which could lead to great natural
disasters, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Over-grazing of livestock is one of the most important factors
that lead to desertification of grassland," said Chen Guichen,
an associate researcher in the institute.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the lake can feed at most 1.94 million
livestock, but the number of animals in the lake area now exceeds
three million.
</P>
<P>
Overuse of the lake water for agricultural purposes in recent
years has also caused an oversupply of water drained from the
lake. The lake's water level has been dropping an average of 10
centimeters a year since 1959, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds and moving dunes frequently destroy birds' nests
and food supply. The coverage of desert areas has reportedly
increased to 700 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Birds living on the island in the middle of the lake have also
been endangered because of appearance of large numbers of animals
there.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that deteriorating environment of the lake will turn
out to be a great danger to the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau. He suggested that the Chinese government take measures
to protect the lake.

<HEADLINE> EC Recommends 11 member States for Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
recommended 11 European Union countries for the single currency to
be launched in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made on Wednesday during a special
hearing of the European Parliament, to which the commission, the
executive agency of the 15-nation union, presented its report on
European Monetary Union convergence.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland were recommended as
having met the conditions to adopt the single currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the final stage of EMU, member states must
attain a high degree of sustainable economic convergence.
</P>
<P>
Progress is measured against criteria covering inflation,
government deficit and debt, exchange rate stability and long-term
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
EU member states must also meet certain other conditions such
as central bank independence.
</P>
<P>
The commission has already adopted the recommendation of the 11
member states on the initiative of Commission President Jacques
Santer and Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that these 11 countries be the founder members
of EMU from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU heads of state and government will confirm the list of
the first-wave EMU countries at a summit meeting on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation will be made on the basis of the commission's
recommendation and its convergence report together with another
convergence report prepared by the European Monetary Institute.
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be taken on a recommendation from the
EU economy and finance ministers council meeting after consulting
the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
If the 11 recommended countries are confirmed by the EU summit,
this will create a Euro-zone with nearly 300 million inhabitants
accounting for 19.4 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP)
and 18.6 percent of world trade.
</P>
<P>
This compares with 19.6 percent of world GDP and 16.6 percent
of world trade for the United States and 7.7 percent of world GDP
and 8.2 percent of world trade for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, and
Denmark exercised their right under the Maastricht Treaty and
opted out of the first wave for EMU. Greece and Sweden were judged
by the commission not economically ready to join for the time
being.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Sets up Special Team for Takeover of Kia Motors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai Motor Corporation, South
Korea's largest automaker, has lauched a special team to prepare
to take over the financially troubled Kia Motors Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai said it has established an auto research team led by
Chairman Chung Mong-Kyu in a bid to merge with Kia Motor
Corporation, the country's third biggest automaker, which went
bankrupt last year.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's launching of the team came amid a heated tug-of-war
with the Samsung Corporation for control of Kia.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai will detail its take-over offer when Kia is put up for
public bidding, said a Hyundai spokesman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai made its decision to take over Kia in a report on
Sunday entitled "Direction of the Development of the Korean
Automobile Industry."
</P>
<P>
The report said Hyundai's take-over of Kia is the only way for
the South Korean automobile industry to survive in the next century.
</P>
<P>
If Hyundai succeeds, its annual production will reach 2.5
million units, enabling the corporation to become one of the
world's top 10 automakers.
</P>
<P>
It will also greatly contribute to reducing the research and
development cost of South Korean-made cars in the future by
reshaping the nation's auto industry into the big two groups --
Hyundai and Daewoo.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks Guarantees for ASEAN Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Thai Foreign Ministry official
on Wednesday confirmed a newspaper report that Thailand would ask
Singapore to help set up a multilateral forum to secure guarantees
for all ASEAN exporters.
</P>
<P>
Today's Bangkok Post reported that Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai would stress to his Singaporean counterpart Goh Chok Tong,
who arrives here today for a 24-hour visit, that Singapore should
not seek export guarantees for Indonesia only.
</P>
<P>
Goh called on the international community to set up a
multilateral forum to help Indonesian exporters when he visited
the country last month.
</P>
<P>
The officials said all ASEAN exporters, not just only those in
Indonesia, have been beset by problems of obtaining letters of
credit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wants all ASEAN members to jointly lobby European and
U.S. support for the forum, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Chuan and Goh are expected to discuss preparation for the
Asian-European Summit due to take place in London in early April.
Other topics of discussion are likely to include Asia's position
in the region's financial crisis and Malaysia's proposal for using
local currencies to replace the U.S. dollar in trade among ASEAN
members.
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders will push for a statement at the summit which
would urge other nations to do more to address the regional
currency crisis, said the Thai Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand would also want the statement to call on
developed countries to make efforts to help restore confidence in
the region and to open up their markets and provide bank and
credit facilities to the crisis-hit countries as well.

<HEADLINE> Textile Reform Proceeding Steadily, Officials Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's central and local
governments are united and determined in their efforts to
reinvigorate the textile industry through restructuring, according
to government officials.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting with Ye Rongbao, deputy-governor of east
China's Zhejiang Province, the vice-chairman of China National
Textile Council (CNTC), Xu Kunyuan, said that reducing the number
of cotton spindles and stopping losses of state-owned cotton mills
will be the final opportunity that the textile industry has before
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"The textile enterprises have no way out but restructuring,"
said Xu.
</P>
<P>
State-owned textile enterprises have become the largest
unprofitable group among other industries. These enterprises have
more employees than any other state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to make the textile industry
an area of breakthroughs in restructuring medium- and large-scale
state-owned enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to transform the industry from red to
black in three years. The government has drafted a series of
policies in this process.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the central government's policies have added
impetus to Zhejiang Province's drive to restructure the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
She said the local economy is at the transitional stage from
medium-developed to developed. The province has taken pains to
scale down outdated cotton-spinning in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Even before the central government released relevant policies,
the province had already reduced the number of spindles at cotton
mills by 230,000.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the province will slash the number of cotton spindles
by another 430,000 in the next two years, one year ahead of the
schedule set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the destruction of spindles is aimed to get rid of
excessive production capacity by outdated cotton mills. Through
restructuring, down-sizing employees and reducing debt, most of
the medium- and large-size state-owned cotton textile enterprises
will shake off the doldrums and become vigorous in market
competition, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in an ever-changing market, heads of
state-owned enterprises should take the lead to change concepts
and ideology. They should learn about new products, technology and
trends in the international textile market, Ye said, so that they
can steer the enterprises toward expansion in intense
competition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Senior Judges Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Justice Ma Yuan, vice-president
of the China Judges Association, met here today with Dorothy
Nelson, senior judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to
discuss the judicial systems of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Ma briefed Nelson on the establishment of China's judicial system
in the last two decades, especially the implementation of
China's new criminal code which was passed last year.
</P>
<P>
The articles in the new criminal code have been increased to
452 from 192, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The code has also explicitly stipulated the principle of "not
guilty unless proven under the law" to avoid the biases of judges
in the conviction and punishment phases, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The new code has also emphasized citizens' "right of a just
defense" to more effectively protect the legitimate rights and
interests of the state, society and its citizens, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Nelson told Ma that many people in the United States are
concerned about the development of China's judicial system and the
implementation of the country's new criminal code. She said that
the adoption of the principle of "not guilty unless proven under
the law" in the new code is a sign of progress in China's legal
system.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. criminal code also needs improvement and the
two countries could learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about "interference" from government
institutions or other departments, Ma said the independence of
China's judiciary is explicitly stipulated in the law.
</P>
<P>
However, China is still working toward the goal of "rule by
law" and it is hard for the judicial departments to be totally free
from outside interference or influence in law enforcement, Ma told
Nelson. But the absolute majority of Chinese judges can overcome
outside interference and enforce the law fairly, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nelson was appointed to the bench by President Jimmy Carter in
1979. She was dean of the University of Southern California Law
Center, where she had been a professor since 1957.
</P>
<P>
Nelson's current China trip, sponsored by the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, will also take
her to Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province and Kunming in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Woos Investment to Upgrade Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Communications Minister
Patrick Aziza has said that his country is seeking six
billion U.S. dollars to improve its telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day seminar tagged "Nigeria Telecom
'98 ", which opened on Tuesday in Abuja, Aziza said that at least
six billion U.S. dollars is needed to "meet our immediate
requirements of over three million telephone lines and 200,000
cellular lines."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the nation's telecommunications industry would
require about 600 million dollars a year for network expansion,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziza, the current telephone density in Nigeria
stands at one line to 200 people, which is far below the one line
to 100 people standard prescribed by the International
Telecommunications Union.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's first long-term socio-economic development
program, "Vision 2010", a target of approximately eight million
lines should be installed by the year 2010, based on an average
growth rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the financial burden cannot be borne by the
government alone, the minister called on the organized private
sector and foreign investors to invest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The government expects that the combination of the resources
of government and private operators will provide the desired
investment level to accelerate telecommunications network
expansion which will then enable the government to withdraw and
allow the private sector to take the driver's seat to achieve
sustainable telecommunications development," said Aziza.
</P>
<P>
As the sector is being opened up for both domestic and foreign
investments, the emerging telecommunication environment will
offer a range of new opportunities for the investors, said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Textile Reform Proceeding Steadily, Officials Say (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ye said Zhejiang has taken the opportunity to advance the
structure of local industry and growth patterns of the local
economy to a new level.
</P>
<P>
In textile cities such as Ningbo, Hangzhou and Shaoxing, many
state-owned enterprises have begun to reorganize capital through
mergers or takeovers. Less-competitive enterprises have gone into
bankruptcy. About 10 large-enterprise groups are being formed with
competitive enterprises and products at their core.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that relocation of laid-off workers is the crucial part
of restructuring the industry.
</P>
<P>
The central government adopted a policy of "firmly pursuing
restructuring of the industry" while "showing care and sympathy
with workers in carrying out the move."
</P>
<P>
It adopted practical measures to divert and relocate laid-off
workers, especially those 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
Xu said these workers have made great contributions to the
development of the country's textile industry and made great
sacrifices in the reform. The government won't forget them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the restructuring is focused on coastal
areas and major cities where social security systems are
relatively advanced. He expressed the belief that laid-off workers
will not cause conflicts because new jobs will be continuously
created in these regions as the economy grows and the service
sector prospers.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that Zhejiang is carrying out a well-scheduled plan to
lay off workers during the restructuring of the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30,000 workers in the textile industry will be laid
off in the province this year, she said. The provincial government
gives priority to re-employing textile workers in its program to
help laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up five "safety nets" for laid-off textile
workers: minimum wages; minimum payments for subsistence; avoiding
layoffs of both husband and wife; exemption of medicare fees, rent
and public transportation fares; and government officials forging
person-to-person links with laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Different levels of local governments in the province have
signed a document of responsibility with the provincial
government, undertaking goals of relocating a fixed number of
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the laid-off workers have found new jobs through
various channels with the government's help. Among the 30,000
laid-off textile workers, only 4,300 have to rely on relief, which
is called "early retirement." Local governments, enterprises and
social insurance systems will share the expense of supporting
these people.
</P>
<P>
Ye pointed out that laid-off workers must also change their
ideology and expectations in finding new jobs. For example,
Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, has more than 10,000 laid-off
workers at present. At the same time, about the same number of
laborers coming from outside the city are working in various jobs
there.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Adopt Measures to Combat Triads Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chau Tak-hay, secretary for
Broadcasting, Culture and Sport, stressed here Wednesday that
there is no evidence of a serious Triad problem in the performing
arts circle in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at the Provisional Legislative Council
meeting when asked to comment on the recent reports by overseas
media that Hong Kong's entertainment business is manipulated by
Triad Societies.
</P>
<P>
According to police record, he said that there is only one
Triad-related crime reported to the Police Force in 1996. Since
1997, there has been no such case reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
Chau said the Hong Kong police have adopted comprehensive
measures to combat the influence of Triads. These include the
following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing dedicated units in the Police Force to take
proactive measures against Triads;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the police's capability in tackling Triads by
creating 277 police posts devoted to proactive anti-Triad duties;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing the Police Central Witness Protection Unit to
protect high risk witnesses to encourage them to come forward to
report criminal cases including those with Triads involved;
</P>
<P>
-- Launching a comprehensive publicity package to reveal the
truth and evils of Triad life;
</P>
<P>
-- Liaising with shops and business through the Crime
Prevention Bureau to encourage them to report Triad activities;
</P>
<P>
-- Keeping the legislation under constant review to ensure
adequate legal power for the police to deal with the Triads.
</P>
<P>
-- Maintaining close cooperation between the Police Force and
overseas police to tackle Triad activities.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Welcomes Developments of Cambodian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
on Wednesday welcomed the latest developments in the Cambodian
situation, saying he was optimistic over the holding of free and
credible elections in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ramos said he welcomed the full amnesty granted
by Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk to Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
the decision of the prince to return to Cambodia on March 30 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he was optimistic that these "very encouraging"
developments "will pave the way for the holding of free and
credible elections in Cambodia and the much-hoped restoration of
political stability in that country."
</P>
<P>
As current chairman of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) Standing Committee and the ASEAN Troika on
Cambodia, the Philippines takes a keen and active interest in the
evolution of the situation in Cambodia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's peace plan and its acceptance by both the Cambodian
government and Ranariddh were the first breakthrough which
hopefully will improve the political environment in Cambodia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos urged all parties concerned to once more demonstrate the
political will to implement fully the four pillars of Japan's
plan, particularly the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he looks forward to Ranariddh's and other Cambodian
political personalities' safe return to their homeland.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis in East Asia Can Affect World Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis
experienced by East Asian countries is expected to affect growth
in the world output and trade this year, Malaysia's State Bank
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the crisis on the major industrial economies
would vary, depending on their exposure to trade and investment in
the region, the central bank said in its 1997 annual report
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the East Asian crisis was unprecedented in terms
of degree and extent and that due to the region's increasing
importance and integration with the global economy and
international financial markets, the negative impact of the
turmoil was expected to reach beyond regional boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"Uncertainty remains with regards to the duration and the
spread of the crisis, which could eventually alter the world
economic and financial environment, and thus the short to medium
term outlook for the world economy," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, there was a spillover of the regional crisis onto
the world financial markets, when it generated a global stock
market decline in late October last year, and had since
contributed to continued volatility in most equity markets, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, said the region's economies would be most
affected by the crisis as the prolonged uncertainty and
implementation of strong measures and structural changes to
overcome present macroeconomic imbalances took effect.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, fiscal tightening and monetary restraint,
and the restructuring of the economy and the corporate and
financial sectors, can be expected to exert a dampening influence
on growth prospects. However, these measures would pave the way
for a more sustainable and broad-based growth over the medium
term," it said.
</P>
<P>
The significant adjustment of a country currency's was almost
instantly followed by some adjustments in the other regional
currencies, and the pressures on the currencies and equity markets
reinforced each other, it added.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the domestic currency led to sharp falls in
shares prices while the consequent capital outflows exerted
further the pressure on the exchange rate, it said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis also triggered a loss of confidence in the financial
system and reflected the excesses of the private sector.

<HEADLINE> China: Economic, Social, Cultural Rights to Be Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate Wednesday
called on the Commission of Human Rights to give more attention to
economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianmin, head of the Chinese delegation, told the 54th
session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission that only 33 out of
the 534 resolutions passed by the Commission since 1992 deal with
economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The figures illustrated that those rights and the right to
development had not been given adequate attention, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, while voices calling for the promotion and
protection of human rights were growing louder worldwide, Official
Development Assistance (ODA) had kept on declining, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, he noted, the ODA fell to its lowest point since 1973,
accounting for 0.27 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the
developed countries, far below the 0.7 percent U.N. requirement.
</P>
<P>
The figures exposed a serious imbalance in the work of the
Commission, resulting from the tendency to over-emphasize civil
and political rights to the neglect of economic, social and
cultural rights and the right to development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu went on to point out that 4.9 billion of the world's 5.7
billion population lived in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"However important civil and political rights may be, the
primary concern of the 4.9 billion people is about the realization
of their economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right
to development," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations failed to pay enough attention to their
concern, it would find itself estranged from the majority of the
world's population," he cautioned. "Consequently, mainstreaming
human rights in the UN could hardly succeed."

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Call Special Meeting on Indonesia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The meeting will provide an opportunity to present assessments
of the humanitarian impact of the current economic crisis and
severe drought," Downer was quoted by the Australian Associated
Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, the meeting will facilitate coordination of
international assistance for Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Downer said the move followed his meeting in Washington
recently with World Bank President James Wolfensohn, at which he
raised Australia's concerns about the effect of the Asian economic
crisis on Indonesia's ability to feed its population.
</P>
<P>
"The combined effect of the economic crisis and the prolonged
drought have given rise to a clear danger of major food security
problems as food affordability decreases and crop harvests are
reduced."
</P>
<P>
The concerns over Indonesia was also voiced Wednesday night by
former prime minister Paul Keating in a lecture to a university in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Australia could not, and should not, try to insulate itself
from the 200 million people in Indonesia who were its nearest
Asian neighbors, Keating said, calling Indonesia the country of
"greatest immediate concern" to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We stand with Indonesia" and that should be the basis of
Australian policy throughout Asia's financial crisis, the former
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been lobbying on Indonesia's behalf to have the
conditions of its International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout eased
because of fears the tough economic measures demanded could lead
to food shortages and social upheaval.
</P>
<P>
Australia has contributed one billion U.S. dollars to the IMF's
43 billion U.S. dollar bailout of Indonesia, as well as donating
5.8 million U.S. dollars for drought and up to 254 million U.S.
dollars in insurance cover for wheat sales.
</P>
<P>
Australian armed forces have made emergency plans to evacuate
Australians in Indonesia in case turmoil develops in the country,
Australian newspapers reported earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Kids Overweight May Link to TV Watching: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Kids who watch a lot of
television tend to be heavier than those who do not, a new study
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers used waistline "skinfold" thickness measures to
ascertain childhood weight gain, and found that "skinfold
thickness increased in both boys and girls as the amount of
television watched increased," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Many U.S. children watch a great deal of television and are
inadequately active," concludes the study based on an analysis of
interviews and physical examinations conducted among 4,063
children, aged 8 through 16.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six percent of U.S. children watched four or more hours
of television per day and an average high school graduate will
likely spend 15,000 to 18,000 hours in front of a television
compared with only 12,000 hours in school, the study said.
</P>
<P>
A little more than 20 percent of U.S. kids partake in two or
fewer hours of vigorous activity per week, the study said, adding
that health experts recommend at least three periods of strenuous
exercise every week.
</P>
<P>
The study was the work of researchers at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in Baltimore, along with experts at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.

Wolfsburg, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest carmaker
Volkswagen (VW) Wednesday said that it had bid for British luxury
carmaker Rolls-Royce on Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by visiting Finnish Secretary of State

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Economy to Recover in 1998: State Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
expected to recover from the full impact of the current economic
crisis in the second half of 1998, Malaysian State Bank said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The full impact of the crisis on the domestic economy is
expected to be felt in the first half of this year," the central
bank said in its 1997 annual report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product growth would slow down to between two
and three percent in 1998 after a decade of rapid growth, it said,
adding notwithstanding the slowdown in growth and some increase
in unemployment, the economy would remain positive in the first
half of this year, with stronger growth taking place in the second
half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said "This projection is premised on prospective
developments in the international and regional environment, as
well as developments in the domestic economy in the context of the
government's macroeconomic adjustment program."
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the adjustment measures, introduced in
December 1997, as well as emerging signs of restoration of
regional financial stability have had a positive effect in
restoring investor confidence, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other positive developments have been the
stronger-than-projected exports of 218.7 billion ringgit (60.381
billion U.S. dollars at the present rate) in 1997, against 193.1
billion ringgit (53.313 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, and some
recovery in the equity market, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said "Should this trend strengthen, the prospects for
growth could be higher."
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that a number of risks remained and
they included a sharper-than-expected moderation in world growth
and trade, a more prolonged regional crisis and the uncertain
outlook for exports of electronic and electrical goods, the major
export items of Malaysia.

TAIYUAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas visitors
to north China's Shanxi Province last year grew 29.2 percent over
1996 to reach 125,000 as a result of further improvements in the
local tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
This helped the province earn 37.48 million U.S. dollars in
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas tourists are coming from the
Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and Thailand along with
visitors from Japan, France, the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province earned 4.37 billion yuan from the 18
million domestic tourists, a 36.57 percent rise from 1996. The
earnings went up 72 percent over 1996, the biggest growth rate
during recent years.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's major energy bases, Shanxi is enriched
with tourism attractions such as Wutai Mountain and Hukou
Waterfall. A number of new scenic spots have been developed to
attract visitors.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Bettering Trade with Industrialized Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit with
industrialized countries has either been wiped out or reduced
considerably, said the Commerce, Industry, and Energy Ministry
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first two months of this year saw that industrialized
nations, such as France, the United States and Canada, no longer
enjoyed a trade surplus with South Korea while the nation's trade
deficit with Japan dropped, said an analysis report by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade surplus with the United States amounted to
219 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of this year
while it also enjoyed a surplus of 39 million U.S. dollar with
France, two million dollars with Canada.
</P>
<P>
The nation's trade deficit with the United States stood at 8.36
billion U.S. dollars last year, the second largest only next to
its deficit of 13.65 billion U.S. dollar with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's deficit with European countries turned
into a surplus totaling 740 million U.S. dollars from last year's
deficit of 2.07 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's deficit with Japan plummeted to 554 million
dollars in the past two months from 2.25 billion in the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's improved trade balance came from the country's
expanded exports, decreased imports, and sharp devaluation of the
won in the past months since it signed an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund last December for a rescue loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year witnessed the per capital income of South Korea down
to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars
due to a financial crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Sulphur Ore Found in Southeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An exceptionally large sulphur
ore deposit, reportedly China's largest, amounting to more than 10
billion tons, was verified recently in Guizhou Province in
southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The sulphur ore is scattered over a 2,570-sq.km. area, mainly
in Dafang County, and contains an average 15 percent of sulphur,
fit for sulphuric acid production, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
Experts anticipate that the fine sulphur ore supply will fall
short of the growing market demand with the development of the
sulphuric acid industry. Guizhou needs
1.3 million tons of sulphur ore for 1998, but there are less than
200,000 tons of supplies.
</P>
<P>
The province is planning an 800,000-ton sulphur ore base
and two more 300,000-ton sulphur ore dressing areas.

KAMPALA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will not dictate any
political system on a sovereignty, the U.S. special envoy for
democratization in Africa told Ugandan multipartists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a U.S. diplomat commented publicly on
multipartism.
</P>
<P>
Reverend Jesse Jackson said the U.S. has no right to prescribe
political systems for other sovereign countries at a luncheon
organized by Michael Mckinley, the U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the
country, for Uganda and visiting U.S. political figures in

</P>
<P>
Uganda insists repeatedly multipartism applies no conditions
in Uganda. Multipartism only causes tribalism and chaos in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has various political groups. But Ugandan authorities
hold that these groups are not the real political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to The New Vision Wednesday, guests of Tuesday's

NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha Wednesday presented to the Parliament the
government's interim budget for 1998-99 (April 1,1998-March 31,
1999) to enable the government to carry on its business.
</P>
<P>
India's annual budget is usually presented to the Parliament
every February. As the change of government which was formulated
on March 19, an interim budget as a vote-on-account has to be
presented so as to meet essential expenditure during the first
four months of the next financial year. The regular budget for
1998-99 is expected to be ready in a few weeks time.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Parliament here, Yashwant Sinha said that
the overall economic growth has slowed to five percent in 1997-98,
agriculture has registered negative growth of two percent,
industry continues to be in the doldrums averaging only 4.6
percent growth over the 12 months up to January 1998, and exports
have recorded negative growth in U.S. dollar terms in each of the
three most recent months up to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure in 1998-99 is estimated at 2,649,880
million rupees (68.83 billion U.S. dollars) as against 2,352,450
million rupees (61.10 billion U.S. dollars) in the current year.
No-plan expenditure in 1998-99 is estimated to be 2,005,270
million rupees (52.08 billion U.S. dollars) against 1,746,150
million rupees (45.36 billion U.S. dollars) in the current year,
the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The total non-debt receipts including tax revenues at existing
rates of taxation, are estimated at 1,681,730 million rupees
(43.68 billion U.S. dollars). The fiscal deficit for 1998-99 will
be about 6 percent of GDP, he said. The targeted fiscal deficit
was pegged at 4.5 percent of GDP.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Hong Kong Housing
Authority Rosanna Wong stated here Wednesday that her department
will make efforts to provide more flats to local citizens and
enhance home ownership.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar entitled "Hong Kong Property Market: What Lies
Ahead," Wong said: "The Housing Authority's mission is to provide
a steady and sufficient supply of affordable housing for the less
fortunate in our community."
</P>
<P>
In his first Policy Address last October, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
outlined the blueprint of the SAR government's housing development
strategy, designed to "increase the overall home ownership rate to
70 percent..."
</P>
<P>
Discussing the current situation and prospects of the local
property market, some participants, including officials of the
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, local influential
economists and bankers, said that new home projects launched at
low price and attractive terms would enable to resolve the
home-lack problem in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government's low price strategy for new home projects
will push down the land price, they said, noting that the land
price recorded at low level in the SAR in the passing months due
to the recent economic turmoil in Asia and will remain at low
level in Hong Kong in the near future.

<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ivorien Foreign Minister Essy
Amara has described a statement recently credited to the United
States on the political situation in Nigeria as an insult not
only to Nigerians but to all Africans.
</P>
<P>
Africans "are mature enough to fashion out their own
destines," he said, quoted by the official newspaper New Nigerian
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Amara was in Nigeria to deliver a solidarity message from
President Henri Konan Bedie to Nigerian Head of State General
Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Ivorien minister expressed regret that the U.S. had chosen
to ignore Nigeria's credible historic achievements in
peacekeeping all over the world in preference to less-significant
issues.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the restoration of peace and democracy in
Liberia and Sierra Loene to the sterling leadership of General
Abacha as the current chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
According to him, the message from Presidnt Bedie was
necessitated by the comments credited to U.S. assistant Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs Susan Rice who recently called "the
military dictatorship in Nigeria one of the worst abusers of
human rights on the continent".
</P>
<P>
While urging General Abacha to undertake a "genuine
transition", Rice stated "an electoral victory by any military
candidate in the forthcoming presidential election would be
unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
This statement, Amara noted, was "a flagrant interference in
the internal affairs of Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
Responding, General Abacha urged all nations to learn to
respect the sovereignty and independence of others in the
interest of harmonious international relations.

<HEADLINE> Murder of Casino Official Condemned in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The killing of a senior official
who supervised Macao's casinos was strongly condemned here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Amaral, 45, chief of the Casino Inspection Division
under the Macao Casino Inspection and Coordination Department, was
shot in the head at noon on Tuesday near the well-known Casino
Lisboa. He was confirmed dead upon arrival at hospital.
</P>
<P>
The assassination is the latest murder connected with interests
conflicts between Macao casinos. At least two other senior
officials of the department have been shot since 1996.
</P>
<P>
A number of members of the Legislative Assembly (LA) said the
murder served a challenge to the security departments and damage
to social stability. They urged the government to take resolute
and effective measures to curb the spread of crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The murder of another senior civil servant is a very serious
case," said Tong Chi Kin, a Macao LA member. "It is an evident
challenge to the law, and tolerable to no one."
</P>
<P>
Another LA member, Vitor Ng, urged the government to seek a
fundamental resolution of problems concerning casino interests. If
the problems are not resolved promptly, he said, there might come
another wave of crimes, which will be a severe blow to the local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Macao Daily News said in a commentary on
Wednesday that the worsening security situation in Macao over the
past few years has scared tourists away and make local residents
worry about their safety.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the security departments should make the
utmost efforts to stop the crimes from happening again.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Russian Products Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Ministry of Economy
has recommended that the country ban all types of illegal imports
and protect domestic textile and light-industry products,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions are contained in a report to the State
Commission for Foreign Trade and Tariff Policies.
</P>
<P>
The report also calls for lifting quotas and restrictions
on Russia's textile exports to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The report argues that Russia's textile imports exceed by a
large margin its exports of the products.
</P>
<P>
If the EU refuses to change its harsh stance towards Russia,
the report says, Russia will need to consider exercising a quota
policy on textile imports from the EU.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry proposes that measures be worked out
for inspection of imported commodities and for their pre-sale
management for the sake of protecting the interests of both
Russian consumers and producers.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Russia has worked out, as emergency measures,
some draft plans to issue import permits for various textile
products.
</P>
<P>
To cope with various restrictions imposed by the EU and some
other countries on the import of Russian industrial products, a
bill was passed on March 20 for the sake of protecting Russia's
economic interests in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The bill requests that a special institution be set up to
investigate Russia's foreign trade and work out protective
measures accordingly.

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said on Tuesday that President Boris Yeltsin had
asked him to make proposals on the work of the new cabinet within
a week.
</P>
<P>
The news was announced by President Gennady Seleznev of Russian
State Duma (Lower House) at a press conference after he held talks
with the acting prime minister, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Seleznev said, he and the acting prime
minister discussed government work, but they did not touch
upon the lineup of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of whether State Duma will approve Kiriyenko as prime
minister if President Yeltsin so nominates, the lower house
president said for the moment it was still difficult to predict
the MP's positions.
</P>
<P>
While meeting President Yegor Stroyev of the Russian Federation
Council (Upper House), Kiriyenko said that only concerted efforts
of the government and parliament could ensure the country's progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the six-nation
Contact Group met here Wednesday in a bid to find new approaches
to end the conflict in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in Bonn, the meeting has a main
objective to urge the federal Yugoslav leadership, not just
Serbia, to begin a political dialogue with Kosovo Albanians on the
future status of the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks have been overshadowed by difference in
opinions among the Contact Group members consisting of Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proposes to
tighten sanctions on Belgrade, most other group members is said to
favor "maintaining pressure" on Belgrade to enter talks.
</P>
<P>
Although some economic and diplomatic sanctions were already
decided at the Contact Group's last meeting in London on March 9,
Russia disagrees to go ahead with them for reasons that Belgrade
has already made some progress to meet the demands raised by the
London meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Bonn meeting, Albright and her Russian
counterpart Yevgeni Primakov met in Cologne Tuesday evening trying
to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also held separate talks with
Albright and Primakov earlier Wednesday to prepare for the group's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is also due to hold consultations on the same
day in Bonn with foreign ministers from eight nations in the
neighborhood of Yugoslavia to discuss how to maintain stability in
the entire region.

<HEADLINE> China's Large High-Tech Group Enters Domestic Laser-Jet Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University's Founder
Group Corp. announced here today that its laser jets are now
available on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The Founder WordJet can increase the efficiency of office work
with the help of Founder's Chinese character-processing technology
that was originally used in printing composition, said Wang Xuan,
a member of the Founder Group's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference today, Wang said Founder has 22
years of experience in printing composition and now controls 90
percent of the world market for Chinese language printing
composition.
</P>
<P>
The WordJet has preinstalled 20 character fonts, and produces
quality printouts at high speed, said Wang, who is also president
of the Founder R&AMP;D Center, adding that the printer has great
potential in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese laser-jet market is now dominated by foreign
manufacturers, but the best are equipped with merely four
character fonts.
</P>
<P>
Founder expects an annual production of 20,000 WordJets, and
plans to bring the new products into the top three in the Chinese
laser-jet market this year. WordJets are projected to be one of
the top two laser-jet printers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the birth of WordJet marks a breakthrough
in Chinese-developed laser-printing technology, as well as a great
leap forward in Founder's hardware manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Founder's brand name now appears on its computers, monitors and
terminals.
</P>
<P>
The total sales of Founder in 1997 was 5.85 billion yuan, an
increase of almost 50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Research-and-development investment last year accounted for
4-to-5 percent of the related production value.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Large Environmental Protection Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China will invest more than six
billion yuan (750 million U.S. dollars) in launching a large
project to improve the environment in the source regions of the
Yellow and Yangtze rivers, the two longest in China.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive treatment project will cover an area of
326,000 square kilometers, which includes five autonomous
prefectures of ethnic groups and 34 counties in northwest China's
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
"It will take 13 years to complete the project if it is
launched this year as scheduled," said a leading official with the
Qinghai Provincial agriculture and forestry department, a major
partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
The project will concentrate on planting forests, preventing
soil erosion and fighting desertification, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The source regions of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers have an
elevation of more than 4,000 meters and are plagued with severe
cold and dry weather, prominent features of the local natural
environment. Destruction of the region's forests and grasslands
have led to soil erosion and desertification, which has posed a
threat to the local ecology.
</P>
<P>
"The investment will be funneled to the project in two stages
with financial support from the central government," said Wang
Qian, director of the provincial forestry bureau. The project will
provide comprehensive management and protection of the environment
of seven river valleys. Shelter greenbelts will be planted in the
source regions of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made by the local government to protect the
environment in the source regions in recent years, where forests
cover 208,000 hectares with 93 million trees planted.
</P>
<P>
After the project's completion, the forest coverage rate of the
source region is expected to rise to 10.42 percent from current
4.87 percent, according to an analysis by the provincial forestry
department.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An advance team for Prince
Ranariddh's return arrived here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six-people team includes Prince Sisowath Sereirath,
Education Minister Toul Lous and Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvath.
</P>
<P>
Toul Lous told reporters upon the group's arrival at Po Chen
Tong International Airport that the team came back to prepare
Prince Ranariddh's return on March 30 and to check security
conditions for the return.
</P>
<P>
It will be the former First Prime Minister's first return to
Phnom Penh after his nearly nine months of self-exile. The prince was
deposed by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen last July in the wake of a
military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been made for the prince to stay at a well-known
hotel in Phnom Penh when he returns, said an official of
Funcinpec, a political party of which the prince is leader.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, government officials said no plans were being made
for additional security for the prince's arrival because he is no
longer a co-head of government.
</P>
<P>
"But of course, the Royal government and the Ministry of the
Interior will take every possible measure to protect Ranariddh as
well as any other politician," said Interior Ministry spokesman
Khieu Sopheak.
</P>
<P>
The prince will participate in the July 26 general elections
after his return.

<P>
HAIKOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Fisherman Wang Mutang is feeling
great that he was able to return a 100-year-old sea turtle to sea,
even though some of his friends are sorry that he lost a chance to
make money.
</P>
<P>
The turtle -- 1.9 meters long, 1.1 meters wide, and weighing
more than 250 kilograms -- was captured by Wang on March 9, while
deep-sea fishing.
</P>
<P>
People around him were delighted with the news, believing it
was a good chance for him to make a fortune. Some buyers had
contacted him with an offer as high as 4,000 yuan (481.92
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, upon learning that the turtle is a rare species under
second-grade national protection which rarely survives life in
captivity, Wang made an immediate decision to set it free.

<HEADLINE> Curbing Illicit Drug Trade in Lebanon Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A parliament member has warned
that illegal trade in medicine has soared to a level in lebanon
that it is endangering people's lives, the Daily Star newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, Ismail Sukkarieh said that
staying silent about what is happening in the pharmaceutical
market is a crime, and helping criminal pill salesmen is an even
bigger crime.
</P>
<P>
"We are raising this huge and dangerous issue because it
concerns everybody, not one group and not another," Sukkarieh said.
</P>
<P>
He added that nothing is being done to stop drugs well past
their expiration date being sold on the market, which is the
reason behind many unexplained deaths.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed unscientific advertising and promotion of
unnecessary medicine and illegal distribution for "upsetting an
otherwise very professional pharmaceutical industry."
</P>
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Consultation Bureau (PCB) said in a
statement that Lebanon imported 5,968 products at a cost of 362
million U.S. dollars in 1997, 3,188 of which are not needed with a
value of 230 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The PCB said 887 brands were not registered with the technical
committee; of those 86 were sold illegally and 42 were not
registered even in the country of origin but appeared prepared
especially for export to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the third largest regional consumer of medicine
after Saudi Arabia and Egypt. There are 16 chief importers and 80
companies in the country which sell medicines via 2,100
pharmacies, 164 private hospitals, 27 public hospitals, 55
government clinics and 320 private clinics.
</P>
<P>
Sukkarieh recommended that to curb the crimes, a system be set
up to register and examine imports according to international
standards, such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO),
and an up-to-date national policy.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to appoint a well-trained technical team
in collaboration with the WHO to run the medical sector and
implement the by-laws of the national medicine office, which will
identify a list of basic medicines, relying on those products
manufactured by international companies with research centers, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker as Gold Loses Shine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar's break
above 67 U.S. cents proved short-lived Wednesday in Sydney as it
slipped lower when gold lost some of its recent strong luster.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed the local trading session at 66.87 U.S.
cents, down from 67.03 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Steve North, a senior dealer of Chase Manhattan, said the
Australian dollar spent most of the day in a "holding pattern"
with little to drive it either way.
</P>
<P>
North said the unit's topple from its early high of 67.12 U.S.
cents coincided with a corresponding move in the price of gold in
New York overnight and Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished the local session at 86.99
Japanese yen from 87.10 yen previously, and at 1.2219 Deutsche

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Becomes Self-sufficient in Non-staple Food Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province has
become self-sufficiency in non-staple food supplies primarily
because of its "shopping basket" program, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The program was worked out by the state in 1988 to develop
production of non-staple foods and ensure urban supply.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, one of the country's most important centers for heavy
chemicals, has invested 10 million yuan annually since 1991 to
develop non-staple food bases in its six major cities, and
industrial and mining areas.
</P>
<P>
The province also built dozens of fresh vegetable and livestock
companies to provide urban residents with a constant supply.
</P>
<P>
While setting up large- and medium-size feed-processing plants
in major cities, the province has made efforts to establish farms
for raising pigs, chicken, fish and cattle.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of technological innovation has allowed a group of
modern non-staple processing centers to emerge, which basically
meet the demand of different consumers.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off and as a result, local people's
living conditions have improved a great deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measured
eight on the Richter scale was Wednesday recorded off the coast of
Australia's Antarctic Territory, the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Geological Survey Organization said the quake
happened at 14:11 Australian eastern daylight time just off the
Balleny Islands.
</P>
<P>
It came half an hour after an earthquake in the Banda Sea in
Indonesia shook Darwin, a coastal city in northern Australia,
early Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported as there is nobody in the two
quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
"This is a once in the world once in a year earthquake, so it's
quite a large earthquake," Kevin McCue, a seismologist at the
survey organization was quoted by AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
"And this is the largest in the world so far this year but we
don't expect there have been any damage because there is nobody
there."
</P>
<P>
McCue said the earthquake, which shook Darwin, registered six
on the Richter scale and occurred at 13:44 Australian eastern
daylight time, north of Timor in the Banda sea.
</P>
<P>
It was "too small to have done any damage or cause a tsunami
(tidal wave), but it was felt by quite a few people in Darwin," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Green Shelterbelt Built to Stop Yellow River Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A 500-kilometer shelterbelt
along the lower reaches of the mighty Yellow River is expected to
act as a natural defence against seasonal flooding.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to spend 13 years on the project,
and by 2010 a 30- to 50-meter-wide greenbelt is expected to be
built along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The strong winds and stormy waves often hit dykes violently
during the flood season, according to the commission in charge of
water control on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
They say that embankments were a common method of flood
control, but they cost a lot and sometimes inhibit water flow.
</P>
<P>
Green belt can solve some problems of dyke construction and
branches of trees can also be used as flood control materials,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The central government will spend 10 million yuan on the
project this year and experimental areas have been set up in 10
counties of Shandong and Henan provinces.

<HEADLINE> China Protecting Places of Worship in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's places of worship and holy
sites are being protected by the Chinese government, according to
He Feng, an associate research fellow at the Qinghai Social
Science Academy's Tibetology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
He says that there are more than 3,000 Tibetan temples in the
country that are not only places for religious activities, but
also valuable historic relics. In 1961, the Chinese government put
a group of major Tibetan temples, such as the Potala, Johkang,
Qangdin Lamasery, and Taer Monastery, under state-level protection.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the central government has spent 300 million yuan
(36 million US dollars) on repairs in Tibetan temples that were
damaged during the so-called "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976),
and has allocated one million yuan annually for their maintenance
and has made large-scale repairs to some.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Guinean Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said here today that he is convinced that the frequent personnel
contacts between China and Guinea serve the mutual understanding
and improvement of friendly cooperative ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He made his remarks in a meeting with Guinean Foreign Minister
Lamine Kamara.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the two countries have established close relations
since the two forged diplomatic ties nearly four decades ago, and
that the friendship between the two peoples has also deepened.
</P>
<P>
China and Guinea have conducted positive exploration in
cooperation of mutual benefit with the concern of the two leaders
in recent years, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed to the fruitful cooperation in agriculture as well
as minerals which has just started.
</P>
<P>
There exist more diversified content and broader spheres in the
mutual-beneficial cooperation between the two sides, Qian said,
adding that the prospects for such cooperation are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to a proposal
put forward by Guinean President Lansana Conte to further enhance

stability and prosperity of Guinea itself has positive effects on
the peace and stability of the region.

<P>
Qian also asked Kamara to convey Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's sincere regards to President Conte.
</P>
<P>
Kamara said the traditional friendly cooperative ties between

fields since Conte's China visit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Guinea enjoys a stable political situation and rich resources,
and is willing to further cooperate with China, Kamara said.

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
allocate 200 million yuan (25 million U.S. dollars) for
rehabilitating and treating the sinking areas of Benxi, a
coal-producing city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The sinking areas, caused by over-exploration, emerged during
the Japanese occupation of China's northeast regions. They are
1-to-2 meters below ground level, which causes problems for
residents during the rainy seasons.

By the end of last year the governments had allocated 78.5
million yuan for rehabilitating an area of 2.2 sq. km. with 4.3
sq. km. of urban area remaining to be rehabilitated.

<HEADLINE> Columbian Government Willing to Hold Talks with Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Columbian government
Tuesday reiterated its "firm willingness to seek a political
solution to the armed conflicts" in the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the presidential office said the
government is ready to discuss with guerrillas their wishes for
changes as long as the guerrilla organization is in real earnest
to push ahead the process of reconciliation among the Columbians.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in response to a request by a
guerrilla organization Columbian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC)
for talks with representatives not from the central government.
</P>
<P>
The statement made a positive response to the request, saying
the government has approved non-governmental organizations, local
authorities or individuals to hold talks with guerrillas over such
humanitarian issues as the release of 18 government soliders they
captured last December.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government hoped that the guerrilla
forces will release the soliders as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
FARC Tuesday made public through a radio station in the capital
letters which the 18 government soliders wrote to their families
to show that they were still alive.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the general elections scheduled on May 31,
the guerrillas have stepped up their activities in various parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In exchanges of gunfire with government forces last weekend,
the guerrillas killed 26 people, injured six and captured 26, some
of whom were civilians.

<HEADLINE> New MOFTEC Minister on China's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- New Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic cooperation Shi Guangsheng told Xinhua here
today that he shoulders great responsibility and confronts arduous
tasks.
</P>
<P>
Having worked for China's foreign trade sector for almost four
decades, Shi has a sober and unique understanding of the current
situation of China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Great strides have been made in foreign trade since China
adopted its reform and opening-up policy 20 years ago. Last year,
China became the 10th largest foreign trade country. It has been
ranked No.2 for five consecutive years in terms of the value of
foreign investment introduced. Major headway has also been made in
economic cooperation with foreign countries, providing assistance
to other countries, and reforming the foreign trade and management
systems.
</P>
<P>
However, Shi said there are many challenges and difficulties as
well:
</P>
<P>
-- No access to the World Trade Organization brings many
unfavorable competitive factors to China in the international
market;
</P>
<P>
-- And worldwide trade protectionism has often adversely
affected the development of China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese state-owned foreign trade businesses are not
capable of fully catering to the demands of the market economy and
China's export structure needs to be optimized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the difficulties, Minister Shi -- a frank, open and
humorous man -- said that challenge means opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Since he formed an indissoluble bond with the foreign trade
business when he was admitted as a student at the Beijing Foreign
Trade Institute at the age of 21, he has overcome various
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
After he was assigned to the then Ministry of Foreign Trade, he
was sent to work in the Commercial Offices of the Chinese
Embassies to Mali and Belgium. Since 1974, he worked for the China
Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corp. for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Later, he was dispatched by MOFTEC to Shanghai, China's
largest industrial city and trade center. Two years later, he went
back to Beijing and was promoted to the position of director of
MOFTEC's Import and Export Department.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he became the assistant MOFTEC minister and, two
years later, vice foreign trade minister.
</P>
<P>
His rich knowledge and experience in foreign trade business,
strict work style, adherence to principles and pragmatic approach
have enabled him to surmount difficulties one after another.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon China's foreign trade situation at present, Shi
said there are still many development opportunities and, at the
same time, the influence of the financial crisis in Asia on
China's foreign trade, especially on export and introduction of
foreign trade, should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
"Even though, we must strive to expand exports and positively
absorb foreign investment," he added.
</P>
<P>
To increase exports, the foreign trade companies must reduce
production costs to sharpen their competitive edge and streamline
the export structure, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the the new preferential policies for
absorbing foreign investment should be implemented as soon as
possible. Government should improve its services to ensure the
healthy development of the foreign-funded businesses in China, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Asian to Enhance Cooperation in Fighting Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 interior ministers
and representatives from 30 Asia-Pacific countries agreed here
Wednesday to enhance cooperation in battling the growing
transnational crime in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was contained in the Manila Declaration on the
Prevention and Control of Transnational Crime adopted at the end
of a three-day Asia Regional Ministerial Meeting on Transnational
Crime which ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the delegates expressed deep concern about
the increase and expansion of organized criminal activities in the
region, such as trafficking in human beings, transnational
exploitation of women and children, drug trafficking and other
forms of economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
The delegates promised to take concrete measures, including
promoting national and regional actions against transnational
crime, developing effective strategies aimed at defeating the
economic power of criminal organizations and improving the
functioning of law-enforcing institutions.
</P>
<P>
The declaration warned that with rapid economic changes and
advancements in communications and technology, more joint criminal
ventures emerged and many new forms of criminal activities, such
as computer hacking and credit card frauds, have increased.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the urgent need to make progress in vigorously
promoting international cooperation in criminal matters," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It urged governments to give special attention to extradition,
mutual assistance, witness protection, transfer of prisoners,
seizure and forfeiture of crime proceeds, as well as other forms
of regional and international cooperation in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also appealed to the international community to
give technical assistance to the developing countries in the
region to strengthen their capabilities in combating powerful
transnational crime rings.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the region's first high-level one on transnational
crime, was sponsored by the Vienna-based United Nations Center for
International Crime Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Arab Nations Still Concerned About Turko-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite repeated explanations
from Ankara, Arab countries are apparently still concerned over
the ever-closer military ties between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News quoted Monday an Arab state ambassador to Turkey
as saying that the Turko-Israeli cooperation in military field
might produce a negative impact on the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to say against Turkish-Israeli relations. But
when it comes to the discussion of a strategic or military
alliance between these two countries, we, of course, continue to
have concerns," the ambassador said, declining to be named.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is natural that the Arab world is so sensitive
to the every development, especially those in the defense and
military field, between Turkey and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"For a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, regional
balances in security and military power should be maintained," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The quickly increasing military cooperation between Turkey and
Israel has prompted grave concern among the Arab countries in this
region, which are afraid that the two would form a military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Summit held in Tehran last December criticized
Ankara without specifying its name for its close military
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a leading Arab country, also voiced its concern over
the Turkish-Israeli closer ties in the military sphere during the
visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to Cairo last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Defending its ties with Israel, Turkish government officials
have explained on many occasions that the Turko-Israeli
cooperation is of bilateral nature and not directed against any
third country.
</P>
<P>
Under two defense and military agreements signed early 1996,
Turkey and Israel have rapidly increased their cooperation in
weapon development, joint military training as well as exchange of
visits of military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Last January, the naval forces of Israel, Turkey and the
U.S. held a joint military exercise, code-named "Reliant Mermaid",
in the eastern Mediterranean, triggering strong opposition from
Iran and the Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar, Singapore Further Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The 24-hour official visit of
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, which ended here Wednesday
 morning, has further strengthened the ties between the two
countries, especially in the economic field, Myanmar official
media said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, Goh's second to the country since March 1994,
enhanced mutual understanding and friendly ties for mutual
benefit, the media said.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar has been able to obtain the expertise and know-how
from our Singapore friends in the fields of science and
technology," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Trade has occupied a niche though it is in Singapore's favor
and there exist good prospects for promotion in future," it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Goh held official talks with Senior-General
Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on mutual exemption of visas for
holders of diplomatic and official passports was signed during the
stay.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore business mission, which accompanied Prime
Minister Goh, also held discussions with their Myanmar
counterparts which could lead to further expansion of trade and
investment in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has
developed rapidly in recent years along with exchange of visits
between state leaders and high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Singapore's total investment in
Myanmar amounted to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 65 permitted
projects at the end of 1997, out of 6.6 billion dollars' foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Singapore statistics, Myanmar and Singapore had a
bilateral trade volume of 800 million dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Sign Landmine-Banning Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Campaign
Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the
United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
</P>
<P>
The call coincides with Clinton's 11-day tour of six African
countries, namely Ghana, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Botswana
and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Wednesday, the group said it is
ironic the American leader is visiting Africa to discuss economic
recovery support.
</P>
<P>
But it said one of the most critical impending recovery on the
continent is the millions of hectares of land that cannot be
developed as a result of millions of explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
The group said Africa is a continent solidly behind a treaty
prohibiting production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38 African countries, including the 14 members of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have signed
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government refuses to approve it.
</P>
<P>
However, the anti-landmine campaign said all the countries
Clinton is touring have played major roles in global efforts to
create a mine-free world.
</P>
<P>
The South African lobby group said while Clinton travels
through Africa, it is collecting signatures protesting against
U.S. policy on the explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a former producer,destroyed more than three
million of its anti-personnel landmine stockpiles before it
signed the international convention last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Offers Free Treatment for TB Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
mandated all public hospitals across the east African country to
offer free treatment to tuberculosis (TB) patients due to the
alarming increase of the disease.
</P>
<P>
TB cases in Kenya rose quickly from about 10,000 in 1987 to
more than 42,000 in 1997, the Kenya Times newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
People living in congested environments and those faced with
problems of poor nutrition were at great risk of contracting the
disease, Kenyan Minister for Health Jackson Kalweo warned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The poor socio-economic status of most of our people coupled
with the rising number of those who are HIV infected and,
therefore, more predisposed to contracting tuberculosis, makes
the TB menace even more worrisome today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for intensified public awareness campaigns about the
disease which is now a close rival of the dreaded AIDS as a
killer.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that TB is killing
about three million people in the world annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan said Wednesday that renewed efforts would be made to
improve India's relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the joint sitting of both houses of
parliament here, the president reaffirmed India's commitment to
peace and cooperation among all nations and to enhancing its role
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian government would aim for greater economic
cooperation among developing countries, which is also a priority
of the non-aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government would not compromise on the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity nor bow to any
pressure on this front.
</P>
<P>
On domestic economic issues, the president said that the
government would step up investment in agriculture and
infrastructure, including foreign investment in core sectors, to
sustain a higher economic growth of 7-8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government would also strive for poverty eradication
through generating employment and sustaining a higher GDP (gross
domestic product) growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that "India can and shall be built by Indians,"
the president said that foreign direct investment (FDI) will be
encouraged in the core sectors of the economy and in physical
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Nayayanan said that the country's agriculture had suffered due
to declining investment in the past. The new government would
earmark up to 60 percent of the planned fund for this crucial
segment.
</P>
<P>
"Urgent measures will be taken to substantially step up
investment in infrastructure sectors, including power, roads and
bridges, railways, inland waterways, sea ports, shipping,
airports, telecommunications and information technology," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Denies Buying Castle in Scottish Highlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Tuesday night dismissed as a smear campaign reports that
he is buying a castle in the Scottish highlands, the Herald daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time he has rebutted such reports in as
many months. The first time was during his birthday last month.
</P>
<P>
Reports in the Sunday Times of Britain at the weekend said
that the president was trying to buy a castle in Scotland and
that he was already being dubbed the "king" of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
But a statement from his office last night said that the
report alleging that the president was trying to buy a castle
should be dismissed with the contempt it deserves.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the article was part of a wider smear
campaign launched by the president's detractors, most of whom
stand opposed to the land reform program adopted by the
government, to reverse the colonial legacy in this country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the president had already publicly invited
the British government to take over and sell all properties he is
alleged to personally own in the United Kingdom, and use the
proceeds for charitable purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times alleged that Mugabe had fallen in love with
the Scottish highlands during numerous visits in the past 17
years. It said that the president was believed to have made
inquiries about buying an ancient Scottish seat during the last
Commonwealth summit, held in Edinburgh in October last year.
</P>
<P>
It then listed a number of stately properties the newspaper
said were suitable for sale.

<HEADLINE> China's Potential For Developing New Markets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Because of the "soft landing" for
China's economy, consumer demand in urban areas is expected to
provide new possibilities in China's consumer market, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Until the mid-1980s, China's consumer goods were mainly
foodstuff and items for daily use, but the content and scale of
today's market are remarkably changed.
</P>
<P>
New housing demand in the next two years is estimated at 1.2
billion square meters, to take just one example, and annual real
estate sales are expected to be 60 billion yuan (about 7.2 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Demand for electronics and information is expected to grow 30
percent every year, with annual sales reaching 5.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 old private motor vehicles are expected to be
replaced every year, and demand this year will exceed 1.65 million
cars.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 million urban residents in China need certain community
services. Last year, the prices of 20 services rose 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is another sector with rapid growth. China's revenues
from international tourists exceeded 10 billion US dollars for two
consecutive years, while domestic tourism had over 20 percent
annual growth.

<P>
Consulting and advertising have grown 20 and 40 percent
respectively, and are expected to do a total of 130 billion
yuan in business by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Residential indoor fitting-up business is growing at an annual
rate of over 30 percent, and is worth about 60 billion yuan and
expected to rise to 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have also seen good growth and huge profits in the
medical, entertainment, and catering sectors.
</P>
<P>
The constant improvement in the standard of living and in
consumer standards indicates that China has entered a new period,
one analyst observed, and people's lives have gone from
quantity-oriented to quality-oriented.
</P>
<P>
However, because of regional disparities in consumption and
the backwardness of certain markets, more time is needed for
China's new markets to improve themselves.
</P>
<P>
Some people are saying that new efforts are needed for the
consumer environment, and that shopping by credit needs to be
encouraged in the housing, automobile, and medical care
markets.

NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government and the
European Union (EU) will spend 360 million Shillings (60 million
U.S. Dollars) to market Kenya abroad as a tourist destination,
local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and Wildlife Minister Henry Kosgey was quoted as
saying that the purse will be managed under a joint endowment
fund partly for the protection of fauna and wildlife and partly
for aggressive tourism marketing campaign home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, the east African country would go a long way in
restoring its status as a leading tourist destination on African
continent, he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has started emergency work on
infrastructural repairs following recent El Nino rains, which
will be completed in the next three months, he said following a
meeting with EU head of delegation Lutz Salzmann.
</P>
<P>
Salzmann said it was "extremely important" for the Kenyan
government to encourage the private sector to "play a larger
role" in tourism, the traditional largest foreign money earner
for the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the most important source of tourists for the Kenyan
market since it contributes about half of all tourists coming to
Kenya, said Kosgey.

The city now ranks third in China in exports of technology

<HEADLINE> Newly-Discovered City Wall Gives Outlines Of Old Chinese Kingdom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The recent discovery of a
600-meter city wall in south China has given archaeologists an
outline of the Shu Kingdom 3,500 years ago in modern-day Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
A north-south city wall was found on the northern part of the
Sanxingdui Ruins in Guanghan City, 40 kilometers north of Chengdu,
the capital of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1920s, Chinese and foreign archaeologists have done
many studies of the Ba-Shu culture in the province. In 1986, the
discovery of two large sacrificial pits there got a great deal of
attention.
</P>
<P>
"The newly-excavated wall, 2.8 meter high and 20 meter wide, is
made of rammed earth, on which a great number of pottery pieces
have been found," said experts. They determined that the age of
the wall could date back to 3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Seven pits used for sacrificial offerings were also unearthed on
the southern part of the Ruins. Most of them were three meters
long and 1.5 meter wide, in which body remains, jade, elephant
tusks and stone-made balls have been collected.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed the new discovery will shed light on the study
of religious ceremonies and sacrificial activities held in the
region in ancient times.

<P>
Municipal government sources say that it will introduce 50

companies. They are also encouraged to cooperate with western
technology companies to establish large groups.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai spent 600 million yuan on 185 cooperative projects in
inland areas in 1997, and, in helping resettle local people around

NANJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Wang Li, an 11-year-old girl from
a small village in east China's Jiangsu Province who never smiled

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Jobless Beijing urban residents
are encouraged to earn their bread in the countryside by opening
up waste hilly land.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a new policy of the Beijing Municipal
People's Government, jobless urban dwellers can contract waste
hilly land for 50 years with tax exemption of one to three
years on their products.
</P>
<P>
The new farmers can enjoy reduced tax or tax-free policies when
their harvests are hit by natural disasters or other unavoidable
calamities.
</P>
<P>
Urban dwellers who find "new employment" in the rural areas can
still enjoy unemployment subsidies, according to the new policy.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 35,000 registered jobless people. About 170,000
people have been laid off. Laid-off people are not counted in the
number of jobless people because they still receive some bottom
line benefits from their employers.

<HEADLINE> People in Gansu No Longer Have To Face Grain Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- In northwest China's Gansu
Province, people see the self-sufficiency in grain supplies as the
biggest change since China started its reforms and opening up
twenty years ago.
</P>
<P>
Because of harsh conditions and frequent droughts, Gansu was
always short of grain, but this changed with the reforms. The
province has had from 6 to 7 billion kg of grain for two
continuous years.
</P>
<P>
Although Gansu suffered from droughts in 1997, it still
harvested 7.65 billion kilograms of grain, the second highest
output in its history. And it now has more than four billion
kilograms of grain in storage, a record high.
</P>
<P>
This means more than 300 kilograms per person and self
sufficiency in grain.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has also changed the situation with other products, with
production of 740,000 tons of meat, 150,000 tons of eggs, and
115,000 tons of milk in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It has also become an important supply center for vegetables,
fruits, and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Before the reforms, 72 percent of its rural people lived in
poverty, and Gansu was infamous for this. Now, after fourteen
years of poverty-relief work, 10 million of these people
eliminated poverty. A fifth of the peasants in the province now
lead better lives. In 1997, peasants made 1,210 yuan annually per
person, up 110 yuan from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> 2 Airborn Warning Planes Arrive in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two airborne warning and control
system (AWACS) planes which Japan bought from the United States
arrived at an Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) base in central Japan
on Wednesday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The two E-767 AWACS planes are part of the four U.S. military
surveillance planes which Japan had ordered from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two remodeled Boeing 767 passenger planes flew into the
base in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, shortly before noon, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
They are Japan's first-ever AWACS planes, which are known as
"flying headquarters" because of their ability to track the
positions of all aircraft, naval vessels and ground troops within
a radius of 800 kilometers and send the information to command
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The AWACS has a disk-shaped, jam-resistant radar on top of its
body and can fly for 12 hours without refueling.
</P>
<P>
AWACS planes cost between 54 billion and 57 billion yen (about
415 million and 439 million U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the E-2C "Hawkeye," the E-767s can cover a wider
range of areas and are particularly good at monitoring at low
altitudes, Defense Agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Agency plans to deploy two more AWACS planes at the
end of fiscal 1998, which ends March 31, 1999, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Deposit Rates Soar in Indonesia After Hike in SBIs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in Indonesia
have raised interest rates on one-month deposits to as high as
67.5 percent, following the sharp rise in central bank certificate
note (SBI) rate on Monday, local leading newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rates are the highest seen during the past three decades,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that excessively high interest rates, if
maintained for a long period of time, will annihilate an already
weak banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"If banks have to offer high rates they will eventually
collapse because they cannot afford to pay the gains which will
accrue to deposits," banking expert Sultan Remy Sjahdeni said.
</P>
<P>
State Bank Dagang Negara (BDN) offered the highest interest
rates to its customers Tuesday. The bank's rates for a one-month
deposit more than doubled, jumping to 67.5 percent per annum, up
from 33 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on state Bank Rakyat Indonesia one month
deposits rose from 33 percent to 50 percent per annum, while State
Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) raised interest rates from 33 percent
to 56 percent for one-month deposits.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest private bank, Bank Central Asia (BCA),
hiked one month interest rates to 54.5 percent from 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bank Indonesia, the central bank, raised its
certificate interest rate (SBIs) sharply. Rates on overnight SBIs
stayed at 40 percent, rates on two-day were raised to 41 percent,
three-to-six day rates were raised to 42 percent, one week rates
were raised to 43 percent, two-week rates to 44 percent and one
month rates to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the SBI rate increase on Monday, Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin said the move was intended to absorb
excess liquidity in the market which could lead to higher
inflation and further weakening of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
A banking expert questioned the efficacy of using interest
rates to shore up the rupiah for a long period.
</P>
<P>
"It will be effective in the very short-term only," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank's country director Dennis De Tray said
here Tuesday, "if the interest rate is not raised now, the
inflation rate can go up very quickly and the rupiah can drop very
substantially ... Nobody likes a high interest rate, but right now
it is essential to stabilize the economy."
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July last year and the prices of basic
commodities in the country also increased by 50 to 400 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study Claims 10 Million Americans Still Experience Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite strong economic
growth, 10 million people in the United States, including 4
million children, do not get enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
According to a study released Tuesday by Cornell University and
the National Center for Health Statistics, six percent of American
children and 14 percent of the poor go hungry.
</P>
<P>
The study's lead author, Cornell doctoral candidate Katherine
Alaimo, said that it is not just the unemployed or single-parent
families who do not get enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
"More Americans who do not have enough to eat live in families
of married couples with children than in other types of families,"
Alaimo said.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 4.5 million non-Hispanic whites, 2.4
million non-Hispanic blacks and 2.4 million Mexican Americans are
underfed.
</P>
<P>
Alaimo said the issue is still a serious problem in the United
States, and it is not limited to low-income persons, specific
racial or ethnic groups, certain family types or the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
She also claims families that go hungry are also twice as
likely as others to forego medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
"Many low-income, uninsured Americans may be making the choice
between health care and paying for food," She said.
</P>
<P>
The study of 30,000 people was conducted from 1988 to 1994. It
will be published in the March issue of the American Journal of
Public Health.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Acts to Cushion Shock of Oil Price Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government has
cut public spending and slowed down its economic pace in an effort
to cushion the negative impact of the global decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Mexican government has
cut its public spending by 1.5 percent (200 million U.S. dollars),
and adjusted the economic growth rate to 4.8 percent from the
planned 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has stablized the currency market, reducing two million
pesos (235,000 dollars) worth of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include encouraging exports of manufactured,
agricultural and animal husbandry products and reducing the volume
of oil exports together with other oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported that more measures such as further
spending cuts and tax raises were under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Income from oil exports accounts for 30 percent of Mexico's
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the global oil price crisis, Mexico's foreign
currency income in February declined by 248 million dollars from
January to 562 million dollars, down 37.4 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
This caused the country's trade deficit to rise by 49 million
dollars from January to 635 million dollars in February.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Asked to Study Race and Traffic Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a bill Tuesday requiring the Justice
Department to determine the racial breakdown for routine traffic
stops made by state and local police.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few of us in this country who have not been
stopped at one time for an alleged traffic violation that we
thought constituted really simple racial harassment," said
Representative John Conyers, a Democrat, who is black.
</P>
<P>
Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and the
chief author of the bill, cited figures showing that blacks, who
make up about 14 percent of the population, account for 72 percent
of drivers pulled over for routine traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed by voice vote, would require the
attorney general to conduct a study on traffic stops and include
the age and race or ethnic background of the person stopped, the
alleged traffic violation and whether car searches were conducted
and contraband discovered.
</P>
<P>
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee of the House of
Representatives pushed through an amendment making clear that the
data acquired under the study cannot be used in discrimination
cases.
</P>
<P>
Representative Henry Hyde, a Republican and the Judiciary
Committee chairman, said the legislation has the support of the
administration and can help promote police awareness of the
problems of "profiling," in which cars are stopped based on the
race, age or dress of the occupants.
</P>
<P>
He said there were a "growing number of reported incidents and
allegations that black American males are being stopped for no
reason" and in violation of Fourth Amendment prohibitions against
unlawful searches and seizures. The Senate has not passed the
bill.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Proposes Bartering Oil for Thai Jet Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has proposed bartering oil
for the F/A-18 jet fighters which Thailand ordered but can no
longer afford to buy from the United States, the Bangkok Post said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a source as saying that if the two
countries can reach an oil-for-jet deal, the Petroleum Authority
of Thailand (PTT) will pay the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
"PTT usually buys petrol from Kuwait, so Kuwait will give oil
to PTT instead of money for the jets and the Air Force will
collect money from PTT," the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has been seeking a third party to buy the U.S.
fighters and reimbursement for a 74.5 million dollar deposit.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Supreme Commander General Mongkol
Ampornpisit is negotiating with Kuwait and Chile, which have
expressed interest in the planes.
</P>
<P>
Both Air Force chief Thananit Niamthan and General Mongkol said
 they were expecting good news from Kuwait but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Thananit said the deal should be closed before the end of this
month or the United States would take back the aircraft and the
Air Force would lose the deposit.
</P>
<P>
General Mongkol said he was seeking to have the deadline
extended so as to obtain more time to negotiate with prospective
buyers.

COLOMBO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and Indonesia are
jointly investigating an international racket in the trafficking
of illegal immigrants, The Daily News quoted Foreign Ministry
sources as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Five such immigrants who were arrested last week at Jakarta

Another group of ten who were arrested in similar circumstances
also at the Jakarta International Airport were deported back to

</P>
<P>
They were carrying forged boarding passes and air tickets of an
international airline when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that several agencies in Colombo are producing
these forged travel documents and supplying them to an Indonesian
contact.
</P>
<P>
Assistance of the Australian government is also to be sought in
tracking down the racketeers, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Czech Tourism Slides in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tourism income of the Czech
Republic was 3.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a 10.5 percent
drop from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In remarks published by the local press Tuesday, The Czech
Regional Development and Housing Ministry said the proportion of
tourism income in the gross domestic product (GDP) decreased last
year to seven percent from 7.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange income from tourism fell from 18.8 percent to
16.2 percent in the overall foreign trade figure, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is rich in tourism resources, with Prague
enjoying the fame as a model of architectural art.
</P>
<P>
Overall, tourism income has been rising steadily since 1992
with the number of foreign travelers increasing annually.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the unusual floods last July in eastern areas of
the Czehc Republic are the main reason leading to last year's
reduction in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Political instability, deteriorating social order and poor
services are also believed to contribute to the 1997 slide.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Acts to Stabilize Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso has recently
shown signs of stabilization due to improvement in the regional
financial situation and the Philippine Central Bank's efforts in
combating the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 trading days, the peso appreciated from 40
pesos per U.S. dollar to 37.31 pesos a dollar, the highest in
recent months. Compared with the lowest level in January this
year, the peso rallied 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the composite index of the Philippine Stock Exchange
also went up gradually, reaching 2,310 points on Monday, the
highest level since the financial storm began hitting Southeast
Asia in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The extremely high interest rates which were killing the
country's economy also began falling down. The bankers have agreed
to bring down their prime lending rates to between 17 and 23
percent this week.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed these to the improvement of the
regional financial situation. However, Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said more credit should be given to the various
reforms and measures taken by the country to stabilize the peso.
</P>
<P>
After the currency crisis started last July, the central bank
first strengthened its management of liquidity in the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
It raised its overnight borrowing and lending rates to 32
percent and 34 percent respectively, almost double the pre-peso
depreciation level. In the meantime, it increased banks' liquidity
reserve to 8 percent from 2 percent on top of the 13 percent
statutory reserve.
</P>
<P>
But the tightened liquidity failed to strengthen the peso since
it was mainly affected by the turbulence in the Thai baht and the
Indonesian rupiah. Therefore the central bank lowered the
borrowing and lending rates subsequently.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the bank strengthened its supervision of the banks'
foreign exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
To stop the banks from speculating in the peso, the central
bank reduced their allowable overbought foreign exchange position
from 20 percent to 5 percent while raising their oversold position
to 20 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also required the banks to consolidate the accounts with
their subsidiaries and affiliates to prevent possible
circumvention of the monetary authorities by coursing foreign
exchange transactions through the subsidiaries and affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also introduced a currency risk protection
program called the "non-deliverable forward" facility. The
facility eased the strain on the spot market and satisfied those
who wanted to buy dollar to cover immature foreign currency
obligations in fears of a further peso depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the central bank reinforced the financial system.
Since the crisis was triggered by excessive bad loans brought
about by the real estate sector, the central bank capped the
banks' exposure to the sector to no more than 20 percent of their
loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the rapid growth of bad loans, it ordered the banks
to set up 2 percent of their loan portfolio as a loan-loss
provision within three years. Later the bank decided to accelerate
the implementation of this rule.
</P>
<P>
To help lower the interest rates, the central bank also
re-opened a 30-day lending window to the banks, set up a
peso-dollar swap scheme for banks without government securities
holdings and began purchasing the government securities at market
rates.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, the Philippine financial system
has begun stabilizing, but it does not mean that the financial
storm has been over. The peso might depreciate again if the
currencies in other countries fall anew into turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Demands Greater Efforts in Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's President Jose
Maria Figueres Tuesday urged countries in the western hemisphere
to exert more efforts to fight drug dealing and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
"All countries have the same responsibility to eliminate the
problem of drug supply and demand," Figueres said on the first day
of the 16th International Conference on Drug Fighting.
</P>
<P>
These two factors are "part of the problem and are also a road
to the solution," Figueres said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the U.S. Anti-drug
Agency (DEA) and the Costa Rican Ministry of Public Security, is
aimed at promoting regional cooperation in fighting drugs in the
western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug police officers from more than 30 countries attended
the meeting, which is scheduled to end Thursday. Among those
attending are General Jose Serrano, head of the Colombian National
Police and Thomas Constantine, head of the DEA.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the results of work performed by South
and Central American countries and Mexico will be evaluated by
representatives from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Some of the countries with the largest narcotic production are
located in South America, while the U.S. is considered the major
consumer of drugs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to information released by the U.S. State Department,
Peru, Colombia and Bolivia produce almost 98 percent of the
cocaine consumed worldwide. Every year, these countries illegally
export about 760 tons of cocaine, while the U.S. is the recipient
of more than 300 tons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Opt for Mexican Model in Debt Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is to adopt a revised
version of the Mexican model to solve its private sector overseas
debt crisis, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
This would likely include a grace period of a few years and
provide an affordable exchange rate for the rupiah, the national
currency, against the U.S. dollar, State Minister of the
Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng said here Tuesday
night following a meeting between the country's debt settlement
team and experts from Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give further details as the model is still
being refined, including through further discussions with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under severe pressure since July last year,
plunging to its lowest level of 17,000 to the U.S. dollar in
January, compared with 2,450 rupiah in the pre-crisis period in
July. It is currently trading at about 8,500 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
This has made most indebted companies technically bankrupt as
their foreign debts exceed their equity. Mexico experienced a
similar problem in 1984, Tanri said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December last year, Indonesia's foreign debt
totaled 137.424 billion U.S. dollars, including 63.462 billion
dollars in government debt and 73.926 billion dollars in private
sector debt.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that the aim of the model is not just to
lessen demand for dollars and thus shore up the ailing rupiah but
also to help the private sector resume business to reduce
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Mexican model is workable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said Japan has accepted Indonesia's proposal
to settle its private sector foreign debts with Japanese banks
over a period of three to four years.
</P>
<P>
"But the terms of repayment will be adjusted according to
(changing) conditions in Indonesia and must first be discussed
with the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 40 percent of Indonesia's private sector
debts are owed to Japanese banks and companies.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Frame New Law to Protect Women, Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina told the parliament Tuesday that her government had decided
to enact a more effective and complete law to contain crimes
against women and children, press reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An experts' committee is now examining framing of a new law to
cope with the changing nature and volume of such crimes, and
secure public life, the prime minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experience had proved that the existing laws were inadequate to
deal with such crimes, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Cases relating to terrorist acts like acid-throwing, rape,
child-trafficking and killing for dowry needed quick disposal, she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Addressing the offenses against women and children is very
important and is a must," because women and children constitute
more than two-thirds (70.63 percent) of the country's 124.3
million population, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the proposed law "should also have provisions for
penalizing the criminal for the loss or injury caused to the
victim."
</P>
<P>
"Mere enactment of legislation or a government initiative is
not enough," she said, adding "all social forces irrespective of
their political beliefs and affiliations should come forward to
uproot the social curse."
</P>
<P>
Besides, law enforcers should perform their duty neutrally and
all concerned should make concerted efforts for this, the prime
minister added.

<HEADLINE> 3000 Wait for Heart Operations in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National Hospital in
Colombo has a waiting list of 3,000 patients for heart operations
and most of them are children with congenital heart defects, The
Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted hospital sources as saying that due to the
limited facilities available at the hospital only about 400
operations could be done annually.
</P>
<P>
Until the heavy backlog is reduced, the hospital will not list
new patients for operations.
</P>
<P>
A Sri Lankan doctor, Dudley Halpe, residing in the United
States, has recently come to Sri Lanka with a team of heart
surgeons from the United States and conducted 12 complicated
pediatric operations which could not be done by local doctors, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Annually in Sri Lanka about 2,500 children are born with
congenital heart conditions. Some of them die a few months after
birth and some recover naturally while about 2,000 have to undergo
surgery.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has three hospitals which conduct major heart
surgery. A considerable number of major heart operations including
by-pass ones are conducted at these hospitals, enabling patients
to get treatment for their conditions without going abroad, the
paper added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Helps Poor out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Lei Renyi in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province has helped more than 10,000 of his
country people out of poverty in the past six years, and was
chosen as one of the country's top 10 poverty-relief masters.
</P>
<P>
Wulipu, Lei's home village in Weinan city, had long been
plagued by poverty. In the mid-1980s, Lei, together with other
villagers, began to start township enterprises. And now, the
village has grown into a group, involving agriculture, industry,
and business, with more than 200 million yuan in annual output
value, and nearly 3,000 yuan in per-capita income.
</P>
<P>
A better-off Lei turned to Yanyu Village at the northern foot
of the Qinling Mountains in 1991. He invited some experts on
agriculture and forestry to work out an outline to help the
village develop apples and cash forests.
</P>
<P>
He sponsored some villagers to visit developed areas elsewhere,
to go to college, to set up schools, and to open training classes
on science and technology. He also set aside 40,000 yuan for the
village to start business.
</P>
<P>
As a result, each farmer in the long starved Yanyu can have 500
kilograms of grain, and 1,500 yuan in annual income.
</P>
<P>
Another three villages and a township have also benefited from
Lei's effort. Now, the city has 315 poverty-relief pairs of the
kind, involving approximately 100,000 people.

MADRID, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Jaermann of Switzerland won
the second stage of the Catalan Week cycling race on Tuesday in
Castello d'empuries, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss bursted out some 12 kilometers from the sprint line
and finished several seconds before other riders.
</P>
<P>
Jaermann overcame teammate Stephane Barthe to be the overall
leader with a 20-second gap.
</P>
<P>
Italians Filippo Casagrande and Paolo Bettini finished second
and third repectively.
</P>
<P>
Hard wins hauled riders to finish over one hour more than
expected in the 161-kilometer stage.
</P>
<P>
The race was also hindered when a car slipped through police
controls and was driving towards riders, while most of the leading
group and several team cars took the wrong turning with about 20
kilometers left to ride.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's stage will be the toughest as the 174-kilometer
course is to run over the Rasos de Peguera hill from Castello

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Won't Cut Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 24 (xinhua) -- Ecuador will not cut its present
petroleum production while some OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers
decide to do so in a joint effort to rescue oil prices, Ecuadoran
Energy Minister Alvaro Bermeo said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Ecuador is going to keep its production level for two
reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"First, Ecuador is not an OPEC member state any more and
secondly, our petroleum production is so low compared with OPEC
members that nothing will happen if we increase or keep our
production levels."
</P>
<P>
Ecuador quit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mexico and some OPEC member states including
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela reached an agreement to cut
production so as to stablize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Their decision followed an oil glut in recent months that has
depressed oil prices on world markets to a nine-year low. It
resulted from a Saudi Arabia-led initiative last November to raise
the OPEC production ceiling by around 10 percent, to 27.5 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
"We see a positive panorama for the petroleum market. But one
should wait to speak about realities and not only about
blueprints", Bermeo said.
</P>
<P>
He was satisfied with a possible recovery of crude prices
because that would have a significant effect upon the internal
revenue of his country.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum production finances 47 percent of Ecuador's general
budget.
</P>
<P>
Without doubt the resolution to level petroleum demand and
supply would pump up the price of the crude barrel, Bermeo said.

<HEADLINE> Korda Bounces Out, Hingis Overtakes Serena Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Open champion Petr
Korda of Czech Republic saw another world number one hope all but
evaporated when he bounced out of the Lipton tennis Championships
before reaching quarter-final on Tuesday in Key Biscayne, Florida.
</P>
<P>
While world number one Martina Hingis of Switzerland fought
back solid challenge from Serena Williams in an tense
quarter-final encounter.
</P>
<P>
Korda, who surrendered twice to take over the world top ranking
from American Pete Sampras earlier this year, fell to 20th-ranked
Tim Henman of Britain in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Czech could have become number one by reaching
the semi-finals this week.
</P>
<P>
Hingis just survived the younger of the beaded Williams sisters
in a 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4) victory.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss sensation, 17, who edged her one-year-old-younger
opponent on experience, saved two match points and needed a
third-set tie-break to move up to next round.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Greg Rusedski of Britain also missed his chance to
usurp Sampras' throne as he was upended 6-2, 6-2 by Thomas Enqvise
of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The only player left with a chance to pull down Sampras from
his throne this week is third-ranked Marcelo Rios of Chile, who
can claim the top spot by winning the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Rios moved a step up by a 6-2, 6-3 victory
over Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
American Jeff Tarango upset sixth-seeded Russian Yevgeny
Kafelnikov to advance to the quarter-fianls, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen-year-old Russian prodigy Anna Kournikova needed just 50
minutes to crush out ninth-seeded Sapniard Conchita Martinez, 6-3,
6-0 in a fourth-round match.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Russian Cooperation to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said Tuesday that despite the reshuffle of the Russian
cabinet, his country will continue to cooperate with Russia,
especially regarding integration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Russia is a normal affair of constitution. It
is a natural process to reshuffle the government, particularly
during a complicated transitional period," Nazarbayev said Tuesday
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate reforms in Russia needs new strength and new
thoughts, he said. It has occurred before in Kazakhstan and other
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kazakhstan and Russia will continue to
develop despite the change in Russia, he said. Russian President
Boris Yeltsin has declared that Russia's current economic policy
will not change, and it will benefit peoples of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin appointed Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko as acting
prime minister after he sacked Viktor Chernomyrdin and the entire
cabinet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle came after Yeltsin censured the government during
weekend meetings for its chronic failure to pay back wages and
pensions to millions of Russians.

BUCHAREST, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The shakeup in Russia's
government will not have any negative impact on its domestic
situation or the international community, parliamentary leaders of
associate members of the European Union (EU) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders made this observation at a news conference here
after ending a two-day meeting. European Parliament President
Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, and parliamentary leaders from ten EU
associate member countries, attended the conference, the fifth of
its sort.
</P>
<P>
The big reshuffle of the Russian government would not affect
Russia's stability or its foreign policy orientation, said Jan
Diaconescu, chairman of Romania's Chamber of Deputies.
</P>

Gil-Delgado agreed but stressed that it was necessary to find
the real reason behind the reshuffle, and watch the main
guidelines set by Russia in the future.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin appointed Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko as acting
prime minister after he sacked Viktor Chernomyrdin and the entire

Yeltsin's decision, said Chairman of Lithuanian Parliament

<P>
SOFIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany will help Bulgaria in its
future talks with the European Commission on the country's
accession to the European Union (EU), German Minister of Economics
Guenter Rexrodt told Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov at a
meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt, who arrived here Monday with a large business
delegation, told reporters after the meeting that he was confident
the accession talks would start shortly.
</P>
<P>
Referring to German assistance to the recovery of Bulgaria's
economy, Rexrodt said that a state bank for small and medium-sized
business promotion will be established in Bulgaria with German
capital within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said the pending establishment of a bank promoting small and
medium-sized business and banking privatization in Bulgaria would
help the recovery of the Bulgarian economy.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said during the meeting that although Germany is the
number one investor in Bulgaria, the size of German investment is
extremely insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, agreements were signed between Siemens and
the Energy Committee, and between the Bulgarian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and Berlin's Chamber of Wholesale and
Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Bulgarian Trade and Tourism
Minister Valentin Vassilev, Rexrodt expressed satisfaction with
the development of Bulgarian-German trade and economic relations,
and stressed they had a vast, still untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt's visit is the first by a German minister of economics
in 13 years. The large business delegation is indicative of the
strong interest German businessmen are showing in Bulgaria, said
Rexrodt.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Mounts on Yugoslavia to Recognize Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has not yet met the
demands made by "international communities" to resolve the Kosovo
issue and pressure on the country must be maintained,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will need to maintain credible pressure on Belgrade to have
(Yugoslavian President Slobodan) Milosevic meet the requirements that
were placed on him by the Contact Group in London," Albright told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said this at a press conference held after talks with her
Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring every diplomatic option open for moving the
process of dialogue in Kosovo forward. My message can succeed, but
only if we stick together," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Dini urged Kosovo authorities to talk with
Belgrade without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
There is no process for Kosovo to seek independence, the
Italian Foreign Minister said.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Dini, Albright left Rome for Bonn, where a
Contact Group meeting was scheduled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, which
includes Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the U.S. and Russia, was
established to bring peace to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Albright will chair Wednesday's meeting. It will consider
whether or not to impose new sanctions on Yugoslavia because of
the recent ethnic conflicts in the Serbian province of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Myanmar to Prevent Border Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has urged Myanmar to
prevent incursion by Myanmar-based Karen guerrillas into Thailand
in order to demonstrate unity of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Ambassador to Thailand Hla Maung was summoned to the
Thai Foreign Ministry on Tuesday to hear a letter of protest
against an armed attack by Karen guerrillas on a refugee camp on
the Thai-Myanmar border, Wednesday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The protest letter clearly identified the Democratic Karen
Buddhist Army (DKBA), a Karen splinter group, as the attacker.
</P>
<P>
"The incident affected the Yangon-Bangkok relationship, both of
which are members of ASEAN," Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra said after his meeting with the Myanmar
envoy.
</P>
<P>
He added that both countries should show the international
community that ASEAN members are ready to cooperate with one
another, and that the two countries could walk hand in hand to a
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers takes place in
July. Myanmar joined the grouping last year.
</P>
<P>
Some DKBA guerrillas crossed into Thailand on Monday and raided
the refugee camp, killing one person and wounding 13 others. In
the past, DKBA forces carried out scores of attacks on Karen
refugees taking shelter in Thailand, believing that the displaced
population harbors and supports the DKBA's rivals.
</P>
<P>
A top Myanmar general said at the weekend that Myanmar troops
were not involved in the recent spate of attacks and had no
control over the Karen guerrillas. He said the Thai Army could
take any action deemed necessary to counter the raids, according
to the Bangkok Post.

<P>
TAIYUAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province, a
major coal producer, has designated a number of industries that
overseas companies are encouraged to invest in.
</P>
<P>
Xue Jun, the province's vice-governor, says that overseas
investors are being encouraged to invest in basic industries,
infrastructure, high-tech industries, environmental protection,
and agriculture development.
</P>
<P>
He says that in the past few years, overseas investment has
been increasing in the province's power industry, expressway
projects, and large water control projects, but that the
province is still short of overseas investment in high-tech and
environmental protection industries.
</P>
<P>
He adds that Shanxi will make a greater effort to get more
overseas investment for electronic information, bio-engineering,
new energy, and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are also encouraged to assist the reform of
state-owned enterprises and to develop the service sector.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Traffic Police Trying To Serve People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Getting a flat tire on your
bicycle out on the highway all of a sudden can be a real headache,
but not necessarily if you happen to be in Nanning, capital of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Any traffic police station there can provide you with
medicines, a bicycle pump, a map, a weather report, and the
policemen may even roll up their sleeves and give you a hand.
</P>
<P>
This under-developed city has 1.28 million people from
different ethnic groups and 220,000 motor vehicles and no money to
improve its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, the city is known for its orderly traffic and lack of
accidents, thanks to the efforts of the traffic administration.
</P>
<P>
"Traffic police should set a good example for the common
people, as a great way to contribute to the city's promotion of
ethic progress," said one traffic administration officer.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the city's traffic police have dealt
with 12,370 unlawful activities and in the second half of last
year, helped repair over 2,000 motor vehicles and bicycles free of
charge and helped get 840 seriously-ill people to hospital.
</P>
<P>
To improve people's traffic awareness, the traffic
administration organizes publicity campaigns regularly, and since
last August, has taken steps to keep drivers from sounding their
horns in downtown areas. A test by the department on September 1,
1997 showed that the noise level in the downtown area was 69.9
decibels, which is below the state's level.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the city's Vehicle Administration has
bought 25 computers to help its staff provide more convenient and
accurate services for vehicle owners.
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, an applicant had to wait 15 days before
getting a driver's license, but now the whole procedure takes only
one hour.
</P>
<P>
Its complaint box and phone have 30 volunteers to help its
staff, a move that has been praised by the general public.
</P>
<P>
One senior officer in charge of traffic explains: "Traffic
police should provide a range of services for the public and play
a leading role in shaping a new image for the city."

<HEADLINE> WB, ADB Pledge "Safety net" aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) have pledged to provide humanitarian aid to
Indonesia under a short-term safety-net program in order to help
the country overcome its economic turmoil, Antara News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made Tuesday here by executives of the two
banks when meeting with Indonesian Vice President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's country director Dennis De Tray said after the
meeting besides the humanitarian aid, his institution would also
encouraged other donors to extend help to the poor here.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very careful assessment of food needs, contraception
needs and hospital supports ...," De Tray said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government needs at least 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars worth of essential commodities for this year, comprising 1
billion U.S. dollars for the importation of rice, and the
remainder for other staples, medicine and hospital equipment,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ADB's program director Shoji Nishimoto said the bank
would allocate up to 300 million U.S. dollars for social
safety-net activities in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance will primarily focus on restructuring and
modernizing the banking sector, but beyond that we are also
working on social safety net, basic education and health
services," Nishimoto said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has committed 4.5 billion U.S. dollars and the
ADB 3.5 billion U.S. dollars to the 43-billion-U.S. dollar rescue
package organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the
country last year.
</P>
<P>
De Tray disclosed the World Bank plans to have a technical
meeting in Washington on April 1 to discuss with donot partners on
how to address humanitarian issues.

<P>
PRAGUE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The government reshuffle in Moscow
would not lead to a change in Russia's foreign policy, Rodolf
Hykl, the news bureau chief from the Czech Foreign Ministry said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government has no reason to believe that the change
in Russia's government personnel will bring about a change in its
foreign policy, or a change in its position on NATO expansion,
Hykl was quoted as saying by the Czech News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government believes Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
dismissal of the cabinet headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin aimed to
"further strengthen Russia's reform policy," Deputy Prime Minister
and Agriculture Minister Josef Lux was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin dismissed the entire cabinet headed by Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Yeltsin spoke highly of the work of dismissed
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev at a meeting with presidential administration
executives.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the two men are likely to retain their posts
in a new government yet to be formed, Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
killed and 11 others wounded when two boys in camouflage ambushed
a group of middle school students in Arkansas Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects, ages 11 and 13, were taking into custody after
the 12:40 p.m. shooting outside Westside Middle School in
Jonesboro, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded were two teachers and others were mostly
little girls.
</P>
<P>
The two boys were taken to the county jail. Two rifles and
other weapons were recovered.
</P>
<P>
The school has about 250 students in sixth and seventh grades.
It was unclear whether the suspects were students at the school.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was on
his six-nation tour in Africa, said that he was "shocked and
heartbroken" by the deadly shooting.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth fatal shooting rampage in a school in the
past five months.
</P>
<P>
On December 1, a 14-year-old student opened fire on a student
prayer circle in a hallway at Heath High School in West Paducah,
Kentucky. Three students were killed and five others wounded.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, a 14-year-old boy was arrested after wounding
two students outside a school in Stamps, Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Will Set up JV for Photo Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Approved by the State Council, a
joint venture to make photo materials will be established in east
China, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper said that the project will
involve over one billion US dollars from Eastman Kodak, one of the
biggest investments by a US company.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Kodak will form two new companies with Chinese
partners to make and market colour film, medical and industrial
X-ray film and other products in China and elsewhere in Asia.
Kodak already makes cameras, components and other products in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese companies in the ventures are Shantou Era Photo
Materials in Guangdong Province and Xiamen Fuda Photo Materials in
Fujian Province, both of which make color film and paper; and Wuxi
Aermei Film and Chemical Corp of Jiangsu Province, which makes
medical and industrial X-ray film.
</P>
<P>
According to a market survey jointly done by the China
Enterprise Management Association, the China Enterprise
Association and the State Enterprise Information Exchange Center,
the sale of Kodak film, which ranked second to Fuji in China in
1996, jumped to first place last year with about a 39 percent
market share in China.
</P>
<P>
Kodak earned five million US dollars last year on sales of 14.7
billion US dollars after taking a 1.5 billion US dollars
restructuring charge and setting plans to cut 20,000 jobs, the
paper said.

When some construction workers saw the animal, they immediately
reported it to their leaders, and began organizing the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
After struggling in the freezing water for over 10 minutes,
they managed to get the leopard onto the bank.
</P>
<P>
The animal, which is a meter in length and weighs 60 kg, is
suffering from a cold and some internal injuries, but
veterinarians at the zoo are giving it special attention.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Latin American economists are
considering the effects of the wake of Asian financial crisis in
forecasting a regional economic growth of five percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moneta, permanent secretary of the Latin-American
Economic System, made the point on Tuesday. He said the growth
rate last January was estimated at merely 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chile, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, with an 80 percent share of
the region's trade with Asian countries, are the four suffering
most from the crisis, Moneta said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Latin America was better prepared than before
to face such a crisis, as could be seen in Brazil's case which
was starting to show recovery signs.
</P>
<P>
As for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Moneta criticized
the organization for trying to apply the same solution to all
Asian-Pacific countries hit by the crisis by pressing them to open
their markets to the United States.

<P>
LHASA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, governments at all
levels in Tibet Autonomous Region have attached great importance
to the development of women and children affairs.
</P>
<P>
A number of local laws and regulations to protect the rights of
women and children have been issued by the regional government,
while all the 65 county-level administrative areas have set up
their own coordinative body on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has sent 22 local county magistrates to
attend national training programs on implementing national
policies on protecting women and children.
</P>
<P>
To better understand the situation in Tibet, two regional
government departments have jointly worked out a supervisional
system on the conditions of local children. Four government
reports on the issue have been completed and handed over to
related international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Tibet has invested 10.14 million yuan, including
1.22 million yuan from the Unicef, in the construction of women
and children's centers in five cities and prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has tried hard to help more local women
become government staff workers. A five-year plan (1996-2000) has
been worked out for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, women officials had accounted for 31
percent of the total in the autonomous region, 6.28 percentage
points over that of 1993. Meanwhile, women made up 10.94 percent
of the total number of regional leaders in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, efforts are being been made to protect legal
rights of women and children. Project Hope, a national
non-government program to help students from poor families, has
also benefited Tibetan children as more than 10,000 local school
drop-outs have returned to school.

<HEADLINE> EU Plans Action against French Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Commission
Tuesday planned action against the French organizers of the 1998
World Cup for rejecting demands to sell all remaining tickets
outside France.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, commissioner in charge of market competition,
said the commission had to take a last-minute decision on sending
France a letter of warning prior to taking the action it was
planning.
</P>
<P>
A fine of up to 10 percent of the turnover from what the
commissioner described as wrongly-sole tickets was among a couple
of measures the commission was planning.
</P>
<P>
But Van Miert said that it was impossible now to calculate the
number of the wrongly-sold tickets.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also did not rule out the possiblity of taking
the French organizers to the European court of justice in that he
argued selling the remaining tickets to French residents only was
a discrimination running against the Article 86 of the EU
cmpetition law.
</P>
<P>
The French organizers have so far received 2 million ticket
request for the 64 games to be played during this year's grand
finale in France.
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining 160,000 tickets, 50,000 have been promised to
the football associations of the European Union nations whereas
the remainder will be sold to French supporters, according to the
organizers' planning.
</P>
<P>
The EU has demanded to sell the remaining tickets on a
first-come-first-serve basis and yet the French organizers did not
heed the demand.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert said that the commission had been promised a final
reply by the French organizers for mid-last week but did not get
any word until late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The French did not even make a sporting gesture by allowing
non-resident supporters to have enve a phone call chance,"said Van
Miert, "It would be fair for others to have some chance at least."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the EU would have respected the
organizers' rules shoule they have accepted the EU proposal and
redressed the issue.

<P>
LIMA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Peru represented 24.6
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, said the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
But statistics show that the investment rate has been declining
throughout last year, from 25 percent in the first three months to
24 percent in the last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly attributed to the Asian crisis, which
made it difficult to draw new investment in mining and tourism
sectors, due to the decline on mineral's international prices, the
bank said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The rate of domestic savings also fell from 20.3 percent in the
first three months to 16.9 percent in the last quarter of the
year, while public sector savings went from 6.5 percent to 1.9
percent.

<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>

after the digital, or high-definition TV, broadcasting is
introduced on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> Albright, Primakov Meet in Germany on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her Russian counterpart, Yevgeni Primakov,
met here Tuesday evening to prepare for a Contact Group meeting in
Bonn Wednesday which will seek further measures to end the
conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Without disclosing details, Primakov said after the meeting
that he expected a substantial development at the Contact Group
talks which will also be attended by foreign ministers from
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up meeting to an earlier one in London on March 9,
the Contact Group talks are due to give a new assessment of the
Kosovo situation and discuss further sanctions sought by the
United States to increase pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to begin a political
dialogue with Kosovo-Albanians on the future status of the
southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Although Albright has preached for a tough stance, most other
Contact Group members, especially Russia, have been reluctant to
crack down economically or diplomatically on Belgrade at the
current stage.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats here noted that the latest news reports
about renewed fightings in Kosovo, during which several people
were reportedly killed, would give the United States a strong
argument to push for further sanctions like seizing Serbian and
Yugoslav government assets abroad and placing restrictions on
foreign travel by Yugoslav officials.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Reports Record Year for Private Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the financial chaos
in some Asian nations since last summer, net long-term private
flows rose for the seventh straight year to reach a total of 256
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the World Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on "Global Development Finance 1998"
released here Tuesday, the World Bank noted that private capital
flows to developing countries experienced a rollercoaster year in
1997, rising strongly during the first half of the year before
colliding with the East Asian financing crisis and the subsequent
turmoil in global stock markets, and falling sharply in a general
retreat from new investments in emerging markets in the last three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Although net long-term private flows increased about 10 billion
dollars from the previous record of 247 billion dollars in 1996,
official assistance to the poorest developing countries continues
to drop as a result of tighter aid budgets in industrial nations
and a decision by many governments to reduce direct lending,
according to the 189-page report.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicted that a combination of wary investors
and uncertain prospects for recovery in East Asia, as well as
possible further contagion effects, are likely to slow down net
long-term private flows to developing countries in 1998. However,
if the crisis in some East Asian countries is bottoming out, this
decline will be tempered by the continued robust health of the
global economy, investors returning to markets in countries with
strong economic fundamentals, and changes in the composition of
capital inflows that may have made them more resilient.
</P>
<P>
Predicting economic growth this year, the World Bank suggested
that Malaysia and the Philippines could produce positive rates of
3.5 and 3 percent respectively, while Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea could be contracted or zero growth in the year,
although positive growth should return to all five nations by
1999, unless the situation in Indonesia changes such predictions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment (FDI), which is more stable than
other capital flows, totaled 120 billion dollars last year, about
the same as in 1996 and five times the level in 1990. Of this
amount, privatization revenues accounted for 15 billion dollars.
FDI declined in East Asia, but picked up in Latin America as a
result of privatization transactions, notably in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Administration Officials Urge Inmate Drug Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Cabinet secretaries
Tuesday called for public support for President Bill Clinton's
proposal to allow states to use prison construction money for drug
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The officials said "zero tolerance" for drugs in prison, along
with vigorous testing, extensive treatment and consistent
follow-through once prisoners are released from jail will lower
rates of both addiction and crime.
</P>
<P>
"We need to speak clearly to the American people and let them
know that treatment and testing does work," Attorney General Janet
Reno told a national conference on drug addiction and crime, which
was convened by White House director of drug-policy Barry
McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
"We have a twofold policy: `Zero tolerance but maximum
assistance,'" said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala. "When a drug user actually lands in prison, we have a
unique opportunity to get them into treatment, to break their
addiction and to break the cycle of drugs, violence and
criminality."
</P>
<P>
The three officials sought to rally support for a Clinton
initiative to earmark 200 million dollars in the next federal
budget to identify prison drug users through testing and to make
sure drug users get treatment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had also asked that all states report on the level of
drug use in their prisons and that they be allowed to use prison
construction money for drug testing and treatment.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department survey, released Monday, of people on
probation from jail sentences found that nearly half of the
probationers had been drinking or taking drugs or both at the time
of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Another Justice Department study released in January showed
that more than 60 percent of adult men arrested for an array of
crimes tested positive for at least one drug.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons of recently released
inmates who had received drug treatment in prison indicated that
they were less likely to be rearrested or return to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Drug users who undergo testing and treatment while in prison
are twice as likely to stay drug free -- and to stay crime free,
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
Reno said, "To do just incarceration is not going to work. To
do just prevention and treatment, that's not going to work either.
We need a balanced approach."

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says U.S.-Russia Military Ties on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary of
State William Cohen said Tuesday that the reshuffle of the Russian
cabinet by President Boris Yeltsin will not slow the improvement
in military ties between Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
During a photo opportunity with Georgian Defense Minister
Vardiko Nadibaidze, Cohen told reporters he had information
Yeltsin planned to keep Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and senior adviser Andrei Kokoshin in
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"My information is that Minister Sergeyev along with Primakov
and Andrei Kokoshin, a principal adviser to President Yeltsin,
will remain in office," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I do not anticipate it will have an impact on our
relationship. And I don't think it will have any bearing on the
ratification of START-2" strategic arms reduction treaty by the
Russian Duma, Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
He would not say where his information had come from, but
stressed that Monday's sacking was, as Yeltsin said, aimed at
boosting flagging economic reforms in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Nadibaidze signed a defense cooperation agreement
between the U.S. and Georgia, under which the U.S. would provide
1.35 million U.S. dollars in foreign military financing to Georgia
this year.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Georgia, an active participant in NATO's
"Partnership for Peace" (PFP) military cooperation program with
former communist states, would use the funds to buy military
radios for an infantry company that will take part in PFP
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Nadibaidze told reporters his ministry also believed Yeltsin
intended to keep Sergeyev and Kokoshin on the job in the Russian
cabinet.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission in Congo Finds Bodies Removed From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. mission
investigating alleged massacres in the former Zaire found that at
least one mass grave with all the bodies has been removed in a
possible attempt to destroy evidence, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The team of U.N. experts were investigating reported massacres
of Rwandan Hutu refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary exploration of the site on March 18 by the experts
confirmed the existence of at least one mass grave, whose contents
appeared to have been removed several months after burial,
possible in an attempt to destroy evidence," Carlos told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The location was near the scene where witnesses said Hutu
refugees were executed in May last year as now President Laurent
Kabila was about to seize power from the late Mobutu Sese Seko.
Kabila's forces and Rwandan Tutsi allies are suspected of killing
thousands of Hutu refugees during a bush war across the former
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Indonesia With Aid to Combat Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Department announced
Tuesday that Washington would offer 56 million dollars in food and
medical supplies to assist Indonesia which is suffering from the
worst drought in 50 years and a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said the food and
medical aid was in addition to more than 520 million dollars in
assistance from programs of the U.S. Agency for International
Development and the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia has had difficulty importing food and other
necessities because letters of credit are not being readily
accepted by banks.
</P>
<P>
"Higher prices combined with lower incomes caused by the
economic downturn will make food and other essential goods
increasingly unaffordable by the poor," Eizenstat told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will hold a meeting on April 1 in Washington to
assess Indonesia's humanitarian needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we really want is to get an assessment of needs, and once
that assessment is done, then we can make an assessment of where
those resources will come from," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said the humanitarian aid would not be linked to how
well Indonesia implemented strict economic reforms tied to the IMF
package.
</P>
<P>
"We have really tried to separate IMF conditionality from this
humanitarian package," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said U.S. national interests in Indonesia were too
"significant" for Washington not to act when it is facing natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had a vested interest in propping up
the "moderate" Muslim government that served as a voice of reason
in Asia and preserving access to ports where American warships can
undergo depot maintenance, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Approves Bill for Paying U.N., IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A key U.S. House panel
approved a bill Tuesday that would provide 17.9 billion U.S.
dollars for the International Monetary Fund and 505 million U.S.
dollars to pay back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The House Appropriations Committee approved the legislation by
voice vote. However, Democrats said the measure was insufficient
and predicted a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The panel voted 30-25 to reject a Democratic amendment that
would have provided the full 926 million U.S. dollars for the
U.N. that President Bill Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
It also voted 29-25 to kill another Democratic amendment that
would have added protections for workers and the environment to a
list of restrictions legislators want to add to the IMF funds.
</P>
<P>
The panel's chairman, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., defended the
legislation and said the GOP conditions on the IMF funds were
responsible.
</P>
<P>
The conditions require the Clinton administration to
aggressively prod the IMF to tighten its lending policies.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, moving toward a final vote on a spending bill by
Wednesday, faced proposed amendments that included reducing the
U.S. contribution to NATO and urging allies to pay more for troop
deployments in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican Senate leaders were close to an agreement
with the Clinton administration to use the spending bill to obtain
quick Senate approval of the administration's request for 18
billion U.S. dollars for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is attempting to attach conditions on how the IMF
loans money, mainly to make sure that the loans are not used to
subsidize products made by countries that are economic rivals.
</P>
<P>
The administration had opposed the conditions. But, in hopes of
getting quicker action on the package, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin has been negotiating with Senate Republicans to make the
conditions less rigid.
