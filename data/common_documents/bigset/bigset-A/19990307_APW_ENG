	PETIT BOIS ISLAND, Miss. (AP) -- A Coast Guard helicopter crew  
looking for a sunken barge rescued a 7-year-old boy, four adults 
and three golden retrievers from two boats awash near a Mississippi 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy and two adults suffered from subnormal body

<HEADLINE> Intel Now the Target of Antitrust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a five-month Microsoft marathon, it is  
now Intel inside the antitrust courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The microchip giant will take center stage Tuesday in an  
administrative law hearing at the Federal Trade Commission, 
contesting government charges it illegally used bullying tactics to 
quell competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel case is not likely to have the entertainment value of  
that OTHER antitrust case, now on a month's recess at U.S. District 
Court down the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Microsoft antitrust trial, there probably will not be  
any smoking gun e-mails. Nor will there be bitter disputes over 
what happened: Intel acknowledges it did most of what the FTC 
alleges; the company just claims it acted legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lower profile, the Intel case carries high stakes  
that ultimately could affect prices, quality and innovation in 
computers millions of people now use. 
</P>
<P>
	The central issue in the government's complaint is whether Intel  
Corp., holds a monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the 
``brains'' of computers. The FTC says yes, because Intel microchips 
run about 80 percent of the world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators must prove to the administrative judge  
hearing the case that Intel used monopoly power to shut out its 
competition, hurting consumers in the process. The government also 
must show how such actions curbed innovation and barred other 
companies' potential entry into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel scoffs at the notion that it has ``chilled'' innovation.  
Indeed, the case opens as the company faces unprecedented 
competition from rival chipmakers, specifically Advanced Micro 
Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of funny because the FTC has chosen to bring this  
case at probably the one time in the last 15 years where Intel 
really was having problems in the market,'' said Daniel Wall, an 
antitrust attorney in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough argument (for Intel) to say they don't have  
monopoly power, but they're better positioned to make that argument 
now than they have ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its complaint, the government claims Intel illegally used its  
industry influence to withhold key technical information about 
future microchips from three companies: Digital Equipment Corp., 
Intergraph Corp., and Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The information was necessary for the businesses to develop  
computer systems based on future Intel chips. The FTC claims Intel 
withheld the data to punish the companies for refusing to license 
key patents to Intel without charge. The patents are for 
microprocessors and related technologies made by the three 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital, which makes hardware and software, and Compaq, the  
world's largest computer maker, ultimately gave in to Intel. 
Intergraph, which makes specialized computers for engineers, sued 
and eventually got a preliminary injunction requiring Intel to turn 
over the information. Intel is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, in court documents, calls Intel's actions ``a raw  
exercise of monopoly power to muscle competitors into signing over 
intellectual property rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which reported $26.2 billion in sales last year,  
acknowledges it denied the technical data, but argues it legally 
can decide which secrets to disclose to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent industry report showed consumers bought more low-end  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time in that area. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel claims AMD's performance in the marketplace ``flies in the  
face'' of the government's theory. Two years ago, none of the top 
computer makers used AMD processors, it notes; today nine of the 
top 10 do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence shows that competition has intensified greatly  
since the time of that conduct,'' the company said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the FTC's economic expert, Harvard University professor  
Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in the 
computer industry has suffered, the company points out. 
</P>
<P>
	Scherer describes Intel's behavior as ``unfair'' but agrees that  
its actions have not directly affected chip prices, a factor in 
determining monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's antitrust case against Intel was filed shortly after  
the Justice Department and 19 states sued Microsoft, the software 
giant accused of abusing its monopoly power. The two federal 
agencies have overlapping authority on antitrust and typically 
divide cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Intel case, the FTC seeks a far more limited remedy, if  
it wins, than the ones contemplated for Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency wants an administrative order requiring Intel to stop  
withholding technical information from customers who develop rival 
technologies. Either side can appeal the administrative judge's 
ruling to the full FTC. If Intel loses there, it can go to a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, a prominent technology industry group has  
suggested splitting Microsoft into separate companies selling 
different products, if a federal judges rules against the company.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Former House Speaker Jim Wright faces  
surgery for oral cancer for a second time in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, 76, will be operated on Friday at a Houston hospital to  
remove his cancerous right jawbone and reconstruct it with bone 
from one of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I didn't know whether I wanted to look like Clark  
Gable or John Wayne,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Wright lost part of his tongue and some teeth in his  
right jaw after a small, hard growth was found near the base of his 
tongue. He also underwent radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat left Congress in 1989 during an ethics  
investigation. The Ethics Committee concluded Wright had skirted 
ethics rules by making bulk sales of his book to unions and other 
groups.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An early-morning explosion, the second in as  
many days in the city, destroyed three homes Sunday and injured 
eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast happened shortly before 7 a.m., waking neighbors with  
a noise like thunder, scattering blankets, sheets and other debris 
into trees. Neighbors were frightened but made sure everyone was 
all right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was coming to help. They were great. They were  
wonderful,'' Lillian Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Homes on the block were evacuated and Red Cross officials set up  
a shelter nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe natural gas was involved in the explosion.  
Crews used heavy machinery to remove large rubble and then dug 
through smaller debris with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of two families, one visitor and an emergency worker  
were injured, said police Capt. Linda MacLachlin. Hospitals said 
most were in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a gas leak in an oven caused an explosion that blew  
apart the top floor of a three-story apartment building and injured 
five people. One of the injured was listed in critical condition 
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Will Anyone Pick Against Duke? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	The question was first heard in early February. Is Duke going to  
lose a game in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season? 
</P>
<P>
	When the Blue Devils capped a first-ever 16-0 league season with  
a 20-point win at North Carolina last weekend, the question 
changed. Can anybody beat these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	After this weekend's ACC tournament, which the Blue Devils  
ripped through with three wins by an average of 25 points, the 
question was altered again. Can anybody stay close to these guys? 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the 1999 NCAA tournament, the 64-team competition  
with the subtitle: ``Is second place really so bad?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the Blue Devils such a heavy favorite is a 32-1  
record, a 27-game wining streak, only three wins by less than 
double figures and 13 by 30 or more. Then there are all-conference 
players like Trajan Langdon, Elton Brand and William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't forget Mike Krzyzewski, the coach who has led Duke to  
seven Final Fours and two national championships. There's even a 
tinge of revenge as the Blue Devils had one of their most 
devastating losses ever last year to Kentucky in the regional final 
at St. Petersburg, Fla., the site of this year's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	How can anybody pick against Duke?  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will cruise to the East Regionals at the  
Meadowlands, their favorite Final Four launching pad, with wins 
over Florida A&AMP;M and College of Charleston, and will be joined 
there by Wisconsin, Cincinnati and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, the only team to beat the Blue Devils this season,  
just won't have the last-second heroics it did in that Nov. 28 game 
in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils will play the Midwest Regional champion in the  
national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for Kentucky to be that team as the defending national  
champion makes a Dukelike fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
The Wildcats will stave off some scares, however, as sixth-seeded 
Kansas, with its lowest seeding since 1988, makes some noise in the 
second round and Utah, the team Kentucky beat for the title last 
season, provides a regional semifinal thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will make their trip to St. Petersburg after a  
regional final win over North Carolina Charlotte, the team that 
will grab the nation's attention with solid play and kiss-blowing 
3-point shooter Diego Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Regional will have the best of the second-round story  
lines when George Washington meets its former coach, Mike Jarvis, 
and St. John's. The second round will also have the first of the 
No. 1 seeds leaving when Syracuse stuns Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse will run out of luck against Ohio State in the regional  
semifinals and the Buckeyes' game against Maryland in the final 
will also be a former Boston College coaches reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's Gary Williams will get his first Final Four  
appearance, carried there with a sensational tournament from guard 
Steve Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins' opponent in the national semifinals will be  
Connecticut, another team led by a coach, Jim Calhoun, making his 
Final Four debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies will have some fun running their way past Missouri  
in the second round and Arkansas in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and North Carolina will get back within a game of  
returning to the Final Four for a second straight year. The Tar 
Heels will get second-year coach Bill Guthridge back there but the 
rematch of last year's regional final with Connecticut won't turn 
out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four will have Duke getting revenge on Kentucky for  
last year's game and Connecticut prevailing in what should be an 
entertaining game that doesn't need a shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Duke and Connecticut, the only teams to hold the No.  
1 ranking this season, playing for the whole thing. Then it's time 
to pick your question: Can anybody beat these guys? Can anybody 
stay close to these guys?

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Will Fix Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., whose software runs most of  
the world's personal computers, admitted Sunday that its latest 
version of Windows generates a unique serial number that partly is 
planted within electronic documents and could be used to trace the 
authors' identities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a disclosure with enormous privacy implications, Microsoft  
also said it is investigating whether it is collecting the serial 
numbers from customers even if they explicitly indicate they didn't 
want them disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is, it's just a bug,'' said Robert Bennett, Microsoft's  
group product manager for Windows. ``If it is indeed happening, ... 
we'll absolutely fix that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A programmer, Richard M. Smith of Brookline, Mass., noticed last  
week that documents Smith created using Microsoft's popular Word 
and Excel programs in tandem with the Windows 98 operating system 
included within their hidden software code a number unique to his 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-digit Windows number also appears in a log of information  
transmitted to Microsoft when customers register their copies of 
Windows 98, even if they say they don't want details about their 
computers sent to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Word and Excel programs are among the most widely  
used, and its Windows operating systems run roughly 85 percent of 
the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith compared it to a person's Social Security number being  
stamped on every document they create. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody to my knowledge has had a database that would allow a  
piece of written material to be traced back to who wrote it,'' said 
Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. ``I don't expect 
Microsoft to do that kind of tracing, but it's sort of 
unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sinofsky, a vice president for Microsoft's Office  
products, which include Word and Excel, said the electronic 
documents contain only part of the Windows number, including 12 
digits unique to each network adapter. Such devices are common in 
business computers and allow high-speed Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	In computers without such network devices -- such as most home  
PCs -- a common ``dummy'' address is used, effectively making it 
impossible to trace authorship of documents created on those 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason for people to have these worries,''  
Sinofsky said, adding that Microsoft will disable the feature in 
upcoming versions of the programs. ``I'm super-sensitive to 
people's concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said Microsoft will create a software tool to let  
customers remove the Windows number, which he said is meant to help 
diagnose problems for customers who call with technical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith suggested, however, that Microsoft also could use the  
technology to identify stolen copies of Windows by comparing the 
hardware serial number with a 20-digit product number that also is 
transmitted when a customer registers. The industry claims annual 
losses from software piracy at more than $11.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they suddenly see the same product ID number with different  
hardware ID numbers, it gives them evidence for court that there's 
software piracy,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said Microsoft was looking into whether the number,  
called a Globally Unique Identifier, ever was obtained from 
customers who didn't want details about their computer hardware 
disclosed, such as their network addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett promised that Microsoft also will wipe any of those  
numbers from its internal databases that the company can determine 
may have been inadvertently collected. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy activists weren't mollified.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a cleanup job larger than the Exxon Valdez  
oil spill,'' said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp. of 
Green Brook, N.J., which lobbies on privacy issues. ``There are 
billions of tattooed documents out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy bears remarkable similarity to the plot of  
``Ulterior Motive,'' by Daniel Oran, a former Microsoft programmer 
who worked on Windows until 1994 when he quit to write his first 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, published last year, Oran wrote about the top  
executive at the fictional company ``Megasoft'' who builds 
eavesdropping technology into its dominant computer operating 
system that he exploits during a campaign for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious privacy problem,'' said Oran, who  
laughed about life imitating art. ``The technology isn't good or 
bad. It's like a knife; it can be used both ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy follows criticism of Intel Corp., the world's  
largest manufacturer of computer processors, which designed its new 
Pentium III chips to transmit a unique serial number internally and 
to Web sites that request it to help verify the identity of 
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Chicago AIDS Hospice To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- One of the country's last hospices set up to care  
exclusively for dying AIDS patients has a problem -- albeit a good 
one. It's going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the field say the closing of the Chicago House  
hospice -- and the shifting focus of AIDS facilities throughout the 
country -- is further evidence that the epidemic is less about dying 
and more about caring for the millions who are living with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes Charles Borin, the last remaining resident at the  
two-story white stucco home on Chicago's far North Side where 357 
patients have died in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only one who survived,'' the 76-year-old retired  
hairdresser said recently as he looked at the first boxes he's been 
packing. ``Why? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borin's relative healthiness since he was diagnosed with the  
AIDS virus seven years ago likely has much to do with the 17 pills 
he downs each day. That includes a ``cocktail'' of protease 
inhibitors, the drugs credited with stalling the progression of the 
virus and making it increasingly difficult for Chicago House 
officials to fill the hospice's nine beds in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, they were afraid they simply weren't getting the word  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We contacted everybody we know. .... And nothing. There was no  
response,'' says Dr. Robert Murphy, a Chicago House board member 
who is also director of the HIV clinical treatment unit at 
Northwestern University Medical School. ``And the reason is -- we 
don't need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics have hinted at the trend for quite some time.  
Nationwide, AIDS killed about 43,000 people in 1995, compared with 
16,685 in 1997, according to the most recent data available from 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy has also seen the shift in his practice. Of the 1,000  
HIV-positive patients being treated at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital, he says only 15 have T-cell counts below 50, a level 
considered ``high risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's much the same elsewhere. Even San Francisco General  
Hospital's Ward ``5A'' -- once singled out as a model for inpatient 
AIDS care -- is now filled with as many cancer patients as AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the best thing that's ever happened,'' says  
Murphy, who voted with the Chicago House board to use the $250 a 
day they were spending per hospice patient on services in greater 
demand, including subsidized housing for healthier HIV-positive 
people and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, they have stopped accepting hospice patients and  
will refer them instead to hospices who care for people with all 
kinds of illnesses. Borin, who was admitted in July for 24-hour 
care but wasn't considered a terminal case, will move as soon as he 
can find other housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consider the closing of Chicago House good news, though  
there are a few cautionary notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people out there who still have the disease who are  
not taking care of themselves,'' says Althea Porcher of the 
Connecticut Hospice Cottage Program, which has a five-bed hospice 
for homeless AIDS patients in Branford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Others point to the estimated 40,000 new HIV infections a year,  
which some fear are being lost in the news about the major drop in 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Complacency is setting in,'' says Gustavo Suarez, a spokesman  
for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. ``You often hear people say, 
`Oh, it's just like diabetes.' And that's leading to a lot of 
unsafe practices, particularly in young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In still other cases, protease inhibitors have stopped working.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two years ago, we were to the point that we almost had no AIDS  
patients,'' says Jeremy Hollinger, manager at Coming Home Hospice, 
a 15-bed facility in San Francisco for AIDS and cancer patients. 
``Now we're getting more AIDS patients again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, he says he's also been getting a spate of  
inquiries about bereavement support groups for people who have lost 
loved ones to AIDS, a service the hospice had stopped providing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago House's Murphy says he's hoping a new line of protease  
inhibitors and other drugs will quash any major resurgence of HIV. 
But even the most hopeful understand they're dealing with an 
unpredictable epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know. In a year, we might be right back here,'' Lisa  
Hamlin, resident manager at the Chicago House hospice, said as she 
looked around the house. ``But I hope not.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA's Midwest Features Past Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The NCAA tournament's Midwest Region features the past two  
national champions, last year's runner-up, three of the best guards 
in the land and one of the nation's top freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention one of the tournament's best stories, 800-game  
winner Jim Phelan of Mount St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Phelan is to win No. 801, he will have to pull off an  
upset for the ages against top seed and Big Ten champion Michigan 
State. The Spartans (29-4) have won 18 straight and, by beating 
Illinois on Sunday for the conference tournament title, set a 
school record for victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This caps off an unbelievable Big Ten season for us,'' coach  
Tom Izzo said after the Illinois game. ``Whether we win or lose the 
games to come, we're going to be ready to play and a team's going 
to get our best effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Big Ten co-player of the year Mateen Cleaves, Michigan  
State won the regular-season title by rolling through a conference 
rated as the toughest in the country. Now the Spartans get to play 
their subregional games in nearby Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough, so we've got to go home this week and  
get ready to play,'' Cleaves said. ``Being close to home is great. 
That's going to be an advantage for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mount St. Mary's went into the Northeast Conference tournament  
seeded sixth, but won the title and as a result will make its 
second NCAA appearance. The other, in 1995, ended in a first-round 
loss to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties (15-14) are coached by the bow-tie-wearing Phelan,  
who is in his 45th season at the small Catholic school in 
Emmittsburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nos. 2 and 3 seeds in the Midwest are Utah and Kentucky,  
which played for the national title a year ago with the Wildcats 
coming out on top. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (27-4) is riding a 22-game winning streak. That's far  
different than a year ago, when the Utes were knocked out of the 
Western Athletic Conference tournament in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's heart and soul is guard Andre Miller, who decided not to  
turn pro and led the Utes to a sweep of the WAC regular-season 
schedule and postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky (25-8) doesn't appear to be as formidable as in recent  
years but is still dangerous. The Wildcats, who have reached the 
past three title games, winning two of them, had their most 
regular-season losses since the 1989-90 season, including four 
defeats in the final seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	But they knocked off Auburn -- the No. 1 seed in the South Region  
-- and Arkansas on their way to the Southeastern Conference 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all wish we could have jelled quicker, but we're starting  
to jell now,'' Kentucky senior Scott Padgett said. 
</P>
<P>
	If fourth-seeded Arizona, which won the 1997 national  
championship as a No. 4 seed, returns to the Final Four, it will do 
so on the back of Jason Terry, the Pac-10 player of the year. The 
senior point guard is coming off a 26-point game in the 
regular-season finale against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona opens against No. 13 seed Oklahoma, which apparently was  
the last at-large team invited. The Sooners (20-10) have made five 
straight NCAA tournament appearances under Kelvin Sampson but 
haven't gotten past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arizona obviously is a much more talented basketball team than  
we are, but we're used to that,'' Sampson said. ``We've beaten some 
talented basketball teams this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is in a familiar setting in the Midwest but not in a  
familiar spot. The Jayhawks (22-9) are seeded only sixth, their 
lowest NCAA seeding since 1988. But perhaps that's not all bad -- 
that year they won the national title as the No. 6 seed in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas was the No. 1 seed in the Midwest last year but lost to  
Rhode Island in the second round. This year a second-round loss 
wouldn't be an upset since it would probably come against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams in the Midwest are No. 5 seed North Carolina  
Charlotte; No. 7 Washington; No. 8 Villanova; No. 9 Mississippi; 
No. 10 Miami, Ohio; No. 11 Evansville; No. 12 Rhode Island; No. 14 
New Mexico State; and No. 15 Arkansas State. 
</P>
<P>
	UNC Charlotte has proven it can play with the big boys, beating  
Cincinnati two out of three times in Conference USA. Rhode Island 
is in the tournament as the result of freshman sensation Lamar 
Odom's buzzer-beater against Temple in the Atlantic 10 title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington made a nice run in last year's tournament before  
losing to Connecticut in the East regional semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Crisis Postpones Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency devaluation  
struck Maria Jesus de Souza in a hospital bed, hours away from 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a simple operation that would allow the 62-year-old-nurse  
to receive a prosthesis on her leg, deformed by a bone disease that 
had confined her to a wheel chair for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She had waited for weeks to be admitted to the Sao Jose  
University Hospital, a public institution. Six hours after 
admission, a nurse came with bad news: The operation was postponed, 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was the U.S.-made prosthesis, stuck in a financial  
limbo by a 43 percent devaluation of the Brazilian real since Jan. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	When the hospital ordered the unit in early January, the price  
was set at 1,700 reals, the equivalent of $1,395 at the time. But 
suddenly the distributor was asking almost 3,000 reals, and the 
hospital said it couldn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of Health also didn't accept the new price, and the  
distributor refused to release the piece, Souza was told. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never imagined the devaluation was going to hurt us this  
way,'' said Aurora Augusta Araujo, one of Souza's five children. 
``My mother waited for this surgery for so long, and now we have no 
where to turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a monthly pension of 130 reals, now worth $60, Souza cannot  
afford even part of the difference caused by the devaluation. The 
hospital administration says it's not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the health ministry and the suppliers do not come to terms  
on price, there is nothing we can do,'' said Marcelo Augusto 
Nascimento, the hospital administrator. ``I am sorry for the 
patients.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Maddux Takes His Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two innings was enough for Greg Maddux.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to walk before you can jog, jog before you can run,''  
Maddux said Sunday after allowing a first-inning run in the Atlanta 
Braves' 10-2 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a month and a half,'' the four-time Cy Young Award  
winner said. ``The vast majority of managers and players and 
coaches think spring training's too long. So why push it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux allowed a pair of singles that led to the run but got out  
of the inning on a groundout and double play. In the second, Maddux 
had a strikeout and another double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to go out there and get your brains beat in,''  
he said. ``I thought I got hit halfway decent today, even the outs 
were hit halfway decent. I felt good to be out there again. It was 
actually fun. I didn't want to give up the run, but I felt all 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has logged more than 2,800 major league innings and has  
had 11 consecutive seasons with at least 15 victories. But he said 
Sunday afforded him an opportunity to fine tune the simplest of 
pitching tasks: remembering where to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two times out, you just want to get used to seeing a  
catcher, a hitter, an umpire back there again,'' Maddux said. 
``I've been throwing for the last month mostly into the screen or 
in the bullpen or playing catch. It looks different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the different looks the Braves have this spring is the  
addition of second baseman Bret Boone from Cincinnati. Boone showed 
his value to the Braves and to Maddux by handling a tough 
in-between hop in the second inning that resulted in an 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to help us out a lot,'' Maddux said. ``He's one of  
those guys that if he hits .200, he's still makes your team a lot 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux's goal is to be consistent throughout the remainder of  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say. I'll take him the way he's been,''  
Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``I'll take his inconsistencies.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Wrestling Grows As a Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At 5 feet tall and about 115 pounds, Patricia  
Miranda doesn't think of herself as scary -- except when she has to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows she can intimidate women, men and teen-age boys.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford University sophomore is a nationally ranked  
wrestler. And like most other female wrestlers, when she isn't 
matched against females, she's matched against males. She started 
wrestling boys in the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did a trial run and really liked it -- and why not?'' Miranda  
said. ``It was a sport that took all of me. What intrigued me most 
was the mental challenge. Almost all of it was mind games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling is not beyond women, Miranda said. ``If the woman  
feels she can compete on the male level, it is possible, especially 
in high school,'' she said. ``Women are weaker, just by physiology 
-- but they can train and have more speed and be more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda is ranked No.2 on the women's national team sponsored by  
USA Wrestling, the U.S. amateur governing body. Although she can 
wrestle in international competitions against women, there is no 
Olympic women's competition. The sport might be included in the 
2004 Summer Games, said Mike Duroe, the team's national 
developmental coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Females are a small minority of U.S. wrestlers, but they are a  
growing minority. Their trouble is that, with some exceptions, 
there still are too few females in one place to create female 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	At the high school level, around 1,900 girls participated in the  
1997-98 school year, compared with more than 229,000 boys, 
according to the National Federation of State High School 
Associations, which tracks high school sports participation. In the 
first year in which girls' participation was surveyed, 1984-85, 
there were six, said federation spokesman Bruce Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	When they can't fill their own teams, girls can join boys' teams  
under provisions of the federal government's Title IX equal 
opportunity provisions for athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Miranda's experience. She's on Stanford's men's team, but  
she wrestles women in national and international competition. It's 
all the same to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I walk onto the mat, I feel no connection to my gender,''  
Miranda said. ``I transform not only into a competitor but a 
wrestler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for criticism that there could be something sexual in boys  
and girls grappling on a mat, Miranda doesn't buy it. ``I've never 
heard of a boy being turned on or being uncomfortable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a male opponent feels uncomfortable wrestling a female,  
that's his problem, Miranda believes. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows some do. At Redwood Junior High in Saratoga, Calif.,  
``nobody told me not to be there, so it was a generally positive 
experience,'' she said. At Saratoga High, there was more 
``male-female politicking -- I don't want to say harassment,'' she 
said. ``But I was captain of my high school team by the time I was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some junior high boys defaulted rather than wrestle her, Miranda  
recalled. ``Boys just do not want to lose to a girl,'' she said. By 
college, it's less of a factor -- and at Stanford, it's no factor at 
all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that boys would default rather than wrestle a girl  
angers Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports 
Foundation in East Meadow, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think boys should be allowed to do it,'' she said.  
``The coach should say, `We are wrestling every athlete on that 
team. You either wrestle or you are not on the team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the sport probably will grow to the point at which  
many girls' teams can be fielded, Lopiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls who wrestle should be on female teams, said Walter  
Sargent, athletic director of Brookline, Mass., public schools, 
where the high school has a girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls should not wrestle boys, even when they can under Title  
IX, because it's bad for the girls, Sargent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids say they get the opportunity to be offensive and  
aggressive, and not be in a defensive posture, as they would be 
against boys, who are stronger and bigger,'' Sargent said. And by 
not offering a girls' team, schools limit girls' participation to 
those girls who will wrestle boys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda disagrees. ``I don't see why a coach would make a  
judgment for the female population,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Former King Congregation Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Members of the historic church once led by the  
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., his father and his grandfather moved 
Sunday to a new, $8 million sanctuary across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of members and visitors filled the wooden pews of the  
small, Ebenezer Baptist Church for a brief closing service where 
the congregation prayed and reflected on the church's 76-year 
history before marching over to the new 1,800-seat structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed emotions,'' said Christine King Ferris, King's  
sister, as she walked toward the new building. ``I will always have 
an affinity for Ebenezer. That was where I was baptized, where I 
was married and where my mother was killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singing ``We're Marching to Zion,'' and led by children, the  
congregation marched over to the fan-shaped building where church 
leaders cut the yellow ribbons on the doors of the new sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation had long since outgrown the old, 750-seat  
building, whose history has been marked with both triumph and 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, Ebenezer served as the spiritual headquarters  
for the civil rights movement. Both King, his father and 
grandfather once preached from Ebenezer's pulpit, and it's where 
the slain civil rights leader's funeral was held in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Tragedy struck again in 1974 when King's mother, Alberta King,  
was gunned down while playing ``The Lord's Prayer'' on the organ. 
At the close of Sunday's service, the new church's organ was 
dedicated in her memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither King's widow, Coretta Scott King, nor any of his  
children were at Sunday's service. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Ebenezer has anchored the surrounding area known as  
``Sweet Auburn,'' once a center of black business that has since 
fallen on hard times. The neighborhood is where King grew up and is 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Political and social action will remain a focus of the new  
church's activity, said the Rev. Joseph Roberts Jr., pastor since 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mandate from Dr. King is still very much ours,'' Roberts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With its faded red brick facade, cracked ceiling and creaky  
floors, Ebenezer stands in stark contrast to the Afrocentric 
architectural of the New Horizon Sanctuary with its modern look and 
towering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The new building can accommodate both a 150-member choir and  
1,800 in its oak pews, all of which were filled during Sunday's 
first worship service. 
</P>
<P>
	For Jethro English, an 86-year-old deacon who joined Ebenezer in  
1925, the old church holds many precious memories. As a young boy, 
he was baptized there and it's where he and his wife of 61 years 
were married by Martin Luther King Sr. He was a pallbearer at 
King's funeral and was sitting in the choir when Mrs. King was 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many precious memories there,'' English said.  
``I've seen the tragedies and I've seen the victories.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose for the first time  
since September, though an industry analyst cautioned the increase 
may not signal a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was  
$1.0028 per gallon Friday, up 0.48 cent from two weeks earlier, 
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a price recovery after about a year and a half of  
price cutting, then it is so far a frail one,'' analyst Trilby 
Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	West Coast prices increased after the Feb. 23 explosion at a  
Tosco Corp. oil refinery in Martinez, Calif., which killed four 
people and sent gas buyers chasing for alternative supplies, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned that the tightening of gas supplies might create glut  
conditions prior to the spring driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still weeks away from what the industry calls spring  
demand, when we consume a lot more fuel, but this is the period of 
time that both society and oil industry shift from heating oil to 
driving supplies for greater demand in spring,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-service prices were 94.16 cents for regular, $1.0517 for  
mid-grade and $1.1362 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4002 for regular, $1.4915 for  
mid-grade and $1.5662 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Fed. Health Tax Breaks Cost $111B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It cost the federal government $111.2 billion  
last year to give employers and their workers tax breaks to buy 
health insurance, a new study reports. Most of the money was spent 
on families earning more than $50,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The study being published Monday in the journal Health Affairs  
highlights the contradictions in federal tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies do not have to pay taxes on money spent on workers'  
health insurance, and many employees do not have to pay taxes on 
their share of premiums. But Americans who pay for insurance out of 
their own pockets get no such break. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 68.7 percent of the tax dollars lost because of these  
provisions benefited families earning more than $50,000 per year -- 
only about 36 percent of the population, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 23.6 percent of the benefit went to families earning  
more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A disproportionate share of the tax benefit goes to wealthier  
families because higher-income workers are most likely to have 
health insurance, the authors explained. Also, families with higher 
incomes have higher tax rates, meaning a tax break for them costs 
the government more than a tax break for a lower-income worker 
would. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors questioned the spending.  
</P>
<P>
	``With more than 43 million uninsured persons in the United  
States, it is important to ask ourselves whether it is appropriate 
that 68.7 percent of the federal health benefits tax expenditures 
are going to 36 percent of the population with the highest 
incomes,'' said co-author John Sheils, vice president of the Lewin 
Group, a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that in 1998, total spending on  
employer-sponsored health coverage reached $302.6 billion. Of this, 
employers paid 83.4 percent with employees picking up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax break for health insurance is a remnant of World War II,  
when the government encouraged companies to offer their workers 
health benefits in lieu of increased wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts note that this system is not necessarily the best for  
the health system as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are encouraged to buy expensive health packages  
because money spent for health insurance is not taxed and therefore 
goes further than money spent on wages. The best health packages 
have low co-payments and low deductibles, making it cheaper for 
employees to use their insurance -- but driving up overall health 
care usage and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and  
Means' health subcommittee, is working on a plan to restructure the 
health insurance tax system. He does not expect it to move through 
Congress soon.

	Caribbean Nations Suspend US Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Angered by the U.S. position in a  
trade dispute over banana exports to Europe, Caribbean Community 
nations have agreed to suspend a treaty of cooperation with the 
United States to fight drug trafficking, an official said today. 
The treaty signed in Barbados by President Clinton in May 1997 
calls for cooperation by Caribbean nations in anti-drug trafficking 
measures and extradition of suspects. But regional leaders have 
increasingly complained that Washington has ignored its end of the 
bargain by failing to address economic issues so important to the 
Caribbean.

not be signed until later in the week. An American source said 
rebels were expected to approve the deal, and that they and ethnic 
Albanian politicians would likely sign around March 12.

	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Angered by the U.S. position in a  
trade dispute over banana exports to Europe, Caribbean Community

</P>
<P>
	Leonard Robertson, a spokesman for the 14-member Caribbean

suspend the treaty was seen by the Caribbean leaders as the 
strongest way to send a message to Washington.

larger Latin American plantations and need the preferences.

<HEADLINE> Health Plans Sued Over Viagra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four Viagra pills a month just doesn't cut it  
for David Scholl. So last fall he sued his health plan, QualMed, to 
get it to pay for more of the anti-impotence drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nine dollars a pill is expensive,'' said Scholl, a federal  
judge in Philadelphia. ``And there's something about having to pay 
to have sex that doesn't seem quite right. At least not to pay that 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scholl, 54, is one of a small, but growing number of American  
men suing their health insurers for denying or restricting coverage 
of the Viagra pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the largest health maintenance organizations have been  
sued over their Viagra policies, including Aetna, Humana, 
Prudential and Kaiser Permanente. While none of the cases has yet 
to go to trial, judges have usually let the suits proceed over the 
HMO objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the biggest cases, a federal judge in California last  
month refused Aetna's motion to dismiss a class-action suit that 
seeks to represent men across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say there's more at stake than just Viagra  
coverage. The cases will help determine whether insurance should 
pay for so-called ``lifestyle'' treatments that may not be 
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8 million prescriptions for Viagra have been written for  
more than 4 million men since the breakthrough treatment hit the 
market a year ago. But, Viagra's cost of $9 to $10 a pill and high 
demand worries some insurers which are struggling with rising 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health plans, such as Humana and Prudential say their  
decision not to cover Viagra was based on concerns about its 
safety. The drug is dangerous when taken by those who also take 
certain heart drugs such as nitroglycerin. Some older men have died 
from heart attacks after resuming long dormant sexual lives, 
although Viagra has not been definitively linked to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Wall Street analysts presume the real reason insurers  
won't cover the drug is they're looking to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Donaldson, a spokesman for Louisville, Ky.-based Humana,  
said HMOs have the right to determine which drugs they will pay 
for. And most plans have labeled Viagra a lifestyle drug, which 
does little to improve health of most men. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Lentini, 46, of Spring Hill, Fla. sued Humana Inc. last  
July. He says denying Viagra coverage may be just the start. ``If 
they decide not to cover Viagra today, what will they decide not to 
cover tomorrow?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lentini says he now only buys Viagra when he can afford it.  
``It's not a love potion, but it works beautifully.''

<HEADLINE> Hornets Coach Dave Cowens Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Dave Cowens, who led the Charlotte  
Hornets to unprecedented success but was unable to elevate his 
status as one of the NBA's lowest paid coaches, resigned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Manager Bob Bass announced in an evening news conference  
that Cowens submitted his letter of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not announce an immediate successor, but the most  
likely candidate is assistant Paul Silas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass said Cowens walked into his office late Sunday afternoon  
and told him he was leaving. Bass described the reasons as 
``irreconcilable differences'' but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's ever prepared for something like this,'' Bass said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to 50-win seasons,  
was 4-11 this season with a team that is missing two starters 
because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens signed a three-year, $1.89 million contract in May 1996.  
The contract called for him to get salaries of $575,000 his first 
year, $625,000 last year and $675,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to owner George Shinn and said he felt he  
should receive the NBA average of $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shinn reportedly withdrew the offer in February 1998 because  
he didn't feel Cowens was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary late last  
month as the team struggled at the start of the lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets are operating without leading scorer Glen Rice, who  
underwent elbow surgery before the season began. Leading rebounder 
Anthony Mason also underwent arm surgery and is out for the entire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has taken a lot of hits already this year,'' Bass  
said. ``We've got 60 days left and hopefully we'll be able to make 
some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens informed the players of his decision before practice  
Sunday, then left the training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, most of the players refused to comment, but  
starting guard Bobby Phills said Cowens' meeting with the players 
was an emotional one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very distraught,'' Phills said. ``Deep down, maybe it's  
something he didn't feel as though he wanted to do. But it's 
something he may have felt was best for his family and for 
himself.''

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir May Refuse To Serve Booze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In a decision that could have wide  
repercussions on Egypt's tourism industry, an appeals court has 
ruled that EgyptAir stewardesses have the right to refuse to serve 
alcohol because it is banned by Islam, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four hostesses had sued the national carrier in Cairo's Labor  
Court last year for forcing them to serve alcoholic beverages in 
flight. The women won the case, but EgyptAir appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Saturday upheld the lower court's decision and  
sided with the hostesses, the officials said on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Egypt is an Islamic state and Egyptian law is based on Islamic  
Sharia (law) which bans the carrying or circulating of alcoholic 
beverages, even when they are being offered to non-Muslims or 
foreigners,'' the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could have a big impact on Egypt's tourist industry  
as it could mean that all bar, restaurant and hotel personnel can 
refuse to serve alcohol on religious grounds. Tourism is Egypt's 
second largest source of foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> Laser Drilling Relieves Chest Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Blasting away with a laser threaded into the  
heart, doctors say they can relieve crippling chest pain by 
drilling tiny holes into the walls of the heart's main pumping 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental new technique is intended to help people with  
heart disease so severe that it cannot be relieved by bypass 
surgery or angioplasty. It combines laser energy with catheters 
that are easily pushed through the arteries into the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The first laser for treating heart disease was approved by the  
U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year. However, it requires 
open-heart surgery, and many doctors remain skeptical, in part 
because between 6 percent and 10 percent of patients die during the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The new approach does not require surgery, and results presented  
Sunday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology suggest 
that it is extremely safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen N. Oesterle of Massachusetts General Hospital in  
Boston reported that about two-thirds of patients treated this way 
appear to improve enough to resume reasonably normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are no-option patients,'' said Oesterle. ``They are  
untreatable'' with ordinary procedures and medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study, doctors at 12 hospitals in the United States and  
England randomly assigned 221 patients to have either the laser 
therapy or routine medical care. All had severe angina, resulting 
from poor circulation to their heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Angina is rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Before treatment, all were  
in stage 3 or 4, meaning they had chest pain while eating, brushing 
their teeth or even sitting perfectly still. 
</P>
<P>
	After laser treatment, two-thirds had improved at least two  
grades to stage 1 or 2. This meant they could walk about their 
homes comfortably, even though climbing stairs might still trigger 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can lead a normal life with class 2 angina,'' said  
Oesterle. ``You cannot with class 4 angina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None died during the procedure. Patients can be sent home the  
same day they are treated. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure involves a laser that is threaded into the left  
ventricle on a catheter that is about the thickness of a cocktail 
straw. Doctors then burn 10 to 15 tiny holes into the walls of the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	When the approach was first proposed in the 1980s, doctors  
theorized that the holes acted as substitute blood vessels, 
carrying blood to oxygen-starved muscle. However, experts now know 
that the holes themselves quickly plug up, serving no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it now appears that the laser damage somehow triggers  
the heart to grow tiny new arteries, a process called angiogenesis. 
These arteries feed the muscle that cannot be adequately nourished 
by the heart's clogged coronary arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ben McCallister of Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas  
City said Oesterle's results will probably make physicians more 
open to the idea of using lasers to improve heart circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of skepticism about this,'' said  
McCallister. ``I think this very careful study will change the tide 
about how people think about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oesterle tested a laser system developed by CardioGenesis Corp.,  
where he has been a consultant. Similar approaches are also being 
tested with lasers developed by Eclipse Surgical Technologies and 
Biosense, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patrick L. Whitlow of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation  
presented preliminary data at the meeting on 41 patients treated 
with the Eclipse laser. Eighty percent of the patients improved at 
least two stages in their degree of angina. 
</P>
<P>
	Oesterle said the next step will be to combine the laser holes  
with gene therapy, perhaps leaving behind genes that release 
hormones to trigger blood vessel growth.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Wright Finally Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- At 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, Jamey Wright  
has broad shoulders capable of carrying the weight of lofty 
expectations that accompany a former No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	After 2 1/2 years of gaining on-the-job experience with the  
Colorado Rockies, it's a burden he's ready to unload. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't use the he's-still-young excuse anymore,'' Wright  
said Sunday after throwing two scoreless innings against the San 
Francisco Giants. ``It's time to go out and prove I belong here. 
It's time to get up there in the win column and start proving 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, 24, Colorado's first-round draft choice in 1993, has had  
mixed results since allowing one hit in six innings in his major 
league debut on July 3, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The midseason callup completed a remarkable rise from Double-A  
in a three-month span, but injuries and inconsistency have impeded 
his progress in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there'll be improvement this year,'' Rockies manager  
Jim Leyland said. ``I just don't want him to worry about taking 10 
steps up the ladder. Just take a couple more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A knee injury knocked Wright down a rung in 1996. He tore  
cartilage in his right knee while sliding into second base on his 
first major league hit and has had three surgeries since. 
</P>
<P>
	A collarbone injury shortened his season again in 1997, but he  
was able to pitch 200 innings for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who is 21-30 with a 5.71 ERA in his career, said he  
feels stronger this spring than he has since 1996. He likely will 
pitch third or fifth in Colorado's starting rotation with Darryl 
Kile, Pedro Astacio, Brian Bohanon and John Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamey Wright has a real high ceiling,'' Leyland said. ``You  
have to let that play itself out rather than try to push it. I 
don't want to put too much on him, that this is the year he breaks 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As is wont for a blossoming 24-year-old, Wright has a youthful  
exuberance that tends to override patience. 
</P>
<P>
	He has junked his once hard-breaking slider in favor of a  
still-developing curveball he picked up last year from Kile. Wright 
also is working on decreasing the speed of his changeup to 
complement a fastball in the mid-90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thrown three pitches forever and ever, and I've gotten to  
this level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of winds gusting to 45 mph, Wright stayed primarily with  
his fastball Sunday. It was effective as he gave up a walk, a 
single and struck out a hitter in his 27-pitch spring debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't throw as many offspeed pitches as I would have liked  
to,'' he said. ``You're not going to be able to overpower guys with 
fastballs during the season. It's a lot easier to do it in the 
first part of spring training when they're not used to seeing 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Pushes Front-Runner Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush surrounded himself Sunday  
with a diverse group of high-profile Republicans to formally open 
the flirtation stage of his 2000 presidential campaign, furthering 
an unconventional strategy mapped out months ago to make him the 
GOP front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping nearly all pretense of indecision, the Texas governor  
unveiled his presidential exploratory committee by suggesting he 
will seek the White House unless ``there is a huge yawn'' from 
voters and donors when he starts traveling outside Texas in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that would change my mind is if we got out there  
and just heard a loud thud,'' Bush said in a news conference 
attended by dozens of media organizations from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	His 10-member exploratory committee includes three women, one of  
them black, one Hispanic man and one black man. Former Secretary of 
State George Shultz, GOP chairman Haley Barbour, Rep. J.C. Watts 
Jr. of Oklahoma and five other congressional Republicans give a 
Washington flavor to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who answered one quesiton in Spanish, promised a more  
inclusive GOP that ``makes sure no one gets left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement gives shape to a field of at least 10  
Republicans. Lamar Alexander officially enters the campaign Tuesday 
and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole will take 
the same baby step as Bush, forming her exploratory committee 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, a former Tennessee governor, said the strong showings  
by Bush and Dole in polls could be fleeting. Bush, son of former 
President George Bush, and Dole, wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, 
benefit from name recognition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty soon it will come on down back to earth,'' Alexander  
said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, has held elective office just four years and seven  
weeks. He has not raised a dime as a presidential candidate. He has 
not trudged through the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire, begging 
for votes on the chicken-and-peas circuit with fellow contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he is nurturing an aura of inevitability, leading in polls  
over the most likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers from 14 states have urged Bush to run, with  
more to follow. At least 80 congressional Republicans have pledged 
support. And 16 Republican governors, a majority of the 31 GOP 
state executives, have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, running a front-porch campaign in the mold of William  
McKinley in 1896, has welcomed dozens of lawmakers, donors, 
businessman and operatives on pilgrimages to Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	This Bush bandwagon was built with tools he inherited, including  
his father's name, his state's political pull and his party's 
problems. But it also is the result of careful planning to maximize 
his luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it is that Republicans really want to win this time.  
Part of it is buyers' remorse with President Clinton. Part of it is 
the resurgence of his dad's image. Part of it is his brother 
(Florida Gov. Jeb Bush) -- that two-brother thing works. Part of it 
is Texas -- there is a real panache about the state,'' said Ron 
Kaufman, White House political director for President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The blueprints were made months before the 1996 campaign, when  
the Bush team designed a re-election strategy that could blend 
seamlessly into a presidential bid. Bush was not certain he wanted 
to run for president, but certainly wanted the option open. 
</P>
<P>
	He won re-election in a landslide, securing unprecedented  
support from women, independents and minorities. The results 
impressed Republicans trying to broaden the party's appeal beyond 
anti-tax, anti-abortion, anti-Clinton activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans see him as a winner, and they're tired of  
losing,'' said Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Bush backer. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultant Karl Rove of Austin discretely organized the  
pilgrimages, lined up endorsements and urged operatives to await 
Bush's decision before jumping to early-organizing rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	While the hard work played out behind the scenes, Bush coyly and  
very publicly toyed with the notion of running for president, 
stoking the embers of interest without setting himself ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor orchestrated much of the hype, though ``it was very  
subtle,'' Rowland said. ``It didn't just fall in his lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement Sunday marks the beginning of tougher times for  
Bush, as he starts dealing with the hard issues of a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to pace himself,'' warned Rowland. ``We've all seen  
... front-runners flame out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush read a brief opening statement off a TelePrompTer and  
smoothly fielded most of the questions Sunday. He wavered when 
pressed for his views on abortion, saying the party should adopt a 
``pro-life tenor'' and calling a question about first-trimester 
abortions ``hypothetical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals such as Steve Forbes who are courting conservatives will  
scrutinize Bush's every move. In a letter of support for Forbes 
released Sunday by conservatives L. Brent Bozell III, Richard 
Viguerie and Morton Blackwell, Bush is obliquely criticized as part 
of the ``Gore-lite'' element of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also declined to give details about his positions on  
Kosovo, tax cuts and what he promised would be an ``economic 
stimulus'' package. Specifics will come after the Texas legislature 
adjourns in May, he said. Indeed, he offered little beyond what he 
told Texas reporters last Tuesday, though he sounded more certain 
about his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Say George Jones Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones was making  
remarkable progress Sunday after a car wreck left him ``at death's 
door'' because of a deep cut in his liver, his doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old singer remained in critical condition in  
intensive care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was at death's door when he came in,'' said Dr. Virginia  
Eddy, a trauma surgeon. ``So it's remarkable that he's alive at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was driving home in his Lexus when he crashed into a  
bridge at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday. It took emergency workers about 
two hours to free him from the car. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the liver injury, his right lung was punctured.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously a fighter,'' Eddy said. ``It's really  
remarkable. I've certainly seen people much younger than him in a 
whole lot more trouble at this point in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ventilator was helping Jones breath, and he was sedated by  
pain medication. Bleeding from the liver -- the most serious problem 
-- had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' wife Nancy Jones said he is communicating by squeezing  
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones said many country music stars had called, including  
Faith Hill, Randy Travis, Waylon Jennings and Tim McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Johnny Cash just called from Jamaica,'' Mrs. Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of Jones' peers and fans consider him the best country  
music singer of all time. Starting with his first hit ``Why Baby 
Why'' in 1955, he has charted more than 140 records, including 
classics like ``He Stopped Loving Her Today'' and ``A Good Year for 
the Roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been cited as an influence by singers far outside the  
country genre, including Elvis Costello and Ray Charles, both of 
whom have recorded with him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few days, doctors will try to wean Jones from the  
ventilator, then start feeding him through a tube in his stomach, 
Eddy said. If he continues making progress, he could be allowed to 
go home in as little as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones said her husband wasn't ready to die.  
</P>
<P>
	``The good Lord has a reason, he's not going to take George  
yet,'' she said. ``George has got a lot of singing to do.''

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Founder Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Even as he prepared for his company's  
expected demise, sitting in an office filled with half-packed boxes 
and a pile of unwanted clothes, John Peterman said he understood 
people finding humor in the struggles of The J. Peterman Co. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a catalog company that, after all, started out by  
selling floor-length, cowboy-style dusters and became most famous 
for being parodied on ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Peterman smiled at the ``Doonesbury'' strip in which two  
characters discussed the bankruptcy filing of ``J. Pretensions,'' 
with one remarking as she strolled through falling snow: ``Cold 
today ... Sure wish I had a nice, warm duster!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he shrugged when The New Yorker offered its version of a  
Peterman going-out-of-business sale, with used wastebaskets hyped 
in a satire of the catalog's romanticized ad copy. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of a rollercoaster week, J. Peterman was still in  
business, but John Peterman was out. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's founder and chief executive officer told The  
Associated Press on Sunday that he had been fired by the company's 
new owners, Paul Harris Stores Inc., which appeared at a 
liquidation auction Friday and bought J. Peterman for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase saved the catalog operation and at least 10 of the  
company's 13 stores, but apparently not John Peterman's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing has been such a rollercoaster that, actually,  
this didn't surprise me,'' Peterman said in telephone interview 
Sunday. ``We thought we had a miracle at the end, but I guess there 
are no miracles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firing ended an up-and-down week for Peterman. During the  
interview in his office on Tuesday, he was resigned to his 
company's apparent demise. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was bothered by the gleeful edge to some of the  
coverage of J. Peterman's struggles, the 57-year-old executive 
responded: ``That's human nature'' and cited Theodore Roosevelt's 
words about the irrelevance of critics to ``the man who is actually 
in the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```His place shall never be with those timid souls who know  
neither victory nor defeat,''' Peterman recited. ``I really and 
truly don't care what people think and say about me,'' he said. 
``Everybody's going to have an opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, after Paul Harris rode in as a last-minute white  
knight, Peterman said he was looking forward to working with the 
new owners to take the company forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time marketing executive started his business in 1987 by  
advertising those trademark dusters in the back pages of The New 
Yorker and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	His subsequent catalog offered retro clothing and accessories,  
and revolutionized the mail-order business with its lyrical, 
nostalgia-drenched copy and drawings. The stylized prose and 
misty-eyed regard for the past made J. Peterman an easy target for 
satire, but the company's true impact can be seen in the scores of 
catalogs masquerading as lifestyle magazines that now cram 
mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his company sought protection from its creditors in a Jan.  
25 filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Peterman 
had not hesitated to share his opinions, particularly about Heller 
Financial, the Chicago bank he blamed for the filing. He refused 
requests by lawyers for the company's creditors that he stop 
speaking publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling was that I owe it to the customers and the people  
who like my company that if things are going bad, John steps up and 
says things are going bad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Peterman, the problems started last year after the  
launch of a planned 70-store expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	When store openings were delayed, catalog sales slumped and a  
new home furnishings catalog tanked, J. Peterman faced a cash 
crunch, he said. That led first to layoffs, then to the bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the expansion plan was overambitious.  
</P>
<P>
	A New York Post article even suggested that J. Peterman was  
cursed by the end of ``Seinfeld'' last May. 
</P>
<P>
	John Peterman disputed those analyses. The aggressive expansion  
plan was necessary to attract investors, he said. The stores that 
opened last year, he said, were very successful, averaging annual 
sales in excess of $500 per square foot, a figure widely considered 
the gold standard in the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The real problem, he said, was that Heller, the expansion plan's  
primary lender, didn't have the stomach to handle the inevitable 
bumps in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said the bank refused to approve routine waivers signed  
by store landlords allowing the company to include in-store 
inventories as collateral, panicked over normal complications and 
demanded an absurd level of collateralization. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, he said, the company and Heller were locked in a  
spiral of mistrust that led the bank to restrict credit for J. 
Peterman, exacerbating the company's cash flow problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Heller did not return repeated calls.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a case of the best deal not being the best deal,'' he  
said. ``They are articulately incompetent.''

<HEADLINE> Hornets Coach Dave Cowens Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Dave Cowens resigned as coach of the  
Charlotte Hornets on Sunday, unhappy with being one of the NBA's 
lowest-paid coaches after leading the team to unprecedented success 
in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens informed the players of his decision before practice  
Sunday, then left the training facility. General Manager Bob Bass 
announced at an evening news conference that Cowens had submitted a 
letter of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not announce an immediate successor, but the  
players were told it will be assistant Paul Silas, who played with 
Cowens for the Boston Celtics in the 1970s. Bass said the 
announcement of the interim coach would be made on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens' departure is the latest blow to what was already the  
most difficult of the franchise's 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one thing after another around here this year,''  
point guard B.J. Armstrong said, shaking his head, as he stood in 
the cold night air after the team held what was described as a 
somber practice following Cowens' announcement. ``You have a 
decision to make. Either you come together or you go into 
disarray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Shinn has been accused of unwanted sexual conduct  
by three women, and fans are calling for him to either start paying 
the top dollars needed to keep good talent or sell the team. 
Injuries have sidelined Charlotte's top two players, and one of 
them, Glen Rice, is reportedly about to be traded to the Los 
Angeles Lakers. The team has struggled to a 4-11 record, and 
attendance has plummeted for a franchise that used to consistently 
be among the NBA's leader in sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this franchise is going through mental fatigue,''  
forward Chuck Person said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens walked into Bass' office late Sunday afternoon and told  
him he was leaving. Bass described the reasons as ``irreconcilable 
differences'' but refused to elaborate. Silas said he tried to talk 
Cowens out of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's ever prepared for something like this,'' Bass said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cowens, the only coach to lead the Hornets to consecutive 50-win  
seasons (54-28 in 1996-97, 51-31 in 1997-98), signed a 3-year, 
$1.89 million contract in May 1996. The contract called for him to 
get salaries of $575,000 his first year, $625,000 last year and 
$675,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cowens went to Shinn last season and said he felt he should  
receive the NBA average of about $1.3 million, the Hornets offered 
him a four-year, $5.2 million extension. But Shinn reportedly 
withdrew the offer in February 1998 because he didn't feel Cowens 
was being appreciative enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens went public with complaints about his salary late last  
month as the team struggled to get out of the gate during the 
lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets are operating without top scorer Rice, who underwent  
elbow surgery before the season began. Leading rebounder Anthony 
Mason also underwent arm surgery and is out for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has taken a lot of hits already this year,'' Bass  
said. ``We've got 60 days left and hopefully we'll be able to make 
some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, many of the players refused to comment, but  
starting guard Bobby Phills said Cowens' meeting with the players 
was an emotional one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very distraught,'' Phills said. ``Deep down, maybe it's  
something he didn't feel as though he wanted to do. But it's 
something he may have felt was best for his family and for 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bass said the Hornets have no plans to bring in someone from  
outside the organization to coach the team, at least not between 
now and the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas would be a sensible choice because he is the only one of  
the team's current assistants with previous NBA head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult position to be in,'' Silas said. ``If it  
happens, I would have wanted it to happen differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong and teammate J.R. Reid said Silas will coach for the  
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas and Cowens won NBA championships together with the Celtics  
in 1974 and 1976. During his 16-year playing career, Silas played 
for St. Louis, Atlanta, Phoenix, Boston, Denver and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him there's just two more months left in the season,  
but his mind was made up,'' Silas said of his attempt to convince 
Cowens to change his mind. ``At this point in the season, it's just 
shocking. That's the only word I can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas coached the San Diego Clippers from 1980-83. All three of  
those teams had losing records. He interviewed last summer for 
head-coaching vacancies in Chicago, Sacramento and Seattle but 
didn't get any of the three jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult position to be in,'' he said as he left  
the team's training center Sunday night, five hours after Cowens 
quit. ``But if you're called upon, then I think you have to accept 
it for the good of the organization, for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans have called on Shinn to sell the Hornets for the good of  
the team, but club officials said late last week the team was not 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``From management on down, I think you have to keep some things  
in the inner circle, and obviously we've shown an inability to,'' 
Person said. ``We're washing our dirty laundry outside in the cold 
on the old washboards, instead of keeping it inside where it's nice 
and cozy and there's a washer and dryer. Who knows what's going to 
come of this.''

<HEADLINE> Some Say America in Cultural War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a ``war'' going on in this country,  
but most people may not notice. It's about whether absolute right 
and wrong exist and whether Americans can even tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of prosperity, some thinkers see a decline in  
things money cannot buy -- values, morals and old truths. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Pat Buchanan pledged at the onset of his third  
presidential campaign to ``clean up all that pollutes our 
culture.'' Another prominent activist from the right, Paul Weyrich, 
has gone as far as suggesting conservatives separate themselves 
from U.S. culture -- ``an ever wider sewer,'' he called it -- because 
the ``enemy'' has won. 
</P>
<P>
	A president who lied and still leads is held out as an example  
of cultural decline. So are magazine covers peddling sexual 
gratification and raunchy TV. Even the move toward turning George 
Washington's birthday into a generic Presidents Day is cited as a 
sign of how this country has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we are  
engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting to 
defend,'' Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the leading House 
impeachment prosecutor, told the Senate in his effort to unseat 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The culture war is an apocalyptic struggle ranging across the  
landscape of national life, yet hardly visible to so many. It takes 
multiple forms: the constitutional impeachment drama, Hollywood 
fare, billboard advertising, the teaching of history, behavior on 
college campuses, Internet content and more. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about absolute truth vs. relativism has engaged  
philosophers since the earliest time: Is truth eternal and 
unchanging or is it relative, depending on circumstance, time and 
place? 
</P>
<P>
	To the cultural warriors, America is ``slouching towards  
Gomorrah,'' the biblical city destroyed for the sinfulness of its 
people. Yet the disquiet is difficult for many to fathom. Most 
social indicators either are good or improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a cultural war among the elite,'' says Boston College  
sociologist Alan Wolfe, author of ``One Nation After All.'' ``But 
it doesn't go much farther than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of the book titles at the center of the conflict  
recognize that people are not really with it: William Bennett's 
anti-Clinton ``The Death of Outrage'' and Robert Bork's ``Slouching 
Towards Gomorrah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Hunter, who popularized the phrase in scholarly circles  
with his 1980s book ``Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define 
America,'' agrees the fight mobilizes no more than 10 percent of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says that does not diminish its intensity or importance.  
Elites, after all, shape what is taught to children, shown on TV, 
turned into law and resolved in courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the majority of Americans live their lives fairly  
removed from these kinds of tensions,'' he says. ``That doesn't 
mean there's not a culture war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The culture war is often traced to the 1960s, the decade of  
protest, free love, beads and bad pants. Some slogans from that 
time still hold meaning today, among them ``Do Your Own Thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are pretty tolerant,'' says Todd Gitlin, once at the  
vanguard of the counterculture as president of Students for a 
Democratic Society. ``They have their judgments. They just don't 
think people should enforce their judgments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gitlin, who wrote ``The Twilight of Common Dreams: Why America  
Is Wracked by Culture Wars,'' concedes the 1960s eroded traditional 
authority and brought on the ``rambunctious relativists'' -- perhaps 
the sort of people who later would judge that Clinton should stay 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
	That is how GOP Rep. Tom Delay of Texas, the majority whip, saw  
the impeachment struggle. He told the House it was ``a debate about 
relativism vs. absolute truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some public opinion research indicates Americans, while more  
religious than many cultures and hardly freewheeling about sex, are 
moving toward consensus on many social issues. No seething cultural 
conflict is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe ticks off areas where he is finding common ground among  
most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working women,'' he offers. ``That used to be a big fight.  
Race -- we used to have overt and explicit racism. No one questions 
the principle any more of racial equality. God -- we used to have 
furious battles between Catholics and Protestants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An August 1998 poll by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family  
Foundation found strong majorities supporting both ``traditional 
family values'' and the idea that people should be tolerant of 
those who live by moral standards that they consider wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	But for some warriors there remains too much moral equivocation,  
too much garbage on the tube, too far a drift from the verities. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, declared  
that his side has ``probably lost the culture war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is suggesting conservatives consider such steps as home  
schooling and getting rid of TV, saying ``we have to look at what 
we can do to separate ourselves from this hostile culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter believes that what is driving the cultural war is a  
distinctively American, ``almost irrational, concern for 
perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are ways in which we as Americans at the end of the 20th  
century are just as much Puritans as our Puritan forebears,'' he 
said. ``There is this impulse to build a city on a hill and for 
that to be a bright and shining light, and we won't accept anything 
short of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says the advocates hold firm to their positions; some argue  
abortion is murder, while others, on the opposite side, believe in 
homosexual marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Stay tuned, he suggests.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any conflict that is institutionalized in a number of very  
prominent, well-funded organizations and whose historical and 
cultural roots go back as far as I think they go back, is not going 
to go away any time soon,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for making love, not war.

<HEADLINE> Olajuwon Meets With Dying Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy dying of brain cancer got  
a rare treat Sunday -- meeting the Houston Rockets star for whom he 
is named. 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon Wells, who has tumors in his brain and spine, seemed  
stunned when Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon walked up to the boy 
and his family outside the visitors' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy frowned for pictures with the 7-foot future Hall of  
Famer, but then brightened up and smiled after the player went back 
into the locker room to get ready for a game with the Portland 
Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We show him who Hakeem is on the TV all the time,'' said  
Wells' mother, Clarissa Wells. ``But I don't think he realized who 
he was until he saw him for real just now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wells and her husband, Cornell, named their son Olajuwon  
because of their devotion to the Rockets. They had never seen an 
NBA player, or a game, in person until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great player. I love the way he plays,'' Mrs. Wells  
said, trembling and tearing up after meeting Olajuwon. ``And that 
name just got to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when his son's birthday was, Cornell, a Portland  
construction worker, said: ``Oct. 21, 1994 -- the Rockets repeated 
that year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was diagnosed with cancer last month. His tumors are  
inoperable and has a life expectancy of about two years, said his 
doctor, Legacy Emanuel Hosptial pediatric neurosurgeon Monica 
Wehby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fighter,'' Cornell Wells said. ``He told me himself,  
Daddy, I'm going to fight this all the way to the end. And I 
believe that.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Fans Rejoice at Orioles News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Amid the clanging steel drums, trumpet blares and  
impassioned screams of a playoff game, Cuban baseball fans 
responded with joy Sunday upon learning that the Baltimore Orioles 
will play the national team here on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do come,'' Stanley Hynds, a 25-year-old  
barber, shouted above the crowd as he gyrated his hips in an 
improvised celebration dance. ``It will be a pleasure for us to see 
them and to see them lose right here in this stadium!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball will return to Cuba for the first time in  
40 years with the deal completed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made in the United States, but the word  
circulated among the 40,000 fans who crowded into the 
Latinoamericano Stadium Sunday afternoon for the playoff between 
the two hometown favorites: the Industriales and La Habana. The 
playoff series began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. baseball season has not yet started, the regular  
Cuban season begins in November and ends in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with the idea of their coming to our country to  
play,'' said Marina Ruiz Garnemedia, the director of a children's 
performance group, whose members banged on metal percussion 
instruments, danced the rumba and chanted support for their 
favorite team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Win Industriales! Win!' shouted the girls in matching  
turquoise skirts and cropped tops and boys with multi-colored shirt 
sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a very human, very personal contact between the  
people of our two countries,'' Ruiz, 45, said with a broad grin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is to play a return exhibition game at Camden  
Yards. The second game will be played either just before Baltimore 
starts the regular season April 5 or on an off day during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came after two months of negotiations between the  
State Department, Cuban government, commissioner's office, the 
Orioles and the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but  
the last were the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, who 
played exhibition games there in March 1959, about 2 1/2 months after 
Fidel Castro's revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fresneda, 66, a construction worker, said he remembers  
that game, as well as the games that Cuba's Sugar Kings played here 
against Triple A teams from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to every game at this stadium,'' said Fresneda. ``And  
you can be sure that I'll come here for the Orioles game, too.''

<HEADLINE> Palmeiro Out at Least a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Texas Rangers first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro had his second knee operation within a month on Sunday and 
will be sidelined 4-to-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told there's a chance he'll be ready for opening  
day,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I don't know how 
accurate that is but I'm going to go on that. I'm just trying to 
make plans for the last few days knowing that this would be a 
possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest surgery was to repair torn cartilage in his right  
knee. Palmeiro, who played with the Rangers from 1989-93 before 
re-signing as a free agent during the offseason, also had surgery 
Feb. 10 to repair another injury on the same knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He was working out with the club and had been expected to return  
by the end of the week, but reinjured his knee while jogging 
Thursday. Dr. John Conway operated on the knee Sunday at Fort 
Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas general manager Doug Melvin said there is an outside  
chance Palmeiro could be ready for opening day, ``but realistically 
we'll have to look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, flush with talent at first base going into spring  
training, suddenly are scrambling to fill the position. 
Outfielder/first baseman Mike Simms also is out for up to a month 
with a partially torn left Achilles' tendon. Designated hitter Lee 
Stevens will fill in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I just have to get us by out there until these guys  
get back,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro, 34, has appeared in 1,368 games in the '90s, second to  
Cal Ripken Jr. He has not missed more than three games in a season 
since 1990.

	Albanians Expected To Sign Kosovo Deal  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Kosovo's Albanian leaders later today are expected  
to sign a peace plan to give them autonomy -- a pledge that would 
intensify pressure on the Serbs to sign the agreement or face NATO 
airstrikes. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who negotiated the agreement at 
the request of President Clinton, said yesterday that he was 
confident Kosovo's Albanians would follow through. So far, the 
Serbs have accepted most of the political aspects of the peace plan 
to give broad self-rule to Kosovo for the next three years; the 
province's future would be decided later.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Two British balloonists were safely rescued earlier

attempt to be the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air 
balloon. The British Cable and Wireless balloon landed 200 miles 
off the coast of central Japan, according to an official from 
Japan's Maritime Safety Agency. Pilots Andy Elson and Colin Prescot

defense official. Secretary of Defense William Cohen reached the 
agreement for the hardware in a meeting with Saudi Prince Sultan. 
The Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles will likely be used 
on F-16 fighter jets and are a high priority given the increasingly 
aggressive tactics being employed by Iraqi air forces. No purchase 
price for the missiles was disclosed

	Indian Military Plane Crash Kills 21  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- An Indian air force transport plane  
crashed near a huge township today and exploded in a ball of fire 
in a cluster of bricklayers' huts, killing 21 people, officials 
said. The Russian-built AN-32 aircraft suddenly veered as it 
prepared to land, clipped a brick boundary wall and vaulted into a 
massive drinking water reservoir, flattening dozens of brick huts 
belonging to workers building water storage tanks, witnesses said. 
The dead included 18 people in the plane and three in the huts.

	Russians Withdrawn From Chechnya  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia ordered its government mission out  
of the breakaway republic of Chechnya today because of dangerous 
conditions, a news agency reported. The order to leave the republic 
came two days after a band of masked men kidnapped a top Kremlin 
official, dragging him from an airplane as it was about to leave 
the Chechen capital, Grozny, for Moscow. Russia and the rest of the 
world consider Chechnya a Russian province, but the territory runs 
its own affairs ever since the Chechens' 1994-96 war for 
independence from Moscow.

to prevent it, the China Youth Daily reported today. Thirty-two 
legislators submitted a proposal for a law against sexual 
harassment to the annual session of the Chinese legislature that 
opened Friday, the official newspaper said. The proposal submitted 
to the National People's Congress noted laws in other countries 
that bar sexual harassment, the newspaper said.

In winning a DGA award, Spielberg stands a strong chance of getting 
a director's award at the Oscars on March 21. Only four times has 
the DGA winner not repeated at the Academy Awards. The winner of 
the directing Oscar also usually sees his film take a best picture

	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Josh Steinthal scored 19 points and  
Oregon State muddled the NCAA tournament seeding in the West by 
upsetting No. 6 Stanford 59-45 last night. Deaundra Tanner added 17 
points for the Beavers (13-14, 7-11 Pac-10) and outplayed Stanford 
guard Arthur Lee, who was held to just six points after scoring a 
combined 50 in his last two games. Stanford's point total was its 
season low, eclipsing a 57-49 loss to North Carolina in November.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Banana Fight Threatens WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The showdown over bananas between the United  
States and Europe has put the future of the World Trade 
Organization at risk, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Europeans don't start dealing with us more honestly in  
complying with WTO decisions, I don't know that WTO is going to 
exist or amount to anything,'' Lott, R-Miss., said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has become the battleground for a dispute between the  
United States and the European Union over European restrictions on 
imports of Central and Latin American bananas. The WTO ruled 
against the Europeans in 1997. But the United States, saying the EU 
had not adequately redressed the issue, announced plans to impose 
$520 million in retaliatory tariffs on European goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The 133-nation WTO, set up in 1995, meets in emergency session  
Monday to hear the EU's complaint that the U.S. sanctions are 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO made a decision on bananas. The Europeans have stiffed  
us,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is a free trader but believes that stiff penalties  
should be imposed on any country that dumps goods in this country 
or otherwise practices unfair trade. Lott said he is against 
letting China, which has had a stormy trade relationship with the 
United States, join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is pushing the case because American  
companies, including Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole 
Food Co., grow their bananas mostly in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman and GOP presidential hopeful  
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he worries about protectionist 
sentiments evident within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I care about bananas. My kids eat them every day. But  
I'm not sure that's a reason for us to escalate into a trade war 
here,'' he said, also on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was glad TV commentator Pat Buchanan, a strong  
proponent of protecting U.S. industries, is running for president 
again so the issue of free trade could be debated. ``I'm deeply 
concerned about this rise in protectionism and isolationism,'' 
McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Precocity Wins New Orleans Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Precocity upset 1998 Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness Stakes winner Real Quiet and a small field to win by a 
half-length Sunday in the $500,000 New Orleans Handicap at the Fair 
Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Martin Jr., Precocity made his move from the  
fifth position in a six-horse field midway through the final turn. 
When the horses straightened out for home, the 5-year-old 
maneuvered outside Take Note of Me, Allen's Oop and Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-to-2 second choice in the betting inched past second-place  
Real Quiet in the final strides to claim the $322,121 winner's 
share of the purse in the time of 1:49. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet's first start since losing the 1998 Belmont Stakes by  
a nose to Victory Gallop was impressive. The favorite ran second 
among a cluster of three horses ahead of the small field through a 
1 1/8 miles. But when jockey Kent Desormeaux called upon him to fire 
at the end, the 1998 Eclipse Award winning 3-year-old did not 
respond to Precocity's charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's Oop finished third.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Real Quiet's inactivity because of a slight injury in the  
Belmont Stakes, Precocity had run seven times. His last outing was 
an easy victory in the Whirlaway Stakes at the Fairgrounds on Feb. 
14. In that race, he came from fourth place to catch the leaders 
nearly in identical style. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory on the fast track increased Precocity's earnings for  
owner John Franks to $1,667,462. He finished second to Phantom On 
Tour in the 1998 New Orleans Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, bought privately from Real Quiet's trainer Bob  
Baffert, paid $7.60, $2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet paid $2.40 and $2.10. Allen's Oop paid $2.10.

<HEADLINE> India Military Plane Crashes 23 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- An Indian air force transport plane  
crashed near a huge township Sunday and exploded in a ball of fire 
in a cluster of bricklayers' huts, killing 23 people, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-built AN-32 aircraft suddenly veered as it prepared  
to land, clipped a brick boundary wall and vaulted into a massive 
drinking water reservoir, flattening dozens of brick huts of 
construction workers building the water storage tanks, eyewitnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six others were injured in the accident, which left the front  
half of the plane embedded in the water tank and its truncated tail 
end lying in a heap of blackened, twisted metal on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane slid on the ground at high speed for more 150 feet,  
leaving the path littered with broken shards of metal and debris of 
the poor laborers' huts. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people on board the plane and six civilians on the  
ground were confirmed dead, said Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, the 
highest elected official of the state of New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The air force launched an inquiry into the accident and civil  
and military officials were unwilling to make immediate comment on 
the likely cause. Retired Air Marshall Denzil Keeler told Star 
Television the airport was suddenly enveloped in thick fog that 
reduced visibility to nearly zero, and the aircraft apparently 
undershot the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Press Trust of India said the plane was cleared for landing when  
it suddenly disappeared from the radar screen, crashed and caught 
fire. Rescuers were searching for the flight data recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear early in the morning, but later there was a thick  
wave of fog,'' said eyewitness Budhan Singh Kaitwar, 22, who 
escaped unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another plane was flying across the sky when this plane came  
from across, at a very low height, and slammed with a big sound 
into the huts,'' said Kaitwar. ``Everybody was shouting, 'Run! 
Run!''' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was flying in from Gwalior in central India when it  
crashed about 1 1/2 miles from the airport, Press Trust reported. 
Airport authorities reportedly had declared the area unsafe for 
residences, but it was never evacuated, United News of India 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who identified herself as Phulwani said two of her  
children were killed when a piece of burning metal hit her hut. 
Phulwani, cuddling an infant, said she was working in a nearby area 
when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had gone out of the house and when I came in, I found both  
my sons dead,'' she said, pointing to her hut where red blotches of 
dried blood were visible in a heap of charred bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport, which handles international, domestic and military  
flights, was closed to all traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second air accident in three days in India. On  
Friday, an Air France cargo plane crash landed in the southern city 
of Madras. The plane was burned to a skeleton, but only one of the 
five-member crew was injured.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Sweatshop Protests Staged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters across the country demonstrated  
Saturday outside stores they say sell clothing made in sweatshop 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, as many as 300 activists crowded in front of  
the Gap flagship store in the busy downtown shopping district. 
Police arrested 16 after they blocked a doorway to the store, said 
Capt. Dennis Martel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred activists marched up Manhattan's Fifth Avenue in  
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want clothes made in sweatshops,'' said a sign  
hoisted over a sea of umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gap has been charged with having its clothes manufactured  
with indentured labor, mostly young Asian women working on the U.S. 
island of Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
	Class-action lawsuits filed in January in California by human  
rights groups claim Saipan workers face beatings, forced abortions, 
vermin-infested quarters and armed guards -- all while making 
clothing tagged ``Made in the USA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Gap company officials said they were ``deeply  
concerned by the allegations in the lawsuits. We simply do not, and 
will not, tolerate the type of conduct alleged in factories where 
we do business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protester Emma Berkman, a bicycle messenger, says she no longer  
buys clothing ``unless it says it's union-made. You can't trust 
anybody otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York rally ended in front of the Nike store on East 57th  
Street. The Nike corporation insists it is now monitoring factories 
in Asia where critics say miserably paid workers have suffered 
conditions that include physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Other anti-Gap protests happened in front of Northern California  
stores in Berkeley, Fresno, Santa Monica and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cambridge, Mass., about 10 Harvard University students spent  
an hour in the cold weather handing out leaflets in front of The 
Gap and chanting, ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Gap sweatshops have to go.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: More Sports Harassment Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More men are coaching women's teams -- and  
getting accused of sexual harassment, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the increase in women's sports since the enactment of Title  
IX, the percentage of women coaching female teams has declined from 
90 percent in 1972 to 47 percent, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	While few statistics are available, the Times interviewed about  
50 athletes, parents, coaches, administrators and researchers. 
Lawsuits against North Carolina soccer coach Anson Dorrance, the 
former coach of the U.S. national team, and Syracuse tennis coach 
Jesse Dwire have highlighted the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big problem out there,'' Don Sabo, a sociology  
professor at D'Youville College in Buffalo, told the Times. ``It's 
all about emotions, about trust, and about the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joel Fish, director of the Center for Sport Psychology in  
Philadelphia, added: ``The whole issue of sexual harassment within 
athletics, of coaches trying to understand the boundaries of what's 
right and wrong, of when to yell and when to pat her on the back, 
of whether or not to hug, is still being defined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Keller, a U.S. national team player and a former college  
player of the year, has accused Dorrance of inappropriate behavior 
that included uninvited sexual comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Jennings has accused Dorrance, who has led North  
Carolina to 15 NCAA titles and the United States to a Women's World 
Cup championship, of creating a hostile environment for her before 
cutting her from the team. Dorrance has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwire, a 20-year veteran at Syracuse, was accused of massaging,  
fondling and propositioning two scholarship tennis players, Kirsten 
Ericson and Dacia Kornechuk, in a suit scheduled for trial March 29 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses the school of retaliating against the players  
after they pursued a complaint through the university's grievance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A university panel recommended a two-year ban of Dwire in 1997,  
finding he had violated policies regarding sexual harassment and 
discrimination. However, the penalty was reduced to a three-month 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	A Syracuse spokesman said neither Dwire nor any of the dozen  
university administrators named in the suit would comment.

<HEADLINE> Women's Wrestling Grows As a Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At 5 feet tall and about 115 pounds, Patricia  
Miranda doesn't think of herself as scary -- except when she has to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows she can intimidate women, men and teen-age boys.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford University sophomore is a nationally ranked  
wrestler. And like most other female wrestlers, when she isn't 
matched against females, she's matched against males. She started 
wrestling boys in the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did a trial run and really liked it -- and why not?'' Miranda  
said. ``It was a sport that took all of me. What intrigued me most 
was the mental challenge. Almost all of it was mind games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling is not beyond women, Miranda said. ``If the woman  
feels she can compete on the male level, it is possible, especially 
in high school,'' she said. ``Women are weaker, just by physiology 
-- but they can train and have more speed and be more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda is ranked No.2 on the women's national team sponsored by  
USA Wrestling, the U.S. amateur governing body. Although she can 
wrestle in international competitions against women, there is no 
Olympic women's competition. The sport might be included in the 
2004 Summer Games, said Mike Duroe, the team's national 
developmental coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Females are a small minority of U.S. wrestlers, but they are a  
growing minority. Their trouble is that, with some exceptions, 
there still are too few females in one place to create female 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	At the high school level, around 1,900 girls participated in the  
1997-98 school year, compared with more than 229,000 boys, 
according to the National Federation of State High School 
Associations, which tracks high school sports participation. In the 
first year in which girls' participation was surveyed, 1984-85, 
there were six, said federation spokesman Bruce Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	When they can't fill their own teams, girls can join boys' teams  
under provisions of the federal government's Title IX equal 
opportunity provisions for athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Miranda's experience. She's on Stanford's men's team, but  
she wrestles women in national and international competition. It's 
all the same to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I walk onto the mat, I feel no connection to my gender,''  
Miranda said. ``I transform not only into a competitor but a 
wrestler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for criticism that there could be something sexual in boys  
and girls grappling on a mat, Miranda doesn't buy it. ``I've never 
heard of a boy being turned on or being uncomfortable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a male opponent feels uncomfortable wrestling a female,  
that's his problem, Miranda believes. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows some do. At Redwood Junior High in Saratoga, Calif.,  
``nobody told me not to be there, so it was a generally positive 
experience,'' she said. At Saratoga High, there was more 
``male-female politicking -- I don't want to say harassment,'' she 
said. ``But I was captain of my high school team by the time I was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some junior high boys defaulted rather than wrestle her, Miranda  
recalled. ``Boys just do not want to lose to a girl,'' she said. By 
college, it's less of a factor -- and at Stanford, it's no factor at 
all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that boys would default rather than wrestle a girl  
angers Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports 
Foundation in East Meadow, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think boys should be allowed to do it,'' she said.  
``The coach should say, `We are wrestling every athlete on that 
team. You either wrestle or you are not on the team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the sport probably will grow to the point at which  
many girls' teams can be fielded, Lopiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls who wrestle should be on female teams, said Walter  
Sargent, athletic director of Brookline, Mass., public schools, 
where the high school has a girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls should not wrestle boys, even when they can under Title  
IX, because it's bad for the girls, Sargent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids say they get the opportunity to be offensive and  
aggressive, and not be in a defensive posture, as they would be 
against boys, who are stronger and bigger,'' Sargent said. And by 
not offering a girls' team, schools limit girls' participation to 
those girls who will wrestle boys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda disagrees. ``I don't see why a coach would make a  
judgment for the female population,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Shalala Fends Off Attempted Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health and Human Services Secretary Donna  
Shalala fended off an attempted robbery at a bank cash machine 
Sunday and provided police with information that led to three 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala, 58, was not hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred about 7:15 a.m. after she had withdrawn  
money from an ATM near her home in the Georgetown section of town 
and was walking back to her car, said Lt. Pat Burke of the District 
of Columbia Police. 
</P>
<P>
	A man tried to grab Shalala's wallet, telling her, ``give it up,  
give it up,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Shalala falls to the ground, curls into a fetal position  
and screams her lungs out,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a witness approached, the man and a woman standing nearby  
jumped into their car, joining a second woman already behind the 
wheel. The three then drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala noted the license plate and called police, who arrived  
quickly, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police apprehended the trio after witnesses reported seeing  
three people fleeing a car in another part of Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary was able to identify a man and one of the women  
when police brought them back to the crime scene, said Shalala's 
spokeswoman, Melissa Skolfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``She thinks the police did an excellent job,'' Skolfield said.  
She said Shalala was ``absolutely unhurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke credited Shalala with quick thinking in protecting herself  
and helping police make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Shalala did what she felt was necessary to protect herself  
and it worked well for her.'' He said she was ``very astute'' in 
getting the tag number of the suspects and relaying it to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police determined the vehicle was stolen and found items stolen  
from a young woman earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with attempted robbery, robbery and use of an  
unauthorized vehicle were district residents Tawana Nicole Clark, 
20; Donald Sewell Clark, 22; and Sylvia Lorraine Dorsey, 20.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Unveils Tournament Seedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Big Ten tied the record with seven  
teams selected Sunday for the NCAA tournament. The Southeastern 
Conference grabbed most of the top spots, however, with one-fourth 
of the top 16 seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no shocks about the No. 1 seeds -- top-ranked Duke,  
Michigan State, Auburn and Connecticut -- and there weren't many 
controversies about the at-large teams taken for the final few of 
the 64 spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten set the record with seven teams in 1990 and it was  
matched by the Big East in 1991 and the Big Ten again in 1994. The 
league could have gotten the record if Illinois had completed its 
conference tournament run with another upset over Michigan State on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think in terms of conferences,'' NCAA Selection  
Committee chairman C.M. Newton said. ``The fact is we had seven 
teams in. Had Illinois won, that would have won their way in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Coast Conference will have only three teams, its  
lowest total since only two were chosen for the field of 48 in 
1980, when the tournament tips off Thursday and Friday. Newton said 
the league had a chance for a fourth team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wake Forest really needed to win a game in the (ACC)  
tournament and they didn't do that,'' he said. ``They had a chance 
to play their way in and didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to regular-season and tournament champion Michigan  
State, the other Big Ten teams selected were Ohio State, Indiana, 
Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's seeded teams were Auburn, No. 3 Kentucky and No. 4s  
Tennessee and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, second-seeded Maryland and third-seeded North Carolina  
were the ACC teams chosen. The Big East, with Connecticut, No. 2 
Miami and No. 3 St. John's, also had three teams in the top 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (32-1), the first team to go 16-0 in the ACC, will take  
their 27-game winning streak into an opening-round game in the East 
Regional in Charlotte, N.C., on Friday against Florida A&AMP;M, one of 
five teams in the tournament for the first time. The Rattlers 
(12-18), who won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament, 
are the only team in the field with a sub-.500 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't (win the tournament) we'll know that we did  
everything we could to try to win it and we didn't let pressure 
stop us,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said of his team's overall 
No. 1 seeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (29-4), the Big Ten champion, was chosen No. 1 in  
the Midwest Regional and will play on Friday against Mount St. 
Mary's, the Northeast Conference champions coached by 800-game 
winner Jim Phelan. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (27-3), which lost to Kentucky in the Southeastern  
Conference tournament semifinals, opens play in the South Regional 
on Thursday in Indianapolis against Winthrop, the Big South 
champions making their first tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (28-2) was the only top seed moved out of its  
natural region. The Big East champions will play in Denver on 
Thursday against Texas-San Antonio, which won the Southland 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason is because Duke is the No. 1 seed,'' Newton said of  
Connecticut's move to the West. ``UConn came out second but had to 
go out of region because Duke was the top seed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big East and Big 12 each had five teams invited. The other  
multibid conferences were Conference USA and Pac-10 with four each; 
the Atlantic Coast Conference, Missouri Valley Conference and 
Western Athletic Conference with three teams each; and the 
Mid-American Conference with two. 
</P>
<P>
	The other games to be played in Charlotte are: fourth-seeded  
Tennessee against No. 13 Delaware; fifth-seeded Wisconsin against 
No. 12 Southwest Missouri State; and eighth-seeded College of 
Charleston against No. 9 Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boston it will be: second-seeded Miami against No. 15  
Lafayette, which is making its first appearance since 1957; 
third-seeded Cincinnati against No. 14 George Mason; sixth-seeded 
Temple against No. 11 Kent; and seventh-seeded Texas against No. 10 
Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Regional semifinals and finals will be held March 19  
and 21 in East Rutherford, N.J.	   In addition to the Michigan State-Mount St. Mary's game in 
Milwaukee, fourth-seeded Arizona plays No. 13 Oklahoma; 
fifth-seeded North Carolina Charlotte meets No. 12 Rhode Island; 
and No. 8 Villanova plays No. 9 Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The games Friday in New Orleans feature second-seeded Utah  
against No. 15 Arkansas State; No. 3 Kentucky against 14th-seeded 
New Mexico State; No. 6 Kansas against 11th-seeded Evansville; and 
seventh-seeded Washington against No. 10 Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest Regional semifinals and finals are March 19 and 21  
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other games Thursday in Indianapolis, fourth-seeded Ohio  
State plays No. 13 Murray State; No. 5 UCLA meets 12th-seeded 
Detroit; and Syracuse plays Oklahoma State in the 8-9 matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The other South subregional starts Thursday in Orlando, Fla.,  
and features No. 2 Maryland against last year's surprise team, No. 
15 Valparaiso; No. 3 St. John's against 14th-seeded Samford; No. 6 
Indiana against No. 11 George Washington; and seventh-seeded 
Louisville, the school given a second chance at being in the 
tournament, against No. 10 Creighton. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Regional semifinals and final will be March 18 and 20  
in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Connecticut-Texas-San Antonio, the games Thursday  
in Denver feature No. 4 Arkansas against No. 13 Siena; No. 5 Iowa 
against No. 12 Alabama Birmingham; and No. 8 Missouri against No. 9 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle on Thursday second-seeded Stanford plays No. 15  
Alcorn State; No. 3 North Carolina meets No. 14 Weber State; No. 6 
Florida goes up against No. 11 Pennsylvania; and No. 7 Minnesota 
plays No. 10 Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Regional semifinals and finals will be March 18 and 20  
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The national semifinals are March 27 in St. Petersburg, Fla.,  
and the matchups are South vs. West and East vs. Midwest. The 
championship game is March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina extended its own record with its 25th consecutive  
appearance, 10 more than the next best current streak, Arizona's 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	The other first-time NCAA teams are Arkansas State, Kent and  
Samford.

<HEADLINE> J.Peterman Founder Has Last Laugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Even as he prepared for his company's  
expected demise, sitting in an office filled with half-packed boxes 
and a pile of unwanted clothes, John Peterman said he understood 
people finding humor in the struggles of The J. Peterman Co. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a catalog company that, after all, started out by  
selling floor-length, cowboy-style dusters and became most famous 
for being parodied on ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Peterman smiled at the ``Doonesbury'' strip in which two  
characters discussed the bankruptcy filing of ``J. Pretensions,'' 
with one remarking as she strolled through falling snow: ``Cold 
today ... Sure wish I had a nice, warm duster!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he shrugged when The New Yorker offered its version of a  
Peterman going-out-of-business sale, with used wastebaskets hyped 
in a satire of the catalog's romanticized ad copy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it was Peterman who had the last laugh. There will  
be no going-out-of-business sale; a last-second buyer, Paul Harris 
Stores Inc. of Indianapolis, appeared at a liquidation auction 
Friday and bought J. Peterman for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase saved the catalog operation and at least 10 of the  
company's 13 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite happy,'' he said after the auction.  
</P>
<P>
	His relief contrasted with his resigned demeanor earlier in the  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was bothered by the gleeful edge to some of the  
coverage of J. Peterman's struggles, the 57-year-old executive 
responded: ``That's human nature'' and cited Theodore Roosevelt's 
words about the irrelevance of critics to ``the man who is actually 
in the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```His place shall never be with those timid souls who know  
neither victory nor defeat,''' Peterman recited. ``I really and 
truly don't care what people think and say about me,'' he said. 
``Everybody's going to have an opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time marketing executive started his business in 1987 by  
advertising those trademark dusters in the back pages of The New 
Yorker and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	His subsequent catalog offered retro clothing and accessories,  
and revolutionized the mail-order business with its lyrical, 
nostalgia-drenched copy and drawings. The stylized prose and 
misty-eyed regard for the past made J. Peterman an easy target for 
satire, but the company's true impact can be seen in the scores of 
catalogs masquerading as lifestyle magazines that now cram 
mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his company sought protection from its creditors in a Jan.  
25 filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Peterman 
had not hesitated to share his opinions, particularly about Heller 
Financial, the Chicago bank he blamed for the filing. He refused 
requests by lawyers for the company's creditors that he stop 
speaking publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling was that I owe it to the customers and the people  
who like my company that if things are going bad, John steps up and 
says things are going bad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Peterman, the problems started last year after the  
launch of a planned 70-store expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	When store openings were delayed, catalog sales slumped and a  
new home furnishings catalog tanked, J. Peterman faced a cash 
crunch, he said. That led first to layoffs, then to the bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the expansion plan was overambitious.  
</P>
<P>
	A New York Post article even suggested that J. Peterman was  
cursed by the end of ``Seinfeld'' last May. 
</P>
<P>
	John Peterman disputed those analyses. The aggressive expansion  
plan was necessary to attract investors, he said. The stores that 
opened last year, he said, were very successful, averaging annual 
sales in excess of $500 per square foot, a figure widely considered 
the gold standard in the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The real problem, he said, was that Heller, the expansion plan's  
primary lender, didn't have the stomach to handle the inevitable 
bumps in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said the bank refused to approve routine waivers signed  
by store landlords allowing the company to include in-store 
inventories as collateral, panicked over normal complications and 
demanded an absurd level of collateralization. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a case of the best deal not being the best deal,'' he  
said. ``They are articulately incompetent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Heller did not return repeated calls seeking  
reaction to Peterman's charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, he said, the company and Heller were locked in a  
spiral of mistrust that led the bank to restrict credit for J. 
Peterman, exacerbating the company's cash flow problem. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the bank refused to loan J. Peterman the money to  
purchase spring inventory after the bankruptcy filing, making it 
harder to find a buyer willing to keep the company going. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier last week, while he was still preparing for his  
company's liquidation, Peterman had refused to indulge in ``what 
if'' scenarios. He said he learned not to do that when he played 
baseball, first at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., and then 
in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think about an error, the next ball hit to you, you're  
going to make an error,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Spielberg Wins Award From Guild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg won the Directors Guild of  
America's award on Saturday night for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
making him and the epic World War II film strong favorites for 
Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	In voting by the union for filmmakers, Spielberg defeated  
Roberto Benigni of ``Life is Beautiful,'' John Madden of 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Terrence Malick of ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
and Peter Weir of ``The Truman Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so happy. I'm like so -- '' Spielberg said, interrupting  
himself as he dropped the plaque onto the podium with a clunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Back stage, Spielberg joked, ``I can't believe I dropped it.''  
</P>
<P>
	He dedicated the award to his father, Arnold Spielberg, and his  
father's World War II generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg noted that all five directors were nominated for both  
DGA awards and Academy Awards, and three for making films about the 
World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are finding ways of embracing history,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which follows a squad of soldiers sent  
to find a private whose brothers were killed in the war, was 
nominated for 11 Academy Awards, second only to ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' with 13. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning a DGA award, Spielberg stands a strong chance of  
getting a director's award at the Oscars on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four times has the DGA winner not repeated at the Academy  
Awards. The winner of the directing Oscar also usually sees his 
film take a best picture award. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg has won three DGA awards, also getting honors for  
``The Color Purple,'' (1985) and ``Schindler's List,'' (1993). 
``Schindler's List'' went on to win seven Academy Awards, including

<HEADLINE> Dow Closing in on 10,000 Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Suddenly, 10,000 is looking like a possibility  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest two-day point  
gain ever this past week, putting the blue chips at a new closing 
high of 9,736.08, and restarting talk about the next big milestone 
for the stock market's most widely-followed barometer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Short-term, it certainly looks like the market wants to make a  
run for 10,000,'' said A. Marshall Acuff, Jr., equity strategist at 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's achievement's were remarkable. It rose 268.68 points  
Friday after a 191.52 point surge Thursday, for a total of 460 
points. The rally resuscitated a bull market that had been squeezed 
almost lifeless in recent weeks by higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The impetus for Wall Street's surge was twofold.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, IBM announced it had agreed to supply Dell Computer  
with $16 billion worth of parts over seven years. The deal 
supported assertions that technology stocks, the undisputed leader 
in the market's advance since last fall, still have some life. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Friday, the Labor Department reported that the economy  
is producing new jobs without feeding inflation. Analysts said the 
report gave the Federal Reserve no reason to raise rates to cool 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynamics of the rally augured well for the market. Wall  
Street's leadership broadened from just technology and medical 
stocks, which have carried the market's water for some time, to 
include financial, retail, energy, even economically sensitive 
manufacturing issues. 
</P>
<P>
	That trend helps to raise optimism about the market's future.  
Thom Brown, market strategist at Rutherford, Brown &AMP; Catherwood in 
Philadelphia, said that, ``in three years' time, you could easily 
see Dow 13,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are still causes for concern. Although angst about  
short-term interest rates lessened with Friday's economic report, 
long-term interest rates have gone up, closing Friday at just under 
5.6 percent after starting the year at 5.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumer credit is growing at a very strong 13.5 percent  
annual rate, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. That does raise 
the possibility that the Fed, hoping to stave off an overheating 
economy, might decide to tighten credit after all. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fed tightening would be deadly for the bull market, which owes  
its spectacular gains and longevity to low interest rates that keep 
consumers and corporations borrowing, spending, and stoking 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the stock market still has to justify extraordinarily  
high valuations, which only got higher this past week. Stocks in 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite were selling at an unheard-of 
29 times 1999 earnings, and that was before Friday's rally.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits First Spring Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Big Mac is on the board.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire hit his first home run of 1999, a trademark shot  
high over the left-field wall Sunday for the St. Louis Cardinals in 
a 6-1 exhibition win over the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off his record-breaking season of 70, McGwire wasted no  
time finding his home-run swing. The three-run drive came in just 
his second official at-bat of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get it out of the way,'' McGwire said. ``But it's  
only spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just see the ball, hit the ball,'' he said. ``I believe it  
should never be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire homered a day after Sammy Sosa hit No. 1 for the Chicago  
Cubs. But there's no race -- at least, not now -- and McGwire said he 
didn't even know about his rival's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd at Roger Dean Stadium got exactly what it wanted  
when McGwire launched a high drive that easily cleared the 
left-field wall in the second inning. He crunched an inside 
fastball from rookie lefty Ted Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like that,'' the 23-year-old pitching  
prospect said. ``I mean, it was loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had a slight smile after he stepped on home plate. J.D.  
Drew, Carlos Baerga and several other Cardinals greeted him, but 
McGwire did not punctuate this homer with his fake punch-to-the-gut 
routine that became his stamp during his historic season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,912 fans, many of them wearing No. 25 McGwire jerseys,  
responded with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball landed between the fence and the Expos clubhouse, an  
off-limits area where park officials considered building bleachers 
this spring expressly for McGwire watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The souvenir was retrieved by stadium marketing director  
Jennifer Chalhub, preparing to drive a 1999 white convertible 
Camaro around the field as part of an in-between inning promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he was up and I got out of the car to protect it,''  
she said. ``He came within 25 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalhub was aware that McGwire's 70th home run ball sold for $3  
million or so, but she didn't try to cash in. Instead, she gave it 
to a little girl about 4 years old standing outside the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured a ball would mean more to a kid,'' Chalhub said. ``I  
didn't even say it was a Mark McGwire ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit seven home runs last year in exhibition play. The  
Cardinals share their training complex with Montreal, and the Expos 
are plenty familiar with McGwire. The All-Star first baseman hit 
his final five home runs last season against them, and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Had this been next month when the Cardinals play Montreal for  
real, Lilly might have just walked him. McGwire led the majors with 
an NL record 162 walks last year, and there were runners on second 
and third when he homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we gave a home run to McGwire and everybody was  
pleased about that,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire went 0-for-1 and was hit by a pitch Saturday in his  
spring debut against Montreal. He hit a long foul Sunday before 
drawing a full-count walk from Jeremy Powell in the first inning, 
and later scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Lilly, McGwire barely missed a home run with a long  
drive that barely hooked foul. He homered on a 2-1 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did not bat again and left the game after three innings  
with the Cardinals ahead 6-0. He stopped in the right-field corner 
to sign autographs for a few minutes before walking to the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the Cardinals' 14 home exhibition games is sold  
out at Roger Dean Stadium. McGwire items dominate the souvenir 
stand, with Big Mac hats, shirts, posters and model bats on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than a piece of merchandise, Lilly got a McGwire memory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty pumped up about the chance to pitch to him for  
the first time. But I went about it the wrong way. I tried to match 
power vs. power,'' he said, ``and obviously he has more.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Powell was hit in the right arm by Joe McEwing's line drive  
in the second inning and left the game. X-rays were negative. ... 
Left fielder Orlando Merced, the leading candidate to fill the only 
vacancy in the Expos' starting lineup, left in the first inning 
because of a pulled groin muscle. Alou said he could miss several 
days. ... Cardinals starter Donovan Osborne pitched three scoreless 
innings, allowing three hits and striking out three.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton ventures empty-handed into  
hurricane-clobbered reaches of Central America this week as nearly 
$1 billion in aid is trapped on Capitol Hill by unrelated, partisan 
disputes. The message of solidarity with America's neighbors that 
he will trumpet during his trip to Nicaragua, El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Honduras is aimed as much at Congress as at the 
people rebuilding the region's roads, homes and schools in the

<HEADLINE> NCAA South: The Also-Ran Region? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Maybe the South should be renamed the Also-Ran Regional of the  
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (27-3), regular-season champion in the Southeastern  
Conference, received a No. 1 seed even though the Tigers lost to 
Kentucky 69-57 in the semifinals of the league tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three seeds in the South Regional also enter the NCAAs  
off losses. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Maryland (26-5) was upset by North Carolina 86-79 in the  
semis of the Atlantic Coast Conference tourney, No. 3 St. John's 
(25-8) was routed by Connecticut 82-63 in the finals of the Big 
East and No. 4 Ohio State (23-8) was shocked by Illinois 79-77 in 
the Big Ten semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, don't stop there. The next five teams in the South lost  
their last games, too, beginning with No. 5 UCLA, beaten 87-70 at 
Arizona in the regular-season finale. It continues through No. 6 
Indiana, No. 7 Louisville, No. 8 Syracuse and No. 9 Oklahoma State, 
all of which lost at various stages of their respective league 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, at the 10th seed, there's a South team that actually  
comes into the tournament on a winning streak. Creighton defeated 
Evansville 70-61 a week ago to win the Missouri Valley Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South, at least, the selection committee seemed intent on  
grouping together some of the nation's most surprising teams, 
rewarding them for the work of an entire season rather than their 
recent failings. 
</P>
<P>
	No team was more stunning than Auburn, a perennial NCAA  
selection during the 1980s with teams that featured Charles Barkley 
and Chuck Person. The Tigers made their last tournament appearance 
in 1988, settling for the NIT four times over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Auburn added junior college transfer Chris Porter, who  
became the SEC player of the year and led the Tigers to their first 
regular-season championship since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time coming for this school,'' coach Cliff  
Ellis said Sunday. ``I wouldn't have believed at the beginning of 
the season we would have accomplished as much. I thought we were an 
NCAA tournament team, but to be a No. 1 seed, its a Cinderella 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Tigers learned in the SEC tournament, seedings don't mean  
a thing on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids and these fans deserve all of this that's going on,  
but we've got to get back down to earth and go practice and get 
ready to play a game,'' Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland, making its school-record sixth straight NCAA  
appearance, received its highest seeding since 1980 but lost a 
chance at No. 1 by falling to North Carolina, a team they already 
had beaten twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a shot at a No. 1 seed -- our power rating was there all  
year, our wins, road record in the conference, all those things 
were there,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said. ``If we would have 
won, I think we would have been a top seed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn opens the tournament against 16th-seeded Winthrop (21-7)  
Thursday in Indianapolis, while Maryland was assigned to the 
Orlando side of the bracket against Valparaiso (23-8), which made a 
surprising run in the tournament a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crusaders became just the second No. 13 seed in tournament  
history to reach the round of 16, upsetting Mississippi and Florida 
State. This time, Valpo is seeded 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's also will be in Orlando to meet Samford (24-5),  
champion of the Trans America Athletic Conference, but it's hard 
not to look ahead to the potential second-round matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Storm wins and No. 11 George Washington (20-8) gets  
by Indiana, first-year St. John's coach Mike Jarvis will face his 
former team. 
</P>
<P>
	The other game in Orlando has Louisville (19-10) against  
Creighton (21-8). The remainder of the Indianapolis bracket has 
Ohio State (23-8) against Murray State (27-5), Syracuse (21-11) vs. 
Oklahoma State (22-10) and UCLA (22-8) taking on Detroit (24-5).

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making a pilgrimage to the sites of Hurricane  
Mitch's worst horrors, President Clinton proffers Central Americans 
hope for their reconstruction so that despair does not turn into 
political trouble for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The president embarks -- without his wife, sidelined by a  
recurring back problem -- today on his four-day, four-nation mission 
just as 15,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans in the United States 
illegally become eligible for deportation. He has turned down pleas 
for an extension of the halt in deportations that was instituted 
after last fall's devastating storm and expires today. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's first stop -- at the only home left standing after  
a wall of mud slid down Nicaragua's Casitas Volcano in October -- 
promises to underscore that many of those illegal immigrants have 
nothing to go home to. 
</P>
<P>
	To have them return now ``would cause us tragic problems of  
stability,'' warned Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, who 
will greet the Clintons in San Salvador tonight. In advance of 
their arrival, Calderon pleaded for the United States to reconsider 
an extension of the stay on deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Michael Hammer said the United States has  
determined the region is capable of ``beginning to receive their 
nationals'' although deportations are not expected to begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Clinton's trip was scripted as a neighborly  
show of compassion, solidarity and assistance -- as much as the 
president could muster while his $956 million emergency aid package 
remained tangled in domestic spending politics on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	On the dried, cracked mud at the foot of Casitas Volcano, he was  
laying flowers at the impression left by the body of a small girl, 
victim of the Oct. 30 landslide that killed 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nearby Posoltega, Nicaragua, schoolyard, Clinton was  
meeting with homeless, jobless and -- many of them -- hopeless 
survivors still living in plastic tents four months after Mitch 
moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are losing hope and you don't want an uncertain  
future,'' Hammer said, laying out the goals of Clinton's trip, 
which follows on separate official missions to the region by Mrs. 
Clinton and Tipper Gore, wife of the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without rebuilding schools, homes, roads, crops and jobs, it  
can lead to despair and corruption,'' Hammer said. ``The people 
need to realize that the United States stands with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brought to Nicaragua only a small grab bag of U.S. aid:  
</P>
<P>
	--$10.6 million from the Agency for International Development to  
repair, equip and staff health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another $1.5 million in AID money for the International Red  
Cross to build 4,000 temporary homes starting this month. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.8 million from the State Department to find and remove the  
civil-war-era land mines remaining in Nicaragua and Honduras. 
Mitch's floods and mudslides complicated the problem by shifting 
mapped areas of land mine deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar packages for El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala would  
be announced at Clinton's subsequent stops in those nations, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each grapples with its share of Mitch's ravages: more than 9,000  
dead, thousands more homeless, and as much as $10 billion in 
infrastructure damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the crisis, Central American leaders fault Clinton's  
trade policy as halfhearted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton submitted legislation to Congress last week providing  
enhanced trade benefits to Central American and Caribbean nations 
under the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats from those nations, who have long pressed for the same  
free-trade benefits that Mexico received under the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, said Clinton's latest CBI enhancement does 
not go far enough to build markets for Central American exports 
and, thus, restore jobs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Nicaraguan officials said, Clinton doomed the  
controversial trade package by sending it to Congress separate from 
the more politically popular direct-aid request. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman beseeched Clinton in a  
letter last week to throw his ``credibility and prestige'' behind 
the CBI legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that,'' said Nicaragua's ambassador to the United  
States, Francisco Aguirre Sacasa, ``I don't think it has a 
snowball's chance in Hell of being approved -- even in its diluted 
form.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hamstrung by domestic politics, President  
Clinton ventures empty-handed into hurricane-clobbered reaches of 
Central America this week. His message of solidarity with America's 
neighbors is aimed as much at Congress as at the people rebuilding 
the region's roads, homes and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton embarks Monday -- without his wife, sidelined by a  
recurring back problem -- on what is intended to be a four-day 
goodwill tour of reconstruction projects in Nicaragua, El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Honduras, those hardest hit by last fall's Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our moral responsibility as a neighbor to this region  
coincides perfectly with our interests as a nation,'' said National 
Security Adviser Sandy Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president leaves at home nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid  
trapped on Capitol Hill by unrelated, partisan disputes over 
spending. Most likely, he will encounter the disappointment of 
Central Americans who fault his trade policy as halfhearted. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. promise not to deport illegal immigrants back to El  
Salvador and Guatemala during the disaster crisis was set to lapse 
Monday. White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste said 
there is ``no basis'' for extending the deportation stay. 
</P>
<P>
	But Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein Barillas of Guatemala warned  
that the forced return of a large number of immigrants severely 
would crimp recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our battered economies are not going to be able to sustain  
this influx of people back to the region,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is to address the Salvadoran legislative assembly  
Wednesday. He will stand with disaster victims in a schoolyard in 
Posoltega, Nicaragua, where mudslides wiped out entire villages, 
and lend support to U.S. troops pitching in on the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	At Guatemala City's anthropology museum, Clinton plans a  
roundtable talk on peace with citizens still smarting from a 
Guatemala truth commission report last week that blames most of the 
deaths and disappearances during that nation's 36-year civil war on 
the U.S.-backed army and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton is to convene a summit with Central  
American presidents to make sure the post-Mitch crisis does not 
derail free-market economics and democratic systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch and its subsequent flooding and mudslides killed more than  
9,000 people, left thousands more homeless and caused between $7 
billion and $10 billion in damage to the region's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States already has spent $305 million on relief,  
eclipsing the $297 million devoted to various disasters in Central 
America from 1964 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from providing plastic sheeting and mosquito nets in the  
first weeks after the disaster, however, the United States must 
also ``sustain a flow of trade and investment'' so that Central 
America's peace, democracy and stability -- still a decade young -- 
are not undone, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton submitted legislation to Congress last week providing  
enhanced trade benefits to Central American and Caribbean nations 
under the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Those nations, long pressing for the same free-trade benefits  
that Mexico received under the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
said Clinton's latest CBI enhancement does not go far enough to 
build markets for Central American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it's indispensable, it is not sufficient,'' Stein  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not find economic horizons that can be sustainable,  
provide for the multiplication of job opportunities in Central 
America,'' the last decade's progress in peace, human rights and 
development cannot proceed, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, said Nicaragua's ambassador to the United States, Clinton  
doomed the controversial trade package by sending it to Congress 
separate from the politically popular direct-aid request for $956 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Francisco Aguirre Sacasa said Clinton's leadership on  
free trade, in the face of opposition from his own Democratic 
Party, ``has been somewhat wanting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Clinton commits his credibility and prestige to the CBI  
legislation, ``I don't think it has a snowball's chance in hell of 
being approved -- even in its diluted form,'' Aguirre Sacasa said.

<HEADLINE> How-To Bomb Guide Had Govt in Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Armed only with encyclopedia diagrams and a  
few college courses in physics, Howard Morland set out 20 years ago 
to discover the secret of the hydrogen bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	He came close, so close that the federal government fought to  
stop the Madison-based magazine The Progressive from publishing his 
free-lance article, ``The H-Bomb Secret: How We Got It, Why We're 
Telling It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cold War was still on and federal officials were worried  
about the national security risk of letting the bomb secrets out of 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	After The Progressive refused a request that it censor the  
article itself, the government went to court. On March 9, 1979, it 
won a temporary restraining order under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act 
that delayed publication for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the article threatened ``grave, direct,  
immediate and irreparable harm to the national security of the 
United States,'' even though it conceded that individual components 
of the article, gleaned from public libraries and tours of nuclear 
facilities, were not restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue might seem melodramatic in today's era of freewheeling  
information dissemination across the Internet, where people can 
easily access ``The Terrorist's Handbook'' or ``The Anarchist 
Cookbook'' on the World Wide Web. Several Web pages deal with 
making hydrogen or atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But The Progressive case was only the second in American history  
that temporarily upheld prior restraint of publication. The first 
involved the Nixon administration's attempt to stop newspapers from 
printing the Pentagon Papers, the classified study of U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam -- which the U.S. Supreme Court eventually 
allowed to be published. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been prior restraint cases since 1979, but none based  
on national security, said David Rudenstine, a law professor at 
Cardozo Law School in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors of The Progressive argued that none of the information  
in their article was really secret and that the piece would help 
demystify nuclear theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized that by not breaking any laws, not getting any  
scientist drunk, not getting any government secrets, you could 
figure out the deepest, darkest secret that the government must 
surely have, such as how to build a hydrogen bomb,'' said Sam Day, 
The Progressive's managing editor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Day, 72, still a writer in Madison, said the article didn't  
enable anyone to actually build a hydrogen bomb, since that costs 
``billions and billions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Progressive eventually prevailed, but by then the government  
had dropped its case because another publication had printed key 
bomb-making steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Morland says he pursued the article as a ``missionary or  
evangelist'' in the campaign to abolish nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My motivation was a very strongly held belief that the entire  
human race ... had discovered that the creator had played a huge 
joke on us,'' Morland said in a telephone interview from his home 
in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got smart enough to figure out nuclear forces, would  
we be wise enough to handle that knowledge? It's a test and there 
is only one right answer: permanent abolition of nuclear weapons 
for all time,'' said Morland, 56. 
</P>
<P>
	The historical consequences of the Progressive case have been  
modest because it never reached the Supreme Court or challenged the 
boundaries of the Atomic Energy Act, but it did have implications 
for freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a significant victory for the magazine and a  
significant victory for the First Amendment,'' said Brady 
Williamson, a lawyer for The Progressive. ``Practically speaking, 
the government cannot prevent journalists from writing articles 
based on essentially accurate information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publication didn't have any apparent impact on nuclear  
proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It surely hasn't led to anyone reading his article and buying  
a book and then designing a hydrogen bomb. So it didn't do what 
people feared, giving someone who wanted to build a bomb the 
blueprint on how to do it,'' said Paul Leventhal, president of the 
Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit organization based in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Leventhal adds: ``A nuclear bomb is within the reach of  
a determined group or an outlaw state who wants to get a hold of 
this material, and I think Howard (Morland) helped to draw 
attention to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is there anything today Morland would balk at publishing?  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that pops in my mind is if I knew how to combine the  
lethality of the AIDS virus with the transmissibility of the common 
cold,'' he said, ``I would not tell anybody that.''

<HEADLINE> Botha Wins 800m at World Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- When Johan Botha woke up sick, he knew he  
was ready to win -- and he did, over world record holder Wilson 
Kipketer in an upset at the World Indoor Track Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I woke up this morning I felt sick to my stomach and  
stiff all over, all the signs of nervousness,'' Botha said. ``But 
it's never good to feel too good before a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, feeling as bad as he did, ``I knew I was going to do  
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The South African won the men's 800 meters in 1 minute, 45.47  
seconds, just edging out Kipketer, whose time was 1:45.49. Nico 
Motchebon, of Germany, took the bronze in 1:45.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 800 offered an even bigger surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	Mozambique's Maria Mutola, a three-time indoor champion, lost  
her first race inside since 1992. She was second to Ludmila 
Formanova of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	And she was so shocked she got sick, too. She was examined by  
doctors after the race, but quickly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a world championships race. Anything can happen,'' she  
said later. ``It's one of those things. You never know who's going 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formanova's time was 1:56.90, a championships' record and the  
second-fastest indoors ever. Mutola finished in 1:57.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both of the winners were underdogs, they have been having  
exceptionally good races lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's gold caps a sensational year for Botha, who has won all  
seven of his races. He also defeated Kipketer, who is coming off a 
six-month break, in the semifinal of the championships as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been winning all my races this year, so maybe I should  
have been the favorite,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``this is my first indoor season, and to come  
through and win the world championship is a dream come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, who set the indoor world record of 1:42.67 last March,  
said he did his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied,'' he said. ``I gained something from it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Formanova, the European indoor champion, had also been unbeaten  
this winter, and going into the championships had the 
second-fastest time of the year, 1:58.78, after Mutola's 1:57.06. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before going to sleep last night I thought about whether  
Mutola could be beaten,'' she said. ``But I told myself, she's only 
human, just like me.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Mull Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebel commanders met  
Sunday to consider the peace plan for Kosovo, but -- contrary to 
Clinton Administration declarations -- it appeared the deal would 
not be signed before later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	As promised, leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army gathered in  
the hills of the Drenica region, the nerve center of the rebel 
movement, to vote on a plan for broad autonomy but not the 
independence they have fought for in a year of bitter ethnic war. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of William Walker, the U.S. chief of  
international monitors in Kosovo, attended the rebel meeting held 
at an undisclosed location, said an American source, who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said rebels were expected to approve the deal, and  
that they and ethnic Albanian politicians would likely sign around 
March 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bob Dole, who visited the region at President  
Clinton's request, declared in London on Saturday that the ethnic 
Albanians ``promised'' to sign the deal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole and U.S. diplomats have heightened pressure on the ethnic  
Albanians to sign quickly as a first step toward ending a year of 
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels that has 
killed 2,000 people and driven 300,000 from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one in Kosovo, a poor  
southern province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A signature by the Kosovo Albanians would step up pressure on  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the plan. Their 
signature also would be a belated success for U.S. diplomats after 
they failed to gain the Albanians' full cooperation last month at 
talks in Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian negotiating team in Rambouillet, which  
included politicians and rebels, said it would sign the agreement 
when they met again with diplomats in France on March 15. They said 
they needed to consult the people of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, politicians have said they would sign if the rebels  
are on board. But rebels have long been wary of the deal, because 
it requires them to disarm and falls short of full independence. 
Another sticking point: Albanians want a referendum on independence 
after three years, but Western powers oppose that. 
</P>
<P>
	Top KLA leader Hashim Thaci spoke favorably Sunday of the peace  
plan. ``The agreement process has taken a very positive 
direction,'' he said in Tirana, capital of neighboring Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	But he reiterated that the KLA should remain a defensive force,  
instead of becoming a political party with some of its members 
installed as police, as Western diplomats propose. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials who requested anonymity said Sunday it was  
unrealistic to pin the ethnic Albanians factions down to a specific 
moment when they would sign the deal. Both sides -- politicians and 
rebels -- have a copy of the 82-page peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs have agreed to give Kosovo self-rule but oppose the U.S.  
plan because it calls for 28,000 NATO peacekeepers, including 4,000 
U.S. soldiers, to police the deal on Yugoslav territory. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has nonetheless deployed about 8,000 troops in neighboring  
Macedonia for a peace mission and to underscore NATO threats to 
launch airstrikes if Milosevic does not sign the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an October cease-fire agreement, Milosevic agreed to keep  
Serb police and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo largely confined to 
barracks. But officials of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the cease-fire, said 
this week that Milosevic has five times the acceptable number of 
troops patrolling the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo rebels also have violated the cease-fire by attacking  
Serb police and killing and kidnapping Serb civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	In an example of rising tensions, an ethnic Albanian civilian  
shot and killed two Serb policemen Sunday in a Pristina suburb who 
were seeking his son on robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb police forces responded by searching houses for the father  
and son and beating the occupants. An OSCE official said 15 ethnic 
Albanian civilians suffered heavy bruises and broken bones.

<HEADLINE> Half of Carjackings Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over half the nation's annual average of  
nearly 49,000 carjacking attempts are successful, and almost 
two-thirds of the incidents occur within five miles of the owner's 
home, the Justice Department reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting on data for 1992 through 1996, the most recent  
available, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said that each year an 
average of 48,787 carjackings are tried, and 24,520, or 50.3 
percent, succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims were injured in 23 percent of the completed carjackings  
but in only 10 percent of the unsuccessful ones. A weapon was used 
in 83 percent of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said 84 percent of victims were not injured, but 4  
percent suffered serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, 
broken bones, internal injuries or loss of consciousness. The 
remainder had minor injuries like bruises or chipped teeth. Some 
incidents had more than one victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau defined carjacking as a theft in which a vehicle was  
taken or attempted to be taken by force or threat of it. It counted 
only carjackings by strangers, not by acquaintances or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau's survey had no data on murders during carjackings  
because the figures are estimates based on interviews during 
1992-1996 with 430,000 U.S. residents over age 12. Only survivors 
could be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Using FBI data based on police reports, the bureau said  
strangers committed an average of 27 murders involving automobile 
theft each year during 1992-1996. ``These may have been 
carjackings,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 22 percent of carjackings occurred at or near the victim's  
home, but 65 percent were within five miles or less. The bureau 
offered no explanation, but law-enforcement and automobile club 
officials privately suggested that most cars spend most of their 
time within five miles of the owner's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the incidents occurred in open areas, such as  
on the street or near a bus, subway or train station or airport. 
Also, 20 percent were in parking lots or near stores, restaurants, 
gas stations and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Carjackings were more successful in daylight hours, two of three  
times. At night, less than half the attempts succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	A firearm was used in 70 percent of the successful incidents, 20  
percent of the unsuccessful ones. 
</P>
<P>
	No resistance was offered by 38 percent of the victims. The  
other 62 percent took some kind of action to defend themselves or 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed 19 percent of victims attacked, chased or  
tried to catch the offender or threatened use of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four percent of victims used nonconfrontational defenses  
like running away, calling for help or trying to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder used unspecified defenses.  
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said the data were not sufficient to analyze the  
impact of various self-defenses on either the rate of victim injury 
or the success rate of the carjacking attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau found that all the completed carjackings were  
reported to the police, but authorities were told about just 57 
percent of the attempted carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the bureau's second study of carjacking. A study five  
years ago found a somewhat lower annual average number of 
carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those totals, however, cannot be compared with the current  
figures because, in the interim, the questions used in the 
interviews were altered to probe the carjacking issue more fully, 
bureau spokesman Stu Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Industry Under Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The sweepstakes ``performance review'' sent to  
Mr. R. Miller is marked ``personal &AMP; confidential'' and includes 
details on a $1 million drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	The material rates how well Miller did such things as filling  
out Publishers Clearing House entry forms and mailing them on time 
and how he can upgrade his status with the company by making 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators says people are being duped by such personal  
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting you to buy because they make you believe that  
out of the millions and millions and millions of people who have 
sent in responses, that you have personally come to their 
attention,'' said Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle's state is one of several suing sweepstakes houses over  
their mailings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miller's case, he earned ``exceptional'' ratings in every  
category but one: ``Often takes advantage of our Unbeatable 
Deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Commendable'' was his grade there. An attached note tells  
Miller he qualifies for an upcoming $1 million drawing, and can 
upgrade his status with the company by ordering ``by the 
deadline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweepstakes industry is under new scrutiny on several  
fronts, including Senate legislation that would affect companies 
such as Publishers Clearing House and American Family Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill sponsored by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would set fines  
up to $2 million for deceptive sales tactics and provide the first 
federal regulation targeting the sweepstakes industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee plans hearings next week.  
</P>
<P>
	State regulators also are complaining sweepstakes companies  
target the elderly. Several states have sued the biggest 
sweepstakes houses, alleging a variety of deceptive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general from about half the country met in  
Indianapolis last month to look at mailings that seem to promise a 
far greater chance of winning if the consumer buys something. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, no purchase is necessary to enter or win a  
sweepstakes, and industry representatives note there are 
disclaimers with the You May Already be a Winner promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to give credit to the American people,'' said Bob  
Wientzen, president and CEO of the Direct Marketing Association, an 
industry group. ``They do know these sweepstakes use copy that 
might suggest they might be a winner in a very strong way, but they 
recognize that's just part of the sweepstakes offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes companies keep using high-test language in their  
mailings because it works, Wientzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They respond at higher levels when this sort of dream copy is  
written. Sweepstakes is very much about fantasy and dreaming you 
could win, and I think people enjoy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry estimates 70 percent of households toss the  
mailings without entering a contest or buying any magazine 
subscriptions or other merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who do return the envelope, about 75 percent decline to  
buy anything, said Christopher L. Irving, director of consumer 
affairs for Publishers Clearing House. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who do buy are targeted for additional mailings and  
additional offers, with what Wisconsin's Doyle calls the clear 
implication that more purchases means a better chance at winning a 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's suit singles out Publishers Clearing House, and  
Doyle points to a letter signed by Dorothy Addeo, the firm's 
contest manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``My boss dropped into my office the other day, sat down and  
sighed. What's the story with Norman G. Ziolkowski?'' the letter 
says, noting the name appears on the President's Club Member List, 
among other places, but not on the Winners List. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my mission, Norman G. Ziolkowski. To make you a winner --  
and soon,'' the letter continues. Ziolkowski is guaranteed to win 
something if he responds to a forthcoming mailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have alleged that the boss of the company never walked into  
Dorothy Addeo's office and sighed and mentioned this person by 
name,'' Doyle said. ``It's certainly a false and misleading 
statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irving called the letter a ``dramatization'' of real  
conversations at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that a frequent buyer gets more opportunities is not  
unusual. It's direct marketing, and there's certainly nothing wrong 
with that.''

<HEADLINE> Church Addresses Gay Elder Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A gay elder's election to the governing  
board of a Presbyterian church has been upheld by an ecclesiastical 
court, which rejected a challenge by members who said the man's 
homosexuality violates church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Osborne was welcomed with hugs and handshakes as he made  
his way down the center aisle of the First Presbyterian Church of 
Stamford just before the start of services Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a decision released Saturday, rejected a challenge  
by two church members who said Osborne's election violates a recent 
amendment to the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church that bans 
practicing homosexuals from holding church office. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne said he was gratified by the decision, but still  
concerned about other gay church members who may also face 
resistance because of the new amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still people under the weight of this,'' he said.  
``I think many gays and lesbians will find hope from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy at the church erupted last May after the 800-family  
congregation elected Osborne, 38, to serve on the governing board, 
known as a session. 
</P>
<P>
	He had previously been ordained as an elder and served on a  
session, but since then had begun to live openly as a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of the church filed a complaint. They said Osborne's  
lifestyle violated church doctrine and therefore prevented his 
installation on the session. 
</P>
<P>
	William Prey, a church adviser to the two complainants, said  
they are considering an appeal.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Hire Fisk To Assist GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Carlton Fisk showed that time does heal  
bad feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk, who left Boston with bitterness after the 1980 season, was  
hired Sunday as a special assistant to Red Sox general manager Dan 
Duquette. He is expected to work with the club's minor league 
catchers and make appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a long time ago that that happened,'' Fisk said.  
``The people that caused that situation are not here anymore. For 
me it's a fresh start, a new start. There are no parts of the prior 
regimes behind the doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk, the 1972 AL Rookie of the Year, is best remembered for his  
extra-inning homer off the left-field foul pole that won Game 6 of 
the 1975 World Series. The Reds came back to win the final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire Red Sox family is extremely pleased that Carlton is  
rejoining the organization,'' Duquette said. ``This is something 
that we've been working on for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk left the team, then-partly owned by Haywood Sullivan, after  
Boston failed to mail him a contract by the Dec. 20 deadline in 
1980, allowing him to become a free agent. He spent his final 13 
seasons with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I ever envisioned being back with this  
organization,'' Fisk said. ``I did envision being back in the game 
in some respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk hasn't said which hat he would wear if he is elected to the  
Hall of Fame. He fell 43 votes short this year, his first season of 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll cross that bridge when we get there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky: I Betrayed Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, in an interview with Time  
magazine, says she betrayed President Clinton by telling Linda 
Tripp and other friends about their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only telling 10 people was being pretty discreet for me,'' she  
says in the Time edition appearing on newsstands Monday. ``I 
betrayed the president in that way. I didn't have the foresight to 
see what the possible ramifications of this could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, appearing Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' belittled  
Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of the affair, saying they have ``almost no 
bearing on reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, as in her interview with ABC's Barbara Walters  
aired last week and a new biography by British author Andrew 
Morton, tells Time that she ``didn't have the maturity to realize 
exactly how serious'' the fallout of her affair with Clinton would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also said the outcome of the affair could have been  
different had the president been more forthright about his efforts 
to distance himself from her in 1996 and 1997. That's when she was 
reassigned to a Pentagon job and was unable to win back a position 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a desire to please everybody, and he is also an  
ostrich in that he avoids confrontation at all costs.'' She said it 
``would have changed things a lot'' if he had been more honest 
``instead of stringing me along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky again denies that Clinton tried to buy her silence  
or otherwise obstruct justice, a charge that led to his 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she didn't discuss with Clinton the writing of an  
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit in which she 
denied having had a sexual relationship with him. She also denies 
in Time that Clinton and his friend Vernon Jordan helped her job 
search in exchange for her silence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Tripp, who exposed the affair by giving Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr tapes of her phone conversations with Ms. 
Lewinsky, said Ms. Lewinsky made clear in untaped conversations 
that there was a deal in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was instructed by both the president and Vernon Jordan  
that she had no choice but to use the, quote, story, the cover 
story,'' Mrs. Tripp maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Lewinsky interview and the highly publicized book  
about her were ``Monica's self-justification of events in which she 
was complicit in bringing about.'' Asked about the book, she said, 
``I see it as fiction. I see it as fable, fantasy, farce and fairy 
tale. I see almost no bearing on reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who was present when Starr's staff and FBI officials  
first questioned Ms. Lewinsky about the affair in a Washington 
hotel, said Ms. Lewinsky's assertions that she was mistreated and 
denied access to a lawyer were ``completely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also scoffed at Ms. Lewinsky's statements that she was  
mortified by the prominence given the blue dress stained in one of 
her encounters with Clinton. ``This was a badge of honor for 
Monica,'' Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, asked about the Lewinsky  
interview on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said, ``All I know is that what I 
saw and heard last week sort of reconfirmed in my mind that I cast 
the right vote in the Senate.'' Lott, R-Miss., voted to convict 
Clinton on both articles of impeachment, but the president 
acquitted on both charges of perjury and the obstruction of justice 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	As to future action against the president for his alleged  
misconduct, Lott said: ``I think it's in the hands of the American 
people or, you know, what his conscience might dictate, which is 
apparently not much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, in her Time interview, spoke of the way Clinton  
``looks at women he's attracted to. He undresses you with his 
eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that at her first book-signing event, ``I felt  
cuckoo. ... This whole situation is sort of maniacal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that in the future she might consider law school, ``if  
I could get into law school without having to take the LSAT,'' the 
aptitude test for prospective law students. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was not trying to get rich with her book deal and  
other paid appearances. ``But I need to have the means to take care 
of myself for the next few years,'' she said. ``Therapy is not 
cheap.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Gets Familiar NCAA Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When this year's sites for the NCAA tournament  
were set, Duke took a look and zeroed in on the East Regionals at 
the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils used that same arena as a springboard to the  
Final Four four times -- 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990 -- so their 
fondness for the site is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	To make a return trip likely, Duke needed to earn the No. 1 seed  
in the East and was rewarded for a dominating 32-1 season and the 
ACC tournament championship with that spot on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	C.M. Newton, chairman of the selection committee, said when the  
field was evaluated, it was clear the Blue Devils should get their 
wish. ``Duke came out clearly as the top team in the country,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Blue Devils draw No. 16 seed Florida A&AMP;M at Charlotte,  
N.C., in the first round and then get the winner of the game 
between No. 8 College of Charleston and No. 9 Tulsa in order to 
advance to the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick for the rest of the field was to avoid the Blue Devils  
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody that was watching the board go up there was hoping  
they weren't going to be in the East,'' said Syracuse coach Jim 
Boeheim, who escaped to the South bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Somebody had to stay in the region, though, and the selection  
committee came up with an interesting solution, slipping Cincinnati 
-- the only team to beat Duke all season -- in the same region. The 
Bearcats are a No. 3 seed and open against No. 14 George Mason at 
Boston in the other half of the East bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (26-5) has been an early round casualty the last two  
years and is not anxious to look ahead. Still, the Bearcats 
wouldn't mind another chance at the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys started smiling a little bit around the room when we  
saw that potential match,'' said Melvin Levett, whose dunk beat 
Duke in the closing seconds of their game in the Great Alaska 
Shootout on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course you want to go out and prove to everybody that the  
first time was for real. If the day ever came that we do meet, 
we'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Bearcats worry about Duke, they might want to think  
about potential second-round opponent Temple, a sixth seed in the 
East, which opens against No. 11 Kent at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Owls play a matchup zone, a defense Cincinnati has struggled  
with in the past. The last time the teams met two years ago, Temple 
beat Cincinnati by 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Squeezed between Duke and Cincinnati is Miami, seeded No. 2 in  
the East after losing in the Big East tournament semifinals to St. 
John's. The Hurricanes face No. 15 Lafayette at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the Boston schedule is No. 7 Texas against No. 10  
Purdue, a team that limps into the tournament with some late-season 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd like all these teams on the uptake,'' Newton said.  
``Purdue is 19-12 against a good schedule with some good wins on 
the road. Losing five of their last six disadvantages them late in 
the year. That was a major part of the conversation, comparing them 
to other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining East matchups at Charlotte have fifth-seeded  
Wisconsin against No. 12 Southwest Missouri State and No. 4 
Tennessee against No. 13 Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one wrinkle in Duke's Meadowlands strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	Each time the Blue Devils went from that regional to the Final  
Four, they lost -- twice in the national semifinals, twice in the 
finals. When they won consecutive championships in 1991 and 1992, 
the came from regionals in Pontiac, Mich., and Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Japan Steelmakers Criticize Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a building as long as three soccer fields, a  
thick slab of steel slides out of a blazing furnace, orange with 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparks fly and chunks of nearly molten metal drop to the floor  
as it rattles along a conveyer toward the first of six machines 
that will squeeze the hot steel between giant rollers, gradually 
flattening it into a sheet less than an inch thick and 180 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Kimitsu Steel Works, one of Japan's biggest  
producers of hot-rolled steel. The United States used to be its 
largest foreign market, but that was before steel became the 
subject of the latest trade fight between Tokyo and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, none of the half dozen freighters snugged to Kimitsu's  
docks is bound for North America. Sales to the Americans have 
nearly dried up with the U.S. government considering imposition of 
penalty duties on Japanese steel for allegedly being ``dumped'' at 
below-manufacturing cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very worried,'' said Noritoshi Kimura, a senior manager  
at Kimitsu Works. ``The suit comes just as the economy is turning 
bad and demand is shrinking. The timing was terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no sign of recovery from a recession at home, and most of  
Japan's neighbors struggling with their own economic crises, demand 
for steel is severely depressed throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has never been a major destination for Japanese exports.  
The U.S. market has been, and producers in Japan say they are being 
unfairly shut out. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that Japanese steel exports have hurt the U.S. market  
is completely wrong. It's unreasonable. Japan has been made a 
scapegoat,'' said Hiroki Sasaki, a member of the board of directors 
for the world's second-largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry filed a dumping complaint against  
Japanese competitors after their U.S. sales surged last year to 2 1/2 
times the 1997 level. The dramatic rise, along with a jump in 
imports from South Korea, Brazil and Russia, was blamed for 
thousands of U.S. layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Commerce Department said last month that Japanese  
producers were dumping hot-rolled steel at up to 68 percent below 
the fair value, and it threatened to impose punitive duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel never sold its products below cost, Sasaki  
contends. He says the company has been unable to defend itself 
against the charges because the Commerce Department won't say how 
it calculated its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese industry executives argue that the drop in U.S. steel  
prices in 1998 was caused by market factors: a surge in demand for 
steel early in the year as the U.S. economy grew more robust, 
followed by a sudden collapse when General Motors plants went on 
strike. GM is the U.S. steel industry's largest customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paralyzed by the prospect of stiff dumping duties, Japanese  
shipments of rolled steel to the United States plunged 99.7 percent 
in January from a year earlier to just 294 tons, Japan's Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry said last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline is already hurting.  
</P>
<P>
	Kawasaki Steel Corp., one of the top five Japanese producers,  
increased the estimate of its expected loss for the fiscal year 
that ends March 31 by a third to $820 million. It blamed the trade 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Japan's steelmakers predict they will have to cut  
output by about 10 percent this year, a huge blow to an industry 
that was already struggling with underused plants and too many 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Japanese steel market remains at this level, then some  
kind of drastic reorganization can be expected,'' said Seiji 
Yamada, a steel analyst for the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry already had been cutting back for more than a  
decade. More than 3,200 jobs have been lost at the Kimitsu mill 
since 1986, reducing its workforce to 3,800. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts have come from retirements and transfers of employees  
to affiliated firms, so Kimitsu and other big steel plants have 
avoided mass firings so far. 
</P>
<P>
	But senior manager Kimura, a 30-year veteran of the steel  
industry, is worried about the impact of the company's long hiring 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hiring so few new people, what is going to happen  
if demand grows stronger 10 years from now?'' he said. ``There 
won't be enough experienced managers to run the company.''

<HEADLINE> Futuristic Olympic Torch Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The curve of a boomerang and the peaks  
of the Sydney Opera House have been combined to create the 2000 
Games' futuristic blue, silver and white Olympic Torch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's unveiling of the torch provoked complaints from  
many news organizations over why Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd. 
newspapers got advance photos and publicity on the new design to 
display in Monday morning editions. 
</P>
<P>
	New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the  
presentation of the new torch was not a news event, and therefore 
could be offered as an exclusive to News Ltd., a major games 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway agreed with Knight, saying  
the torch announcement was not news. 
</P>
<P>
	The torch will be carried by 10,000 Australians on a 100-day,  
16,800-mile journey throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Passing through almost 1,000 towns and communities, the torch  
will travel within an hour's drive of 85 percent of Australia's 
population, to complete its journey at Stadium Australia on Sept. 
15, when it will light the Sydney 2000 flame. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh torch will be used for each of the 10,000 relay legs,  
and bearers will be able to buy the torch they carry for 300 
Australian dollars ($185 U.S.), the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing 2.2 pounds and made of stainless steel, anodized  
aluminum and textured aluminum, each layer of the 28-inch high 
torch represents fire, water and earth.

<HEADLINE> Statue Prompts Bus Route Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELTON, Conn. (AP) -- A school bus route was changed for art's  
sake -- because one little girl could see more than she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus passed right by a 15-foot replica of Michelangelo's nude  
statue ``David'' standing in a private office park. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark DelVecchio said Sunday his 10-year-old daughter told him  
last week that she was offended by the statue, so he called her 
school and asked officials to change the bus route. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think I'm ridiculous, but you've got to  
remember how tall a school bus is,'' said the father of three 
daughters. ``The view you actually get from the bus window is from 
the navel down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus now passes out of sight of the statue, installed by the  
developer of the office complex. 
</P>
<P>
	DelVecchio said he has been unfairly accused of depriving  
children from art. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the guy brought it. I'll probably never make it to  
Italy to see it,'' DelVecchio said. ``But you have to look at it 
through my daughter's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were looking at the guy's face, it would've been a  
different story.''

	``I'm not very ambitious about films,'' the pop star says in

It's a paradox in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Met Opera Presents 'Khovanshchina' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                  *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Metropolitan Opera audience, basically  
attuned to Verdi, is not in sync with Mussorgsky's sprawling, 
doom-ridden ``Khovanshchina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audience on Friday night was sparse and became increasingly  
so during the opera -- more than four hours long. 
</P>
<P>
	Conductor Valery Gergiev brought out to the fullest the beauty  
of the very melodic music and got the evening's largest applause. 
Dolora Zajick was fine as Marfa, who links all the opera's 
elements, and Roberto Scandiuzzi was excellent in the largest male 
role, Dosifei, leader of the Old Believers. Most of the other 
singers in the large cast had vocal wobbles. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem with the opera, which is set in the late 17th  
century in Moscow, is that it is episodic, which makes it hard to 
follow. In one scene, three men sit and talk politics a long time, 
which is tedious to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussorgsky, who wrote his own libretto, depicts in order in the  
first three scenes three factions opposing Peter the Great, who was 
a child at the time. In the first scene, Paata Burchuladze, 
imposing and theatrical but with a distracting vocal wobble, 
portrays Prince Ivan Khovansky, leader of the militia, who wants a 
revolt to put his son Andrei on the throne. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei wants to carry off Emma, a young German girl. Emily  
Pulley's protests ring high and clear. Unfortunately for the 
audience, Emma doesn't appear again. Andrei's fiancee, Marfa 
(Zajick), steps in to say how hurt she feels. 
</P>
<P>
	The second scene has Marfa as a fortuneteller, visiting Prince  
Golitsin (Vladimir Bogachov), foretelling his exile. He's an 
adviser to Sophia, Peter the Great's older sister, and represents 
her. Neither Sophia nor Peter could be depicted on stage in 
Mussorgsky's time. 
</P>
<P>
	The third scene concerns the Old Believers, with Marfa, a member  
of that religion, continuing to lament her love for Andrei. 
</P>
<P>
	Crashing chords of doom punctuate the opera. The last scenes  
depict disasters to Peter's opponents. Khovansky is shot. Golitsin, 
in a cart, rolls to exile. The Old Believers set their hermitage on 
fire and die singing at the final curtain. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a lot of glorious singing for a large chorus, almost no  
duet or small ensemble singing. Instead of a romantic couple there 
is Marfa's one-sided love. She tells Andrei she'll hide him after 
his father is shot. She takes him to die with her. He's still 
singing about Emma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Khovanshchina'' (Khovansky intrigue), last heard at the Met in  
1988, is being performed six times this season, including a March 
13 matinee live radio broadcast. Mussorgsky started composing it 
soon after he finished ``Boris Godunov.'' He died in 1881 before 
orchestrating it. Rimsky-Korsakov orchestrated it in 1883 and 
Shostakovich, whose orchestrations are used by the Met, did it in 
1958.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Boiling Cat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERNON, N.J. (AP) -- A man faces animal cruelty charges after  
police found a cat boiling on his stove. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Whritenour, 36, was admitted to Greystone Park  
Psychiatric Hospital in Parsippany for evaluation on Saturday after 
police made the gruesome discovery at his home Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was his cat Gizmo,'' Township Patrolman Sean Talt  
said. ``He mentioned to us he'd eaten cat at least a half-dozen 
times before, and dog once.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Wins Award From Guild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg won the Directors Guild of  
America's award on Saturday night for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
making him and the epic World War II film strong favorites for 
Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	In voting by the union for filmmakers, Spielberg defeated  
Roberto Benigni of ``Life is Beautiful,'' John Madden of 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Terrence Malick of ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
and Peter Weir of ``The Truman Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so happy. I'm like so -- '' Spielberg said, interrupting  
himself as he dropped the plaque onto the podium with a clunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Back stage, Spielberg joked, ``I can't believe I dropped it.''  
</P>
<P>
	He dedicated the award to his father, Arnold Spielberg, and his  
father's World War II generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg noted that all five directors were nominated for both  
DGA awards and Academy Awards, and three for making films about the 
World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are finding ways of embracing history,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which follows a squad of soldiers sent  
to find a private whose brothers were killed in the war, was 
nominated for 11 Academy Awards, second only to ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' with 13. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning a DGA award, Spielberg stands a strong chance of  
getting a director's award at the Oscars on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four times has the DGA winner not repeated at the Academy  
Awards. The winner of the directing Oscar also usually sees his 
film take a best picture award. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg has won three DGA awards, also getting honors for  
``The Color Purple,'' (1985) and ``Schindler's List,'' (1993). 
``Schindler's List'' went on to win seven Academy Awards, including 
best picture and best director.

<HEADLINE> Intel Now the Target of Antitrust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a five-month Microsoft marathon, it is  
now Intel inside the antitrust courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The microchip giant will take center stage Tuesday in an  
administrative law hearing at the Federal Trade Commission, 
contesting government charges it illegally used bullying tactics to 
quell competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intel case is not likely to have the entertainment value of  
that OTHER antitrust case, now on a month's recess at U.S. District 
Court down the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Microsoft antitrust trial, there probably will not be  
any smoking gun e-mails. Nor will there be bitter disputes over 
what happened: Intel acknowledges it did most of what the FTC 
alleges; the company just claims it acted legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lower profile, the Intel case carries high stakes  
that ultimately could affect prices, quality and innovation in 
computers millions of people now use. 
</P>
<P>
	The central issue in the government's complaint is whether Intel  
Corp., holds a monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the 
``brains'' of computers. The FTC says yes, because Intel microchips 
run about 80 percent of the world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators must prove to the administrative judge  
hearing the case that Intel used monopoly power to shut out its 
competition, hurting consumers in the process. The government also 
must show how such actions curbed innovation and barred other 
companies' potential entry into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel scoffs at the notion that it has ``chilled'' innovation.  
Indeed, the case opens as the company faces unprecedented 
competition from rival chipmakers, specifically Advanced Micro 
Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of funny because the FTC has chosen to bring this  
case at probably the one time in the last 15 years where Intel 
really was having problems in the market,'' said Daniel Wall, an 
antitrust attorney in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough argument (for Intel) to say they don't have  
monopoly power, but they're better positioned to make that argument 
now than they have ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its complaint, the government claims Intel illegally used its  
industry influence to withhold key technical information about 
future microchips from three companies: Digital Equipment Corp., 
Intergraph Corp., and Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The information was necessary for the businesses to develop  
computer systems based on future Intel chips. The FTC claims Intel 
withheld the data to punish the companies for refusing to license 
key patents to Intel without charge. The patents are for 
microprocessors and related technologies made by the three 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital, which makes hardware and software, and Compaq, the  
world's largest computer maker, ultimately gave in to Intel. 
Intergraph, which makes specialized computers for engineers, sued 
and eventually got a preliminary injunction requiring Intel to turn 
over the information. Intel is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, in court documents, calls Intel's actions ``a raw  
exercise of monopoly power to muscle competitors into signing over 
intellectual property rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which reported $26.2 billion in sales last year,  
acknowledges it denied the technical data, but argues it legally 
can decide which secrets to disclose to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent industry report showed consumers bought more low-end  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time in that area. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel claims AMD's performance in the marketplace ``flies in the  
face'' of the government's theory. Two years ago, none of the top 
computer makers used AMD processors, it notes; today nine of the 
top 10 do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence shows that competition has intensified greatly  
since the time of that conduct,'' the company said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the FTC's economic expert, Harvard University professor  
Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in the 
computer industry has suffered, the company points out. 
</P>
<P>
	Scherer describes Intel's behavior as ``unfair'' but agrees that  
its actions have not directly affected chip prices, a factor in 
determining monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's antitrust case against Intel was filed shortly after  
the Justice Department and 19 states sued Microsoft, the software 
giant accused of abusing its monopoly power. The two federal 
agencies have overlapping authority on antitrust and typically 
divide cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Intel case, the FTC seeks a far more limited remedy, if  
it wins, than the ones contemplated for Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency wants an administrative order requiring Intel to stop  
withholding technical information from customers who develop rival 
technologies. Either side can appeal the administrative judge's 
ruling to the full FTC. If Intel loses there, it can go to a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, a prominent technology industry group has  
suggested splitting Microsoft into separate companies selling 
different products, if a federal judges rules against the company.

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Play in Cuba March 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major league baseball is returning to Cuba for the first time in  
40 years, completing a deal Sunday in which the Baltimore Orioles 
will play the Cuban national team on March 28 in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this produces the kind of human results that we're all  
hoping it does, this could be something really big,'' baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig said. ``I'm very proud of the role we will 
play in doing something constructive -- that transcends baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team will play a return exhibition game at Camden  
Yards. The second game will be played either just before Baltimore 
starts the regular season April 5 or on an off day during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do come,'' Stanley Hynds, a 25-year-old  
barber, shouted amid the clanging steel drums, trumpet blares and 
impassioned screams during a playoff game in Latinoamericano 
Stadium in Havana on Sunday. ``It will be a pleasure for us to see 
them and to see them lose right here in this stadium!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came after two months of negotiations among the  
State Department, Cuban government, commissioner's office, the 
Orioles and the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The games were planned after the Clinton administration decided  
in January to ease the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but  
the last were the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, who 
played exhibition games there in March 1959, about 2 1/2 months after 
Fidel Castro's revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who plans to attend the game in Havana, said that if the  
game is successful, the major leagues might schedule additional 
events in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other clubs that want to do this, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubans have defected in recent years and play for major  
league teams, notably Florida pitcher Livan Hernandez, the 1997 
World Series MVP; his half-brother Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, 
who starred for the New York Yankees in last year's postseason; and 
Tampa Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good players,'' Orioles outfielder B.J. Surhoff  
said. ``If you look around the majors, there are a number of very 
good players with Cuban backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, Cuba's president and a former baseball player himself,  
has referred to defectors as ``traitors,'' and Cuban officials have 
accused U.S. teams of trying to bribe Cuban players into abandoning 
their country. U.S. agents have helped Cuban players defect when 
they were on tour outside their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the announcement, news of the game had still  
not reached baseball-crazy Cubans in the capital of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great! Finally we can test the strength of our  
players,'' said Jose Angel Montes, a 25-year-old computer 
technician, when informed of the agreement. ``We have a lot of 
players who are a lot better than Duque Hernandez.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While salaries in Cuba average $10 a month, Livan Hernandez got  
a four-year contract from the Marlins worth $4,495,000, and Orlando 
got a $6.6 million, four-year deal from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban refugees and several congressmen have criticized baseball  
and the Orioles for dealing with Castro and oppose the games. About 
70 people protested Sunday at the Orioles' exhibition game against 
the Florida Marlins in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing Castro's government. ``It's like taking part in 
the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he understands ``people have all kinds of different  
human and political views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sensitive to that. I understand the feelings,'' he  
said in Tampa, Fla. ``We'll take care of the baseball politics and 
let the governments take care of the other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the two games -- a sticking point in the  
negotiations -- will be used mainly to support baseball and other 
sports activities in the two countries, major league baseball said. 
The Clinton administration did not want profits to go to Castro's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it's only an exhibition game, Orioles' players won't put  
too much emphasis on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got things I need to get done on the field,'' first  
baseman Will Clark said. ``If I'm one of the guys who has to go 
down there, I'm going to treat it just like another ball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, two American League umpires and two Cuban  
umpires will work the game, and the Cuban team agreed to use wood 
bats instead of the metal bats it usually hits with, according a 
source familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles and the commissioner's office will pay for the  
improvements at Latinamericanos Stadium, such as padding the 
outfield fence, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation from major league baseball, the players'  
association and the Orioles probably will go to Havana this week to 
work out logistics and attempt to settle when the game in Baltimore 
will be played.

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 60m at World Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- With one false start after another  
marring his earlier heats, Maurice Greene knew he had to keep calm 
to win the 60 meters Sunday at the World Indoor Track 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene proved he could do just that, winning the gold with a  
time of 6.42 seconds. His own world record is 6.39. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to win and I won,'' he said, adding that he never  
promised to set a new world record. ``I have to be satisfied with 
the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, who beat Greene at the USA Championships a week ago,  
won the silver, improving his best time by .01 of a second to 6.43. 
Jason Gardener of Great Britain placed third at 6.46. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 60 meters, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece beat  
American Gail Devers by .06 seconds to win the gold at 6.96. 
Devers, bothered by a hamstring injury throughout the races, 
clocked in at 7.02 seconds, slower than her indoor season best of 
6.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said the false starts were not his fault but were caused  
by an unusually sensitive system at the three-day event that would 
register the slightest flinch or movement as a false start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to change for the system and just do the  
best job that I could,'' Greene said. ``I stayed focused and I ran 
a very technical good race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His coach, John Smith, said that the false starts, in the end,  
did not hurt Greene's running. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted to him to do was get it out of his head and make  
him get back to the point where he can compete,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greene wasn't about to blame the false starts for not  
breaking the world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always possible to break the world record,'' he said.  
``But you know you have to run a technical race. I just didn't 
produce a world record race today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harden said he was extremely pleased with his race.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good race,'' he said. ``You're racing against the  
world-record holder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene acknowledged Harden was ``improving each week.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything can happen in 60 meters,'' he said. ``You lose some  
and you win some. It's the life of being a sprinter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devers' leg was so sore she sat on the floor during her news  
conference after the race, But the two-time indoor 60-meters 
champion appeared in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to finish the race no worse than I started,'' said  
Devers, also a two-time world indoor champion and two-time Olympic 
gold medalist at 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She ran a great race,'' Devers said of Thanou.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanou said she was thrilled to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy for everyone in my country. And I hope with  
this medal, they'll all be happy, too,'' she said.

turned to politics and was elected mayor of Managua in 1990. He was 
once jailed for opposing the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, 
whose family ruled Nicaragua for 42 years, but also opposed the 
leftist Sandinistas who overthrew Somoza in 1979. He is the second

<HEADLINE> Hope, Fear After Brazil's Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) -- The collapse of Brazil's currency  
was a bonanza for Luis Santos, a shoe manufacturer looking to 
expand his production selling abroad. The wholesale price for his 
shoes fell to a competitive $12 a pair, and he now dreams of 
placing his products alongside trendy brands in U.S. and European 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Joao Porto, a public school teacher of history and  
philosophy, the devaluation of the currency, called the real, 
brought on a family crisis. Porto had planned to pay for a bed and 
a clothing closet for his two children with his Christmas bonus -- 
but the bonus never came. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by the new governor of Minas Gerais state on Jan. 6  
to declare a 90-day moratorium on debt payments triggered a chain 
reaction that affected the Christmas bonuses of thousands of state 
employees like Porto. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium alarmed investors, already worried about Brazil's  
$65 billion budget deficit, and intensified the outflow of dollars 
to the tune of at least $1 billion a day, despite annual interest 
rates of about 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the international financial crisis reached Brazil  
last August, more than $40 billion has left the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the government stopped spending billions of dollars  
in currency reserves to prop up the faltering real, in effect 
allowing a devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the real has fallen about 40 percent against the  
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The world that has emerged as a result of the devaluation has  
brought misfortune to some Brazilians while providing others with 
lucrative opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Murilo Araujo, another exporter, is taking advantage of the weak  
real to revive a project he shelved almost five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Araujo's company, which makes meters that measure home energy  
consumption, nearly cracked the American market in 1994, after 
samples priced $20 each were successfully tested in South Carolina, 
Texas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the government launched an anti-inflation program  
called the Real Plan that ended four-digit inflation, stabilized 
prices and kept the currency strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong real made Araujo's goods were more expensive to sell  
overseas. As a result, Araujo lost a significant amount of money in 
order to maintain prices to foreign customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Araujo feels that his company, with 1998 sales of $30  
million, will be competitive in U.S. and European markets besides 
Latin America, where it has a firm presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong real strapped us, but now we got a powerful  
boost,'' Araujo said. ``The outlook is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Araujo worries that the debt moratorium will scare  
investors away from Minas Gerais, Brazil's third-richest state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moratorium has hurt the state's appeal,'' Araujo said.  
``It will take a long time to recover it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Minas Gerais -- a southeastern state the size of  
France -- was an economic success story. From a mainly rural 
economy, it developed over the past 30 years a solid and often 
sophisticated manufacturing industries like Araujo's. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's economy last year was $70 billion, bigger than many  
Latin American countries and third in Brazil after Sao Paulo, the 
nation's industrial mecca, and Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of last year, Minas Gerais owed 18.5 billion reals to  
the federal government, multilateral organizations and Eurobond 
holders. At the time it was compiled, the amount represented $15.4 
billion -- it has not been recalculated since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most businessmen, Araujo sees the Minas Gerais crisis as a  
personal fight between Franco, who was president from 1992 to 1994, 
and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso helped shoot down Franco's presidential bid in 1998. And  
when Franco demanded new terms to repay Minas Gerais' federal debt, 
Cardoso responded by blocking federal funds to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Franco has become, by coincidence or strategy, the voice of  
the opposition,'' said Marcos Coimbra, president of the Vox Populi 
polling institute. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cardoso's popularity plummeting, Franco has offered himself  
as the spokesman for a new economic order. While many Brazilians 
don't take him seriously, polls show Franco has strong support 
among the poor and middle class, 
</P>
<P>
	Fabio Fernandes, a shoe factory worker, says the government  
should be more concerned about health care, housing and education 
than paying creditors. He admires Franco's defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few governors would have the courage he had to declare a  
moratorium,'' Fernandes said.

<HEADLINE> Iditarod Sled Dog Race Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- The dog teams are trained, the gear  
repaired and the trail scouted out. Now it's time for speed and 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday the 56 mushers in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race  
headed into the Alaska wilderness, each with a game plan for being 
the first to reach the finish line in Nome, 1,100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The mushers are competing for a $450,000 purse, of which $54,000  
goes to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner must have fast dogs. That goes without saying, and a  
dozen or more mushers fit that description. 
</P>
<P>
	It's trail savvy and tactics that will separate the elite from  
the also-rans -- when to run the team hard and when to ease up, how 
far to run between rests, how long to rest, and as the race 
progresses, when to make the decisive move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at every champion -- we've all risked something to win  
this thing,'' said Doug Swingley of Lincoln. Mont., who won in 1995 
in a record 9 days, 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's bold venture that year was to push his team halfway  
down the trail, to the gold-mining ghost town of Iditarod, before 
taking his mandatory 24-hour rest stop. The other frontrunners 
followed conventional wisdom and took their long break much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Those mushers kept waiting for Swingley's dogs to run out of gas  
because they ran too hard too soon, but the collapse never 
happened. He ended up with a fresher, better-rested team and won 
the race by a comfortable six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley is not saying whether he'll run as far as Iditarod  
again this year, but that's not his point. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys are beating on the door, but (to win) they have  
to think of something new,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years the Iditarod has seen its share of innovations in  
sleds, harnesses, clothing and dog nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Now catching on is freeze-dried dog food -- blocks of desiccated  
beef, lamb, egg and other ingredients that when mixed with warm 
water creates a high-energy meal. 
</P>
<P>
	At $10 a pound, the food is much more expensive than the frozen  
meat that makes up most of the dogs' diet. But it's lighter, won't 
spoil and can be prepared more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a necessity,'' said DeeDee Jonrowe,  
last year's runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see people a little less dependent on checkpoints,''  
said three-time champion Martin Buser. ``We're going to see more 
camping out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camping out along the trail is a tried-and-true Iditarod head  
game. When front-of-the-pack mushers are in a checkpoint, they can 
keep an eye on each other and be ready to respond to any move. But 
when they camp, they're less visible to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson, a five-time Iditarod winner, said freeze-dried  
food would add a tactical twist on certain parts of the trail, but 
he's not using it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a good, strong, healthy team, the weight of  
carrying fresh meat is not much of an issue,'' said Swenson, who 
last won the race in 1991. ``And I can prepare my fresh-frozen 
product as fast as freeze-dried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mackey, the 1983 Iditarod champion, is carrying  
freeze-dried food and expects to camp out more this year as a way 
to keep away from other mushers. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, he's also playing to his team's experience of  
running long distances without visiting a checkpoint. All of 
Mackey's dogs have done the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International 
race. The Quest has fewer than half as many checkpoints as the 
Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
	``My plan is to try to eliminate a few of the checkpoints,''  
Mackey said. ``I figure that's my only advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iditarod commemorates a dog-sled relay of diphtheria serum  
to Nome during a 1925 epidemic. The race began in 1973 and is run 
along historic trails traveled by gold prospectors.

 *J. Leland Atwood    	
</P>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- J. Leland ``Lee'' Atwood, a key figure  
in the aerospace industry for more than 50 years while president 
and chief executive officer of Rockwell International Corp., died 
Friday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood's work led to the development of the P-51 Mustang  
fighter, one of the main aircraft used in World War II. The fighter 
was developed for Rockwell's predecessor company North American 
Aviation, now part of the Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood was credited with helping the company gain leading roles  
in developing the award-winning F-100 Super Sabre, X-15 rocket 
plane, the B-1 bomber and space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, he began work at North American Aviation, becoming  
chief engineer and vice president. He was elected president in 
1948, gaining the title of CEO in 1960 and then chairman of the 
company two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He received various aviation awards, including a Presidential  
Certificate of Merit in 1948 for his contributions to the war 
effort. In 1995, Italy gave him its Commander of Merit declaration 
for his contributions to the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he was awarded NASA's Public Service Award, the highest  
honor for a non-governmental employee. It recognized his leadership 
efforts with the government-industry team that completed the first 
manned lunar orbit mission, Apollo 8.

 *Leopold Just    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leopold Just, a Latvian-born engineer who built  
a reputation worldwide for constructing highways and New York City 
bridges, died Feb. 25. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Just helped design the George Washington Bridge, linking New  
York and New Jersey, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, connecting 
Staten Island and Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to New York in 1921 and worked for the consulting firm  
Moran &AMP; Proctor before earning a civil engineering degree in 1929 
from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He also held a law 
degree from New York University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, Just joined what was then called the Port of New York  
Authority and helped design the Lincoln Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	He left in 1938 to build tunnels for the Pennsylvania Turnpike  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to New York in 1940 he became a structural engineer  
with the famed Swiss-born engineer, Othmar Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	Just, who became a chief engineer in 1952, had a key part in  
designing the Walt Whitman Bridge in Philadelphia and the Throgs 
Neck Bridge, connecting the Bronx and Queens.

 *Stanley Kubrick    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stanley Kubrick, a visionary craftsman whose films  
-- including ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``2001: 
A Space Odyssey'' -- often reflected a violent and despairing view 
of life, died Sunday. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were summoned Sunday to Kubrick's rural estate in  
Herfordshire, 25 miles northwest of London, and certified his 
death. ``There are no suspicious circumstances,'' police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, the publicity-shy Kubrick was  
preparing for the midyear release of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' his first 
film in 12 years. Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the film 
had been shrouded in the secrecy that attended all of Kubrick's 
later movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a career spanning four decades, Kubrick worked infrequently  
but often brilliantly, and was regarded as a maverick talent -- to 
some, a genius. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanley Kubrick was the grandmaster of filmmaking. He copied  
no one, while all of us were scrambling to imitate him,'' director 
Steven Spielberg said in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick was a fierce perfectionist who wouldn't do one take if  
he could do a hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick chronicled the effects of war in ``Fear and Desire''  
(1953) and ``Paths of Glory'' (1957); the suicidal logic of the 
Cold War in the blackly comic ``Dr. Strangelove: or, How I Learned 
To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964); and sexual obsession 
in ``Lolita'' (1962). 
</P>
<P>
	``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' with its dazzling visual imagery and  
inspired use of music, was a great success, and Kubrick got the 
second of his four Academy Award nominations for best director. The 
other nominations were for ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Barry Lyndon,'' 
and ``A Clockwork Orange,'' which unlike ``2001'' were also 
nominated for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Clockwork Orange,'' set in a violent future, was one of  
Kubrick's most provocative films and was disparaged by Anthony 
Burgess, whose novel was the basis of the film. Burgess accused 
Kubrick of turning his novelistic study of free will into an orgy 
of violence.

<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Merrill Parks Jr., the FBI's special  
agent in charge of Connecticut, died Saturday after a brief 
illness. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks supervised about 100 agents and a support staff of 70  
since he was appointed to lead the Connecticut office in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	During his reign, the office brought charges against dozens of  
ranking members of the Latin Kings, the state's largest reputed 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks spent 29 years with the FBI, investigating organized crime  
in New York City, Houston and Washington. He spent two years in the 
early 1980s with the Drug Enforcement Agency.

<HEADLINE> New WBA Champ To Have Eye Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Reid is looking toward a rich  
and successful boxing career, but first the new WBA super 
welterweight champion will have surgery on a droopy left eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation will be in five days and Reid can resume training  
in three or four weeks, said Dan Goosen, president of America 
Presents, Reid's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recovery time is minimal,'' Goosen said after Reid, the only  
U.S. Olympic boxing champion in 1996, outpointed Laurent Boudouani 
of France on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third time Reid has had surgery on the lid, and  
it appears this sort of procedure will have to be done 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	The droopy lid limits Reid's vision, but it didn't hamper his  
performance against Boudouani before a crowd of a crowd of 2,167, 
mostly Reid fans, in a ballroom at the Boardwalk Convention Center 
and before an HBO audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Boudouani scored with several hard rights to the head.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could see out of the left eye, but that right hand was  
coming fast,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, a 25-year-old from Philadelphia, was simply too fast for  
his 32-year-old opponent. He was effective with jabs and rights to 
the body and he hurt the Frenchman with a left hook to the head 
that him wobbling in the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I hurt him, but he had enough experience to stay away,  
to stay up,'' said Reid, who won by six points each on two cards 
and by five on the third. 
</P>
<P>
	While the victory was not nearly as dramatic as his one-punch  
knockout of Cuba's Alfredo Duvergel in the third round of the 
156-pound gold-medal bout at the Atlanta Olympics in which he was 
far behind in the scoring, it was impressive for a man fighting 
professionally for only the 11th time. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid (11-0, seven knockouts, 154 pounds) did some trash talking,  
but Boudouani (38-3-1, 32 knockouts, 152 pounds), doesn't 
understand English. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's next opponent is not known, but Boudouani, who said he  
hurt his left shoulder early in the fight, called for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Reid is a gentleman, and I came all the way to this  
country,'' Boudouani said through an interpreter. ``If David Reid 
is a gentleman, maybe he will come all the way to France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 10-round heavyweight brawl, 6-foot-5 Lou Savarese, 240, of  
Houston got up from a sixth-round knockdown and scored a split 
decision over 6-8 Lance Whitaker, 249, who had won his first 18 pro 
fights, 16 by knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker's camp contended that Savarese (39-2, 32 knockouts)  
didn't beat referee Steve Smoger's 10-count. Savarese, however, 
while on one knee, looked directly at Smoger as he took the count, 
and it appeared he got up before 10.

<HEADLINE> 'Band in Berlin' Is Misguided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It is odd to spend 90 minutes-plus with a group  
of performers and then not learn much about the characters they are 
playing -- despite a proliferation of facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an experience occurs in ``Band in Berlin,'' a misguided  
musical documentary that somehow has found its way to Broadway and 
the Helen Hayes Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The production combines the worst elements of educational  
television and a high school history lecture in its attempt to tell 
the story of the Comedian Harmonists, the most popular singing 
group in Germany before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	There should be a stirring tale in this saga of six men -- five  
singers and a pianist -- whose unique five-part harmony gains them 
international fame. At the height of their popularity, they are 
forced to disband because several members of the group are Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's creators never quite resolve how they want the story  
told. The author, Susan Feldman, places the musical within a series 
of concerts given by the troupe between 1927 and 1935. In between 
songs, there are badly lighted and hokey film segments of an actor 
playing one of the singers as an old man, reminiscing about the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the musical numbers are fun, with the quaint  
old-fashioned style actually sounding fresh and new. The songs 
cover quite a lot of ground -- from sprightly German tunes to 
American standards such as ``Tea for Two,'' ``Stormy Weather'' and 
``It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five singers -- first tenor Mark Bleeke, second tenor Timothy  
Leigh Evans, lyric baritone Hugh Munday, baritone Peter Becker and 
bass Wilbur Pauley -- work together in style. There is gentle fun in 
their performing, an almost sweet humor that is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Their best -- and wittiest -- moment occurs in a vocal  
interpretation of Rossini's overture to ``The Barber of Seville.'' 
Their voices really do sound like musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Patricia Birch uses actual photographs, posters and art  
from the period to chronicle Germany's descent into Nazism. There 
is the obvious juxtaposition of the approaching firestorm with the 
cheerful, often exuberant melodies being sung on stage. It is a 
pattern that gets repeated over and over again with diminishing 
dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, ``Band in Berlin,'' too small and too studious for  
Broadway, would work better as a cabaret act. It is earnest 
entertainment, and despite the wonderful harmony, decidedly minor 
key.

	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Manistique rebounded from a slow start to  
take the lead from pacesetter Magical Allure and win by three 
lengths Sunday in the $294,000 Santa Margarita Invitational 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying a high weight of 122 pounds with Gary Stevens, the  
4-year-old filly passed Magical Allure on the far turn of the 
1 1/8-mile track and drew clear to finish first in a field of only 
four fillies and mares in 1:48 1/5. The win was Manistique's 
seventh in eight starts and first in a Grade I event. 
</P>
<P>
	India Divina finished third, one-half length behind Magical  
Allure, and Victory Stripes finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Manistique, the 1-5 favorite, earned $180,000 to increase her  
career total to $646,700. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned $2.60 and $2.10. Magical Allure returned $2.20.

<HEADLINE> Saudis, Iran Discuss Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil  
ministers said Sunday that in order to raise prices, the market's 
surplus must be eliminated, the official Saudi Press Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In their talks in Riyadh, Ali Naimi of Saudi Arabia and Bijan  
Namdar Zanganeh of Iran agreed there is ``a surplus in supply of 
oil, and it is necessary to get rid of this surplus in order for 
oil prices to improve,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions came about two weeks before the Organization of  
the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to hold a ministerial 
meeting on oil prices, which have plummeted to their lowest level 
in 20 years, hovering near $11 a barrel for the past several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two sides also agreed on the need to continue discussions  
between themselves, and among OPEC members and non-members, to take 
a united and positive decision during the next OPEC meeting on 
March 23,'' the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said Wednesday that  
his country and Iran were determined to curb the collapse of oil 
prices on international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia has a daily production quota of 8 million barrels,  
while Iran, the second-largest OPEC producer, has a quota of 3.3 
million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Other OPEC members include Algeria, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait,  
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Nicaragua, El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about Nicaragua and El Salvador, which President Clinton  
is visiting Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *NICARAGUA:   	
</P>
<P>
	GEOGRAPHY: Covering 50,180 square miles, Nicaragua borders  
Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south. It has coasts on 
both the Pacific and Caribbean sides of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	PEOPLE: Nicaragua's population of 4.3 million is overwhelmingly  
Roman Catholic, and Spanish is the official language -- except on 
the Miskito Coast along the Caribbean, where English is prevalent 
and there is a strong Protestant minority. 
</P>
<P>
	ECONOMY: With a mixture of mining and agriculture, Nicaragua  
produces coffee, sugar cane, corn, beans and cattle as well as 
lumber, gold, silver, copper, tungsten, lead and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
	HISTORY: Spanish conquerors first visited what is now Nicaragua  
in 1522 and it was a colony until it gained independence in 1838. 
The United States invaded in 1909 and occupied Nicaragua until 
1925, when it left Gen. Anastasio Somoza Garcia as president. The 
Somoza family ruled Nicaragua with an iron fist for 42 years. A 
popular uprising led by the leftist Sandinista movement took power 
in 1979. With U.S. aid, former Somoza soldiers mounted a nine-year 
guerrilla war. After a peace agreement in 1989, the Sandinistas 
lost the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *EL SALVADOR:   	
</P>
<P>
	GEOGRAPHY: El Salvador covers 8,260 square miles, roughly the  
size of Massachusetts. It is bordered by Guatemala to the west and 
Honduras to the north and east, and has a Pacific coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	PEOPLE: The nation's 5.8 million people are largely Roman  
Catholic, but there is a growing Protestant minority. The language 
is Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	ECONOMY: With a mixture of agriculture and industry, El Salvador  
produces coffee, cotton, corn, sugar, bananas, rice, beans and 
sorghum. It also processes foods, makes textiles and clothing and 
has major hydro-electric plants. 
</P>
<P>
	HISTORY: Spanish explorer Pedro de Alvarado conquered what is  
now El Salvador in 1525 and it was a colony until 1821, when the 
Central American nations formed a federation. El Salvador became a 
republic in 1838, but was oppressively ruled by an upper class 
closely allied with the rightist military. In 1979, a leftist 
guerrilla group launched a fight for power that lasted until 1992, 
when a peace agreement was signed. A republican government is now 
in place.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's latest economic study committee --  
this one with members picked only by the owners -- starts work with 
a Monday meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, former Federal  
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, Yale president Richard Levin and 
television commentator George Will are the four outsiders on the 
group. Levin was the author of the owners' original salary cap 
proposal in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig heads the panel, and Colorado Rockies  
owner Jerry McMorris and Boston Red Sox chief executive officer 
John Harrington are the vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig appointed the ``blue ribbon task force'' last month after  
many owners complained the latest salary escalation further 
increased the imbalance between baseball's haves and have nots. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's current collective bargaining agreement probably will  
expire after the 2001 season.

<HEADLINE> UN Criticizes INS Refugee Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States' clampdown on illegal  
immigration is hurting would-be asylum seekers and refugees, 
complains a high-ranking representative of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	People fleeing persecution in their homelands are being snared  
in a web of ``very, very restrictive'' U.S. policies designed to 
deter illegal immigration, said Dennis McNamara, director of the 
division of international protection at the Geneva-based 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. agency is responsible for overseeing the safety of the  
world's refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara was in Washington in recent days to meet with officials  
of the State Department and elsewhere. He was registering 
objections to U.S. detention and removal policies Congress ordered 
under a 1996 law designed to crack down on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to meet Monday with Doris Meissner, commissioner of  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and suggest 
alternatives to the detention of would-be refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are refugees, of course they should not be detained at  
all unless they are a threat to the state or community,'' he said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The detention and removal policies are ``on a par with some of  
the most restrictive that we have seen in industrialized 
countries,'' McNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials defended their handling of the more than 100,000  
asylum and refugee cases considered each year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people temporarily are detained because they arrived  
without documents or with fraudulent papers, INS spokesman Barbara 
Francis said. She said 40 percent are released before their cases 
are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has one of the most generous asylum programs  
in the world,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara agreed the United States has a good record in offering  
political haven. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. remains our major donor, financial supporter, major  
political backer (and) .... the biggest refugee receiving country 
in the world. So the record is a long and positive one in general 
terms for refugees,'' McNamara said. ``Even more, therefore, our 
concern that these new restrictions go against that general 
trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law put in place procedures that require the temporary  
detention of would-be asylum seekers and refugees who present 
themselves at U.S. ports of entry without travel documents or with 
false paperwork. They are detained during investigation of their 
claim. 
</P>

	McNamara said such detention constitutes a breach of the  
international refugee convention signed by the United States and 
135 other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugee convention says that people should not be punished  
for illegally entering the country, and that includes detention,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rockwell CEO Atwood Dies at 94 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- J. Leland ``Lee'' Atwood, a key figure  
in the aerospace industry for more than 50 years while president 
and chief executive officer of Rockwell International Corp., has 
died. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood died Friday of natural causes at St. John's Hospital in  
Santa Monica, the company announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His work led to the development of the P-51 Mustang fighter, one  
of the main aircraft used in World War II. The fighter was 
developed for Rockwell's predecessor company North American 
Aviation, now part of the Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lee was a great American and his contributions during this  
century helped enable the United States to attain aerospace 
superiority,'' Don H. Davis, Rockwell's chairman and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood was credited with helping the company gain leading roles  
in developing the award-winning F-100 Super Sabre, X-15 rocket 
plane, the B-1 bomber and Space Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer was born in Walton, Ky. on Oct. 26, 1904. He  
studied at Hardin-Simmons University and later received a 
bachelor's of science degree in civil engineering from the 
University of Texas in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his career as a junior airplane engineer with the  
Army Air Corps at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio in 1928. Two years 
later he left to work as a design engineer with Douglas Aircraft 
Co. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, he began work at North American Aviation, becoming  
chief engineer and vice president. He was elected president in 
1948, gaining the title of CEO in 1960 and then chairman of the 
company two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He received various aviation awards, including a Presidential  
Certificate of Merit in 1948 for his contributions to the war 
effort. In 1995, Italy gave him its Commander of Merit declaration 
for his contributions to the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he was awarded NASA's Public Service Award, the highest  
honor for a non-governmental employee. It recognized his leadership 
efforts with the government-industry team which completed the first 
manned lunar orbit mission, Apollo 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood is survived by his wife, Patricia.

<HEADLINE> Do Corporate Spin-Offs Pay Off? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This week, Lew Platt, chief executive of  
Hewlett-Packard made one of the most defining decisions of his 
career -- splitting the computer and electronics giant into two 
separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it pay off?  
</P>
<P>
	A recent study shows the most successful corporate splitups are  
much smaller than Hewlett-PackardUs $68 billion market value. 
</P>
<P>
	The management consultant McKinsey &AMP; Co. looked at more than 130  
of them over the past decade and found that the best performers 
were companies with a market value below $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the spinoff, Rsmaller companies donUt get (as much  
executive) attention, as the larger companies do,S said Warren 
Batts, a professor of strategic management at the University of 
ChicagoUs Graduate School of Business. RWhen they stand alone and 
they can move the needle on their stock, their motivation level, by 
and large, goes up substantially.S 
</P>
<P>
	So smaller splitups tend to hit the market with turbocharged  
stocks. In their first two years on their own, these newly minted 
companies returned an average of 32 percent to shareholders, 
assuming dividends are reinvested. 
</P>
<P>
	Splitups of larger companies, however, returned just 13 percent  
during the same period, which was below the 17 percent return of 
the Standard &AMP; PoorUs 500 Index, according to the McKinsey study. 
Executives at McKinsey, which reportedly advised Hewlett-Packard on 
its breakup, declined to comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
	One big splitup that has yet to show promise is Hilton Hotels  
Corp. The Los Angeles-based company jettisoned its gambling 
operations in December, creating Park Place Entertainment Corp. The 
stock, which began trading in January at $7 a share, closed 
unchanged Friday at $7.50. HiltonUs own stock is also flat for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	ThatUs not to say, however, that spinning off large holdings is  
a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	RWhen the two companies are not dependent on each other for any  
significant reason ... then spinning them off normally takes out a 
layer of administration and speeds up the responses of each 
organization to its market needs,S said Batts, who sits on several 
corporate boards and has been involved in several spin-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	ThatUs what Hewlett-Packard is thinking. The Palo Alto,  
Calif.-based company plans to retain its computer, printer and 
software businesses and break out its divisions that make medical 
products and devices that measure performance in everything from 
semiconductors to wireless communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Those businesses accounted for $7.6 billion of H-PUs sales of  
$47.1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	RWe believe we can make two new companies that are more focused  
and more nimble,S Platt, H-PUs chief executive, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton Hotels hopes that it will have more flexibility as an  
independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	RAs a combined company, you had to make decisions,S explained  
Marc Grossman, a Hilton spokesman. RDo we acquire a gaming company, 
and does that mean we canUt make a hotel acquisition?S 
</P>
<P>
	One large-capitalization company that made the split work was  
AT&AMP;T, which kept its long-distance business while spinning off its 
computer company, NCR Corp., and its telecommunications equipment 
company, now called Lucent Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the breakup AT&AMP;T had a market value of about $75 billion.  
Today, trading separately, the three companies have a combined 
value of $287 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst and investors like some splitups because the companies  
are easier to evaluate when theyUre separate. On Wall Street, they 
call it a Rpure play.S

<HEADLINE> FTC Antitrust Charges Against Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission has accused Intel Corp., of  
violating antitrust laws. In an administrative hearing on the case 
beginning Tuesday, FTC attorneys must prove: 
</P>
<P>
	--Intel is a monopoly.  
</P>
<P>
	--Intel used its monopoly power to hurt competitors or to prevent  
potential competitors from entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
	--Intel's actions hurt consumers, either by hindering innovation  
or through higher prices for products. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler Baker, an antitrust attorney based in Dallas, says  
monopolists often are held to a higher standard than other 
companies because their actions have a wider impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's done by a little company that has no prospect of  
driving another company out of business, that's one thing, but when 
it's done by a big company that has 85 percent of the market, the 
effect may be to squelch the competition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Banana Fight Threatens WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The showdown over bananas between the United  
States and Europe has put the future of the World Trade 
Organization at risk, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Europeans don't start dealing with us more honestly in  
complying with WTO decisions, I don't know that WTO is going to 
exist or amount to anything,'' Lott, R-Miss., said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has become the battleground for a dispute between the  
United States and the European Union over European restrictions on 
imports of Central and Latin American bananas. The WTO ruled 
against the Europeans in 1997. But the United States, saying the EU 
had not adequately redressed the issue, announced plans to impose 
$520 million in retaliatory tariffs on European goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The 133-nation WTO, set up in 1995, meets in emergency session  
Monday to hear the EU's complaint that the U.S. sanctions are 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO made a decision on bananas. The Europeans have stiffed  
us,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is a free trader but believes that stiff penalties  
should be imposed on any country that dumps goods in this country 
or otherwise practices unfair trade. Lott said he is against 
letting China, which has had a stormy trade relationship with the 
United States, join the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is pushing the case because American  
companies, including Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole 
Food Co., grow their bananas mostly in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman and GOP presidential hopeful  
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he worries about protectionist 
sentiments evident within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I care about bananas. My kids eat them every day. But  
I'm not sure that's a reason for us to escalate into a trade war 
here,'' he said, also on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was glad TV commentator Pat Buchanan, a strong  
proponent of protecting U.S. industries, is running for president 
again so the issue of free trade could be debated. ``I'm deeply 
concerned about this rise in protectionism and isolationism,'' 
McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Pfeiffer Says Women Are Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Pfeiffer thinks the obstacles women  
face in life make them great role models. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are the heroes of our time,'' Pfeiffer says in Sunday's  
Daily News. ``We accept the impossible. We take on way more than we 
could ever accomplish, and we somehow manage to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about it. We run the home. We pretty much are in charge  
of raising the children, although the men help. A lot of us have 
careers. Also, women are very much in charge of putting energy into 
a relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer's latest movie, ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' is a  
tear-jerker about a woman whose young son disappears from a hotel 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old actress, whose films include ``A Thousand  
Acres,'' ``The Age of Innocence,'' ``Batman Returns,'' ``The 
Fabulous Baker Boys,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Scarface,'' 
credits her good looks for getting her career going, but said hard 
work is what kept it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``My appearance helped me in the beginning just to get work when  
I was learning my craft,'' she said. ``I learned to act as I went 
along. Learning on the job was a gift. It was also scary. 
Fortunately I have a real sink-or-swim mentality. I'm so afraid of 
humiliating myself that I'll go to any length not to.''

<HEADLINE> Forger Writes His Way Out of Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- An alleged forger got out of jail thanks to  
a phony letter faxed to officials that had the word ``governor'' 
misspelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter faxed to authorities notified jail officials that a  
parole violation warrant against Joshua Williams, 38, would be 
dropped on Feb. 26. Believing the letter to be genuine, deputies 
allowed Williams to leave the jail that day after he posted bond on 
two forgery cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, on Corrections Department letterhead, had  
typographical errors -- including ``Govenor'' -- and ended with the 
forged signature of an actual parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had been in the jail since Feb. 1. He was on parole for  
a forgery conviction, and the Department of Corrections had filed a 
warrant alleging that he had violated parole. 
</P>
<P>
	He was re-arrested Wednesday in his hometown and was returned to  
the Johnson County Jail on Friday. His trial on four counts of 
forgery is scheduled to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're real interested in finding the creative mind that faxed  
that letter,'' said Bill Miskell, a spokesman for the Kansas 
Department of Corrections.

<HEADLINE> Couples Aim for 'Millennium' Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The odds oppose them, Y2K computer alarmists warn  
against it and doctors frown, but some prospective procreators are 
eyeing the mother of all due dates for their newborns -- Jan. 1, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For would-be parents hoping to have a Y2-Kid on New Year's Day,  
April 9 is the prime conception date -- although experts say it's 
almost impossible to plan a child's birthdate without major 
technological intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't discourage millennial mothers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be all new -- a new year, a new section of our  
lives,'' says Cameron House, a researcher in Bryan, Texas, who will 
schedule her artificial insemination at a clinic the second week of 
April if she and her husband don't conceive by then. 
</P>
<P>
	And while some couples want to avoid hospitals next January  
because they are terrified of the Year 2000 computer bug wreaking 
havoc, Mrs. House and others are seeking to add the joys of 
parenthood to their New Year's Day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband, he thinks it's kind of cool,'' says Michelle  
Ramirez, a human resources manager in Hollister, Calif. ``To me, at 
this point, I just want a baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first births of 2000 have captured the imaginations of  
couples and entrepreneurs alike. 
</P>
<P>
	A San Francisco Web site is selling a $49.99 Millennium  
Conception Kit, which includes a fertility guide, ovulation 
prediction tests, a pregnancy test, massage oil and candles. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Zealand company is sponsoring a contest to guess the sex  
and weight of that nation's first 2000 baby, and a British 
television network has incurred the wrath of churches with a 
documentary-style series about couples striving for millennium 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstetricians aren't thrilled about millennial-baby enthusiasm,  
especially if women want help hurrying their baby along around 
midnight Dec. 31. They warn that inducing labor increases medical 
risks and costs. Atlanta gynecologist Mark Perloe, like many 
doctors, doesn't let patients pick their child's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people set all kinds of crazy goals, but that doesn't  
mean that medical science should go out there to meet it,'' he 
says. ``It's not medically appropriate to do something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women can schedule in-vitro fertilization and other clinical  
procedures electively, but that doesn't much improve the chance of 
birth on a specific day. Caesarean sections can also be elective, 
as medically warranted, but with Jan. 1, 2000, falling on a 
Saturday, many doctors will try to avoid the operations that day. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who want to try procreation the old-fashioned way, sex  
results in pregnancy only about 20 percent of the time, Perloe 
says. Most women's fertility cycles vary, and Perloe predicts 
``less than a 1 percent chance'' of delivering on New Year's Day by 
having sex early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there's a big window of two to three weeks on either side  
of the due date,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of that deters many from considering the idea, with  
some going so far as to use fertility drugs to alter their cycles 
and to locate doctors willing to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on several computer bulletin boards that have taken up  
the topic, many women say the possibility of Y2K computer problems 
affecting hospitals has changed their minds about spending New 
Year's Eve in labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can just see me in the hospital giving birth on Jan. 1,  
2000, when all the power goes out!'' one woman posted last month. 
</P>
<P>
	That thought unnerved Jennifer Nashif of Canton, Mich., enough  
that she and husband Peter are waiting until May to try to conceive 
their third child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to go overdue,'' says Mrs. Nashif, 28. ``And I do not  
want to deliver on January first. I'm just a little concerned about 
what the Y2K computer bug might do to our utilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Roman Catholics, Pope John Paul II has declared 2000 a  
``Jubilee year'' to focus on forgiveness, reconciliation, 
conversion and penance. Mrs. Nashif, a Catholic, says she liked the 
idea of having a baby on Jan. 1, but ``the whole year's a Jubilee 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Haddon, an Athens, Ga., computer technician, dissuaded his  
wife from having their second baby next winter because of the 
uncertainty he foresees with computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Haddon, 22, who originally wanted a January baby, eventually  
agreed, in part because she thinks Y2K babies are a fad for many 
wanting ``the attraction of having their 15 minutes of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, says Mrs. House. She sees motherhood as the perfect way  
to open a new century, one she initially viewed as a frightening 
milepost in the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of worried about the whole thing. Then I thought,  
'Hey, this is the millennium, the first year, wow,''' she says. 
``It will just be neat.''

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' No. 1 at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Analyze This,'' the new comedy starring  
Robert DeNiro as a neurotic mob boss and Billy Crystal as his 
therapist, finished No. 1 at the weekend box office, beating the 
teen love-game tale ``Cruel Intentions,'' estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' earned $17.7 million in its debut. It was a  
victory of sorts for both actors, outdoing their most recent 
openings by millions. DeNiro's action thriller ``Ronin'' debuted 
with $12.7 million and Crystal's ``My Giant,'' opened with $3.1 
million, according to figures released by Exhibitor Relations Co. 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' the latest film geared toward a teen  
audience, debuted in second place with a solid $13.2 million -- not 
bad for a film that reportedly cost just $11 million to make. 
However, it failed to beat the opens of other teen flicks such as 
``She's All That'' ($16.1 million) and ``Varsity Blues'' ($15.2 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	Another teen movie, ``She's All That,'' rounded out the top 10  
with $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's dark ``8mm,'' about a detective's  
descent into porn subculture, finished No. 3 with $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Other Sister,'' a love story about two mentally challenged  
people starring Juliette Lewis, was in fourth place with $5.6 
million. It lost just 15 percent of its audience in its second 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of competition like 'Analyze This' and the adult  
market, I think we did very well. I think it's about word of mouth. 
The public does it for you,'' said Chuck Viane, senior vice 
president of distribution for Buena Vista Pictures distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was down 8.5 percent from last year,  
when moviegoers were still lured by mega-hit ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday through  
Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' $17.7 million.  
</P>

	2. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $13.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles Protest Orioles Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Cuban exiles demonstrated against  
the Baltimore Orioles' planned exhibition game in Havana, saying 
Sunday the March 28 game symbolizes America's growing support for 
Fidel Castro and his communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of  
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said 
Huber Matos, a Cuban native who spent 20 years in prison on the 
island for opposing Castro's government. ``It's like taking part in 
the abuses that are going on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matos joined more than 70 exiles waving Cuban flags and holding  
protest signs outside the gates of Fort Lauderdale Stadium before 
an exhibition game against the Florida Marlins. Then they took 
their protest inside the ballpark and continued the demonstration 
in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to let Oriole players know Cuba's  
reality,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers and Women Against 
Repression in Cuba. ``This is a time to support the Cuban people. 
They don't realize there is a wave a violence aimed at the 
opposition and certain journalists there. This is not a time to 
play ball with Castro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be the first by a major league team in Cuba in 40  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters said they oppose a game played on the island while  
Castro's government continues to jail political opponents. They 
cited the case of four opposition leaders on the island who went on 
trial last week on charges of sedition amid a new crackdown on 
political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accused the four dissidents of promoting U.S.  
policies toward Cuba and trying to harm the economy by discouraging 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were arrested in July 1997 for criticizing a  
Communist Party document that they said did not present solutions 
to the country's severe economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cuba there is a brutal dictatorship that stomps on the  
rights of people,'' Matos said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the words of the protesters were lost on some fans at the  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should keep sports out of the political arena,''  
said Kevin Stutzman of Fort Lauderdale. ``I understand what they 
are saying, but I think they are going about it the wrong way. They 
make people angry instead of sympathetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles fan Kevin Callahan said the Havana trip provides his  
favorite team a chance to scout potential players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could get a good player down the road from this,'' said  
Callahan, who lives in nearby Coral Springs.

<HEADLINE> Benigni, Paltrow Win SAG Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An exuberant Roberto Benigni captured a lead  
actor prize for ``Life is Beautiful'' and Gwyneth Paltrow took home 
an actress award that she dedicated to her mother at the Screen 
Actors Guild awards Sunday night. Robert Duvall and Kathy Bates 
also received honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, the Italian director-actor-writer who created the  
comic-tragic story of a father trying to shield his son from the 
horrors of Holocaust, lifted award presenter Helen Hunt and spun 
her around, then said in broken English he was so happy that 
``every organ of my body is moving in a very bad way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni's award was the biggest surprise of the night and  
suggested the best actor Oscar later this month is a toss-up. He 
beat such strong nominees as Joseph Fiennes (``Shakespeare in 
Love''), Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan''), Ian McKellen (``Gods 
and Monsters'') and Nick Nolte (``Affliction.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow, awarded for her role as the heiress who falls in love  
with a young William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' paid 
tribute to her mother Blythe Danner as ``the most brilliant, 
beautiful, profound actress I know'' and dedicated the award to 
her. Paltrow also won a Golden Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just such an honor to be recognized by my peers.  
You'll never know quite what this means to me,'' said Paltrow, 
nominated along with Cate Blanchett in ``Elizabeth,'' Jane Horrocks 
in ``Little Voice,'' Meryl Streep in ``One True Thing'' and Emily 
Watson in ``Hilary and Jackie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' also won the ensemble acting prize for a  
film. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, honoring actors in both film and television, was  
broadcast on cable's TNT from the Shrine Exposition Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In other film categories, Bates, the politically savvy campaign  
troubleshooter in ``Primary Colors,'' and Duvall, the tough, 
baseball-loving corporate attorney in ``A Civil Action,'' won 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thrilled, absolutely thrilled,'' supporting-actress  
winner Bates said backstage, making no secret of her desire to go 
on to win an Academy Award on March 21 for the same role. ``It's 
been on my mind ever since the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other supporting actress nominees were Brenda Blethyn for  
``Little Voice,'' Judi Dench for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Rachel 
Griffiths for ``Hilary and Jackie'' and Lynn Redgrave for ``Gods 
and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duvall won for supporting actor, beating David Kelly for  
``Waking Ned Devine,'' Geoffrey Rush for ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
and Billy Bob Thornton for ``A Simple Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the SAG awards are still young -- in their fifth year --  
they are becoming a strong predicator of Oscar winners because of a 
significant overlap of the membership of the actors' union and the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, four of those receiving SAG awards went on to pick up  
Oscars: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Robin Williams and Kim 
Basinger. Only Gloria Stuart, who shared the supporting actress SAG 
award with Basinger, didn't get an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, three of four SAG winners picked up Oscars.  
</P>
<P>
	The SAG awards were determined by voting open to the  
rank-and-file members of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	In the guild's television categories, Sam Waterston won for lead  
actor in a drama series for ``Law &AMP; Order,'' Julianna Margulies 
picked up her second prize for actress in a drama for ``ER,'' while 
the ensemble prize for drama went to the cast of ``ER,'' its fourth 
award in the five years the show has been on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensemble award for comedy series was given to the cast of  
``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Fox picked up an award for actor in a comedy series  
for ``Spin City'' and Tracey Ullman won for actress in a comedy 
series for ``Tracey Takes On.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Reeve won for actor in a TV movie or miniseries for  
``Rear Window.'' Angelina Jolie got the actress award for movie or 
miniseries for ``Gia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Douglas was given the guild's Lifetime Achievement Award.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Who Wed Doctors Are Happier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After 32 years of marriage and three  
children, Drs. Garry and Virginia Fuller don't talk much about 
medicine at home. 
</P>
<P>
	They met before medical school and say their anesthesiology  
specialty is only one of their common interests. Still, Garry 
Fuller said their marriage has endured because they have a greater 
understanding of each other's careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say, `I saved this person's life last night.' And  
you're not bragging, but in a way you get some gratification 
because the person understands how hard it is to do,'' said Fuller, 
who lives near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical profession can be fatal to marriages because of its  
long hours and high pressure. But a new study found it can be a 
boon in dual-doctor relationships because both physicians tend to 
work fewer hours, have a greater role in child-rearing and be 
happier about their shared professional experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certainly benefits to being a physician married to  
another physician,'' said lead author Dr. Nancy Sobecks, who is 
married to a hematologist in Riverside, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within my own family, we both feel like trying to balance  
career and family life is a much more difficult thing to do because 
of our profession. I probably work less hours ... because we can 
financially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is what the study published Feb. 16 in the Annals of  
Internal Medicine found: Women in dual-doctor families are more 
likely than female doctors married to non-physicians to make 
professional sacrifices for their spouse, earn less money and 
arrange their work schedules to care for children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was most surprised that gender roles are still extremely  
strong descriptors of people's behavior. Men and women in medicine 
really are equal, but when they are married (to other doctors), 
women fall back on the same traditional roles,'' said study 
co-author C. Seth Landefeld, who is married to another physician, 
co-author Mary-Margaret Chren. They both work in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The study originated as anecdotal talk between the authors -- all  
but one of whom are married to other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as more and more women have entered the field of  
medicine, this is going on more and more,'' said Sobecks, who also 
co-wrote the report. She predicted that nearly half of all doctors 
will be married to other doctors in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The study surveyed 1,208 physicians who graduated from medical  
school between 1980 and 1990. Of those, 22 percent of male 
physicians and 44 percent of female physicians were married to 
other physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that both men and women in dual-doctor families  
had lower personal incomes than other doctors, suggesting that the 
dual-doctor families have greater leeway due to their greater 
combined income, Sobecks said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, both male and female doctors in dual-doctor  
families had a greater share of child-rearing, although women still 
bore the brunt of those responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Maryellen Kyle said she has about 90 percent of the  
responsibility for raising her family's three daughters in 
Philadelphia. She said she chose to work in private practice to 
have a more flexible work schedule and, if anything, wishes she 
could work fewer hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This falls in the realm of common sense. It's the complicated  
choices working women make,'' said Kyle's husband, Dr. Rogers Kyle. 
``I would hope that my being in the same profession would make me 
more empathetic. ... But any career choices she made, I don't think 
I could have made a difference with. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most dual-doctor couples agree their shared careers offer  
them support in a sometimes trying profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take bad days out on the patient so you tend to  
bring them home with you,'' Garry Fuller said. ``If you bring them 
home to someone who doesn't understand them, well, people can only 
take that for so long. But for us, she has a bad day, you have a 
bad day, and you understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the findings from a study in the Annals of Internal  
Medicine about doctors married to doctors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Female physicians in dual-doctor families were less likely to  
believe they were successful in career goals than female doctors 
married to nonphysicians, 69 percent to 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Female physicians in dual-doctor families were more likely to  
arrange their work schedules to care for children than female 
doctors married to nonphysicians, 87 percent to 71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Male and female doctors who were married to other doctors  
worked fewer hours than female physicians married to nonphysicians; 
the hours worked by male physicians did not differ. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Among male physicians, those with a nonphysician spouse at  
home had the most children. Among female physicians, those in 
dual-doctor families had the most children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Female physicians married to other physicians were more likely  
to report making professional sacrifices for family reasons, 33 
percent, than female doctors married to nonphysicians, 19 percent. 
About 7 percent of male physicians reported limitations due to 
family responsibilities, and it did not differ based on whether 
they married a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	-- About 90 percent of doctors married to doctors reported  
satisfaction from shared work experiences, compared to 77 percent 
of doctors married to nonphysicians. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A total of 26 percent of the doctors surveyed were married to  
physicians, including 22 percent of the men and 44 percent of the 
women.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Monday amid continued bullish  
sentiment following a 5 percent rally in the market's main index 
Friday and a new record high on Wall Street. The dollar edged lower 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 95.75  
points, or 0.64 percent, to 14,989.75 points in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average closed up 710.55 points, 
or 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.82 yen in early trading, down 0.12 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but slightly above its New York level of 
122.80 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices moved higher behind the yen's  
relative weakness against the dollar and continued low interest 
rates in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo market was Friday's 268.68-point gain  
in the Dow Jones industrial average for a new closing high of 
9,736.08. 
</P>
<P>
	New York stocks surged as a slight rise in joblessness and wages  
in the United States eased investor concerns that the fast-growing 
economy would spur inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 9.64 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,156.36 
points. The TOPIX closed up 41.61 points, or 3.76 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was slightly higher in Tokyo  
from Friday's level in New York after falling on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were watching the outcome of the Bank of Japan's policy  
board meeting slated for Friday, as speculation has mounted that 
the central bank may come up with more ways to ease its 
already-loose monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the central bank's generous stance in the short-term  
money market has recently pushed down long-term interest rates in 
Japan, adding a boost to the dollar's strength against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 133.08 yen, up from  
132.98 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.555 percent from Friday's finish of 1.560 
percent, driving its price up to 101.98 yen from 101.94 yen.

	Clinton To Visit Central America  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making a pilgrimage to the sites of Hurricane  
Mitch's worst horrors, President Clinton proffers Central Americans 
hope for their reconstruction so that despair does not turn into 
political trouble for the region. The president embarks Monday on 
his four-day, four-nation mission just as 15,000 Guatemalans and 
Salvadorans in the United States illegally become eligible for 
deportation. He has turned down pleas for an extension of the halt 
in deportations that was instituted after last fall's devastating 
storm and expires Monday.

	Rightists Lead El Salvador Election  
</P>
<P>
	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- An ex-philosophy professor was  
headed for a first-round victory in El Salvador's presidential 
election on Sunday with a strong lead over two former guerilla 
chiefs. With about 79 percent of votes counted, the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal said Francisco Flores of the governing rightist 
National Republican Alliance had 51.8 percent -- enough to avoid a 
runoff against the No. 2 vote-getter if that share held up. Turnout 
appeared to be below 40 percent of the 3.1 million registered 
voters -- perhaps in response to a tepid campaign.

Sunday. The decision was fueled by anger over the U.S. position in 
a trade dispute over banana exports to Europe. The dispute 
escalated last week as the United States announced plans to impose 
punitive tariffs on targeted European goods. The WTO is holding an 
emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss the spreading trade dispute.

Nakamura's resignation was accepted by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi

Southeastern Conference grabbed most of the top spots, however, 
with one-fourth of the top 16 seeds. Top-ranked Duke, Michigan 
State, Auburn and Connecticut were named No. 1 seeds. In addition 
to regular-season and tournament champion Michigan State, the other 
Big Ten teams selected were Ohio State, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota,

<HEADLINE> Soccer Violence Sweeps Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMO, Italy (AP) -- A wave of violence swept Italy's minor league  
soccer stadiums Sunday, with spectators tossing rocks and police 
using tear gas to subdue fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One player is under investigation for attacking a police officer  
after a game, the ANSA news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A scuffle involving spectators, police and players from  
third-division clubs Como and Modena broke out in the tunnel 
leading to the locker rooms after the teams played to a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer was taken to the hospital with head injuries and a  
Modena player was questioned by police, ANSA said. Police would not 
confirm the reports. 
</P>

	In Naples, four officers were treated at a hospital for injuries  
during clashes with rival hooligans outside San Paolo Stadium 
before a Serie B game.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Unveils Men's Tournament Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Big Ten came within one upset by  
Illinois of getting a record eight teams in the NCAA tournament, 
while the proud ACC finds itself keeping company with the Missouri 
Valley and WAC with three teams each. 
</P>
<P>
	But if anybody has a gripe with the selection committee this  
year, it's a Connecticut team that is headed far from its fans in 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman C.M. Newton said Sunday the panel judged the Huskies  
the second-best team in the 64-team field behind Duke. Yet, they 
alone among the four No. 1 seeds were shipped far from home and 
will open play in Denver in the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, leading scorer Richard Hamilton said traveling  
across the country does have its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help us because then there's no distractions,'' he  
said. ``We've got to stick together, we got to be together to do 
the things we want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other No. 1 seeds are Duke in the East, Michigan State in  
the Midwest and Auburn in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee spent a lot of time trying to fit the Huskies into  
the South, where they would have traveled no farther than 
Indianapolis for the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) because of the conference constraints, we disadvantaged  
so many teams moving them out of their region, we went back and did 
another bracket putting them in the West to see how it filled 
out,'' Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made it much fairer.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duke -- the No. 1 overall seed and the first team to go 16-0  
through the ACC -- draws unofficial seed No. 64, Florida A&AMP;M 
(12-18), one of five teams in the tournament for the first time. 
The Rattlers are the only sub-.500 team and got in by winning the 
Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been branded the Cinderella through the conference  
tournament and we'll keep that moniker in this game as well,'' said 
Jamaal Rhodes, a sophomore forward who will probably get the honor 
of covering Elton Brand next Friday. ``But we aren't afraid of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, a No. 16 seed  
has ever beaten a No. 1. But whether the Rattlers do it or not is 
no reason to keep them out of the tournament, Newton insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for the tournament and good for college basketball  
to have teams like that that jump up here,'' Newton said. ``It's 
the experience of a lifetime, to make that field. That's the beauty 
of this national tournament. It's truly national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten set the record with seven teams in 1990 and it was  
matched by the Big East in 1991 and the Big Ten again in 1994. The 
league could have gotten the record if Illinois had completed its 
conference tournament run Sunday with another upset over Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the ACC, it will have its lowest number of tournament  
teams since two, the limit at the time, were picked for the field 
of 40 in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to regular-season and tournament champion Michigan  
State, the other Big Ten teams selected were Ohio State, Indiana, 
Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Purdue, which almost ruined itself 
with a late-season slump and wound up No. 10 seed in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southeastern Conference has one-fourth of the top 16 seeds,  
including Auburn, No. 3 Kentucky and No. 4s Tennessee and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the committee's long-standing policy is not to pay any  
attention to conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, second-seeded Maryland and third-seeded North Carolina  
were the ACC teams chosen. The Big East, with Connecticut, No. 2 
Miami and No. 3 St. John's, also had three teams in the top 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (32-1) takes its 27-game winning streak into the  
opening-round game in the East Regional in Charlotte, N.C., on 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Small Stocks Don't Draw a Crowd / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Raise the subject of small-company growth  
stocks at an investment conference these days, and you won't put 
yourself in any danger of being trampled in a stampede. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bustling annual gathering of some 850 financial advisers  
held here recently by the brokerage firm of Waterhouse Securities, 
a session on small-stock mutual funds drew a trickle-in audience of 
50 or so. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no mystery why the other 800 found something better to  
do. Small stocks have consistently trailed far behind the big blue 
chips all through the mid- to late 1990s, and they have shown no 
signs of behaving any differently so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an area of the market that has just been beaten up  
incredibly in recent times,'' said Ted Aronson, a specialist in 
small stocks with the money-management firm of Aronson and 
Partners, who took part in one of the conference's main panel 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	A case can be made, Aronson suggested, that small stocks have  
been stuck in the out-of-favor side of the investment cycle for the 
past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we coming to a new small-cap cycle? I don't know,'' said  
James Oberweis, who manages three portfolios of small to mid-sized 
stocks at the firm of Oberweis Asset Management. But if you can't 
predict what the market will do next, he said, you can analyze the 
relative values that prevail today: ``Small-cap stocks are at an 
absolute all-time low relative to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, small stocks as a group trade at a higher  
price-earnings ratio than big stocks do, based on the presumption 
that small companies, working from a smaller base, can usually 
achieve faster earnings growth than their blue-chip counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Oberweis noted, the aggregate P-E of a widely recognized  
small-stock index, the Russell 2,000, has been about 10 percent 
BELOW the P-E of the blue-chip-dominated S&AMP;P 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Many commentators say this represents an emotional extreme, and  
the pendulum must sooner or later swing back. Not every analyst and 
money manager agrees with this point of view, however -- some assert 
that blue chips have earned their new preeminence by emerging as 
the big winners in a new economic world order. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever their disagreements on other subjects, all the managers  
at the Waterhouse conference shared the same view of one category 
of investments, the super-hot Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is insanity,'' said Oberweis. ``These stocks don't make  
any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They strike me as the riskiest investments I've ever seen in  
my career,'' declared Robert Sanborn, manager of the Oakmark Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``The math doesn't work,'' said Brian Posner, a celebrated  
manager at Fidelity Investments for 10 years before he took over 
the reins of the Warburg Pincus Growth &AMP; Income Fund in January 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Whitman, the outspoken manager of the Third Avenue Funds,  
suggested whimsically that the only sensible way to ride the 
Internet boom was to be a venture capitalist, putting your money 
into a small company before it goes public and cashing out when the 
initial public offering of stock is made. 
</P>
<P>
	Venture-capital investing is a high-risk proposition normally  
open only to wealthy investors who can afford to make numerous big 
bets at the same time, expecting no more than a few to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Aronson offered a different Internet-stock suggestion, also for  
bold types willing to go against the trend in the market: ``I think 
the way to play them is to sell them short.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Clinton Aide Writes Memoirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a new book, former White House aide George  
Stephanopoulos says he sought counseling and eventually took an 
antidepressant drug to help him deal with the pressures of ``living 
on the Clinton roller coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos, who joined Clinton's campaign in 1991 and worked  
in the White House until late 1996, writes in his memoirs that he 
began seeing a therapist after White House counsel Vince Foster's 
suicide. He broke into hives, which he tried to hide with a beard, 
and suffered from insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually saw a psychiatrist who prescribed Zoloft, a  
popular antidepressant, to ``help stop my nerves from flooding my 
brain with the chemical fueling my compulsive symptoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medication helped, Stephanopoulos said. ``I still worked  
hard, but I worried less. I cared about what we could do, but I 
didn't obsess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos also said he ``felt like a dupe'' when he learned  
the truth about Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	He writes that he doubted Clinton's denials when the Lewinsky  
scandal broke in January 1998 and says he wrestled with what he 
knew would be the consequences of feeling the way he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe Clinton, and I couldn't buy the party line --  
which meant I was the enemy now,'' Stephanopoulos wrote. ``I didn't 
think I was a hypocrite, because my defense of Clinton against past 
bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn't 
create new ones ... For several years, I had served as Clinton's 
character witness. Now I felt like a dupe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos' book, ``All Too Human: A Political Education,''  
was excerpted in the latest issue of Newsweek magazine, available 
on newsstands Monday. The memoirs arrive in bookstores nationwide 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other tidbits from the former White House communications  
director, now a professor at Columbia University and an ABC News 
commentator: 
</P>
<P>
	--He said both Clintons had awesome tempers. ``When Hillary was  
angry, you didn't always know it right away -- a calculated chill 
would descend over time. Clinton's anger was a more impersonal 
physical force, like a tornado. The tantrum would form in an 
instant and exhaust itself in a violent rush. Whoever happened to 
be in the way would have to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--His first impression of Clinton in 1991: ``An overgrown boy.  
... He had the gait of a man used to being obeyed, admired, courted 
and loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He did not challenge Clinton when Clinton's affair with  
Gennifer Flowers was revealed: ``I needed Clinton to see me as his 
defender, not his interrogator, which made me, of course, an 
enabler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Once, during a brainstorming session about Supreme Court  
nominees, Clinton joked about nominating the first lady: ``The 
wildest fantasy hit closest to home: Wouldn't Hillary look great in 
a black robe? Of course, that couldn't happen ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos describes the Clintons as ``complete partners,  
businesslike in meetings, often childlike with each other.'' He 
describes seeing the Clintons in a playful stance one night in 1992 
when Clinton was ``hoarse and cranky'' while preparing for a 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went up to their suite with the next day's schedule to find  
her on the couch with him, legs laid over his lap, feeding him 
lemon slices dipped in honey,'' Stephanopoulos said. ``In playful 
moments, Clinton called for her in baby talk: `Hee-a-ree, 
Hee-a-ree.' ... ''

<HEADLINE> Back Injury Cancels First Lady Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A recurring back injury is keeping Hillary  
Rodham Clinton from accompanying the president on a four-day 
goodwill tour of Central America this week, the first lady's 
spokeswoman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton aggravated a previously injured back muscle while  
on a skiing vacation in Utah with her President Clinton and their 
daughter, Chelsea, said spokeswoman Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons returned to the White House on March 1 after a few  
days in Park City, Utah, where Mrs. Clinton skied with Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said the first lady did not have enough time to recover  
properly before the trip beginning Monday to Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, countries hardest hit by last 
fall's Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton toured the hurricane-struck area in November,  
shortly after Mitch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	She first hurt her back last spring.

<HEADLINE> 4 ACC Teams Highlight NIT Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four ACC teams and a rematch of the memorable  
Georgetown-Princeton game in the 1989 NCAA tournament highlight 
this year's NIT field. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest, North Carolina State, Clemson and Georgia Tech  
earned NIT bids Sunday from the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only 
three ACC teams were chosen for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton, which nearly pulled the biggest upset in NCAA  
tournament history 10 years ago before losing to top-seeded 
Georgetown 50-49 in the first round, will play host to the Hoyas on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are eight 20-game winners in the 32-team NIT, including  
Fresno State (21-11), Mississippi State (20-12) and Xavier (21-10). 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt like we earned an opportunity for the NCAA  
tournament,'' said Mississippi State coach Rick Stansbury, whose 
Bulldogs will play at Colorado State (17-10) in the first round. 
``We won 20 games in one of the best conferences in America. ... I 
don't understand why we weren't selected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big East, WAC and Big 12 also placed four schools in the  
NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Other intriguing first-round matchups are Jerry Tarkanian's  
Fresno State squad at California (17-11), an interstate battle 
between Northwestern (15-13) and DePaul (17-12), and Providence 
(16-13) at North Carolina State (18-13). 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point we figured we'd end up playing,'' said  
Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill. ``The NIT will do whatever it 
thinks is best for the tournament. We're just happy to be in the 
postseason and excited to be able to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first three rounds of the tournament will be played at  
campus sites. All first-round matches will be played on Wednesday. 
The second round will be held March 15-16, and the third round will 
take place March 17-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinals and finals will be played at New York's Madison  
Square Garden on March 23 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The other first-round matchups are: Hofstra (22-9) at Rutgers  
(18-12); Georgia (15-14) at Clemson (16-14); Seton Hall (15-14) at 
Old Dominion (24-8); Butler (20-9) at Bradley (17-11); Xavier 
(21-10) at Toledo (19-7); Alabama (17-14) at Wake Forest (16-13); 
Pepperdine (19-12) at Colorado (17-14); Southern California (15-12) 
at Wyoming (17-9); UNLV (16-12) at Nebraska (19-12); Texas

<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Some quotes from Texas Gov. George W. Bush  
and some members of the presidential exploratory campaign committee

matter what life brings.'' -- Bush. 

</P>
<P>

<P>
	``We need to do all we can to encourage George W. and his lovely  
bride to make this decision.'' -- Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.

<HEADLINE> 20 Hurt in Colombia Stadium Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A railing in the second deck of a soccer  
stadium in Cali gave way Sunday, sending fans and the metal barrier 
crashing on spectators below. Twenty people were injured, three 
seriously, the Red Cross reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The railing at Pascual Guerrero Stadium loosened when jubilant  
America fans pressed against it after their team scored the game's 
first goal against Deportivo Cali. 
</P>
<P>
	In the resulting confusion, several America fans rushed the  
field and scuffled briefly with Cali's goalkeeper and a defender. 
The players were not injured, and play resumed 45 minutes after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, in a game between these same teams in this stadium, 22  
people were crushed in a stampede. The mayhem began when fans 
leaving the stadium were urinated on by spectators above them.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits First Spring Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Big Mac is on the board.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire hit his first home run of 1999, a three-run shot  
Sunday for the St. Louis Cardinals in an exhibition game against 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd at Roger Dean Stadium got exactly what it wanted  
when McGwire launched a long drive that easily cleared the 
left-field wall in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, coming off a record 70 homers last season, connected  
against rookie lefty Ted Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had a slight smile after he stepped on home plate. J.D.  
Drew, Carlos Baerga and several other Cardinals greeted him, but 
McGwire did not punctuate this homer with his fake punch-to-the-gut 
routine that became his trademark during his historic season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,500-plus fan, many of them wearing No. 25 McGwire jerseys,  
responded with a standing ovation 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star first baseman picked on a familiar opponent in the  
Expos. He hit his final five homers last year against them, and six 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac, who hit seven homers in spring training last season,  
was playing his second exhibition game of the year. He was 0-for-1 
and hit by a pitch against Montreal on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a long foul before drawing a full-count walk from  
Jeremy Powell in the first inning. Against Lilly, McGwire barely 
missed a home run with a long drive that barely hooked foul before 
hitting a 2-1 pitch deep to left. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire did not bat again and left the game after three innings  
with the Cardinals ahead 6-0. He stopped in the left-field corner 
to sign autographs for a few minutes before walking to the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the Cardinals' 14 home exhibition games is sold  
out at Roger Dean Stadium, a complex they share with Montreal. 
McGwire merchandise dominates the souvenir stand, with hats, 
shirts, posters and model bats on sale.

<HEADLINE> Florida A&AMP;M's Reward: Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Welcome to the big time, Florida A&AMP;M.  
</P>
<P>
	It promises to be a short and painful stay.  
</P>
<P>
	By pulling upset after upset last week in the Mid-Eastern  
Athletic Conference tournament, the Rattlers (12-18) got the NCAA 
bid they had been praying for. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, with that comes something of a sobering challenge: a  
first-round game against top-seeded Duke (32-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone would have told me six months, or even six weeks  
ago, that we would be playing in the NCAA tournament against Duke, 
I would have laughed,'' Florida A&AMP;M coach Mickey Clayton said 
Sunday after watching the brackets announced on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	There hadn't been much to smile about around the A&AMP;M program  
until last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rattlers opened the season with 10 straight losses, the  
second-worst start in team history, and were 1-13 at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	But they turned their season around by going 11-5 the rest of  
the way despite injuries. In fact, they played the final of the 
MEAC tournament with just nine healthy bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	They managed to string together four straight wins as a No. 7  
seed last week and made their first-ever NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to continue to play together,'' said Jamaal  
Rhodes, a sophomore forward who will probably get the honor of 
covering Elton Brand next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been branded the Cinderella through the conference  
tournament and we'll keep that moniker in this game as well. But we 
aren't afraid of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If history is any indicator, maybe they should be.  
</P>
<P>
	Since the NCAA expanded the tournament to 64 teams in 1985, a  
No. 16 seed has never beaten a top seed. Naturally, that means a 
team with a losing record has never had even one victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's miracle entry -- Prairie View -- brought its 13-16  
record to the tournament and was unceremoniously dumped 110-52 by 
Kansas in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Tallahassee, also the home of Florida State, Florida  
A&AMP;M is used to standing well outside the sports spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one day, that will change for the Rattlers, as they  
trade in the Hampton States and Howards of the world for Duke, 
considered by far the strongest team in this year's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Their only similar experience this year was a season-opening  
game against Auburn that ended in a 94-47 loss.

	``We hope to draw from that experience,'' Clayton said. ``We're  
just going to go after these guys and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Line Explodes in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINWELL, Mich. (AP) -- A natural gas line ruptured Sunday in a  
rural area north of Kalamazoo, causing an explosion that was felt 
for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of injuries and the cause was unknown,  
according to Consumers Energy, a utility company. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion happened about 7:30 p.m. and the glow from the  
fire lit up the sky for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Three miles from the scene, 70-year-old Aubrey Nicholson was  
watching television when the flickering of their lights gave way to 
a loud roar that rattled the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a jet,'' Nicholson said. ``The whole sky was  
lit up. It was a pink glow, and once in while there'd be a huge 
mushroom ball go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his home just a mile from the explosion, Roy Livingston was  
working on his computer when -- out of the corner of his eye -- he 
saw a bright flash through a picture window. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like a bomb went off,'' said Livingston, 34. ``I saw  
it mushroom up and everything. I thought it was a nuclear bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was out about three hours later, and utility workers  
were on the scene to isolate the line and pinpoint what caused the 
explosion.

<HEADLINE> Big East Champ Is Top Seed in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- After Stanford fell flat in its final  
regular-season game, there was no doubt a team would come from far 
away as the No. 1 seed in the West. That team is Big East champion 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Selection Committee had to send either Auburn or  
Connecticut out West, and UConn got the nod. With North Carolina as 
the No. 3 seed, two of last year's Final Four -- Stanford and North 
Carolina -- will play in the same region. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut will make the long journey to Denver for a  
first-round matchup Thursday against Texas-San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which lost any fleeting chance for a No. 1 seed  
Saturday night with a loss at Oregon State, is seeded second, and 
will play Alcorn State Thursday at Seattle's Key Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	With Western Athletic Conference champion Utah sent to the  
Midwest as the No. 2 seed, there aren't a lot of Western teams in 
the West Region. Connecticut was just one of several that will 
cross a few time zones. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, long accustomed to staying close to home in the  
first round, will go to Seattle for its record 25th consecutive 
NCAA tournament appearance. The Tar Heels (24-9), as the No. 3 
seed, play Big Sky champion Weber State (24-7) in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas and Florida, two SEC teams that played one of the best  
games in the conference tournament, are both headed to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (20-8), which lost to Arkansas 75-74 in the SEC  
quarterfinals, travels about as far as a team can go and stay in 
the continental United States, playing Ivy League champ 
Pennsylvania (21-5) in Seattle on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas (22-10), which lost to Kentucky in the SEC tournament  
championship game Sunday, got the West's No. 4 seed and goes to 
Denver to play Siena (25-5) of the Metro Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (17-10), the No. 7 seed, has a tough first-round  
matchup in Seattle against Big West champion Gonzaga (25-6), one of 
the best outside shooting teams in the country. Iowa (18-9), in Tom 
Davis' last hurrah as coach, plays Alabama-Birmingham (20-11), a 
Conference USA team whose at-large berth was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	UAB lost to Louisville in the semifinals of the conference  
tournament, never beat a ranked team and lost to some mediocre 
opponents at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an anxious day, to say the least,'' UAB coach Murry  
Bartow said. ``We looked at it objectively all day and knew it 
would be close, but with the strength of our league and the 20 
wins, we thought we earned it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other first-round game in Denver, Missouri (20-8), one of  
five Big 12 teams in the tournament, plays New Mexico (24-8), a 
team that might not have its star Kenny Thomas, who missed the last 
two WAC tournament games with a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has taken Iowa to the NCAA tournament nine times in  
his 13 seasons as coach, won't be back next year because his 
contract wasn't extended. Davis has never lost a first-round game, 
and he was satisfied with the Hawkeyes' matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fifth seed is excellent for us,'' Davis said. ``I told our  
team, `Don't expect an easy game.' When you get the draw, you see 
there are no easy games all the way up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe. Texas-San Antonio (18-10), the Southland Conference  
champion, will be making its second trip to the NCAA tournament, 
and since its first-round matchup is against Connecticut (28-2), 
the journey shouldn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcorn State (23-6) won its first Southwestern Athletic  
Conference tournament championship since 1984 and earned the right 
to play Stanford (25-6), the Pac-10 champion with all of its 
starters back from last year's Final Four team. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford coach Mike Montgomery didn't think Saturday night's  
loss to Oregon State cost his team a No. 1 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a long shot for a No. 1 seed all along,'' he said. ``I  
think we got exactly what we deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he insisted the Cardinal won't take Alcorn State lightly. He  
remembered a decade ago, when Stanford was in the NCAA tournament 
for the first time in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost to a team named Siena,'' Montgomery said.  
</P>
<P>
	Siena's trip to the West Regional is its first NCAA appearance  
since then.

<HEADLINE> Search Ends for Haitians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Coast Guard has called off its search Sunday  
for up to 40 Haitians who apparently drowned while trying to sneak 
into the country in what is described as the deadliest smuggling 
attempt ever off the South Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point they're presumed dead,'' Lt. John Pierce said.  
``We searched right up until midnight without results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two boats loaded with refugees sank Saturday in the early  
morning hours. Crew members on a passing freighter reported hearing 
screams from the water about 30 miles east of West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers found only three survivors. A Coast Guard cutter  
recovered the bodies of two men, and crew members saw two other 
men's bodies sink below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was not sure of the exact number of people  
missing. U.S. Border Patrol Senior Patrol Agent William Brett told 
the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale that interviews with survivors 
led him to believe there were 43 people in all -- 16 men and two 
women on one boat and 20 men and five women on the second boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The men rescued from the choppy waters of the Atlantic Ocean  
told the border patrol that one of the boats broke down and that 
the other boat approached to help. Both boats then went under, the 
survivors said. The vessels were a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the survivors, Louis Pierre, was in good condition at  
Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach and spoke to The 
Associated Press through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre said there were 16 men and two women on the boat he was  
on. They left St. Mark, Haiti, Monday night, and stopped in the 
Bahamas on Thursday night to rest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After they left the Bahamas, the boat started taking on water  
and sank, he said. He said he was in the water 17 hours before he 
was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre, 42, said he was hoping for political asylum, and denied  
that the trip was organized by smugglers. He said that he was not 
smuggled and only contributed $50 for food and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other survivors were treated at hospitals and released  
to U.S. immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of Haitians and Cubans taking to the seas rose in  
1998, and authorities say they expect the trend to continue in 
1999. In 1998, Coast Guard vessels intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 
1,206 Haitians at sea, compared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre said he hopes to receive political asylum and settle in  
Delray Beach. His wife and four children are still in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love for them to come, but not in the boat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Dominates NCAA Women's Pairings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee, Purdue, Louisiana Tech and Connecticut received the  
top seeds Sunday in the NCAA women's basketball tournament, which 
has a decided Southeastern Conference flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight SEC teams made the field of 64, a record for one  
conference. That contingent is headed by Tennessee, the regular 
season and conference tournament champion and winner of the last 
three national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked Lady Vols (28-2) were made the No. 1 seed in  
the East Regional. They'll begin their quest for a fourth 
consecutive title and eighth overall against Appalachian State 
(14-14), the Southern Conference representative, at home on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Purdue (28-1) heads the bracket in the Midwest,  
third-ranked Louisiana Tech (26-2) is the top seed in the West and 
sixth-ranked Connecticut (27-4) is the No. 1 seed in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins at eight sites on Friday. The remaining  
first-round games are Saturday, also at eight sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The other SEC teams named to the field were Alabama, Auburn,  
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana State and Mississippi State. 
All are veterans of NCAA play except Mississippi State, which will 
be making its first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight teams from the SEC is a reflection of the parity from  
top to bottom,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. ``I think most 
folks would tell you that one through those top eight or nine ... 
you go into the arena knowing you have to play strong basketball to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut claimed a No. 1 seed after bouncing back from a rash  
of injuries at midseason, when the Huskies lost three of six games. 
They've won 12 of 13 since then, including an impressive three-game 
run through the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a late-season injury to All-American Nykesha Sales  
kept Connecticut from becoming a No. 1 seed. The Huskies had been a 
top seed in each of the four preceding years. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, a key injury cost Notre Dame, which had been expected  
to be among the top 16 seeds before losing point guard Niele Ivey 
to a season-ending knee injury in the Big East tournament. The 
eighth-ranked Irish, with their best record ever at 25-4, are the 
No. 5 seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to think (the injury) did have to be a factor,''  
said Bernadette McGlade, who chairs the selection committee. ``It 
occurred in a semifinal game. In the championship game, Notre Dame 
had a little bit of a different look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame committed 24 turnovers in a 96-75 loss to Connecticut  
in the tournament finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut meets St. Francis in the first round at home on  
Friday, Louisiana Tech plays host to Central Florida on Friday and 
Purdue entertains Oral Roberts on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brackets are arranged so that the Midwest Regional champion  
faces the West and the East winner meets the Mideast in the 
national semifinals in San Jose, Calif. That creates the 
possibility of a Tennessee-Louisiana Tech rematch in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee beat Tech 93-75 in last year's title game in Kansas  
City, Mo., to complete a 39-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC hit the NCAA jackpot after being ranked as the nation's  
No. 1 conference all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the SEC teams in the field finished .500 or below in the  
league. Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi State all went 7-7, while 
Florida was 6-8 -- the first team with a losing conference record to 
get an at-large bid. Florida is 19-13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nineteen wins in the SEC is a pretty good season most teams in  
the country would take,'' said McGlade, assistant commissioner of 
the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous years, the SEC has had as many as seven teams.  
McGlade said she did not think the committee was setting a 
dangerous precedent by picking so many teams from one league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee felt strongly that teams that got in from the  
top three or four conferences in the country were all teams that 
definitely were one of the best 64 in the country,'' she said. 
``That does not mean the SEC will forever get eight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 followed the SEC with  
five teams each in the NCAA field. The Big East, Big Ten, 
Conference USA and Pac-10 all had four. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong schedules helped two leagues that traditionally get only  
their tournament champion in the NCAA field land two berths this 
year. Maine made the field as an at-large entry after losing to 
Northeastern in the America East finals. Santa Clara made it from 
the West Coast Conference, which sent St. Mary's, Calif., as its 
automatic qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, UC Santa Barbara, which is ranked 17th in The  
Associated Press poll and has won 21 straight games, garnered only 
a No. 10 seed in the West. The Gauchos play in the Big West, which 
was ranked 17th among conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not have any opponents in the top 25 rankings or  
RPI,'' McGlade said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal State Northridge, winner of the Big Sky Conference  
tournament, made the NCAA field after a season that got off to a 
shocking start. The team's coach, Michael Abraham, resigned 
following his arrest in October on charges that he sold crack 
cocaine in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Frozena Jerro took over and guided the Matadors to a  
21-7 record. They're the No. 15 seed in the West and will play 
Colorado State on Friday.
