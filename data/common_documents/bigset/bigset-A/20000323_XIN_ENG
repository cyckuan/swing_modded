<HEADLINE> Indian City of Agra Greets Clinton With Tight  Security, Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the entire city resembled a military
garrison with armed para-military personnel guarding every nook
and corner to prevent any untoward incident during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from the scene that
only a few reporters were allowed to cover his visit to Taj Mahal,
one of the seven wonders of the world, leading to heated arguments
between journalists and officials.
</P>
<P>
The media personnel, most of whom were from New Delhi to cover
the event, were thoroughly frisked by U.S. security officials, PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
The tight security measures were taken following a bomb blast
on March 18 in a bus near city, in which a woman was killed and 16
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
The security was accompanied by noisy demonstrations by left
party activists who took on a march to Taj Mahal waving black
flags, holding placards and shouting anti-Clinton and anti-U.S.
slogans, PTI said, adding some of them were detained by the police.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the agency said, people in the city, known
for their hospitality, remained by and large cool to Clinton's
visit, a sharp contrast to their past enthusiastic response to
other world leaders including former Chinese Premier Zhou En Lai
and former Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted a old citizen in Agra as saying that when Zhou En
Lai came for a visit in 1955, people and school children
spontaneously lined up all along the entire route to the Taj to
give him a warm welcome.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests to Ukraine for Shooting at Turkish Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry Thursday
summoned Ukrainian Ambassador to Ankara Oleksandr Motsyk to protest
against Ukrainian coast guards who killed two fishermen when
opening fire on Turkish fishing boats in the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian coast guards on Wednesday shot at five Turkish
boats which they claimed were fishing in Ukrainian territorial
waters without getting permission, killing two fishermen and
sinking two boats.
</P>
<P>
Turkey asked Ukraine to take necessary measures to prevent re-
occurrence of similar incidents and guarantee compensation, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen's association of Turkey harshly reacted to the
incident. Staging a press conference, Ismet Yalcin, chairman of
Istanbul Fish Producers Association, said that when the Ukrainian
Coast Guard boats opened fire, the five Turkish fishing boats were
sailing nearly 110 miles south of Ukrainian shores.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the reason was, murder of a Turkish fisherman and fire
opened by coast guard boats can't suit principles of maritime,
modernity, and humanity. We condemn this attack," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zafer Murat Cetintas, advisor of the Association, accused
Ukraine of continuously polluting the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea
with its oil tankers and heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
He said that he couldn't understand the reason for Ukraine's
opening fire on fishing boats in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk paid his
first official visit to Turkey to expand bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turco-Ukraine relations recorded rapid progress after the former
republic of Soviet Union won independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Also, Ukraine is one of the countries that support Turkey's
initiative for the establishment of the Black Sea economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Menekse, chairman of the Marmara Fishermen's Cooperatives,
said that fire can't be opened on a ship in accordance with
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that he encountered a similar attack on March 13, 1991
in international waters, Sariyer Fishermen's Cooperative Chairman
Mehmet Sahin said their boat was riddled after the attack.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the maximum speed of the fishing boats can be 12
miles per hour, Sahin said the Ukrainian coast guard boats can
catch fishing boats without opening fire.

General Manager Antonio Castillo.

The Minister of Industry Juan Hurtado, who also is the chairman
of the Andean Community Commission, said that its members are
aware that their right is to face and consolidate the economy of
the region with efficiency, as well as to reduce the costs to be
more competitive and offer better advantages.
</P>
<P>
Andean Community General Secretary Sebastian Alegrett said that
this year expectations are centered on the growth of the economy
in the region, foreseen to be 2.3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health Ministry
said Thursday that the number of people who are suffering from
tuberculosis (TB) is on the increase despite of national efforts
to curb the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Although Ethiopia has implemented Direct Observation Treatments
(Dots) strategy recommended by the World Health Organization,
only 65 percent of the patients get cured, the ministry said in a
statement issued on the eve of the World TB Day to be observed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
TB has seriously affected citizens in the age group of 14-45
who could be instrumental in the nation building process, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were 250,000 TB patients in Ethiopia
by mid- 1999. Ethiopia launched Dots strategy in 1992 in a bid to
reduce TB cases.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Stress Support for Unity of Syrian, Lebanese Tracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid reiterated on Thursday the Arab support for and
adherence to the integrity of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with a visiting Hungarian
parliamentary delegation, Abdel-Meguid rejected Israel's attempts
to sap the organic unity of Syria and Lebanon, saying that such
attempts were doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which stations more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon as
peacekeepers, has decisive influence on Beirut. The two countries
agree not to separate their peace negotiations with Israel for the
return of occupied territories. But Israel has been striving to
drive a wedge between the northern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid voiced hope that the Geneva summit between Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and United States President Bill Clinton
on Sunday would lead to progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to press Israel into taking tangible steps to
withdraw to the June 4, 1967 borders. He underlined the support of
the Arab countries for the just Syrian and Lebanese demand for
Israeli pullback from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Syria's Golan in the 1967 Mideast War and set up
a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian parliamentary delegation is due to leave here on
Saturday for Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas in a
regional tour.

<HEADLINE> Texas Lawmakers Express Solidarity With Palestinians on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Showing support to the Middle East
peace process, 13 U.S. parliamentarians expressed on Thursday
solidarity with the Palestinian people on their rights to
Jerusalem, the Palestinian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Texas lawmakers expressed the attitude after a meeting with
three members of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the political situation and the status of
Jerusalem. The Palestinian legislators briefed their guests on
the "Israeli occupational measures" in the Holy City and stressed
the Arab nature of it as capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the Palestinian existance in the Holy
City was "original and deeply-rooted in the history" while the
Israeli existance in it has "an occupational and transient nature."
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to establish peace without the return of the
Holy City to full Palestinian sovereignty, the two sided said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side urged the U.S. parliamentarians to adopt a
more decisive stance towards Israel based on relevant resolutions
of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war. It declares that Jerusalem is the "indivisible and
eternal" capital of Israel while the Palestinians insists that East
Jerusalem would be the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is among the toughest issues to be
discussed in the final-status talks between the two sides, which
are expected to conclude in September.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress adopted a few years ago a resolution
recognizing Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem and urging the
government to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
However, U.S. President Bill Clinton postponed the implementation
of the decision.

be achieved by force, threats to scorch Lebanon, evasion from its
commitments or by devising crisis.
</P>
<P>
The security could only be brought about by a clear and honest
commitment to the peace march based on the land-for-peace principle
and the implementation of the United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242, 388 and 425, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
These resolutions call for Israeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan
Heights to the June 4, 1967 borders, immediate and unconditional
pullback from south Lebanon and the Western Bekaa and establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast War and
set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 allegely
to protect its northern areas from attack by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the pan-Arab forum strongly condemned Israel's
repeated aggressive operations on Lebanon, stressing the need to
put an end to such acts. The league is holding contacts with
influential powers in the region to press Israel into halting its
aggressive offensives, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that he discussed with Arafat the latest
developments of the Arab-Israeli peace process, especially on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Contacts will be maintained between the league and the
Palestinian National Authority in the coming phase to follow up the
efforts exerted to push forward the peace talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed cautious optimism for achieving a progress in the
peace march on the Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here earlier in the day after a two-day visit to
Egypt. He frequently visits Egypt to discuss with President Hosni
Mubarak the peace talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> FAO Stresses Food Security and Sustainable Development for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Thursday urged developing
countries to pay more attention to food security and achieve
sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf, the FAO chief, made the remarks at the 25th FAO
Regional Conference for the Near East, which is being held in
Beirut on March 20-24 and is attended by 29 countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the world cereal production in 1999 dropped
1 percent from 1998 to reach 1,872 million tons, which, for the
first time in four years, made cereal consumption exceed
production.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that at the end of 1999, 52 million people in 35
countries were faced with food emergencies resulting from natural
or human disasters.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, he added, the role of FAO, which aims
to alleviate malnutrition and hunger, and serves as a coordinating
agency for development programs in the whole range of food,
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
Referring to other "crises" facing world food industry, such as
mad cow disease and the presence of dioxin and listeria in the food
chain, Diouf said such "crisis" which occurred in developed
countries have created concern in developing countries which do not
have sufficient capacity of analysis.
</P>
<P>
The organization must respond to these challenges and its
concerned bodies are working to draft codes of conduct and
determine international standards for food security, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for agricultural development, the leader of the world's
biggest agricultural agency reiterated that developing countries
must improve the basis of sustainable development, especially water
policy.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, founded in 1945 and having 179 member countries and one
member organization, is the largest specialized agency in the
United Nations system and the leading agency for agriculture,
forestry, fisheries, and rural development.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Stresses Importance of Framework Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat highlighted here on Thursday the
importance of reaching a framework agreement on the final status
issues between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival from Cairo where he held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat termed the talks as "
important, positive and encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he and Mubarak dealt with the latest developments on
the Palestinian-Israeli track of peace in the light of the Israeli
redeployment in 6.1 percent of the West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
The talks had special significance as they preceded Mubarak's
visit to the United States, Arafat said. He spoke highly of the
Egyptian, European and U.S. efforts to push forward the talks on
the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks, which entered their
third day in Washington Thursday, focused on further Israeli
pullout from the Palestinian territories and the possibility of
reaching a framework accord before May.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides had failed to make substantial progress
so far, a Palestinian official said, urging the U.S. to play a more
effective role in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Strengthen Cooperation in United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United
States both said here Thursday that they agree to strengthen their
cooperation in the United Nations in order to make the world body
"more efficient and more responsive to the challenges of the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
The agreement was jointly announced by Sergey Lavrov, Russian
permanent representative to the United Nations, and Richard
Holbrooke, U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation and the United States agree to
intensify Russian-American cooperation in the United Nations in
order to promote broad agreement on practical ways and means to
support the reform process with the aim of making the United
Nations more efficient and more responsive to the challenges of
the new millennium," a brief joint statement, read by Lavrov to
the press here, said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation and the United States share an
obligation to encourage the United Nations to the greatest
possible effectiveness and efficiency, especially in maintaining
and enhancing international peace and security in accordance with
the U.N. Charter," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Our ministers asked their ambassadors in New York and their
respective ministries to work together with others towards this
end," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States are two of the five permanent
members with veto power on the 15-nation U.N. Security Council,
which, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary responsibility for
the maintenance of peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement came after the meeting in Lisbon early in
March between U.S. State of Secretary Madeleine Albright and
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was also released just before the Fifth
Committee of the General Assembly, which is in charge of
administrative and budgetary affairs, will begin discussion of the
U.N. reform issues, including finance and membership dues,
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both the ambassadors stopped short of giving detailed
explanation of the joint statement, saying that they will work
with other countries, including the other permanent members of
Security Council, on relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
"We're also going to work closely together with the other
members, P-5 (five permanent members of the Council) and other
countries," Holbrooke said. "What we are trying to do here is to
stimulate a much more intensive effort towards reform and with the
original founding member states take a leading role."
</P>
<P>
"I can't give you specifics now because we're still working
them out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lavrov said that the joint statement is "a general
statement of policy, and the details would be worked out not only
between our two countries, but with the participation of P-5, as
Ambassador Holbrooke said, and other members of the United Nations.
"
</P>
<P>
"As far as the budgetary reform is concerned, Russia is
prepared to negotiate resolution which will be a consensus
resolution," Lavrov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A consensus was being reached
Thursday among the European Union leaders as regards the
transformation of the 15-nation bloc into a more competitive
economy.
</P>
<P>
Maria Joao Rodrigues, advisor to Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres, said that the 15 EU member states agreed during
their first-day session to develop ambitious policies for the
information society, to carry out economic reforms, to go ahead
with the renovation of the European social model and to promote
macro-economic measures that ensure sustained development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Portugal that is holding the rotating EU
presidency, Rodrigues told the press that the 15 EU member states

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Attachment of DDR to U.N. Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday said the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process has become
an increasingly important component of the United Nations
peacekeeping operations and post-conflict peace-building
activities and urged their attachment to peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the United Nations Security
Council on the role of U.N. peacekeeping in DDR, Shen Guofang,
Chinese deputy permanent representative to the U.N., said the DDR
process should be included in relevant peace agreements from the
very beginning on a case-by-case basis and, at the same time,
overall planning should be made for this process.
</P>
<P>
The process involves political, economic, military, social and
other factors and the United nations should listen carefully to
and fully respect the opinions of all parties involved, especially
those of the governments concerned, and seek their support and
cooperation, Shen stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Without a relatively secure and stable environment, it would
be impossible for the United Nations to carry out disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration programs in coordination with
countries and parties concerned," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The conflicting parties should demonstrate the political will
for this process and maintain the cease-fire in real earnest, and
at the same time, the United Nations peace-keeping operations
should be put in place as soon as possible to help stabilize the
situation on the ground," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"When carrying out disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programs, the international community, including the
United Nations, must maintain an impartial and objective attitude,
enable all former combatants to be civilianized fully and
thoroughly or to be incorporated into regular national forces in
accordance with peace agreements," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The illicit arms flow has more often than not made effective
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration operations very
difficult to realize or drained off their achievements. Therefore,
parties concerned should put a grip on it and, more important, the
existing mechanism for arms embargo of the Security Council should
be strictly implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of disarmament, demobilization and integration is not
only something for the Security Council to discuss, but also
demands the participation and coordinated action of all relevant
United Nations bodies and the exchange of information and
communication among them.
</P>
<P>
Shen called on the international community and relevant U.N.
agencies to provide necessary contributions and appropriations for
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in a peace-keeping
environment.

<HEADLINE> Ruling PASOK Maintains Small Lead in Voter Preference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- With the April 9 national
elections drawing near, Greece's ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) has so far continued to maintain a marginal lead
over the country's main opposition New Democracy (ND), according
to the results of two opinion polls released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion poll, PASKO held a small 0.4 percentage point
lead over the ND, with the ruling party leading with 35.1 percent
followed closely by the ND with 34.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the MRB poll, which was conducted on March 7-17 on a sample
of 2,000 people, PASOK led with 34.5 percent over the ND with 34.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Premier Costas Simitis retained a comfortable
precedence over ND leader Costas Karamanlis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two polls showed that more than 50 percent of
the respondents believed that PASOK would win the coming
parliamentary elections, the 10th since the restoration of
democracy in Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos dissolved
the parliament, signaling the official start of the country's
election campaign, which is taking place mainly between the two
largest political parties in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The last parliamentary elections in Greece were held in
September 1996, with the ruling PASOK being re-elected by
obtaining 41.49 percent of the votes and getting 162 seats in the
300-member parliament.

<HEADLINE> France Regrets Increasing Violation of Truce in D.R.Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- France expressed strong regret
Thursday over what it called the increasing acts of violation of
the truce in the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo) by both
sides of the war.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan troops and Congolese rebels took last week from
government forces the city of Idumbe in Kasai province, 750
kilometers east of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government forces are making offensives in the
northwestern front in Equateur province and in the southern
province of Katanga against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"France is worried by the general reinforcement of the military
forces of the conflicting parties which seems to be a prelude to a
revival of fightings. It is also concerned about the declarations
of some rebel leaders that the truce is no longer in force," said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France also expressed concern about the difficulties being met
by the U.N. personnel who are in the D.R.Congo on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
"France appeals to all the parties of the conflict to meet
their commitment and especially to respect the truce, without
which the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force, the MONUC,
cannot take place," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She also appeals to all Congolese parties to engage in national
dialogue as is called for by the Lusaka agreement, and to
cooperate with the mediator appointed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), former Botswana President Quett Masire.
</P>
<P>
The D.R.Congo government and its ally countries signed with
Rwanda and Uganda, two countries which back the Congolese rebels,
a truce agreement last July in Lusaka, but the agreement has been
incessantly violated by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Minister Criticizes EU Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Finance Minister Heinz
Grasser, who is a member of the far-right Freedom Party, Thursday
accused the European Union of creating a situation of
discrimination between "good and bad" Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister, who is attending the two-day European
Union summit in Lisbon, said that Austrian students were paying
the price for the political sanctions by Austria's EU partners.
</P>
<P>
He said that Austrian students could no longer visit France and
that in his opinion the EU had opened "a breach" in the
fundamental treaty of the 15-nation bloc by not consulting the
Austrian government on the measures introduced.
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the bilateral political sanctions agreed
upon by the 14 EU member states to isolate Austria that swore in a
coalition government with Joerg Haider's ultra-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the Lisbon summit would mark the
beginning of a process to normalize bilateral relations between
his country and the other EU member states, especially France and
Belgium that have been publicly cold-shouldering Austrian
government officials since early February.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of the Freedom Party changing
its political make-up, a pre-condition set by Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres for the 14 EU member states to lift the
sanctions, the Austrian finance minister said that his party had
already given a "clear signal" on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He hinted at the facts that Haider has resigned from the
presidency of the Freedom Party and the Freedom Party has
expressed by signing the coalition government preamble its faith
in the democratic values and respect for human rights as required
by the Amsterdam Treaty of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the shift from the traditional "family
photo" of EU leaders to a group photo with EU leaders and the
visiting Mexican president, Grasser said that it was diplomatic
language.
</P>
<P>
The traditional EU "family photo" at the summit was substituted
by a group photo after French President Jacques Chirac and Belgian
Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt threatened to stay away from the
family photo opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Refutes U.S. Groundless Charges Against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai
has refuted United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
groundless charges and slanders against China's human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights here Thursday, Qiao said that the Chinese delegation
was obliged to exercise the right of reply to reject the
unwarranted accusations on China by Albright on the same day and
some other Western guest speakers since the session began on March
20.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along been committed to the promotion and
protection of human rights," he said. "In the past year, while
developing its economy and improving the people's living standard,
China has also attached great importance to the building and
perfection of democracy and legal system and the promotion and
protection of civil and political rights."
</P>
<P>
He told the session that various positive measures had been
adopted to enhance judicial transparency, law enforcement
supervision, the anti-corruption combat according to law and the
perfection of its democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
"China is now in the best historical period with regard to
human rights situation," the Chinese ambassador said. "The Chinese
constitution clearly stipulates that all Chinese citizens are
entitled to freedom of expression, assembly, association and
religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Under the protection of the constitution and other laws, Qiao
said, the Chinese people freely enjoy all these rights according
to law and there does not exist the question of persecution at all.
</P>
<P>
"The human rights of all the ethnic minorities, including the
Tibetan people, are also fully respected and protected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about "Falun Gong," Qiao said that the evil cult had
spread fallacies and endangered the life and health of the Chinese
people. The cult has already claimed the lives of more than 1,400
practitioners and innocent people.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental objective for the Chinese government to ban
this cult is to protect the human rights of all Chinese people,"
he said. "The United States, while severely crashing down cults at
home, has made irresponsible remarks on China's handling of evil
cult. This is completely out of the needs of domestic politics and
is a clear demonstration of double standards."
</P>
<P>
Citing the Chinese proverb "Do not do to others what you would
not have them do to you," Qiao said that the Chinese government
and people are firmly opposed to this kind of practice by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is used to pointing fingers at other
countries' human rights situation, but back in its own country,
there exist gross violations of human rights: notorious racial
discrimination, police brutality, torture in prison, infringement
on women's rights and campus gun killings," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A country like the United States with such poor human rights
record has no right to judge other countries' human rights
situation at the U.N. forum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador advised the United States to spend more
time to examine its own human rights situation instead of
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the
pretext of human rights. Otherwise, he said, it will end up with
lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.
</P>
<P>
He also told the United States not to bring the struggle
between U.S. parties to the U.N. forum in order to canvass votes
in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of Cuba, Iraq and Russia exercised their right of
reply to denounce the U.S. accusations against their respective
countries.

<HEADLINE> More Arrests Follow Assassination Attempt on Karabakh Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Police in Nagorno-Karabakh
Thursday arrested "numerous people" suspected of involvement in an
assassination attempt Wednesday on President Arkady Gukasian of
the self-proclaimed republic inside Azerbaijan, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after Wednesday's detention of former Karabakh
Defense Minister Samvel Babaian and some of his supporters shortly
after Gukasian, his driver and bodyguard were wounded in a
shooting in Stepanokert.
</P>
<P>
Babaian was dismissed last December due to a stand-off with the
Gukasian-led government, which accused Babaian of "defending
personal and clan interests, of resorting to all manner of methods
including provocation aimed at derailing the president's course
and demanding his resignation."
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnic Armenia enclave inside Azerbaijan.
Yerevan and Baku have been at odds over the status of Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Arms and ammunition have been found in the homes of some of the
28 people detained earlier, Interfax said, quoting an official of
Karabakh's Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
Gukasian, his driver and bodyguards have been whisked to
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor's Office said three bullets went through
Gukasian's leg, the driver suffered wounds to the head, kidney and
lungs, and the bodyguard was shot in the spine.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Gas, Transport Liberalization: Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- France, one of the two economic
growth engines of the European Union, was opposed to the
liberalization of gas and transport markets that may hinder the
adoption of a final conclusion of the Lisbon EU summit.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese news service Lusa quoted a French source as
saying that the insistence of some EU member states on opening the
French market was excessive.
</P>
<P>
"The French side does not hold this view," said the source who
was afraid that the competitiveness of the market would otherwise
have negative effects on the social dimension.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of the complete potential of a European area
without frontiers through the total liberalization of the energy,
transport and financial service sectors is considered to be one of
the keys to success of the economic reform being discussed by the
heads of state and government from the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The plan to further exploit the potential of the EU internal
market is popular with the national governments of Britain, Spain
and Portugal but was opposed to by France, where the state is ever
present in strategic domains of the economy or where public and
social service priorities are high.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders, prime ministers, foreign ministers and finance
ministers plus the French and Finnish presidents are trying to
look for solutions that allow the 15-nation bloc to imitate the
United States in the fight against unemployment and in the
qualification of work force for the knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
They are discussing the draft proposal worked out by Portugal,
that is holding the six-month rotating presidency of the European
Union, in order to outline a strategy that is expected to help
reverse the lag of Europe as against the United States in the
information society and in the IT industry that generate jobs as
well as wealth.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan Man Accused of Violating UN Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is investigating an
Irish- born citizen alleged to have provided supplies to the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
violation of the UN sanctions, Botswanan Foreign Minister Mompati
Merafhe said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Coghlan was named by British Foreign Affairs Minister of
State for Africa Peter Hain in February as an alleged buster
against the UN's arms, fuel, travel and diamond trade embargo on
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Hain said Coghlan allegedly owned a warehouse in Gaborone where
fuel and other supplies for UNITA were stored until they could be
flown to rebel camps in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Coghlan, who came to Botswana in 1978 and owns a road transport
and air charter company, has denied the allegations and threatened
to sue the British government for tarnishing his name.
</P>
<P>
"I have no dealing with UNITA and none whatsoever," Coghlan
said.
</P>
<P>
Coghlan claimed that there are many UNITA activists in southern
African countries and they are selling illicit diamonds for
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in 1993 banned sales of arms, military
equipment and fuel to UNITA, which has been at war with the
Angolan government since 1975.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were extended in 1997 to finance, travel and the
diamond trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) (C The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will start an eight-million U.S. dollars
regional food security training program on food policy, household
food security and poverty alleviation and food trade and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
Director of the training program Edward Chisala told the
Zimbabwe News Agency on Thursday that the program, to be started
in July, would improve the efficiency of organizations dealing
with food security.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "we want to emphasize that food security
begins at the household level.  Food security is also related to
poverty and its improvement will mean alleviating poverty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said most countries in Southern Africa were going through
economic changes that called for food management by other sectors
other than governments.
</P>
<P>
The training would focus on national and regional centers that
deal with food security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Food security in the SADC region is being threatened by
torrential rains induced by cyclone Eline that devastated parts of
Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe in February.

<HEADLINE> ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly Ends in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Song Li
</P>
<P>
ABUJA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians from African,
Caribbean, Pacific (ACP) and their European Union (EU)
counterparts Thursday ended their four-day meeting in Nigeria's
capital Abuja with a resolve to intensify their partnership
cooperation under new agreements to be signed in Fiji in June.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of the 30th ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly, the
ACP co- president Louis Clair said the new accords to replace the
25-year-old Lome I-IV convention that expired last month, would
elevate the age-long North- South cooperation to "new ways of
doing things" in the future.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement to be signed in Suva the Fijian capital on
June 4 would emphasize democracy, human rights and good governance
in the appropriation of the European development fund, on which
development projects are financed in ACP countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 billion U.S. dollars has been put into ACP countries
since 1975, but it seemed not to have benefited the people. That
is why there must be an emphasis shift, according to Clair.
</P>
<P>
"We are in support of efforts to alleviate poverty in
developing nations, especially, the 39 highest indebted countries,
but we cannot do it alone, this must be done in partnership," he
added.
</P>
<P>
With the trend on globalization and free trade, the
co-president said the ACP countries should try and promote trade
among themselves well beyond the current neglectable level.
</P>
<P>
He said enlargement of the European Union would bring new
opportunities to the ACP countries as the market for ACP products
would also be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 parliamentarians attended the assembly, which is the
largest international meeting hosted by Nigeria's civilian
government since it took over from the military last May.
</P>
<P>
In addition to delegates from the 86 ACP and EU member
countries, the Organization of African Unity, African Development
Bank, and other inter- governmental organizations also sent their
representatives to the meeting.

<P>
The 31st assembly takes places at the ACP-EU headquarters in

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Beefs Up Fire Fighting Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is beefing up effort
to put out wildfire in the Borena region bordering with Kenya, a
senior official of the Ministry of Agriculture said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters from the Ethiopian airforce and a spotter plane
offered by South Africa have begun reinforcing the ground fire
fighters in the Borena region where wild fires have been raging
since mid February, Tamirue Habte, spokesperson of the fire
fighting campaign, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement was made possible after the forest fires in
most places of the Bale region, some 400 kilometers south of the
capital Addis Ababa, were extinguished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia started aerial fire fighting operation about two weeks
ago in the Bale region where a national natural reserve is
situated in.
</P>
<P>
"Two Ethiopian helicopters and one South African spotter plan
have been involved in the battle against the bush fire from 6:00
am to 6:00 pm," Tamirue said.
</P>
<P>
The South African spotter plan is used for locating fire spots
and commanding the anti-fire operation in the air.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, tens of thousands of fire fighters
in the Borena region have been trying to put out the wild fire
with nothing but rakes, beaters and backpack water pumpers.
</P>
<P>
"We have been expecting more effective fire fighting tools from
the world community to put out the conflagration," Tamirue said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, in response to Ethiopia's appeal, South Africa,
Germany, the United States and Canada have either sent their fire
fighters and experts or fire fighting tools to the fire spots.
</P>
<P>
Referring to losses caused by the wild fires, Tamirue said
that Ethiopia had never experienced such big forest fire.
</P>
<P>
"We are mapping extent of the damage," he said. However, he
indicated that it would be difficult to make assessment of
ecological and psychological losses resulted from the wild fire
even if commercial ones were assessed.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Parliament Accepts President Bizimungu's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Parliament accepted the
resignation of President Pasteur Bizimungu at an extraordinary
session on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwanda News Agency report, 56 of 59
parliamentarians present at the meeting approved the president
resignation.
</P>
<P>
"I have resigned my post on March 23, 2000, as the President of
the Republic of Rwanda for my personal reasons," Bizimungu said in
his letter to the Speaker of the National Transitional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In another letter to the Vice President of Rwanda and chairman
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), Paul Kagame, Bizimungu said,
 "I have resigned from the leadership of the party as the vice
chairman and member of the National Executive Committee and the
Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
I tried my best to serve the movement (RPF) and the nation; I
therefore apologize for any mistake. I will continue to serve the
nation and the movement as an ordinary RPF member."
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu quit his post after accusing members of parliament of
having played a crucial role in the resignation of the former
Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigema and other cabinet ministers
for allegedly involving in corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament on Monday, Bizimungu said that
parliamentarians violated constitutional provisions by summoning
several members of the cabinet on charges of corruption committed
before the organic law that empowers parliament to control
government was passed.
</P>
<P>
According to an RPF official, Bizimungu threatened to resign
for the first time in last December, following the complaints by
Masaka residents in Kigali rural prefecture that they had been
illegally displaced by President Bizimungu in order to get enough
grazing land.
</P>
<P>
After RPF received a letter from Masaka residents calling for
protection of their rights, three RPF members were sent to the
President to settle the matter. The President was annoyed by the
act and threatened to resign. Top RPF leaders convinced him not to
do so.
</P>
<P>
According to the Arusha peace accord, the Speaker of the
National Transitional Assembly assumes the interim presidency
after the resignation of the President, and the parliament and
cabinet members will elect the new President from the two
candidates nominated by the RPF.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Chairperson of
 Rehabilitation and Prevention of Tuberculosis (Rapt) Christine
Nkomo Thursday said there was a marked increase in the number of
people suffering from TB, despite numerous awareness campaigns
being carried out in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of the commemoration of the World TB Day,
Nkomo said more than 50,000 cases were reported in the country
last year.
</P>
<P>
She said that "the other issue is that 70 percent of the people
who are suffering from TB are HIV positive."
</P>
<P>
The only way to reduce TB cases was to treat everyone that was
 suffering from the disease because it could be easily infect the
next person as it was an airborne disease.
</P>
<P>
However, it was disappointing to note that most TB patients did
not finish their treatment courses, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Most patients stop taking drugs after feeling better, but as
an association we are working on monitoring them as of now, we
have trained people who make follow-ups to make sure that
patients stick to their drugs,"
</P>

she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The donors community has decided
to give Uganda 800 million U.S. dollars this year to help
eradicate poverty in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of a five-day meeting of

<HEADLINE> Finally a "Family Photo" of EU Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Finally, a "family photo" of
European Union heads of state and government was taken Thursday,
but only with someone outside the 15-nation bloc making them line
up in front of camera lenses.
</P>
<P>
A family photo of EU heads of state and government is usual for
any of the union's special summits. But one had been deemed so
difficult for the Lisbon version of the special council in that
Austria's 14 EU partners have been boycotting the country
politically.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, one of the two presidents
attending the two-day summit Thursday and Friday in Lisbon, agreed
to take his place for a group photo of European Union leaders with
visiting Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on the margins of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
France and Belgium have been cold-shouldering Austria ever
since the coalition government with Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party swore into office in Austria on February 6.
</P>
<P>
Chirac earlier announced that he would stay away from the
traditional family photo with Austrian Prime Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel as continued protest against Vienna's coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who had also planned to
boycott the family photo, agreed to the arrangement by Portugal,
that is now holding the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-
nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel had asked the gathering of EU leaders to lift the
political ban on his country and hoped that the Lisbon summit
would mark the start of normalized relations between Vienna and
other EU capitals.
</P>
<P>
"I will explain our position and I hope that the path to
normalization can begin here," said Schuessel. "I don't expect a
final solution but I think that with my message a path toward
normalization will be opened during the next weeks and months."
</P>
<P>
Portuguese opposition leader Jose Manuel Durao Barroso told the
Austrian prime minister that he would do everything he could to
resolve the "lamentable" divisions in Europe's conservative
political family over Vienna's coalition with Haider's ultra-right
Freedom Party.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Council to View DDR as One Part of Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday urged the Security Council to view disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) as only one part of the
multifaceted approach in peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the Security Council on the role
of U.N. peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration, Annan said today's peacekeeping operations bears
little resemblance to its original character, they seek not only
to bring stability to areas of conflict, but also to address the
root causes of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"If peacekeeping operations are supporting DDR processes
efficiently, it is essential that provisions for DDR be integrated
into any peace agreement that is reached," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangements for disposal of arms and ammunition should be
decided as part of peace negotiations, so that the question of
what to do with the collected arms and ammunition does not
subsequently become a stumbling block," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also often essential that arms issues be considered in a
regional context. Prerequisites for a successful regional approach
include bilateral decisions to share intelligence and information,
cooperation by relevant regional organizations and continued
support from the Security Council," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Seoul Regards DPRK's Breach of Disputed Sea Line As Provocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Navy said Thursday
it will regard the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
vessels' entry into the Northern Limit Line (NLL) as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
If the DPRK Navy violates the NLL in the name of its rules on
access to the five -islands, "our armed forces will consider it a
provocation and will not tolerate it", the South Korean Navy said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As an apparent response to the DPRK Navy's announcement of six-
point rules restricting sea and air access to five islands in the
Yellow Sea, the South Korean Navy said the NLL is the practical
sea border line.
</P>
<P>
Not only the NLL has been maintained as the sea demarcation
line separating the South from the North since 1953 but it was
also provided for under the basic inter-Korean agreement concluded
in 1992, said the navy.
</P>
<P>
This position of the South Korean Navy was explicitly
manifested in a statement the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff
issued on September 3, 1999, the navy added.
</P>
<P>
The 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War did not demarcate
a sea border, often raising sovereignty disputes between the two
Koreas. The five islands -- Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonpyong
and Woo -- are scattered over 90 kilometers along the loosely
designated sea border off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula,
and they are situated closer to the DPRK side.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK People's Army General Staff unilaterally declared last
September its drawn demarcation line in the Yellow Sea, but the
South Korea refused it.
</P>
<P>
On June 15 last year, an inter-Korean military conflict
occurred in the NLL drawn in 1953 by the United States, with a
DPRK torpedo boat hit and sunken by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has never recognized the NLL since it was drawn.

A clash took place between Colonel Jean-Michel Mechain and
eight agents of the protection and security section (DPSD) of the
Defense Ministry when the former was followed on a street in the

Colonel Mechain was sent to hospital after being slightly

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Fail to Make Breakthrough in Talks on NTT Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States ended
three days of high-level deregulation talks Thursday, failing to
narrow their differences over the size of planned cuts in
interconnection fees charged by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. (NTT).
</P>
<P>
"I was briefed that the talks ended in failure because of
considerable gaps" over the telecom issue, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Mikio Aoki told a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day talks, Japan made a concession by
expressing its readiness to accelerate its plan to cut the
interconnection fees that NTT charges its competitors to access
the NTT's local circuits by 22.5 percent over four years, Japanese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The concession, however, did not satisfy the U.S., which has
been calling for a deeper cut.
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher told a press
conference after the talks that Japan "is proposing a policy that
would reduce the costs by too little over too long a period."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initially demanded an immediate 50 percent cut, but it
is now willing to allow Japan several years to cut the rate by
half.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side reportedly made a new proposal at the latest
talks, calling for a 22.5 percent cut in access charges over two
years and a more than 40 percent reduction thereafter.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Washington maintained that the NTT should be
able to achieve the reduction the U.S. is seeking through
streamlining efforts by NTT group companies, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But Tokyo would not agree to the cuts proposed by the U.S.,
saying such cuts would likely accompany hikes of basic charges
that the NTT levies on its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is also concerned that a sharp cut in interconnection
fees would affect the NTT's profits, resulting in cuts in the NTT'
s workforce.
</P>
<P>
Due to the failure to resolve the issue, Tokyo and Washington
may not be able to compile an updated bilateral deregulation
report by the March 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The issue may also develop into a major trade row between the
two countries ahead of the annual summit of the Group of Eight (G-
8) major countries to be held from July 21 to 23 in Okinawa
Prefecture, as Washington has expressed its intention to raise the
issue in the political arena, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Population Growth Hits Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's population stood at 126.68
million as of October 1 last year, up 200,000, or 0.16 percent
from a year earlier, the lowest increase since the end of World
War II, the Management and Coordination Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total, 126,686,000, consisted of 64,714,000 women and 61,
972,000 men, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Of Japan's 47 prefectures, Okinawa had the highest rate of
increase, while 23 prefectures, including Osaka and Kyoto, saw
their populations declining, with Akita Prefecture posting the
biggest decline in its population, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid aging of Japan's population, the number of
people aged 65 or over totaled 21.18 million, up 679,000 from a
year earlier. The number accounts for 16.7 percent of the
population, compared with 16.2 percent as of October 1, 1998, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of children under 14 dropped 316,000 to 18.74
million, accounting for only 14.8 percent of the population. It
was the first time that the number fell below 15 percent, the
agency added.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets British Parliamentarians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, here today told Ben
Chapman, chairman of the Britain-China Group of British parliament,
and other parliamentarians from the group that the frequent
exchanges between the two legislative bodies can further promote
bilateral state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain was among the first Western countries to
forge diplomatic ties with new China. After the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland, Sino-British relations entered a new era,
he pointed out, adding that high-level exchanges between the two
countries in recent years have promoted friendly cooperation in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
Inter-parliamentary exchanges constitute an important part of
inter-state relations, he said. The NPC and the British parliament
have enhanced their exchanges in recent years and both have played
an important role in their respective political and social lives,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and the British parliament should further their
contacts and cooperation so as to promote the relations between
the two countries in other fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that members from the group could get to
know China's reality through the visit and continue to play their
part as a bridge between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li also exchanged views with the guests on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Chapman said that the Britain-China Group, now with more than
150 members, is the largest group in the British parliament,
demonstrating the interest of British legislators in getting to
know more about China, a country which has scored rapid growth and
undergone changes. The best way to follow such changes, Chapman
noted, is to visit the country personally. He told Li the group is
ready to further their efforts to enhance mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Chapman and his group are here as guest of the NPC's China-
Britain Friendship Group.

Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, was
among those present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Combat Tuberculosis: Senior Health Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis claims 250,000 lives
each year in China, and is thus a major public health problem
hindering the country's social and economic development, according
to a senior Chinese health official.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Health Yin Dakui said here today a total of
six million tuberculosis (TB) patients make China the second
largest country in the world in terms of TB population, next only
to India.
</P>
<P>
Without effective measures, about 200 million to 300 million
healthy Chinese might be infected by tubercle bacillus in the next
decade, and one tenth of them might become TB patients, Yin warned
at a symposium on World TB Day, which falls tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The country's health care system is also confronted with other
TB-related issues, such as higher TB incidence in rural areas,
greater risk of a TB epidemic associated with HIV/AIDS, and drug
resistance cases as a result of irregular treatment.
</P>
<P>
Yin said that China suffers serious loss of work force each
year owing to the infectious disease, because 75 percent of TB
patients are between 15 and 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to work out medium and long-term plans for TB control
for the coming decade on the basis of a national epidemiological
survey to be completed this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Effective treatment recommended by the World Health
Organization will be introduced to more areas to curb the spread
of TB, he noted.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- So long as its own wheat industry
is not threatened, China allows the import of all kinds of wheat
from the United States, according to a government bulletin
published today.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin was issued in accordance with a Sino-U.S.
agreement on agricultural cooperation by the Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and the State Administration of Inspection of Import

</P>
<P>
The U.S. quarantine departments should inspect and quarantine
the wheat which is to be exported to China and should provide
quarantine certificates for the qualified batches, according to
the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The number of TCK spores in wheat imported from the US should
not surpass the number written in the Sino-US agreement, and
relevant research on TCK spores will be carried out between the
two countries to make the calculation of the number of such spores
more accurate, the bulletin said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Further Apply IT in Fighting Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Hong Kong
will make more efforts to crack on drugs with Internet technology,
Hong Kong Commissioner for Narcotics Clarie Lo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The application of IT is an integral part of the government's
drug preventive education programs," Lo said at a Rotary Club
luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is setting up a drug information resource center, to
be completed around 2001, to centralize all drug related
information in Hong Kong and to provide more support for
professionals and workers in the drug field, according to Lo.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition hall in the center will be equipped with state-of-
the-art technology, combining interactive displays, computer games
and video presentation to illustrate the harmful effects of drug
abuses and introduce Hong Kong's anti-drug work.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that these lively and interesting computer-
assisted interactive devices will make a more lasting impact on
the minds of visitors, especially young people who are our primary
target," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
The Narcotics Division has planned to revamp its Homepage by
strengthening the variety of interactive games to disseminate anti-
drug messages targeting at young people.
</P>
<P>
Plans are also in hand to establish a Homepage on the Internet
to facilitate on-line reports by members of the public on
suspicious transaction relating to money laundering and train
relevant personnel including those in the financial sector to
identify and react to suspicious transactions relating to money
laundering, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the drug dealing through Internet, Lo said a Task
Force on Psychotropic Substance Abuse to be formed will be looking
at ways to establish monitoring systems and the need to negotiate
with service providers and with the telecommunication and software
industries to develop a code of conduct on the treatment of drug-
related information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The task force, to comprise more than 26 members including
medical practitioners, social workers, academics, and law
enforcement agencies, will hold its first meeting in late April.
It will draw up a comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue," Lo
said.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Experiencing Third Turning Point: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said Thursday that Hong Kong was coming precisely across
the "third strategic inflection point" in its economic history,
referring to the knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was indeed facing a new major challenge now, and to
manage this change, "we should harness the potential of technology
to add value to our economic activities, and particularly
information technology, which holds the key to our future," Tung
said at the 40th anniversary dinner of the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries.
</P>
<P>
He urged businesses to reflect deeply on their established
business model, saying that "we need to be able to make productive
application of technology to add value to our businesses and to
make ourselves more competitive in the global business environment.
"
</P>
<P>
"This is not just for industries and big companies that can
obviously benefit from technology, but also in many of the more
traditional lines of business and medium and even small companies
as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Hong Kong industries would be able to
continue to respond effectively through the market and that their
shrewd business sense would help Hong Kong meet new challenges and
scale new heights.
</P>
<P>
Quoting British historian Arnold Toynbee's saying that "
civilizations rise or fall depending on whether they are able to
give the right responses to challenges under demanding conditions",
Tung said "this situation of challenge and response is clearly
where we, and in fact our competitors, are today."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong passed the first historical strategic inflection
point when its role as an entrepot to the Chinese Mainland
diminished in the 1950s. The second strategic inflection point was
passed in the late 1970s when land and labor costs became major
constraints for Hong Kong industries. Expansion of industrial base
into Southern China solved these problems.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that the government was committed to providing
the necessary support to industry to help them meet the challenges,
such as the 5 billion HKD (640,000 USD) Innovation and Technology
Fund and the Science Park, which had signed up three international
technology companies already.
</P>
<P>
"In the next few weeks, I am going to announce the appointments
to the Council of Advisers on Innovation and Technology and to the
Board of Directors of the Applied Science and Technology Institute,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Fears No U.S.-Iranian Rapprochement: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz stressed Thursday that Iraq does not fear any rapprochement
between the U.S., its arch enemy, and Iran, a long-term hostile
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The real purpose of the U.S. decision to improve relations with
Iran, said Aziz in an interview with Monte Carlo radio, is to
prolong the war between Iran and Iraq, aiming to cause more damage
to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called upon Iranian leaders not to be misled by the U.S.
scheme. Iraq and Iran fought for eight years in the 1980s before
reaching a ceasefire in 1988. About 1 million people from both
sides lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official was referring to remarks made by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who regretted U.S. support
for Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war as "shortsighted"
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused Albright of being "specialized at distorting facts
and telling lies." It has been known to all that the U.S. sold arms
to Iran in the so-called Irangate scandal, but nobody knows when
the U.S. supported Iraq against Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American-Iranian Council in Washington last
Friday, Albright announced the U.S. would ease sanctions against
Iran, allowing the purchase and import of Iran's goods such as
carpet, dried fruits, nuts and caviar. This move was seen as the
boldest attempt yet by the Clinton Administration to try to improve
relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has welcomed the move as "positive" and said that Tehran
would respond by importing U.S. grain and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed relations in 1980 following the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by fervent Iranian students
in the heydays of the Islamic revolution, which toppled the former
pro-U.S. shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
The two countries tuned down their hostilities against each
other after President Mohammad Khatami, who came to power in 1997,
called for people-to-people contacts to bring down the "wall of
mistrust".
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Iraq have remained strained. More
than a decade after the end of the war, they have yet to settle
issues related to prisoners of war, border demarcation and
reparations.
</P>
<P>
For years, the two Gulf neighbors have been trading accusations
against each other for harboring dissidents who are engaged in
terrorist activities, hampering the normalization of bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan not Backing Terrorism: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Thursday said that his government had
never been involved in terrorism in the Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during his press conference here when his
reaction was sought on U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement on
violence in the Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is visit India currently, in an recent interview
had said, "I believe that there are elements within the Pakistani
government that have supported those who engaged in violence in
Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, General Musharraf condemned the killing of 35
Sikhs in Indian-controlled Kashmir and demanded "high level
inquiry" into the incident so that India could not exploit it for
"a propaganda purpose".
</P>
<P>
He said there are strong evidences that Indian security
officials were "directly involved in the killing." "It might be a
move by India to divert world attention from the Indian repression
in occupied Kashmir," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen killed 35 Sikhs in a village in India-
controlled Kashmir on Monday night, just hours before Clinton's
visit to India.

"Science should not be imprisoned. There should be no barriers
in flow of science and technology," said Joshi during his meeting
here with the scientists, who are accompanying visiting U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
India and the United States signed an agreement here on Tuesday
on the establishment of an Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum,
which aims at promoting collaboration and exchanges between the
two countries in the field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Forum as a "fresh chapter" in science
collaboration between the two countries, Joshi said it would also
provide an independent platform to discuss thorny issues such as
the removal of technology sanctions imposed against India
following the country's nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Joshi also discussed with the U.S. scientists the potential for
collaboration in information technology, climate, clean energy and
ocean studies. The Indian side also expressed interest in
collaboration in the computer hardware sector.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, a non-governmental organization based in New
Delhi strongly criticized an Indo-U.S. pact on clean energy and
environment signed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact, the United States will provide an
assistance of 45 million U.S. dollars for India to develop clean
energy and water projects.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Science and Environment (CSE) criticized that
the pact would compel India to buy U.S. technology, which would
provide extra business for U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
"What they (the Americans) are saying effectively is to take a
little bit of money from us, buy our more efficient technology,
but we will take the credit for greenhouse gas reduction," said
the CSE in a statement.

company only said it may consider to compensate.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that many residents in the Futilla village near
the Malongo Oilfield have recently been found with symptoms
including vomiting, abdominal pain, throat burn and cough. Nine of
them, with high fever and short of breath, have been sent to the
capital city of Luanda for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary diagnosis indicated that they may have fallen ill
as a result of poisonous gas and oil-contaminated water and fish.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 barrels of crude oil were leaked from a CABGOC
offshore oil well early this January, throwing the surrounding
waters and coast area into serious pollution. The local
authorities had to close parts of the seabeach and ban the
fishermen from going out for fishing, leading to great economic
loss for the area.
</P>
<P>
It is said that oil pollution is a common occurrence in the
area, especially in the Futilla village, where many people have
been found to suffer from diarrhea, vomiting, skin inflammation
and cough.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with a production capacity of 750,000 barrels per day,
is the second largest oil producer in Africa, next to Nigeria. The
Cabinda province accounts for more than half of Angola's oil
production.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, oil exploration and production in Angola has
developed quickly due to the inflow of large amount of foreign
capital. However, environmentalists are becoming more and more
concerned over the pollution problem caused by these activities.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Food Aid Program in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
will spend 50 million U.S. dollars on food aid to hundreds of
thousands of people living in precarious circumstances in northern
Uganda in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The agency made the announcement in Kenya's capital Nairobi
Thursday at a crucial time as violent attacks by rebel groups in
the northern part of Uganda continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Ugandans have been forced out of their
homes and many of them have sought shelters and protection in
ad-hoc camps near urban centers, WFP said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything possible to ensure that food aid
continues to reach these people whose lives have been devastated
by senseless violence," said Burk Oberle, WFP Regional Manager for
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, an attack on Padibe camp, which were
hosting 30,000 internally displaced people and is 25 kilometers
north of Kitgum town, killed 12 people and injured 40 others,
with 400 homes burnt to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The violence is believed to have been carried out by the
Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist rebel group that has been
operating in the region for the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said it is currently feeding over 550,000
displaced people in Uganda, nearly 80 percent of them are living
in the north of the country and the remainders are based in the
southwestern district of Bundibudgyo.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing emergency assistance, WFP will focus
on setting up food-for-work and training programs in Uganda over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
These projects will give those displaced by violence and the
communities vulnerable to food shortage the skills and
opportunities to enhance their agricultural production and
economic development, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Probe Cult Mass Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Feng Jian
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that the government would set up a special commission of
inquiry to look into the March 17 mass suicide by cult members.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the State House here Thursday
afternoon, the president said the commission would have to submit
a comprehensive report on the matter within six months.
</P>
<P>
The government would, based on this report, work out plans to
restrict and uproot all cults endangering people's lives. he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reasons for the existence of the cult
Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God in Uganda,
Museveni attributed it to lack of education and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of education and unemployment make it possible for the
illiterate people in the rural areas to resort to cults when they
are sick," the president told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of economic development, especially
the industrialization process to Uganda, saying that this is the
only way to eliminate cults and cult activities from the country.
</P>
<P>
Some preventive measures would be taken in the short run and
security organs have been directed to arrest the cult leaders if
they are alive and still on the run, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Internal Affairs Minister Edward Rugumayo said
that a report by forensic experts would be ready on Thursday and
it would help establish the nature of the incident in which 530
people, including 78 children, died.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Donate More Aid to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been urged to
donate more fund to the Mozambicans who have been affected by the
recent devastating floods and are still living under threats of
more floods.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Uganda National Commission of PanAfrican
Movement here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Dean, chairman of the national commission, told reporters
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that his organization has
opened a bank account in Kampala to receive donations from
individuals or associations.
</P>
<P>
"On the first day of opening the account, we receive some
500,000 shillings (over 300 U.S. dollars) and more money is coming
in. We just want to lobby more support and send the fund to our
brothers in need in Mozambique," said Kintu Nyago, a prominent
member of the movement.
</P>
<P>
The movement appealed to the media to play a better role in
soliciting support for those affected by floods.
</P>
<P>
The National Commission of PanAfrican Movement was set up in
1994 and it has organized workshops, conferences and debates on
various topics and offered training courses.
</P>
<P>
The flooding in Mozambique has left tens of thousands of people
homeless and lack of basic medical services. Food reliefs and
other forms of support have poured into the country to help it
recover from the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Dismisses Pyongyang's Rules on Voyage to 5 Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea decided Thursday
evening to dismiss Pyongyang's latest rules on sea and air access
to five islands in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean decision was made at a working-level meeting
of the Defense Ministry, which said it will maintain by all means
the Northern Limit Line (NLL) as provided for under the basic
inter-Korean agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the Navy of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) announced a six-point order of the five islands in
the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Navy said if and when U.S. and South Korean military
and private vessels swerve from the designated routes, it would be
believed as an act to violate the DPRK's territorial waters and
sky.
</P>
<P>
The NLL was made in 1953 by the United States after the Korean
War and the DPRK is not allowed entry into disputed waters, but
Pyongyang has never accepted.
</P>
<P>
The disputed waters good for crab fishing saw an inter-Korean
naval battle during the crab-fishing season last June, in which a
DPRK torpedo boat was sunken.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the DPRK unilaterally announced its drawn sea
demarcation line south of the NLL.
</P>
<P>
The five islands are south of the NLL but north of the DPRK's
sea demarcation line.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean ministry viewed the DPRK Navy's announcement
of the order as a "plot to cause social chaos" in South Korea
before the April 13 general elections and the crab-fishing season
for South Korean fishermen in the disputed waters.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it "will not take any immediate military
countermeasures" but will keep a sharp eye on the DPRK's naval
movements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Observing Nuke Test Moratorium: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is observing the
moratorium on nuclear tests in compliance with the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a source in the Atomic Ministry press
service said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source, quoted by the Interfax news agency, was commenting
on western media reports about an underground test in Nevada and
an ensuing demonstration of protest in the Japanese city of
Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
"By all appearances, this was a non-nuclear explosion. As we
know, the U.S. is observing the test moratorium, which they
announced in September 1992. The work under way in Nevada does not
violate the CTBT because no nuclear energy is emitted in that kind
of test," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Russia, which is also observing a test
ban, carries out non-nuclear explosions too, adding, "their
primary aim is to ensure the safety of the nuclear stockpile which
is being used."
</P>
<P>
Russia conducted its latest non-nuclear explosion in the
northern Novaya Zemlya island in January 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Unity party, which threw
its weight behind Acting President Vladimir Putin, was officially

</P>
<P>
Russian Justice Minister Yuri Chaika Thursday gave Deputy

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Philippine Vice-Presidents Confer in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to develop long-
term, stable and good-neighborly relations of cooperation with the
Philippines and other member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence, Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao said here
today.
</P>
<P>
This constitutes an important component of China's independent
foreign policy of peace and is also a consistent policy, Hu said
in talks with Philippine Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that China and the Philippines are developing countries
in Asia, and in the circumstances of the accelerating process of
economic globalization and regional cooperation, the promotion of
consultation and cooperation as well as common development
conforms to the interests of the two countries and their peoples,
and is also conducive to regional peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
He praised Arroyo's contributions to promoting Sino-Philippine
relations, saying that through joint efforts, the two countries'
friendly cooperation in a variety of areas has been progressing
remarkably since their establishment of diplomatic relations 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 1996 visit to the
Philippines, Hu said that during the visit the leaders of the two
countries reached a consensus on establishing good-neighborly and
cooperative relations of mutual trust geared toward the 21st
century, thus defining the direction for the growth of bilateral
relation in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the Philippines not long
ago opened up a new chapter in bilateral relations, he said. (

On the Taiwan issue, Hu stressed that the Chinese Government
has consistently worked for a peaceful resolution of the issue;
however, peaceful reunification should be accomplished under the
prerequisite of the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will never allow anyone abandoning the one
China principle and going for any form of "independence" for
Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said that, because this year marks the 25th anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries, she was happy to have this opportunity to visit China
at this time.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' cooperation in various fields has been
developing smoothly, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Philippine government and people value
relations with China, and hope to further expand cooperation with
it in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated the Philippine government's one China
policy, which is the political basis for the establishment of
their diplomatic relations, saying that such a stand remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As a friendly neighbor of China, the Philippines offers
congratulations to China on its sustained economic growth, and
hopes to expand economic and trade cooperation with China, thus
contributing to common prosperity in the region, she said.
</P>

During the talks, Arroyo and Hu also briefed each other on the
domestic situations in their respective countries, and exchanged
views on issues of common concern.

SHANTOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The national tax officers in the
Chaoshan area of south China's Guangdong Province vowed here today
to crack down on local tax dodging.
</P>
<P>
Located on the coast, the Chaoshan area includes the cities of
Chaozhou, Shantou, Shanwei and Jieyang, where there is a thriving
market economy. But tax dodging is rife due to lax supervision.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation issued a notice at the
beginning of this year to strengthen tax work in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Provincial State Taxation Bureau has sent a group
to the Chaoshan area to help the work. Chen Liuming, director of
the bureau, called for effective measures to stop tax cheating.
</P>
<P>
He asked the officers to sort out and verify all ordinary value-
added taxpayers and weed out illegal manufacturers and those
issuing illegal value-added tax invoices.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that a computer software program would soon be in
operation to help the effort.

<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China has agreed to import
oranges from the US, as of March 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
In a joint notice made public today, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and the State Administration of Inspection for Import
and Export Commodities (AIIEC) agreed on orange imports from the
states of Texas, Arizona, Florida (currently confined only to the
seven counties of Indian River, St.Lucie, Martin, Palm Beach,
Collier, Hendry and Lee) and California (currently confined only
to the six counties of Fresno, Tulare, Kern, Madera, Ventura and
Monterey).
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, the oranges destined for China must

designated by both the AIIEC and the US Department of Agriculture
and under certain inspection requirements, details of which can be
found at http://WWW.ciq.gov.cn.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on the conclusion made by the Chinese
experts following their inspection of oranges from those areas to
evaluate the risk of pests entering the country, in line with
China's Law on Exit and Entry Quarantine of Animals and Plants and
related regulations, and agreements between the governments of
China and the US, the notice says.

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Announces Local Election Framework in  Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Thursday announced to hold local body
polls in December this year, while refusing to give any timeframe
for national and provincial elections.
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet thought about the holding of national and
provincial assemblies elections. These elections will be held
after the process of local bodies is completed," Musharraf said
while spelling out "a framework for devolution of power and
responsibility at the grass-roots levels" here.
</P>
<P>
According to Musharraf, union council elections at the village
level will be held from December this year to May, 2001 and
district-level elections will begin in July, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Following the local polls, elections for provincial assemblies
will be held and the National Assembly and Senate polls will be
ensuing, the general said.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who assumed the post of chief executive of
Pakistan after a bloodless coup in October last year, and his
government have long been under enormous pressure from inside and
outside to "return to democracy", that is, to hold the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
This issue is expected to be high on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's agenda when he visits Pakistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out the outline of the district and local government
plan, Musharraf said it will consist of three tiers namely
district councils, sub-district councils and union councils.
</P>
<P>
District and union council members will be elected through
direct elections and sub-district council members and members of
union councils through indirect elections.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said that the plan will realize the empowerment of
women by giving equal representations in all levels of bodies.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also announced lowering the voters' age by
three years, from the present 21 years to 18 years, to broaden
voting base and ensure maximum participation of the youth.
</P>
<P>
These elections, he said, will be held on a non-party basis.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf described local elections he envisaged as "a peaceful,
constructive, democratic, dynamic revolution whose sole objective
is to place in hands of the people the power to shape their own
destiny."
</P>
<P>
"The people themselves will become empowered to take charge of
the foundations of democracy and of the system by which they are
governed," he said.

<HEADLINE> TB Kills 60,000 in Bangladesh Every Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major
killer disease in Bangladesh, silently killing over 60,000 people
every year owing to poverty and people's ignorance of the health
hazard, said a United Nations Children's Fund report released
Thursday on the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"One in every 10 minutes dies of TB in Bangladesh, while one in
every 2 minutes get infected," said the report. In 1997,
Bangladesh accounted for 3.6 percent of the TB cases worldwide.
</P>
<P>
TB kills over 60,000 people in the country every year, the
report said, branding Bangladesh as the worst TB-affected country
in South Asia and the fourth worst-affected in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to recent estimates, there are 600,000 existing cases
of TB, with 300,000 new cases reported every year in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"The frightening state calls for comprehensive measures to
control TB in Bangladesh, which is a priority for the country and
even for the world," said the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis and its causes are closely linked to poverty. The
probability of becoming infected and developing clinical
conditions is associated with malnutrition, crowding, poor air
circulation, and poor sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Recent medical reports indicated that TB and HIV/AIDS support
and host each other, and when TB is correctly treated, the
incidence of HIV/AIDS is also automatically reduced.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Health and Family Welfare Minister Sheikh Fazlul
Karim Selim Thursday urged upon the world community to come
forward in combating TB and sought coordinated efforts of
development partners for overcoming the disease at a three-day
ministerial conference on "Tuberculosis and Sustainable
Development" held in Amsterdam, Holland.
</P>
<P>
National Tuberculosis Control program of Bangladesh has adopted
the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course method. Diagnosis and
treatment services are available in all health complexes free of
cost.

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Asks Clinton to Help for Kashmir Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Thursday said he will ask U.S. President
Bill Clinton to help for the peaceful solution of the thorny
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded press conference here, he said Kashmir is
a "cause of all strifes in the region" and peace and progress in
the region is possible only after a peaceful settlement of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, will request Clinton when he visits
Islamabad to play a role in peaceful solution of the Kashmir
dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to tell him clearly that peace can be brought
about in the region by addressing the issue which is bedeviling
the relations between India and Pakistan," the general said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he would "request the U.S. president to play
some role while remaining in the background for the solution of
the issue."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is on his Indian tour, is scheduled to visit
Pakistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said there are lot of things that he will discuss
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will tell Clinton "we are for peace. We want peace in
the region first of all. Because no progress is possible without
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the U.S.-India relations, he said, "American
relations with India are their own concern. We will not be
competing."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, will develop its own relations with the
United States on one-to-one basis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit to Bangladesh Opens Up New Vistas  for Bilateral Cooperation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton's just-
concluded visit to Bangladesh has opened up new vistas for
bilateral cooperation and raised the image and stature of
Bangladesh "immensely" in international relations, Foreign
Secretary C.M. Shafi Sami said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen on the outcome of the "historic visit" by
President Clinton, Shafi Sami said it was a "clear and positive
recognition" by the United States of the constructive and forward-
looking policies of the present government.
</P>
<P>
He said now that the visit is over, "the world community will,
no doubt, assess the visit from the importance that the United
States has attached to Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the invitation extended to Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina by President Clinton to visit the United States, Sami said
when materialized, Hasina's visit, expected to take place in
October, will be the "first official visit by a Bangladesh leader
on an invitation extended by a U.S. President in person."
</P>
<P>
On the question of raising ready-made garment export quota,
giving duty-free access of Bangladeshi goods to the U.S. market
and supporting Bangladeshi information technology industry, the
foreign secretary said Bangladesh received encouraging response
from the Americans in these fields.
</P>
<P>
The issue of regularizing undocumented Bangladeshis living in
the United States and deportation of the killers of Mujibur Rahman,
the first prime minister of Bangladesh, also received sympathetic
response from the U.S. president, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Chief of General Staff to Visit NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Chief of General Staff
Anatoly Kvashnin will visit NATO headquarters in Brussels in May
to discuss the situation in Kosovo, a top Defense Ministry
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin is expected to arrive in Brussels on May 10, when the
Council of NATO Chiefs of Staff convene, Leonid Ivashov, head of
the Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation
Department, was quoted by Interfax as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue Kvashnin is expected to raise in Brussels is
the situation in Kosovo," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian Defense Ministry considers the current
situation favorable for cooperation between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
"What NATO is on March 23, 2000, is much better than what it
was on March 24, 1999."
</P>
<P>
NATO launched massive air strikes against Yugoslavia on March
24, 1999, prompting Moscow to freeze all military ties with the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia's latest contacts with NATO have demonstrated that not
everything is that simple with NATO, although on the whole Russia
is being increasingly involved in the European security process,
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
"We could not have dismissed this chance for 'unfreezing'
relations with the alliance," he said, adding that "further
relations with NATO will largely depend on NATO itself."
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his positive comments on Russia-NATO ties,
Ivashov Wednesday played down the thawing of relations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the two sides are only "at the beginning of
the path" toward the full restoration of relations and that
promotion of the relations depends on NATO's readiness for a
dialogue with Russia on equal terms.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov also said it is premature to talk about opening any
NATO mission in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The time has not yet come to open a NATO military
communications mission and information office in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
Russia's acting President Vladimir Putin caused a stir when he
indicated in an interview with BBC television earlier this month
that Russia could join NATO if Moscow were treated as an equal
partner. But Moscow then backtracked by saying that Putin was
speaking on hypothetical basis.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov announced Thursday that Russia is considering the
possibility of setting up a base for the repair and maintenance of
the Russian military equipment used in the Kosovo peacekeeping
operation. But he added that "there are no plans for setting up a
Russian military base in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"If this issue ever does come up, it will be handled by Moscow
and Belgrade on a bilateral basis with due account taken of
international norms and principles," he said.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle United Replace Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Newcastle United sacked chief executive Freddie Fletcher on
Thursday with the finance director for north-east rivals
Sunderland taking the position.
</P>
<P>
David Stonehouse will take over on April 3 after the latest
boardroom ruction at the premier league club.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reuters report, Fletcher assumed Newcastle's
executive chairman duties after the acrimonious resignation of the
club's chairman in December 1998 and two months ago a board
restructuring left him to focus on media rights and new business
development.
</P>
<P>
His surprise departure may be linked to fan power after this
month's bitter court battle with supporters over Newcastle's plans
to move them from their regular seats to make way for a corporate
hospitality area.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle have dragged themselves from the bottom of the league
since Bobby Robson took over as manager from Ruud Gullit, who
resigned in August.
</P>
<P>
But scars still remain from the furore surrounding directors
Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd after they made disparaging
remarks about fans in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hall and Shepherd, who control a majority of the company's
shares, resigned as directors in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Denis Cassidy quit as Newcastle chairman in December 1998
along with two fellow executives after Hall and Shepherd were
restored to the board. The company's stockbrokers resigned at the
same stage.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland Plc said in due course it would appoint a
replacement for Stonehouse, who joined in 1996 and was involved in
bringing Sunderland to flotation on London's Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland have enjoyed a good season after being promoted to
the premier league and are currently in eighth place, ahead of
Newcastle in 11th.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle also said on Thursday that Les Wheatley, chief
operating officer and finance director, had resigned and would
take up the position of finance director at Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Cable company NTL announced in December it had taken a 9.8
percent stake in Newcastle after giving the club a 25 million
pound (39.43 million dollars) cash injection.

JINAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of coastal
Shandong Province in east China will invest 25 billion yuan to
renovate its old urban areas over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.4 million square meters of rundown houses will be
demolished, and nearly eight million square meters of new housing
will be put up.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to develop stores, tourist and
recreational facilities, and public facilities in the city.
</P>
<P>
This will provide good opportunities for real estate developers.
Statistics show that the city now has only 38 real estate
development companies, which is hardly enough to cater to the
demand of a renewed urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said that all large real estate projects will
be carried out through bidding.

NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is confronting a severe
water shortage as state reservoirs are nearly 85 percent empty with
only 40 million cubic meters of water behind the dams, local media
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the drought in its fifth straight year, Cyprus has urged an
complete of the Larnaca desalination plant, at the southern coast
of the island, by December this year, four months earlier than the
original date set in the contract with Israel, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will pay more money in return, it added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Cyprus government is trying to make the Dhekelia
desalination plant at Cyprus' southeast coast, currently the
island's sole such facility, desalt an extra 10,000 to 20,000 cubic
metres of water a day.
</P>
<P>
The Dhekelia plant, currently operating at maximum output,
desalts 40,000 cubic metres of water daily.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government is considering a Greek offer to ship
free fresh water to Cyprus from Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has got mere 254 millimeters of precipitation since
October 1999, only half of the normal figure in a rainy season.

<HEADLINE> Three Filipino Drivers Meted Death for Drug  Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Three Filipino drivers were meted
death sentence Thursday by a regional court here in Metro Manila
for drug trafficking, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Quezon City Regional Trial Court handed down
the decision against the three drivers who are aged 48, 39 and 21
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that all the accused were in one car and each had a
role in the consummation of the transaction proves that they had a
community of design," Quezon City Judge ose Mendoza said in his
nine-page decision.
</P>
<P>
The three were found guilty for violation of the Dangerous
Drugs Law for an unlawful sale of 634 grams of pseudoepherine
hydrochloride, a regulated drug.
</P>
<P>
The said drug is a raw material used for the preparation of
methamphetamine hydrochloride known as "shabu."
</P>
<P>
Under the Dangerous Drugs Law, the allowed therapeutic dose for
pseudoepherine is 15 to 120 milligram only and if it is far beyond
therapeutic requirements, the penalty is death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Court records showed that on September 22, 1998, the three
accused were nabbed by the Philippine National Police Narcotics
Group in a buy-bust operation for selling the 634 grams of
pseudoepherine hydrochloride.

<TEXT>
<P>
Companies from the two countries signed 11 business agreements
which include four in the IT sector, three in environment, three
in power and one in tourism area.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, visiting United States
Commerce Secretary William Delay said U.S. firms were very eager
to enter into agreements and do business with their Indian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"We are also willing to provide our experience and expertise to
the Indian companies," Delay said, adding the on-going visit of
President Bill Clinton provided a rich opportunity to promote
American commercial interest in India and the agreements signed
here today were a "win-win" situation for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Delay said implicitly that Washington would not lift
its economic sanctions against India imposed after its nuclear
tests in May 1998 before New Delhi signs the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
However, Delay asked the Indian government to take steps to
increase import from the United States so as to reverse the trade
balance between the two countries which was heavily in New Delhi's
favor.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that India's exports to the U.S.
amounted to over nine billion U.S. dollars last year while imports
from the U.S. was only 3.7 billion dollars, with a balance of more
than 5.3 billion dollars in India's favor.

<HEADLINE> India to Allow 100 Pct Foreign Direct Investment in  Oil Refining Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This decision was included in an inter-ministerial report
dubbed Hydrocarbon Vision 2025, which was submitted to Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee here on Thursday by Petroleum
Minister Ram Naik. The document will work as a policy spectrum for
the country's oil sector in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The current government ceiling for FDI in the oil refining
sector was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Hydrocarbon Vision 2025, the government will also
merge standalone oil refineries in the public sector with the
petroleum marketing companies as it will be difficult for the
former to survive in the liberalized oil scenario from 2002
onwards, said Ram Naik.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he would place the report before the Parliament
during its current session for necessary approval.
</P>
<P>
The Vision report, finalized by the ministerial group headed by
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, also recommended existing
subsidies be phased out over three to five years and an expert
group be set up to determine levels of tariffs and duties for
implementation in a phased manner, said Petroleum Secretary Dr.S
Narayan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministerial group recommended disinvestment in
a phased manner in oil PSUs in appropriate levels to realize
maximum shareholders value, but did not elaborate on the extent of
disinvestment.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested deregulation of overseas exploration and
production by Indian oil companies, he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Stop Dumping of U.S. Chicken Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Chamber of
Agriculture and Food Inc. (CAFI) urged the government Thursday to
stop the United States bid to dispose of its excess chicken parts
production by dumping them at low prices in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
CAFI said in a report that the government should only allow
whole chicken, instead of just broiler parts, to get in, so that
local products can become price competitive against imported ones.
</P>
<P>
The food chamber made the plea that measures should be taken
immediately, to avert the collapse of the 200-billion-peso (5-
billion-U.S. dollar) poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
Citing market intelligence reports, CAFI said American poultry
raisers had managed to dump some 31,899 metric tons of broiler
parts into the Philippines last year at an average price of 23
pesos (0.57 dollars) per kilo.
</P>
<P>
Last year's volume was 1,058 percent more than the 2,753 metric
tons dumped in 1998, CAFI said, adding that this rate of increase
even eclipsed the 895 percent growth rate of U.S. broiler parts
registered in Ukraine, the 388 percent in South Korea in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The huge volume sold at extremely low price -- half the 50
pesos (1.25 dollars) per kilo domestic chicken production cost --
has adversely affected thousands of poultry growers so much that a
number of them are now contemplating of shutting down their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Other allied industries supplying requirements for poultry
raisers, including feed millers, veterinary products manufacturers,
transport workers, among others, are also feeling the crunch, CAFI
said.
</P>
<P>
"All these has got to stop. The government has to move fast.
Otherwise, hundreds of our member firms, not to mention
independent poultry raisers, will be forced to close down their
operation," CAFI added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Spends Huge Expenditure on Rail  Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar government has spent a
huge expenditure on rail transportation, buying in various railway
facilities from at least three countries in an effort to better
its rail transportation performance.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the local Myanmar Times
journal, state-run Myanmar Railways (MR) recently purchased from
France diesel electric engines at a cost of 440 million francs (65
million U.S.dollars) and from Yugoslavia 402 new goods-wagons and
spare parts worth 28 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The MR is planning to put them to use to schedule more express
freight trains.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the MR has also imported from China 120 million
dollars worth of rails, locomotives, coaches, heavy machinery,
wireless transmission sets, signal equipment and spare parts which
are used to upgrade the country's rail transportation equipment
and services, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the country's financial, economic and
social conditions, the MR has been carrying out transport services
with 279 diesel locomotives, 41 steam locomotives, 679 carriages
and 3,339 wagons.
</P>
<P>
Express passenger and cargo services are being undertaken on
Yangon-Mandalay route and Mandalay-Myitkyina route, the two major
railroads linking the country's northern and southern parts, in
collaboration with private entrepreneurs on contractual basis and
short distance rail transport services are carried out by rail
buses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that since 1988, Myanmar has built 1,
590.4 kilometers (km) of railroads and the distance has extended
to 6,058.4 km in 1999 from 4,468 km in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The country is currently engaged in extending its railroad
network still further.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Religious Followers to Observe Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has appealed to followers of all religions to observe laws of the
country to avoid calamities like the one took place in Uganda
recently which killed more than 300 people.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Thursday quoted Permanent Secretary of
Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs Bernard Mchomvu as saying that
the right to worship is a constitutional one for all Tanzanians,
but the freedom has to be exercised within the parameters of the
law.
</P>
<P>
The government will not tolerate groups whose activities
threaten peace and tranquility or are antagonistic, said Mchomvu,
who is also Registrar of Societies, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that worshippers who pray naked or those who refuse
to take the sick to hospital, refuse to enroll their children to
school and those using abusive language, will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
According to Mchomvu, the number of registered and unregistered
 religious groups in Tanzania have been on the increase since
1998.
</P>
<P>
Between 1998 and this year, the ministry has received 32
applications from various religious sects seeking registration, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Out of them, 22 were registered and five were refused and seven
were deregisterd, he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the mushrooming of religious sects to external
influences from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons include the struggle for positions and the
scramble for money by religious leaders, while some just want to
be worshipped and seek to form their own groups, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- About 50 people were killed on
Wednesday by raging fire following an alleged vandalization at a
site of the pipeline of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC) in the Abia state of eastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Charred bodies of the victims, burnt cans, bicycles and
motorcycles were seen at the scene, reminding people of the 1998
pipeline fire in Delta State, which killed about 1,000 people,
according to The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Amgbala, a regional commander of the fire fighters,
was quoted as saying that his men had already exhausted their fire
fighting materials without extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
He said that 28 suspected vandals have been arraigned in court
while 17 others are still being interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Items recovered from the suspects include oil tanker vehicles,
mini buses, pumping machines, motorcycles, bicycles and heavy
jerry cans filled with fuel.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the intermittent fuel scarcity in the southeastern
states on the "persistent vandalization of NNPC oil pipelines in
the zone."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to traditional rulers and community leaders to
co-operate with law enforcement agents by enlightening the people
on the dangers inherent in such acts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Economic Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has launched an economic blueprint with a target to
increase Gross Domestic Product growth rate from the present 2.4
percent to 10 percent by the year 2003, leading Nigerian newspaper
The Guardian reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo unfolded the macro-economic policies of his
administration Wednesday in the capital Abuja at the opening of
the meeting of the Federal Executive Council, the highest
policy-making body of the government, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, which entitled: Nigerian Economic
Policy, 1999-2003, the Obasanjo's government would achieve by 2003
the targets, among others, the rise of the employment rate from 50
percent to 70 percent, the reduction of inflation rate to single
digit, the improvement of the electricity provision from 34
percent to 60 percent, the rise of literacy level from 57 percent
to 80 percent, and an easier access to telephone and water.
</P>
<P>
While elaborating the measures to achieve the macro-economic
goals, Obasanjo stressed that his government would take every
measure to improve the workings of the joint venture technical
committees, pledging to increase local involvement in those
sectors current dominated by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
On macro-economic policies, Obasanjo said the government would
pursue stability in the price and exchange rate, ensure a healthy
balance of payments and allow interest rate to support the real
sector.
</P>
<P>
 He also give the highest priority to the agriculture both for
poverty reduction in the rural areas and improvement of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said his government, when inaugurated last May,
inherited an economy that reflected declining capacity utilization
in the real sector, poor performance of major infrastructure,
large budget deficit, rising level of unemployment and inflation.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the guiding principle of his
government's economic thrusts would revolve around the people
because "the economy belongs to the people", stressing that the
economy "shall also be technology-driven, broad-based, humane,
open and internationally significant".
</P>
<P>
The objective of the policies was aimed to revive Nigeria's
ailing economy, significantly raise the standard of living of the
people, put Nigerians back to gainful work and create new
employment opportunities, said he.

<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Obasanjo administration
Wednesday rejected a proposal for convening a sovereign national
conference to decide upon the validity of the sticky issues
including the introduction of Islamic Law Sharia
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Dapo Sarumi was quoted as saying by the
Daily Times, a major Nigerian newspaper published Thursday, after
a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He said: "the Federal Executive Council has no legislative
powers to summon a Sovereign National Conference, it is the
National Assembly that has the powers to do that. We took an oath
to defend the constitution and there is no place in the
constitution where we are empowered to summon a Sovereign National
Conference."
</P>
<P>
But he added it would be in the best interest of the nation to
remain a strong and united country.
</P>
<P>
The proposed conference had been quite a focus of Nigerian
media recently. Many people and organizations, especially in the
South of the country, had said such a forum was the only way to
find ways out of the country's multi-faceted problems.
</P>
<P>
But others said such a conference would go no where but to the
weakening of the federal government and further conflicts between
the states.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Premier Assures Austria's Participation in EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Premier Antonio
Guterres assured Austria's full participation in the two-day
European Union summit beginning here Thursday but reaffirmed the
political sanctions imposed on Vienna by its 14 EU partners for
including the far-right party into the government.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of
the 15-nation bloc, said he planned to avoid debate on the issue
of Austria during the summit, though Austrian Prime Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel would try to use an official dinner to be
hosted by Portugal Thursday for the heads of state and government
of EU member states to appeal for a lifting of the freeze on
bilateral political relations.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners have been boycotting the country
politically since the swear-in of the Austrian coalition on
February 6. France and Belgium have time and again cold-shouldered
Austria on official occasions even though the European Commission,
the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said that the bilateral
freeze would not affect the business of the EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of extreme rightist Joerg Haider's Freedom Party
into the Austrian coalition government stirred up a furor across
the EU member states, of which some are fearful of a possible rise
to state power of ultra-rightists in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The Lisbon summit is not about Austria but about employment,
Guterres said before the summit kicked off to focus on issues of
employment, structural reforms, social cohesion, common European
security and defense policy, inter-governmental conference and the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The EU is scheduled to sign a trade pact with Mexico that is
expected to cut tariffs on 95 percent of two-way trade when coming
into effect on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Mexico trade pact will give EU manufacturers and
producers almost as much access to the Mexican market as their
United States counterparts under the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Russia Refuses to Send Police to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday rejected a U.N.
request to send a special police force to Kosovo in protest of the
body's inability to check the negative trends in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
"The entire responsibility for the unsatisfactory state of
security of the local population, for the failure to put an end to
ethnic clashes, and for the growing crime rate fully rests on the
current leadership of the U.N. mission in Kosovo," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It voiced serious concern that "the negative trends in Kosovo
have gone too far; the security of the non-Albanian population is
steadily worsening; the activity of Kosovo terrorists and criminal
groups is increasing."
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of the U.N. mission in Kosovo and KFOR (the NATO-
led multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo) do not fully
utilize the powers granted them by U.N. Security Council
resolution 1244 and the means at their disposal to stabilize the
situation in Kosovo," the Interfax news agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow was surprised "about the stance of the U.N. Secretariat
and leadership of the mission in Kosovo on the speedy deployment
of an international police force in the area," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they regularly point to the acute police
force insufficiency, on the other they have been obstructing for
several months and under various pretexts the arrival of Russian
Interior Ministry officials for operations with the mission police,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In this situation we are forced to rescind our agreement with
the U.N. request to send a Russian special police unit to Kosovo,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
on Thursday reiterated Moscow's threat to withdraw its
peacekeepers from Kosovo if developments there "unfold according
to a worst-case scenario."
</P>
<P>
Russia has some 3,600 peacekeepers stationed in Kosovo as part
of the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation worsens and the question of separating
Kosovo from Yugoslavia looks likely, Russia will not share the
responsibility for these developments with the countries that
encourage them," Ivanov said in an interview with the RTR
television station.

HOHHOT, March 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region last year was the recipient of five
international aid programs, worth a total of 14.6 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional department of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, the aid programs are mainly concerned with
the region's medical care, disaster relief and special education
for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The five aid programs are sponsored by Japan, Germany and

HARBIN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Yang Guiju was delighted to hear

<P>
From today on, Yang and 39 other women who had also lost their
old jobs will work for the Lactation Company, the first of its
kind in the province to help women who have just given birth get
through the breast-feeding period.
</P>
<P>
Geng Danzhu, founder of the company, who is also the chief of a
local community service center, said that with the development of
the economy, people require more convenient and classified service
items. The main purpose of the Lactation Company is to provide
mothers and infants with services ranging from washing nappies to

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Quality of Museum Exhibitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China has chosen the annual ten-
top exhibitions among museums nationwide for 1999 in a bid to
better display the country's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
At an award ceremony for this year's best exhibitions today,
Zheng Xinmiao, deputy director of the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage, said, "Most of the museums are striving to
streamline their management and raise the quality of exhibitions."
</P>
<P>
The ancient tomb show in Mancheng in north Hebei Province, and
the nine others were chosen out of 45 entries.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on the exhibitions' artistic and academic value,
the awarded museums also have installed advanced equipment such as
ultraviolet glass shields and optical fibers for lighting in an
effort to protect the valuable cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
"The museums use their well-prepared exhibitions to attract
visitors and make profits," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
The newly built exhibition hall of the Nanjing Museum combines
outer architectural style with exhibits, showing Nanjing's charm
as a well-known ancient Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palace Museum specially schemed the packaging
art exhibition, introducing treasured packaged articles in the
imperial court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Visitors could also view nomadic life of northern ethnic groups
from the ancient cliff pictures inscribed in the mountains of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tibet Museum and Sichuan Museum both arranged
unique shows featuring their local customs.
</P>
<P>
Zheng's administration hopes Chinese people will learn and
enjoy these museums.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the country's relics protection
departments administer more than 1,300 museums housing over nine
million relics, and some 90 million people visit over 7,000
exhibitions last year.
</P>
<P>
The administration plans to increase the total number of
museums to 3,000 in 15 years, with at least one in every medium-
sized city.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's first group of 26
graduate students majoring in Peking Opera performance will make
their debut tomorrow at Beijing's Chang'an Theater.
</P>
<P>
They will perform there from March 24 to 30, the Beijing Youth

<P>
During their three-year campus life at Chinese Opera Institute,

</P>
<P>
Their mentors said the graduates' artistic level was greatly

</P>
<P>
Peking Opera had long pursued the tradition of one-to-one
teaching, which limited the number of skilled trainees.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Insurers Optimistic About Chinese Market on Eve of WTO Entry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials of many overseas-
funded insurance companies are making optimistic predictions about
the market in China on the eve of the country's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We are very lucky to be here earlier than many others," said
Joseph Sin, president of AXA-Minmetals Assurance Co., Ltd., a Sino-
French joint venture insurance firm in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
More overseas insurers are expected to be allowed to enter the
Chinese market, which will trigger fiercer competition, he said.
But, he stressed, "No competition, no development. This is the
consensus for all insurers here," he said.
</P>
<P>
His company was set up in Shanghai in June 1999 and became the
ninth overseas insurer in this largest metropolis and financial
center in China. The company's business has been improving
gradually, with the number of salesmen increasing to almost 1,000,
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Local experts have also expressed confidence in the insurance
market after WTO entry. "After China becomes a WTO member, the
country will have to speed up the pace of opening up the local
insurance market," said Xu Wenhu, a professor and deputy director
of the Fudan University International Insurance Institute.
</P>
<P>
Xu said more insurance companies and products are expected to
appear in the country, and he predicted that the local insurance
market will experience even greater competition.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was the first city in China to open its market to
overseas insurers. Since 1992, when the U.S. International
Assurance Co., Ltd. opened for business in the city, nine overseas
insurance firms have joined in the market competition here.  (

<HEADLINE> Overseas Insurers Optimistic About Chinese Market on Eve of WTO Entry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseas insurers, who now hold only on-tenth of the local
market share in Shanghai, have introduced their mature skills,
advanced concepts, sound service, and standard management to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the post-WTO-entry era, overseas insurance
firms here are quite optimistic, saying that they believe the
Chinese government will gradually relax its control on the scope
and form of business allowed for overseas insurance companies, and
are of the opinion that there will be greater room for overseas
insurers to develop in China.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for the days after China is admitted into the
WTO," Dick Wan, vice president of AXA Minmetals, said, adding that
"We plan to open branches in other cities."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, overseas-funded insurance companies
have been quite successful in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Hong Life Insurance, a Sino-Canadian joint venture with
Canada-based Manulife Financial Group, has been doing a brisk
business ever since it opened four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing better than any other Manulife branches in the
world," said general manager Chen Bingen. Chen disclosed that his
company is working on some new products in order to meet the
forthcoming competition in China after its WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
And many companies still outsiders to the Chinese market are
now working to take a slice of the insurance business in the
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Yide, Shanghai representative of New York Life
International, Inc., said his company has handed over its
application and is still waiting for a reply. "We do hope to take
an upper hand in the competition," said Qiao, who could not help
revealing his anxiety.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Prices Down 5.1 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices of Hong Kong in
overall terms registered a year-on-year decrease of 5.1 percent in
February 2000, slightly smaller than the 5.3 percent fall in
January, according to the Census of Statistics Department of Hong
Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The smaller decline in the Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI)
in February was attributable partly to higher charges for package
tours around the Lunar New Year, and partly to firming up in the
retail prices of motor fuels, liquefied petroleum gas, jewelry and
certain consumer durables.
</P>
<P>
Clothing and footwear registered the largest year-on-year
decrease of 13.1 percent in the Composite CPI in February 2000,
followed by housing and consumer durables that declined by 10.4
percent and 6.3 percent in the Composite CPI, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, year-on-year increases were recorded for
fuel and light that were up by 3.8 percent in the Composite CPI.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman noted that consumer prices
continued to decline, as retailers continued to offer substantial
price discounts on a wide range of consumer goods and services
amidst keen competition in the retail market.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Ranks Busiest Container Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is the world's
busiest container port with its total throughput in 1999 reaching
more than 16.2 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), said
Hong Kong Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 11.2 percent increase on an annual
basis, he said, adding that the robust performance of the
container throughput was attributable to the acceleration of the
Asian economic recovery plus a significant upturn in transpacific
shipments in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for the port of Hong Kong, Peter Thompson,
chairman of the Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board (PMB), said the
expanding South China cargo base would remain Hong Kong's main
cargo source.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, Hong Kong will have much to gain from the
spurring effect of China's imminent accession to the World Trade
Organization," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
PMB forecast a seven percent growth in container throughput for
Hong Kong in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Timely provision of port facilities is crucial to the success
of the port of Hong Kong," Chairman of PMB's Port Development
Committee Gerry Forsgate said.
</P>
<P>
"A key element of matching supply of port facilities with
demand is the accurate forecast of future port cargo demands. The
port cargo forecasts will provide crucial data for carrying out
realistic and accurate planning for future port facilities and the
provision of port-related infrastructure," Forsgate said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Military Leader to Visit Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's military ruler
General Pervez Musharraf will make a three-day working visit to
Malaysia beginning March 27.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Musharaff's
visit would allow Kuala Lumpur to get first-hand information on
the current situation in Pakistan since the military take over.
</P>
<P>
"We will know what action they will take to bring back Pakistan
to normalcy and to enable the country to once again become a
member of the Commonwealth," he told a news conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"He is coming as a leader of a country but our position on what
we think of a military junta replacing a civilian government
democratically elected does not change," Syed Hamid said
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's suspension from the Commonwealth was in line with
the organization's stance of not condoning military take-over of a
democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said as a member of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group, Malaysia is supposed to monitor the situation in
Pakistan and recommend to the Commonwealth Heads of Government
whether to reinstate Pakistan as a fully participating member of
the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said it is at his request that Musharraf will visit
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity to meet him and have discussions on
current state of Pakistan and on other bilateral issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf toppled Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12 last
year in a bloodless coup. He suspended Pakistan's constitution,
parliament and four provincial assemblies when he ousted Sharif.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Links Lifting Sanctions To Signing CTBT By  India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"India signing CTBT will not only remove sanctions but reduce
tension in the world," said visiting U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley after his hour-long meeting with Indian Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
Asked when U.S. would lift the remaining sanctions imposed on
India following its nuclear tests in May 1998, Daley expressed his
hope that the sanctions become a thing of the past, saying even
the group of eight industrialized countries had asked India to
sign the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
India has hoped that, during the five-day visit by President
Bill Clinton, Washington would remove the sanctions which have
been gradually lifted.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Sinha, Daley said, he emphasized the
need for India to further reduce tariffs to attract U.S.
investments into the South Asian country while Sinha expressed his
difficulty due to budgetary constraints.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the Indian Parliament here on
Wednesday, Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton promised to remove
all "existing impediments" to trade with India while urging India
further open up its economy.
</P>
<P>
Delay asked the Indian government to take steps to increase
import from his country so as to reverse the balance of trade
between the two countries which was heavily in New Delhi's favor.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that India's exports to the U.S.
amounted to over nine billion U.S. dollars last year while imports
from the U.S. was only 3.7 billion dollars, with a balance of more
than 5.3 billion dollars in India's favor.
</P>
<P>
Delay announced that the two countries would hold three cabinet
level dialogues focusing on finance and investment, cooperation on
trade and investment, and on commerce.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned About Arms Race in South Asia:  Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We don't want the same kind of mistake to be repeated in the
region similar to the one during the Cold War era which had left
erstwhile U.S.S.R.(Soviet Union) bankrupt," Ackerman, heading a
delegation of U.S. Congressmen which called on Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Thursday, told the press here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressman promised that America would not "
pressurize India" to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
or try to impose its will on India.
</P>
<P>
"We fully recognize the fact that India knows the best of its
interest and has the right to decide on the issue keeping its
national interest in mind," he said, echoing an address to both
houses of the Indian Parliament by visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton here on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to India, the first by a U.S. President in the
past 22 years, marks the beginning of a "whole new book" in Indo-U.
S. relations, said Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
"With the Cold War now over, there has been a change in south
Asian relationship and the president's visit lays to rest the
convention that U.S. imposes its will on India," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ackerman also revealed that Clinton would "be spending close to
three hours" in Pakistan in a "restricted area" during his brief
stopover in that country on his way home after the conclusion of
his five-day visit to India.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ruling Party Unveils Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) released its election
manifesto here on Thursday, vowing to stimulate economic growth if
it wins the next parliamentary elections in April this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed as a country over the last two decades to
implement revolutionary change of national politics. Now we must
use the lessons of that experience to implement revolutionary
change of our national economy to empower our own people once and
for all," the party said in the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
According to the manifesto, the party will lower and control
the interest rates, control the price of basic commodities,
resolve gender concerns and accelerate infrastructural
development.
</P>
<P>
Land would be given to priority groups including communal
peasants, war veterans and collaborators, former political
prisoners and detainees, young agricultural graduates and other
professionals and indigenous business people who demonstrate the
capacity for agriculture, the document said.
</P>
<P>
In the manifesto, Zanu-pf vowed to boost the industrial base
and support the development of small and medium-scale enterprises,
especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The party would promote the establishment of more export
processing zones and industrial parks and provide tax incentives
to the indigenous business community so they could establish
industries in smaller towns and growth points, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the party would, after the elections, do away with
the Lancaster House Constitution and replace it with a home-grown
constitution, taking into account relevant views made by people
during the Constitutional Commission's outreach program.
</P>
<P>
The party would also foster moral values, renew national
confidence, maintain peace and stability, give the workers their
due representation and empower indigenous people, the manifesto

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Blood Banks Dry up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Most government hospitals of
Zambia are facing critical shortage of blood, making it difficult
for them to carry out major operations, the Times of Zambia
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the country's Health Minister David Mpamba
as saying that this shortage is caused by the prevalence of AIDS
and HIV in the country, because most of the donated blood is
rejected after screening.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing everything possible to ensure that
operations are not disrupted, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have this problem because of the AIDS prevalence but we are
doing everything possible to control the situation," he said. "As
I am talking to you right now our men in Lusaka are out in the
field collecting blood from donors."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pauline Mbangweta, public relations officer of the
country's biggest hospital, University Teaching Hospital, said
another factor leading to the blood shortage is that the number of
people donating blood has drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 percent of Zambian adults are now living with HIV.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Resigns Over Make-up of New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, an ethnic hutu, had resigned as a result of
disagreement with colleagues in the ruling tutsi-dominated Rwanda
Patriotic Front (RPF) over the make-up of a new cabinet which was
announced on Sunday, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
The RPF formed a government of national reconciliation which
sought to embrace both ethnic groups after the genocide of
hundreds of thousands of minority tutsis by hutu extremists in
1994.
</P>
<P>
But several senior officials belonging to hutu, including
Pierre Celestin Rwigema, have quit their positions since the new
government was formed.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema resigned last month as prime minister after a
parliamentary probe accused him of corruption.
</P>
<P>
It is said that most of the power in Rwanda now rests with Vice
 President Paul Kagame, a tutsi who is also chairman of the RPF.
 Rumors have been rife in Kigali for months about strained
relations between Kagame and Bizimungu.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Yet Decide to Quit COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite of its plan to pull
out of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
the Tanzanian government has not decided to quit the regional
economic block, Tanzanian media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at the Lusaka International Airport on his
way home from a visit to Namibia, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa stressed that the issue his country faces now is not whether
it should pull out of COMESA or not, but how many regional groups
it should belong to at one time.
</P>
<P>
"We have stakes in SADC (Southern African Development
Community), COMESA and the East African Community and yet there
are others who want us to join them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Tanzania is yet to officially pull out of
COMESA, a regional community aimed at sharing the region's common
heritage and destiny to allow greater social and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The decision will depend on recommendations by the
organization's ministers who will hold a consultative meeting next
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Tanzania's plan to pull out of COMESA does not
mean it lacks interest in pursuing economic integration.
</P>
<P>
On the re-launched East African Community, Mkapa explained that
it is aimed at strengthening economic and commercial relations of
the member states and therefore poses no threat to other regional
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, COMESA exists as an organization of free
and independent sovereign states that have agreed to cooperate in
developing their natural and human resources for the good of all
their people.
</P>
<P>
With a membership of 21 states and a population of 385 million,
it forms a major integrated trading block.
</P>
<P>
Many COMESA member states are also members of one or more
regional groupings such as the East African Co-operation, the
Southern African Development Community, Southern African Customs
Union, Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and Indian
Ocean Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some member States are concerned that their dual or even
multiple membership in these organizations will make it difficult
for them to implement agreed programs, including making membership
contributions.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Declares Navigation Order Around Islands Under U.S. Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Thursday declared the order of navigation
to and from the five islands under U.S. control.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that if U.S. warships and civilian ships go
beyond the designated zones and waterways, it will be regarded as
"an outright intrusion into the territorial waters of our side and
waters and airspace under our military control," the Korean
Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In that case ,the communique said, the DPRK armed forces will
retaliate without warning.
</P>
<P>
After the West Sea conflict on June 15, 1999, the DPRK
negotiated the demarcation line on the West Sea with the United
States several times, but failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The communique said: "We have made every possible effort to
settle through negotiations issues that may be raised between our
side and the U.S. forces side, among them an issue of navigating
to and from islands under the U.S. forces side's control under the
Korean Armistice Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Now that the U.S. forces side finally refused to discuss the
issues, our side cannot wait any longer for its response to our
offer for a technical discussion. Therefore, the KPA Navy Command
was authorized to confirm and declare 'order of navigating to and
from five islands' situated in the territorial waters north of the
extension of the military demarcation line at the West Sea of
Korea," it said.
</P>
<P>
The waters around Paekryong, Taechong and Sochong islands shall
be designated as the first zone, the waters around Yonphyong
island the second zone and the waters around U island the third
zone, the communique announced.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warships and civilian ships, which are considered not
hostile, shall be allowed navigate in the first, second and third
zones through the corresponding waterways.
</P>
<P>
Planes are not allowed to fly over the islands "in principle"
except over the waterways in unavoidable cases, it said.
</P>
<P>
"If warships and civilian ships and planes of the U.S. forces
side go beyond the designated zones and waterways, it will be an
outright intrusion into the territorial waters of our side and
waters and airspace under our military control," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK threatened to retaliate without warning if the U.S.
side "dares to challenge."
</P>
<P>
A DPRK naval ship sank and three others were damaged in the
June 15 naval conflict between the DPRK and South Korean navies,
following which the DPRK established a West Sea demarcation line
but the U.S. side sticks to the "Northern Line."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Has Asia's Largest Digital Film Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Digital Film Making Works
under the China Film Group Corporation became operational recently,
and is the largest of its kind in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yaozu, general manager of the works, said that "We just
want to provide Chinese directors more means of film making, so as
to help China's film industry out of its stagnant period." As for
him, stale content and backward screening methods have been the
main factors for the lagging film market.
</P>
<P>
Digital technology will make films more stimulating and
breathtaking, and it is expected to be expanded into picture
composition and stunt making, along with audio synthesis and
montage, he added.
</P>
<P>
Huang made it clear that their technological hardware is more
or less at the same level as foreign counterparts, but their
technological staff need more experience.
</P>
<P>
The film industry has experienced three stages of development,
from silent to sound, black and white to color, and analog
technology to digital signals, which is now taking place worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The film "Opium War" in 1997, directed by Xie Jin, was the
first in China to use digital technology in audio synthesis, and
the recent film "Emergency Landing" was the first to edit stunt
scenes with computers.
</P>
<P>
"The development of multimedia and the Internet has made the
use of digital systems a trend, which will eventually combine
shooting, film distribution, and screening into one. So, it is a
matter of life or death for the film industry whether to use
digital technology now," said Huang.
</P>
<P>
The company will expand its business by making commercials,
music TV programs, electronic games, and TV operas as well.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the ten hottest films in the US were digital, and
nearly half of the more than 1,000 scenes in "Titanic" were made
via computer.

<HEADLINE> New Sino-Japanese Fishery Agreement to Take Effect (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The New China-Japan Fishery
Agreement will be put into effect starting June 1 this year,
Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture Qi Jingfa told a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Japan signed the agreement on November
11, 1997, and completed their respective domestic legal procedures
for effecting the agreement in the first half of 1998. But due to
major differences regarding fishery arrangement in the northern
East China Sea, the agreement did not go into effect.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations, the two sides eventually resolved their
differences late last month, and agreed that the new agreement
will go become effective in June, when the Fishery Agreement
signed by the two countries in 1975 will become invalid.
</P>
<P>
According the new agreement, a Temporary Co-Management Fishery
Zone will be set up between 27 degrees and 34.4 degrees north
latitude, 52 nautical miles beyond the respective basic
territorial sea lines of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
And fishing activities will remain the same as before in the
area south of 27 degrees north latitude and west of 125.3 degrees
east longitude. Fishing ships from both countries may conduct
fishing activities without getting licenses from the other side in
the East China Sea area north of 30.4 degrees north latitude and
between 124.45 degrees and 127.3 degrees east longitude, a region
called the Central Zone.
</P>
<P>
The areas on either side of the Temporary Co-management Fishery
Zone and Central Zone will be under the jurisdiction of the
respective countries.

<P>
Qi said this new agreement is important for regulating the
fishing order in the East China Sea, protecting the fishing
interests of China and Japan, and developing fishing cooperation
and stabilizing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also have a positive influence on resolving
fishing issues between China and the Republic of Korea, and China
and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that when the agreement takes effect, many
Chinese fishing ships will have to retreat from areas close to the
Japanese side, which will affect fishing production and the lives
of the Chinese fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the ministry has called on local governments to
publicize the new agreement so fishermen will correctly understand
its contents, Qi said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials should help surplus fishermen to
quit fishing and find them new jobs in order to ensure social and
economic stability in the fishing communities.

The bilateral consultations and coordination mechanism between
the two sides in this regard has been operating effectively, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the relations between China and ASEAN
countries will be furthered," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Kosovo issue, Sun told the press conference that
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be
respected in an earnest manner, the legitimate rights and
interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo region should fully
be guaranteed, and Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council
should be effectively implemented.
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, conditions necessary for a political solution of
the Kosovo issue can be created," he said, adding that China has
no self-interest in this matter, but has taken a principled stance
aimed at safeguarding the UN Charter and the widely recognized
norms governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that U.S.-led NATO took military action against
Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, using the issue of Kosovo as an
excuse last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's action "seriously violated the UN charter
and the norms of the international law, and set a dangerous
precedent for intervention into other country's internal affairs
by military force," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo situation remains tense, with increased ethnic
strife and conflict, the spokesman said.

The matter is of "vital importance to the healthy development
of relations between China and any other country," Sun said,
adding that "the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of
official contact with Taiwan by any country which has established
diplomatic relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"This stand is clear-cut and consistent," he said, stressing
that "countries concerned have made solemn international
commitments to the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue. We ask
them to adhere to the one-China principle with practical actions
and observe their commitments they have made to the Chinese side."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that there is but one China in the
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territories.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact that has been recognized by the international
community and the election of leaders in the Taiwan region and its
result can not change this fact," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On human rights issue, Sun said that talks between China and
the United States on human rights have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
"The US should truly give up being confrontational and return
to dialogue," said Sun, adding that there are differences between
China and the United States on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The differences should be resolved through dialogue according
to the principles of equality and mutual respect, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
Sun called on the U.S. to correct its erroneous decision of
initiating an anti-China resolution at the UN human rights
conference to be held in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"China has made great efforts to improve people's life and
protect human rights," Sun said, adding that China at present has
the best human rights record.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordanian Workers Back to Gulf Labor Markets  by Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to years of fence-mending
efforts by the Jordanian government to heal the wounds of the 1990
Gulf crisis, Jordanian workers are coming back to the lucrative
labor markets in the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian expatriates brought home 909.4 million Jordanian
dinars (1.27 billion U.S. dollars) in remittance in 1999, up by 11.
6 percent from that of 1998, according to figures from the Central
Bank of Jordan available on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remittances have helped the kingdom achieve a 1.5 percent
economic growth rate in 1999, rare and amazing as the desert
kingdom had been plagued by a chronic economic recession since the
Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Planning Ministry showed that 380,000
Jordanians are currently working abroad, mainly in the Arab Gulf
states, which had expelled tens of thousands of Jordanian workers
during the Gulf crisis, for Jordan was perceived to side with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, alone, expelled more than 300,000 Jordanian workers
during the crisis, most of them are doctors, engineers, professors,
senior managers and other well-paid professionals, dealing a heavy
blow to the national economy of Jordan, where labor export has been
its most important foreign currency earner for decades.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's strained ties with Kuwait and other Gulf countries
thawed after Amman distanced itself from Baghdad in mid-1990s, and
the kingdom managed to normalize its diplomatic ties with Kuwait in
1999 after nearly a decade of rifts over the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Gulf states have promised to recruit tens of
thousands of qualified Jordanians to work in public and private
institutions as they did before the Gulf crisis which touched off
the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials said it will still take some time
to restore Jordan's labor exports to its level prior to the crisis,
when the kingdom received 15 billion dinars (21 billion dollars)
annually, almost equivalent to its revenues in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering charging officials in its
embassies in the Arab Gulf states with promoting Jordan's labor
exports to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It also licensed five head-hunting offices in Amman to further
explore the Gulf labor markets for Jordanian job hunters.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Gulf labor markets to Jordanians will also
help bring down the soaring unemployment rate in Jordan, which was
put at 27 percent by independent estimates as against 14 percent by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The high unemployment rate was partly due to the fact that
Jordanians had dodged low-income and laborious jobs such as
farming, shipping, cleaning streets as well as job opportunities in
the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the jobs are being done by a 1.5-million-strong foreign
labor force, most of them are Egyptians, Iraqis, Palestinians and
other Arab nationals with a minimum monthly salary of 80 dinars
(112 dollars) with a few fringe benefits like free foods.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign workers in Jordan remitted 102.5 million dinars
(143.5 million dollars) back home in 1999, down by 6.7 percent from
that of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Barak Decides to Withdraw Completely From Lebanon: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has decided that the planned Israeli troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon will be carried out completely by July even if it
would be unilateral, the Ha'aretz daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With or without a deal with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, Barak will pull Israeli soldiers from Lebanon to the
international border between the two countries under United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed in 1978 after Israel waged a large-
scale aggression to Lebanon in the name of wiping out Palestinian
guerrillas in the country.
</P>
<P>
It calls for an immediate and unconditional Israeli pullout from
all Lebanese territory and for a return of the full sovereignty of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Barak's decision to redeploy Israeli army according
to the resolution shows his preference for the withdrawal proposal
submitted by his confidant Uri Lubrani, his coordinator of
activities in Lebanon, over the army's proposal for a unilateral
withdrawal code-named "Operation Morning Twilight."
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the Israel Defense Forces' plan
submitted to Barak by Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz last week
will keep some military outposts in areas about 500 meters north of
the Israeli borderline.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Lubrani argued that Israel should wrap its moves in
international legitimacy and fulfill all the demands of the
Resolution 425 to leave the responsibility for keeping peace along
the border on the shoulders of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he added, it will make it hard for Lebanese to rally
international support should Israel be forced to respond to
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla's attacks on its soldiers or northern
towns. Israel set up a 15-kilometer-deep "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-
border guerrilla attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli
casualties have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Barak to withdraw from the buffer zone by July, with or without
a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December
after a 45-month break, broke off again in January over a dispute
on the fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
A new breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian track is possible after
U.S. President Bill Clinton made a surprise announcement on Monday
that he would meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. and Israeli government sources had suggested that if
there were no deal under way, the two leaders would not waste time
to meet. So, the sources said, the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
talks and the revival of Israeli-Lebanese negotiations are
imminent.
</P>
<P>
A leading Saudi-owned Arab daily Asharq Awsat revealed Wednesday
that Barak is likely to be invited to join the Clinton-Assad summit
if their talks make major progress.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Lebanese President Emile Lahoud would
also be invited to the Geneva conclave if substantive Lebanese
issues were raised.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Shows Downturn Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Frayed nerves and cash shortage
hammered stocks here Wednesday by 3.8 percent, pushing the downturn
to the hilt as more investors made a hasty exit, the Cypurs Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Investors continued to sell in a broad-based decline which has
to date brought the all-share Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) index
tumbling 32 percent since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday brought another sharp decline. The all-share index
shot down to 483.69 points, 19 points lower than Tuesday's close,
and straying clear of the 500-point mark, seen as a tentative
support level by some.
</P>
<P>
Traded value stood steady at 17.4 million Cyprus pounds (29.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Retail and commercial stocks fared the worst, falling between
six and five percent. Banking stocks, which had underperformed the
market losses recently, were also affected.
</P>
<P>
The banking index lost 2.9 percent. Bank of Cyprus hit a new low
for this year when it lost 26 cents, closing at 7.90 pounds (13.40
dollars).

<HEADLINE> French Delegation to Visit Baghdad for More Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A French business delegation will
start a seven-day visit to Baghdad on Saturday to promote trade
between France and Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegation will meet Iraqi ministers and
other officials to discuss ways of strengthening bilateral economic
and trade cooperation, said INA.
</P>
<P>
The delegation groups representatives from 35 major French
companies, ranging from energy, petroleum, communications to
minerals, agriculture and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
France, a traditional trading partner of Iraq, has been trying
to gain a slice of Iraq's lucrative market within the framework of
the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal launched in 1996, now in its seventh
phase, Iraq is allowed to sell a limited amount of oil every six
months and use part of the revenue, under the U.N. supervision, to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22
million people, who have been under crippling U.N. sanctions ever
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The French government has been urging French companies to
increase their investments in Iraq, and has sent a diplomat to run
an interests section in Baghdad for the first time since 1990,
besides the already-opened trade center in Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Australian Company Fined for Oil Spill </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- An Australian company has been
fined more than 40,000 Australian dollars (26,400 U.S. dollars)
for allowing 2,000 liters of oil to spill into a storm water
channel, Environmental Protection Act (EPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oil and Fuel Salvaging Pty Ltd in Brisbane, the Queensland
state in east Australia, was fined 20,000 Australian dollars (13,
200 U.S. dollars) for unlawfully causing environmental harm on
June 29 last year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The company also had to pay 10,657 Australian dollars (7,033 U.
S. dollars) to cover the cost of the four-day clean-up.
</P>
<P>
Its directors Eleanor and John Mare were each fined 5,000
Australian dollars (3,300 U.S. dollars) for failing to comply with
the EPA.
</P>
<P>
EPA director Alan Feely said the total penalty sent a clear
message about the legal obligations of individuals and companies
regarding the environment.
</P>
<P>
Feely said the oil spill had the potential to damage mangrove
habitats in the Brisbane River.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the second time Oil and Fuel Salvaging had been
prosecuted for environmental breaches.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Solution not Possible Without 3rd-Party Mediation: Pak FM </HEADLINE>

ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Thursday said that India and Pakistan could not
resolve the 52 years old Kashmir dispute without a third party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Talking to media, Sattar said that strengthening of peace in
South Asia depends on solution of the thorny Kashmir issue and the
solution to this problem is possible only through third party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
If the conflict in the region is to be resolved, that would be
possible through third party mediation, the minister said, adding
India and Pakistan have never resolved any important problem
through bilateral means.
</P>
<P>
This remarks came at a time when U.S. President Bill Clinton is
on his South Asian tour and will visit Pakistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that being a sole super power, the United States would
play a decisive role in solution of this problem," Sattar said.

KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have enlisted the

said, adding that "there are conflicting reports on their fate."
</P>
<P>
"Whether they are alive or dead, they are wanted," the
spokesman said. " We have alerted relevant organs to be vigilant
and arrest the cult leaders once seeing them."
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi told the
New Vision daily on Wednesday that Kibwetere was still alive while
other reports here said that the cult leaders all died in the mass
suicide last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, 530 people have been killed in the
mass suicide, the second biggest in the world, following the 1978
cult killing by People's Temple in Guyana in which more than 900
people died.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan authorities have issued a directive to disband the cult
and apprehend its leaders.
</P>
<P>
The cult, created in 1989 but registered in 1997, has been
working under the disguise of a non-governmental organization. It
has thousands of followers across the country.

<HEADLINE> Police Oust Oscar Fans From Camp at Award Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Oscar fans were unhappy for
the termination of a decades-long tradition -- camping outside
Shrine Auditorium to get good seats to watch Sunday's Academy
Awards, because police ousted them away to make parking space for
elementary school students.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 campers, who had lined up to get a front-row seat on
the bleachers along the red carpet, were given just 45 minutes on
Tuesday to break camp and clear the sidewalks of an adjacent
street.
</P>
<P>
"We are just fans wanting to show our loyalty and be part of a
great event. For us to be treated so poorly, it doesn't seem right.
" said Lola Lopp, a mother of two from Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
A principal of a nearby elementary school complained that Oscar
fans occupied the parking space of the school. University of
Southern California students also have problems to get to their
apartments, because they must walk across the camp, police said.
</P>
<P>
A couple of fans, Susanne Wolf and Silvia Farag, said they flew
in from Frankfurt, Germany, to renew friendships they had struck
up with other fans attending the show during the past five or six
years.
</P>
<P>
Police, however, told the crowd who had gathered along
Jefferson Boulevard to pack up. Many signs reading "No standing,
no sitting, no furniture of any kind, no tents, sleeping bags or
blankets" are posted in the area.
</P>
<P>
Danielle Ferron, a 34-year-old masseuse from St. Malo, France,
said she saw a television report about the encampment, then bought
a ticket on the Internet and flew in Tuesday because it was "
something to try before getting too old."
</P>
<P>
Tina Hernandez, a 46-year-old secretary from Huntington Beach,
California, said she's been coming for 17 years and made so many
friends during the annual camp-out that she set up a Web site for
her group.
</P>
<P>
Her group pitched the first tent last Thursday. By Tuesday, 18
tents lined two sides of the street.
</P>
<P>
Diehard fans had arrived with coolers, tents, barbecues and
even generators to power TV sets. At stake are 200 first-come,
first-served stargazer seats in the fenced bleacher section
erected outside the cavernous Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
Showing sympathy with the fans, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences handed the ousted stargazers numbered vouchers
which give them priority spots in the bleachers, where they can
see their favorite celebrities entering the ceremony.

<P>
MADRID, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A military C-212 cargo plane
crashed Wednesday night in Guadalajara, northeast of Spain,
causing fire in the forest, according to the report by the Civil
Guard of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fire have been put down but the whereabouts of the seven
crew members on board are unknown with the rescue work going on,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed three and half hours later after it took off
at 4 a.m. local time from a southern military base to Saragossa in
northeast Spain.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Defense Ministry said that the reason for
the crash is still unknown so far, but as the plane has been burnt
out, the chance for the seven to survive is very rare.
</P>
<P>
This is the second air accident this month after two F-18
fighters crashed on March 13 near Saragossa, which killed one

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Support for E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Thursday
pledged continued support for East Timor's reconstruction and
transition toward a peaceful and democratic republic.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country is
holding the rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, said that
the EU was particularly concerned with the refugee problem with
still hundreds of thousands of them stranded outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
About 130,000 East Timorese are still sheltering in refugee
camps in the Indonesian West Timor and United Nations officials
said that many are not returning home due to fears of a lack of
security and food.
</P>
<P>
"The EU would help lay down the foundation for the
reconstruction and contribute to peace of the region," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi, president of the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, said that the union had
offered some 53.5 million euro (51.8 million U.S. dollars) to East
Timor and is expected to fish out another 20 million euro (19.4
million dollars) for between now and 2006 for the reconstruction
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Jose "Xanana" Gusmao, chairman of the National Council of
Timorese Resistance, expressed his gratitude to the EU
contribution and that of the international community and said that
without the outside assistance there would be no success in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese independence leader said that East Timor
would be finally built into a democratic republic that can help
ensure peace and prosperity in the region.

<HEADLINE> 2002 World Cup Final Tickets Up to 800 Dollars Each </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese organizing committee
for the 2002 World Cup (JAWOC) said Thursday that top-priced
tickets for the final in Yokohama will go on sale in Japan for as
much as 85,000 (750 U.S. dollars) yen each, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
Committee officials was quoted as saying that tickets for the
final at International Stadium Yokohama will be divided into three
categories, but did not disclose how much the least expensive
seats for the June 30 match would cost.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for first-round fixtures will cost fans up to 17,000
yen, while prices for the knockout stages will be subject to
change, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Exact details about price and distribution of tickets will be
announced after consultation with soccer's world governing body
FIFA, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the 1998 World Cup final in France went as high as
4,950 French francs.
</P>
<P>
JAWOC officials said, however, that Japanese organizers would
start handling applications for tickets from September, with
distribution to be decided by lottery.
</P>
<P>
JAWOC is unhappy that FIFA has allotted co-hosts Japan and
South Korea just 750,000 tickets each -- amounting to half of the
3 million tickets to go on sale -- and said it will continue to
lobby for an increase.

<HEADLINE> World Meteorology Day Marked in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's close cooperation with
the international community has not only contributed to global
efforts in disaster reduction but has also benefited China itself
by improving its ability to forecast the weather and climate over
the past few decades, a top Chinese meteorological official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering marking today's World Meteorology Day,
and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO), Wen Kegang, director of the
China Meteorological Bureau, said that as a founding member of the
organization, China has been an active participant in global
cooperation in meteorology during the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Wen's late predecessor Zou Jingmeng was twice elected chairman
of the organization during the past two decades, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Zou was the first Chinese citizen elected head of a United
Nations organization.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, China has been providing quality
weather and climate information obtained from its network of
weather observatories and stations across the country to other
parts of the world, the director said.
</P>
<P>
China also makes available to some countries weather and
climate information obtained through its own climate satellites.
</P>
<P>
Wen said China maintains close cooperation and exchanges in
meteorology with over 160 countries and regions, and has provided
meteorological instruments and equipment as assistance to about 50
countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe during the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
China has also been a beneficiary of close cooperation with the
outside world, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Advanced equipment, including computers, and personnel training
outside China, has helped improve the capacity of Chinese
meteorologists, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 Chinese meteorologists have received training in the
United States in the past decades as part of bilateral cooperation
in science and technology, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
These people serve as not only the backbone of China's
meteorological efforts, but also as the leading force in China's
international cooperation with overseas colleagues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among those also present at today's gathering were
representatives from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of
Water Conservancy, and leading Chinese meteorologists.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian military police
have arrested one of the seven robbers who hijacked and robbed a
passenger boat on its way to Siem Reap Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chhaum Phai, 28, who was a military staff working in an
engineering unit, was captured in Phnom Penh at 10 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The military police confiscated two AK-47s and lots of cash
from him, including 1,795 U.S. dollars, 319,400 Cambodian riel, 22,
000 Japanese yen, 400 pound sterling and 26,000 Vietnamese dong.
Also confiscated from the robber were five mobile phones, six
cameras, five watches and one recorder.
</P>
<P>
The robber now is under the police detention.
</P>
<P>
According to the military police, the rest of the robbers would
be arrested soon because the suspects have already been identified.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked boat, with 44 foreign and 46 local tourists, was
one of many boats that run daily between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap,

The hijackers first tied up the passengers and cut the boat's
communications system, then robbed passengers' mobile phones, cash,
cameras and valuables.

<P>
After collecting their loot, the hijackers ordered the captain
to pull the boat near a riverbank before jumping overboard and
fled away.
</P>
<P>

countries, including the United States, Australia, France, Japan,
Italy and Germany.

the return of tax rebates when the investor undergoes structural
changes.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises include those that are wholly owned by foreign
investors and specially engaged in investment.
</P>
<P>
However, when the foreign investor company withdraws the
reinvestment by equity transfer or other means, it should return
the tax rebates it has received, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage foreign investment, China offers some tax rebates
for a five-year period to foreign investors in China.

<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's action "seriously violated the UN charter
and the norms of the international law, and set a dangerous
precedent for intervention into other country's internal affairs
by military force," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo situation remains tense, with increased ethnic
strife and conflict, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the situation in the past year provided the
entire world two profound warnings. First, the new interventionism,
which puts human rights above sovereignty, can't solve the so-
called human rights issue. Instead, it will further complicate the
already- existing dispute, and cause disastrous results, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Second, such principles of the UN Charter as equality of
sovereignty and non-interference in other country's internal
affairs are far from outdated, he said. On the contrary, these
principles still have great practical significance.
</P>
<P>
Sun said China hopes that U.S.-led NATO will reflect deeply on
and draw lessons from what has happened in Kosovo in order to
avoid creating any situation which goes against the wishes of the
people of the world for peace and development at the turn of the
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia is willing to
participate in the development of China's vast western region in
the areas of rural development, poverty eradication, and resource
management, David Taylor Irvine, new Australian ambassador to
China, said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in his opening address delivered at a
symposium here hosted by the Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID), a governmental department for overseas aid
projects in health, agriculture, rural development, infrastructure
construction, and other public areas.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of some 20 officials, experts, and
project leaders from both countries, the two-day symposium will
concentrate discussions on such topics as poverty elimination, the
improvement of rural health care, reform of the educational system,
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Aid projects discussed at the symposium could promote poverty
relief efforts in western China, key to the country's strategy of
sustained development, Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
Irvine admitted that "poverty remains a major challenge for
China." Gaps in terms of development levels and income still exist
between China's inland and coastal areas, and between the incomes
of urban and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
However, he also highly praised China's poverty relief efforts,
noting that "some 200 million people have been lifted from poverty,
and substantial improvements have been recorded in China's human
development indicators" over the past two decades.

<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Over the past year, government
departments in charge of overseas Chinese affairs at all levels
have helped companies funded by overseas Chinese deal with a large
number of difficulties and disputes, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State
Council launched a campaign to help overseas Chinese business
people resolve problems and settle disputes encountered in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese affairs offices of all levels handled 3,276

The campaign has protected the legal rights of overseas-Chinese
investors and improved the environment for investment in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that overseas Chinese, foreign
nationals of Chinese origin, and compatriots from Hong Kong and
Macao, are the largest overseas investor in the mainland,

<HEADLINE> Jordan Further Opens to Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's powerful Higher Council for
Investment (HCI) has recommended lifting the ceiling on foreign
investments in key sectors to grant 100 percent ownership to non-
Jordanian investors in a bid to woo the much-needed foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
The sectors to open to full foreign investments and ownership
include information technology, leasing companies, banking and
financing services, hospitals, hotels, communications, insurance,
environmental protection and catering services, the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made during a HCI meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh earlier this week, is expected to be
approved next month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
If approved, foreign investors will be allowed to launch their
projects in the desert kingdom without the need to enter into
partnership with their local counterparts as required by current
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, some sectors are still expected to remain in the hands
of Jordanian investors or with a 50 percent ceiling of ownership by
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Financial clearing and settlement companies, distribution of
pharmaceutical products, real estate service and customs clearing
service will be confined to local investors.
</P>
<P>
Sectors which may absorb 50 percent of foreign investments are
retail trade, exports and imports, money exchange and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The 50 percent ceiling was made at the request of the Amman
Chamber of Commerce, which believed that these sectors still need
stronger protection from the government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Assad Summit Stirs High Hopes for Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad could bring a
breakthrough in Israeli-Syrian peace talks, despite ongoing
official attempts to play down the meeting, a senior Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Assad are to meet on Sunday in Geneva. Israeli
Deputy Foreign Minister Nawaf Massalha told the Jerusalem Post
newspaper Thursday that Clinton will bring to the meeting a
compromise proposal on the future borders between Israel and Syria,
which will be acceptable to both of them.
</P>
<P>
According to Massalha, a compromise has been worked out by the
Americans by which Israel would withdraw to the June 4, 1967, line,
while the Syrians were ready to be flexible regarding some small
modifications to the line.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks late last year, but
the talks have been stalled since January after two rounds. Syria
demanded that Israel promise to withdraw to the June 4 line and the
demarcation of borders be discussed first before tackling other
issues such as security, water and normalization of ties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Wednesday twice with U.S.
ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk to discuss the Geneva meeting.
The two also discussed the visit to Israel next week of U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen, whose trip will deal in part with
American defense aid to Israel following a peace agreement reached
by Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak also discussed the peace process on Wednesday in telephone
conversations with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Patrick Seal, the British journalist known to have
close ties with Assad and who was in Syria and Israel earlier this
month, told reporters in Vienna Wednesday that Clinton would bring
up a compromise solution on the border issue, stressing that Assad
would not come to the meeting if he did not intend on accepting the
compromise.
</P>
<P>
If there is a breakthrough in the Geneva talks, Barak will
probably be asked to go to Geneva for a meeting with Assad, other
sources here said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Tries to Lessen Dependence on Imported Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
continue to harness alternative sources of energy in helping
lessen the economy's dependence on imported oil and shield
consumers from the impact of price changes in the world market,
Philippine News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui was quoted as saying that the
present global situation, in which crude oil production is
controlled by a few, underscores the need for the country o tap
its indigenous and renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at other forms of energy so we would not be
totally dependent on crude oil," Tiaoqui said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tiaoqui, the government is making substantial
progress in tapping other sources of energy to lessen the
dependence of various sectors on imported crude.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he noted, the country was 40 percent dependent on
imported oil for power generation, but this went down to 23
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
For 2000, he said, the government hopes to bring this down
further to only 11 or 12 percent. Because o these efforts, he
added, the government can afford to temper oil price increases and
lessen their impact on the public.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the secretary said that as a result of efforts to
raise the country's energy self-reliance level, dependence on
imported oil has been reduced to roughly half of the national
energy requirements since 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with 1973 when the country was 92 percent
dependent on imported oil, the Philippines now buys oil to cover
only 47 percent of its energy requirements.
</P>
<P>
This significant reduction of oil dependence can be attributed
to the successful efforts by the government to harness indigenous
sources of energy, such as hydro and geothermal power and
agricultural wastes,Tiaoqui noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Estrada administration also continues to
develop renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and mini-
hydro power.

<HEADLINE> Power Industry to Be Zambia's Leading Money Earner: COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has said Zambia could make power
generation and distribution its leading money earner in the next
10 years, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The country has the biggest potential to generate and
distribute electricity to make the sector the number one earner
for the country in the next 10 years," the report quoted COMESA
Assistant Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya as saying in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The exports of electricity from Zambia to the region can
surpass the earnings from any sector including the mines, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngwenya, the Zambian government should "leave no
stone unturned to generate power for the regional market."
</P>
<P>
The realization of the prospect can be strengthened with the
exports of power to South Africa, which is expected to experience
a massive power shortage by the year 2008, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has indicated that it will be experiencing a
massive power shortage by 2008. Its people are now looking at ways
in which they can meet that deficit. This is the opportunity for
Zambia to see what it can do to take advantage of the situation
and supply the electricity to South Africa, Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia should put special emphasis on power, noting
that realizing full export earnings from the sale of power does
not get affected by world trends for market demands.

JAKARTA -- Indonesian former president Soeharto is healthy
enough to face questioning for alleged corruption during his three-
decade rule, according to a report from an independent medical
examination team.
</P>

Soeharto was declared medically fit after undergoing two
examinations last week, the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted a source
close to the state-appointed medical team as saying. But the
source would not say whether questioning the 78-year-old former
ruler would be feasible since he has trouble in speaking. (

<HEADLINE> Quotes of Russia's Main Presidential Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters will go to the
polls Sunday to elect a new president among 11 candidates.
Following are some quotes of the four leading contestants.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, the acting president who is widely expected to
win the race:
</P>
<P>
-- "Anyone who doesn't regret the passing of the Soviet Union
has no heart; anyone who wants it restored has no brains."
</P>
<P>
-- "The higher the degree of economic freedom of economic
entities, the higher the level of development of the state."
</P>
<P>
-- "Only one thing can be effective in such circumstances (
Chechen separatism) -- to go on the offensive. You must hit first,
and hit so hard that your opponent will not rise to his feet."
</P>
<P>
-- "These videos, their advertising (TV campaign ads by other
candidates). I will not try to find out in the course of my
election campaign which is more important, Tampax or Snickers."
</P>
<P>
-- "It is hard for me to visualize NATO as an enemy. I think
even posing the question this way will not do any good to Russia
or the world. The very question is capable of causing damage."
</P>
<P>
-- "I don't see why (Russia should) not (join NATO). I would
not rule out such a possibility, but I repeat if and when Russia's
views are taken into account as those of any equal partner."
</P>
<P>
-- "Nobody is going to admit Russia into NATO. We have never
thought this could happen."
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist party leader who trails Putin
in the second place in opinion polls:
</P>
<P>
-- "Our fathers and grandfathers did not liberate Europe from
fascism for the NATO military alliance to make seven-mile steps
advancing to the east and posing a threat to Russia's national
security."
</P>
<P>
-- "The authorities are trying to conceal the truth of the
tragic situation in the country. It is my duty to bring it to each
voter."
</P>
<P>
-- "To save the country, the economic and social policy must
be immediately changed."
</P>
<P>
-- "I guarantee the recovery, within five years, of your
savings depreciated by (former prime ministers Igor) Gaidar and (
Sergei) Kiriyenko. We will restore citizens' rights to cheap
housing and communal services, to free education and health care.
The State will establish rigid control over prices for basic
foodstuffs and essentials. Electricity and communications tariffs
and transport fare will be reduced."
</P>
<P>
-- "I know where and how to find money to fulfill my program.
Our country is still very rich.
</P>
<P>
-- "I guarantee timely and fair labor remuneration, immunity
for legally obtained property. The State will support enterprises
of all forms of ownership, in town and in the country, and will
ensure equal conditions for their development."
</P>
<P>
-- "Stop the extinction of the Russian people. Ensure a worthy
future for our children and grandchildren. Restore the country's
defense potential. Provide tangible assistance to the development
of culture and enhance public spirit. Wage a resolute struggle
against crime and corruption."
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party:
</P>
<P>
-- "The new ruling elite is neither democratic, nor Communist,
neither conservative nor liberal, neither red nor green. It is
merely selfish, greedy, and rapacious."
</P>
<P>
-- "Any action Russia takes in today's world, Russia is taking
for its own vital interests, not to please anybody or to make any
other country happy. Russia's problems should be tackled primarily
by our own selves because they are absolutely crucial for the
Russian people, for the future of Russia."
</P>
<P>
-- "Russian media remain free from direct political censorship
as before but is now controlled by the robber-barons, who, in fact,
are part of the government."
</P>
<P>
-- "In politics just as in boxing, the winner is not the one
who is stronger, but the one who's left standing at the very end."
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party:
</P>
<P>
-- "I advocate a military-police state with a strong army and
police structures."
</P>
<P>
--"Democracy will lead this country to an abyss. A three-
million-man army must be established and the KGB restored. This is
the only path."
</P>
<P>
-- "You have only one choice -- either me, or (acting
President Vladimir) Putin. The next president will be named
Vladimir."
</P>
<P>
-- "If bloodshed is necessary, I will shed it. And if you are
afraid, don't vote (for me)."
</P>
<P>
-- "I will spill the blood of all national-separatists,
destroy them in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance
with the criminal code. There will be KGB posts and informers
everywhere. I will know what is going on in this country. I am
telling you in advance that I will exterminate them all. Rivers of
blood will flow. Ten million or 15 million will die, but the
remaining 135 million will live normally."

<HEADLINE> Record Viewers To Watch Oscars Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Xinhua) -- This year's Oscars may not
only draw the biggest number of viewers on television -- but also
online, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some 1 billion TV viewers around the world, the
analysts believe, more people than ever will watch the Oscars
online as tens of millions are expected to click their way into
the movie industry's most publicized drama.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than two million viewers caught the annual
awards night on the Net, the analysts pointed out, adding that the
number is expected to increase ten-fold this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Web sites will focus on the Oscars ceremony or
related events when the Academy Awards are handed out at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Leading the cyber way is Oscar.com, a joint venture of the
Academy and Disney-owned GO.com and ABC.com. It promises to take
viewers backstage, showing the winners live as they talk to the
press -- it's the first time the Academy allowed this.
</P>
<P>
Brian Bowman, vice-president and general manager of ABC.com,
says the Web site is an enhancement to the telecast. "We can offer
things online you don't see on TV, but at the same time, if you
are watching two screens, your television and your PC or laptop,
it makes it a much more enriching experience," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other sites covering the event include Hollywood.com. It
promises to give visitors backstage passes, complete updates with
soundbites and chat rooms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Representative Advocates China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The agreement between China
and the United States on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is mutually beneficial to both countries and
contributes to the long-term U.S.-China relations, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshelfsky said here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, she said, the agreement will create enormous
opportunities for American exports and export-related jobs, for
continued China's economic reform and for the global trading
system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience of more than 100 people at a meeting
hosted by Town Hall Los Angeles, Barshelfsky said that China, one
of the largest countries in the world, should not be isolated from
world trade.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the importance of China's accession to the WTO and
urging U.S. Congress to approve the Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status for China, Barshelfsky said that she
expects the United States to double its exports to China in the
following years under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The historic bilateral market access agreement between China
and the United States, which sets forth the terms for China's
accession to the WTO, was reached last November after seven years
of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barshelfsky said that she expects U.S. congress to approve the
PNTR status for China before the end of May.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Philadelphia 76ers forward
George Lynch will be sidelined for two weeks after he sprained a
ligament in his right knee Wednesday night, the team said.

Lynch was injured less than two minutes into action. He was
battling for rebound position when Raptors center Antonio Davis
crashed into his right knee, knocking Lynch to the floor.

The preliminary diagnosis was a sprain rather than a tear and
appeared to be similar to the injury he suffered last season, when
he missed seven games.

Lynch was averaging 9.6 points and 8.0 rebounds in 66 games
this season, his second with the Sixers and seventh in the NBA. He

<HEADLINE> Highways to Link All of China's Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A highway will be built in Medog
County in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the only
county in China presently without access to highways.
</P>
<P>
A special team organized by the Second Surveying and Designing
Institute of the Ministry of Railways will go to the county to
choose the best route for the highway next month, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Work on the highway will be very difficult due to geological
conditions. Medog is located south of the Yarlung Zangbo River,
with many steep mountains and deep valleys, and the county is also
in a region with the highest amount of rainfall in China.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are confident of selecting the best route and
adding Medog to the national highway network," said an official
with the surveying and designing institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), one of the country's four leading commercial
banks, plans to provide 120 billion yuan (14.56 billion U.S.
dollars) in loans for fixed asset investment projects this year.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said today that the ICBC will continue to
increase its lending to highway, power, telecommunications, and
other infrastructure projects, and inject more into hi-tech and
new industries, such as biological engineering, new energy sources,
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC will choose a number of profitable and large
enterprises and groups to develop long-term and steady cooperative
relations, while suspending loans to loss-making, resource-
consuming, and polluting enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As for lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, hi-tech
firms with efficient management systems will be given priority,
ICBC sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large proportion of the bank's loans will go to
technological upgrading projects in key industries and key
enterprises, as well as those involving huge overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also extend its support to western regions for
the construction of local infrastructure and enterprise
restructuring. The proportion of its loans going to western
development projects will be increased considerably this year,
according to the spokesman.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Since beginning of this year,
China's 32 publishing houses have published 72 books on economic
developments in western China.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that books about the large-scale development of

</P>
<P>
The Beijing Xidan Book Mansion has opened a special counter for
over 20 kinds of books on western development, and some of these
books have already sold out.
</P>
<P>
The State Press and Publication Administration and the State
Ethnic Affairs Commission have collected 10 million yuan over the
past four years to support western regions, especially those of
ethnic minorities, to develop the publishing sector.
</P>
<P>
Experts also note that there is much to be done to develop
cultural resources in western China, which will help stimulate

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Continued Efforts on Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official has
urged to continue exercising effective control over population
growth in China, reduce the birth rate, and improve the quality of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The issue is vital to the country's socialist modernization and
it is in the long-term interests of the Chinese nation regarding
its existence and development.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, a state councilor and secretary-general of the
State Council, made the remarks at a national teleconference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced a historic change in the reproduction of
its population as it has entered the period of low birth rate, the
state councilor said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official noted, family planning will remain a
tough task in the country as in the coming decade, its population
is expected to increase by 10 million every year.
</P>
<P>
Wang called the recent resolution on family planning made by
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the State Council a "guiding document" for the work on population
and family planning.
</P>
<P>
The work of family planning should be centered on the overall
development of human being, he said, urging that the people's
status as the master of family planning be respected and their
legal rights be protected.

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls for Int'l Efforts to Resolve Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan President Rafiq Tarar
Thursday urged the international community to facilitate the
solution of the long-standing Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the Pakistan Day parade here, Tarar expressed the
hope that the world would not act as a "silent spectator" over the
dispute and "would try to realize the promises made to Kashmiri
people through the United Nations by the entire world community."
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is a disputed area on the upper subcontinent of which
Pakistan controls some one third and India holds the rest and over
which the two South Asian neighbors have fought two wars during
the past half century.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations passed a resolution in 1949 calling for the
plebiscite of Kashmiris to determine the belongingness of the area.
However, the resolution has never been implemented.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Islamabad's unequivocal support for Kashmiris'
freedom movement, Tarar said his country wants a peaceful
settlement of the Kashmir issue as it "is an issue linked to the
survival of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believed in peace and did not intend to engage in any
arms race, the president said, adding "but we are fully capable to
give telling responses to any aggression."
</P>
<P>
He referred to the Kargil conflict last summer, which went so
close to a fourth Pakistan-India war, as "a glittering example"of
such "telling responses."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on Thursday is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the
Lahore Resolution that led to the birth of the Muslim country on
the subcontinent.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Dissolved into PNG Local Water System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Up to 150 kilograms of deadly
cyanide has dissolved into a local water system in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) after a crate of the chemical was accidentally
dropped from a helicopter, an Australian mining company admitted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on Tuesday as the company, Dome Resources,
was transporting two one-ton boxes of the pellets to the Tolukuma
gold mine, where the chemical is used for processing gold ore.
</P>
<P>
Twenty kilometers short of the mine, one package broke away
from a sling underneath the helicopter, plunged into the jungle
area, about 85 kilometers north of Port Moresby, and smashed apart
on impact.
</P>
<P>
Dome Managing Director Silver said some of the cyanide would
have dissolved in the rain and washed into local streams but there
would be no major environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
"Something like 100 to 150 kilos would probably have dissolved,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately the area in which it has landed is very sparsely
populated and it's an area which doesn't have a lot of streams
flowing in it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dome Resources said clean-up teams had recovered up to 70
percent of the one ton of the cyanide dropped into jungle.
</P>
<P>
Silver said topsoil was being stripped from the immediate area
and taken to the mine for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Other chemicals are being used to neutralise the cyanide, he
said.
</P>
<P>
PNG disaster authorities have warned local villagers not to
drink from nearby rivers.
</P>
<P>
Even small quantities of cyanide can be lethal if ingested.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace compared the incident with the recent cyanide
poisoning of rivers in central Europe by a Romanian mine half-
owned by Australia's Esmeralda Exploration.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said the PNG accident was another blow to the image
of Australian mining.

<HEADLINE> Stricter Laws Called for after PNG Cyanide Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A cyanide accident in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) highlighted the need for stronger laws governing
Australian companies operating overseas, the Australian Democrats
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats environment spokesman Andrew Bartlett said a
voluntary code of environmental management is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"This highlights the need for environmental protection laws to
have some sort of binding effect on Australian companies operating
overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just Australia's reputation but the reputation of
the Australian companies operating overseas," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Australian mining company Dome Resources admitted that up to
150 kilograms of deadly cyanide may have dissolved into a local
water system in PNG after a ton of the chemical was accidentally
dropped from a helicopter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dome Managing Director Michael Silver assured the community
that the company was using chemicals to try to neutralize the
cyanide, but said he could not guarantee nobody would be adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
Bartlett said holding out hope is not good enough, with people
and the environment under threat of contamination.
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to do a lot more than just hope that people
will not be put in danger," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have legal enforceable requirements that every step
is taken to prevent people being put in danger and the environment
placed in danger," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bartlett has joined the Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown in
urging the government to tighten the voluntary code after an
Australian mining company was linked to a cyanide spill in Romania
in February.

<HEADLINE> EU, Nigeria Sign Development Funding Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and Nigeria
signed here on Wednesday three development funding agreements
worth some 32.8 million euros (one euro is about one U.S. dollar),
signaling the restoration of such assistance after the country
resumed civil rule last year.
</P>
<P>
These agreements were signed by Philip Asiodu, chief economic
adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo and Poul Nieson, EU
commissioner for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, about 21 million of the sum will go into
"micro- projects programs" for Nigeria's troubled Niger delta
region and be used for much needed water supply, inter-village
transport, health and income generation projects.
</P>
<P>
Ten million euros will be allocated to help the economic
management capacity project in a bid to strengthen key government
institutions such as the central bank, the Finance Ministry, the
Federal Office of Statistics and the National Planing Commission.
</P>
<P>
The third area the aid goes is programming study which will
enable Nigeria and the EU to establish guidelines for mid-term and
long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreements during the ongoing 30th session of the
African, Caribbean and Pacific Associates-EU Joint Parliamentary
Assembly, Nieson described the signature as "tangible proof of the
EU's commitment to its future relations with the Africa's most
populous country."
</P>
<P>
Funding of major EU projects in Nigeria was suspended five
years ago to protest alleged human rights abuses by the military
regime of Sani Abacha, who died in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were lifted in June 1999 after the country
embraced democracy in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Arrivals in Tanzania Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The flow of refugees from
the war- ravaged Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi has
drastically dropped in the last two weeks, according to officials
in Tanzania's western Kigoma Region.
</P>
<P>
They were quoted by the Guardian newspaper as saying on
Thursday that after being overwhelmed by daily arrivals of up to
300 refugees at the height of clashes between rebel and government
forces in both Burundi and the DRC, refugees were trickling in at
an average of two a day in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in Kigoma, between March 9 and 19, no new
refugee was registered at the two major reception centers of
Kibirizi and Kibondo.
</P>
<P>
While at the Mugunzu reception center in the same region, only
253 new arrivals from Burundi were recorded during the first week
of this month.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the drop of refugee arrivals to what
they described as a "restoration of stability" in Burundi and the
DRC.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Sign SACU Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to resolve outstanding issues over the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) and to sign the agreement as quick as
possible, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers had for two years been waiting for the signing of the
SACU agreement to enable them to fulfil their export quotas, Ajay
Vashee, president of Zambia National Farmers Union, was quoted by
the paper as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delay has made the farmers lose an opportunity to increase
the quotas given under the South Africa veterinary protocol, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's delay to finalize the SACU agreement
is killing Zambia's export potential in beef, oil crops and
fruits.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia is expected to export 10,000 tons of soya
beans, 1,500 tons of beef, 5,000 tons each of groundnut and soya
bean cakes and two million litres of orange juice.
</P>
<P>
Other quotas include 1,000 tons each of dried beans, soya bean
oil and cotton cake, 500 tons of sunflower cake, 210 tons of green
peas and 135 tons of baby vegetables.
</P>
<P>
According to Vashee, large scale farmers have the capacity to
fulfil these quotas and if the agreement had been signed they
would have created room for small and medium scale producers to
satisfy local demand.
</P>
<P>
SACU agreement now has a membership of five countries,
including Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Botswana and Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Top Grain Producer Boosts Grain Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in northeast
China, the biggest Chinese grain producer, is expected to enjoy an
increase of 365 million kilograms in grain production capacity
this year.
</P>
<P>
The increased grain production capacity is mainly attributed to
the 224 agricultural development zones and 20 units of modern
agricultural demonstration which were newly built last year,
according to provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
As the top grain producer in the nation, Heilongjiang turned
out 3.07 billion kilograms of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang injected a total of 800 million yuan (96 million U.
S. dollars) into agricultural development projects in 1999,
upgrading more than 173,300 ha of low-quality farming fields,
improving rural electric power grids and purchasing new farming
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Ten new high-tech agricultural parks were also initiated in the
province last year, with an aim to popularize high-yield and
better-quality strains of farm products and experiment with new
growing techniques.
</P>
<P>
In a move to further restructure its agricultural sector,
Heilongjiang has oriented its agro-projects to quality rather than
quantity, resulting in the popularization of high-quality crop,
grain and soybean and the introduction of a series of special
varieties such as European sturgeon.

TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
totaled 1,181 billion yen (11 billion U.S. dollars) in February,
up 26.8 percent from a year earlier for the first rise in 11
months, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus increase was attributed to a steep rise in exports
which outweighed a gain in imports.
</P>
<P>
Exports jumped 15.0 percent to 4,134 billion yen (38.6 billion
dollars), while imports surged 10.9 percent to 2,953 billion yen (
27.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports rapidly grew on a robust demand for Japanese
information and telecommunications equipment. Shipments of
semiconductors and related electronic parts, optical equipment for
scientific use and telecom equipment rose 30.8 percent, 28.1
percent and 53.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States climbed 66.0 percent to 687.3 billion yen (6.4 billion
dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
With Asian neighbors, Japan's merchandise trade surplus soared
94.4 percent to 403.7 billion yen (3.8 billion dollars), with
exports surging 32.0 percent and imports growing by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the 15-member European Union (EU)
went up 5.8 percent to 369.4 billion yen (3.5 billion dollars) for
the first upsurge in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustments for
seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 107.11 to the dollar in February, up 6.6
percent from the previous year's level.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Size of Foreign Aid Rises Sharply in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A sharp gap between commitment and
disbursement of aid money has inflated the size of foreign aid in
pipeline over the years, and the situation is unlikely to change
because of the donors' changed aid policies, said a government
document presented Thursday in a special cabinet meeting for
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The document, prepared for placing in the next Paris
Development Forum meeting scheduled on April 13-14, estimated the
size of the aid money in the pipeline at 6.327 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of current fiscal year (1999-2000).
</P>
<P>
The amount went up from 4.963 billion dollars in 1998-1999 and
4.693 billion dollars in 1997-1998, showing that the pipeline size
of the foreign aid was increasing faster than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The document attributed the sharp increase of the pipeline
money to the slow disbursement of aid against the annual
commitments.
</P>
<P>
"As witnessed from the foreign aid statistics, disbursement is
not increasing significantly despite a rise in commitments," said
the document, stressing the need for efficient implementation of
projects.
</P>
<P>
The document said the development partners of Bangladesh have
changed their attitudes and strategies in making fresh aid
commitments as they are willing to see that aid is being used for
socio-economic changes and strengthening the base of economic
management.
</P>
<P>
They also laid importance on poverty alleviation, eradication
of corruption, establishment of transparency and accountability in
governance, liberalization of economy and consolidation of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
While going through the recent development in the economy, the
document projected a 5.5 percent growth in the gross domestic
products in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The document also projected a sharp increase in fiscal deficit
for the current fiscal year, the amount of which is estimated at
120.27 billion taka (2.31 billion dollars), showing a significant
jump from 100.64 billion taka (1.93 billion dollars) in the fiscal
deficit during the 1998-1999 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Duty-Free Access of Bangladeshi Products to EU Likely in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The much-cherished comprehensive
trade agreement granting duty-free access of Bangladeshi products
to the European Union market is likely to be signed in May,
Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil was quoted Thursday by The New
Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the trade agreement was first scheduled on March
20 but deferred to April 10 due to U.S. President Clinton's visit
to Dhaka on the day. Now it has been deferred again to sometime in
May.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister said following the European Union, other
important countries like Japan are also likely to permit duty-free
access of Bangladeshi exports.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Bangladesh's approach to get duty-free access to the
U.S.market, Jalil said they had got positive response from the U.S.
side during Clinton's visit on March 20.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bangladesh mission in the United States would
closely monitor and follow up the issue that has been raised
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary, we will send high-level delegation to pursue the
issues," Jalil said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Large-Scale Housing Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to build 7,500
houses under a large-scale housing program to cater to the
increasing demand for housing, the Board of Investment (BOI) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The BOI said in a statement that under the program, 25 new
projects will be launched in urban areas with each project
consisting of 300 houses to be completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of the houses will be allocated for low and
middle income families, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Task Force on Housing and Urban
Development, Sri Lanka has been short of about 170,000 urban
houses by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2005 over 500,000 houses will
be needed, of which more than half will be in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The BOI will soon call for proposals from private sector
investors to build new houses under the housing program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program the government will provide the land on
concessional terms and will provide common infrastructure upto the
periphery of the housing project sites, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said three large projects providing upto 4,000 houses were
under construction by private sector developers who have been
given similar concessions in the government's effort to expand
housing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill Pressuring OPEC to Increase Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday approved a bill pressuring the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise
production and reaffirming President Bill Clinton's authority to
cut U.S. aid and arms sales to OPEC members and nations that fix
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The 382-to-38 vote in favor of the bill came just five days
before OPEC meets in Vienna to decide whether to boost production.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, offered by Benjamin Gilman, the New York
Republican who chairs the House International Relations Committee,
requires the president to report to Congress within 30 days on
which OPEC nations have fixed oil prices, and negotiate with other
countries to "reduce, suspend or terminate" military assistance
and arms exports to countries found to have "engaged in price
fixing."
</P>
<P>
This "spotlights OPEC's price-fixing activities" and "sends a
clear message to the administration and to the oil producing
nations that oil price fixing is harmful to the American consumer,
" said Gilman.
</P>
<P>
The measure prompted a heated partisan debate over the Clinton
administration's energy policies and whether the bill, in fact,
would have any substantive impact on current, or even future oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Democratic opponents to the measure said the legislation had no
teeth and that if the Republican-controlled Congress really wanted
to reduce U.S. dependence on OPEC oil, it should pass tax credits
and funding for research that develop alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the legislation
would interfere with his diplomatic efforts with OPEC oil
ministers, and therefore the administration would oppose the bill.
Similar legislation is also pending in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
OPEC must boost crude oil output by about 2 million barrels per
day to return world stocks and prices to normal levels, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

<HEADLINE> East China City Residents Donate 14 Tons of Blood in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100,000 people in Nanjing,
capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, donated a total of
14 tons of blood last year, an official with a local blood
donation center said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ningwu, director of the Blood Donation Office at Nanjing
Red Cross Blood Center, said the donated blood is enough to meet
the city's clinical use.
</P>
<P>
With a population of over two million, Nanjing started a blood
donation campaign in 1986, one of the earliest among all Chinese
cities, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Since China's Blood Donation Law took effect in 1998, more and
more Nanjing people have joined the campaign for blood donation
with leaders at all levels taking the lead, he said.
</P>
<P>
Six vans for blood donations are shuttling around the city to
collect blood from volunteers and the campaign slogan "donating
blood is love, courage and sacrifice" has touched many hearts.
</P>
<P>
These vans collect more than half of the city's donated blood,
according to sources with the blood center.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the campaign, a special building for blood
donation was recently set up along the street of downtown Nanjing,
which is believed to be the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The special building will facilitate people to donate blood
with its complete equipment and efficient service, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Blood Donation Law, a blood donator or his
or her relatives can receive free blood donations three times the
amount he or she gives.

<P>
TAIYUAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 16,000 cataract
patients in north China's Shanxi Province have regained their eye
sight in the past two years thanks to the efforts of members of a
state-sponsored medical team who performed surgery free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The team was part of a "Sight First China Action" program that
was launched in 1997 by the Ministry of Health, the Chinese
Disabled Persons Federation, and Lions Club International.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed to help 1.75 million Chinese people regain
eye sight and train 11,000 ophthalmologists for rural hospitals
across the country in the 1997-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
They began working in the province in 1997 and have performed a
total of 17,600 operations on people suffering from cataracts in
poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
The team members will continue to perform such operations in a
period of five years for 46,000 patients in the province's remote
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Unveils Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Regional
Bureau of Xinhua News Agency was unveiled on Thursday Morning at
the news mansion at No 5, Sharp Street West, Wanchai of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the unveiling ceremony, Bureau Director Zhang
Guoliang said the Asia-Pacific region, which is adjacent to China,
maintains close ties with China in various fields, and the region
also enjoys significant international status with its rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Xinhua News Agency is China's state news agency and
has been witnessing continuous expansion in the drive to be a
worldwide press institution.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has always attached great importance to the news
coverage in the Asia-Pacific region and set up its regional
headquarters in Hong Kong in 1984 to coordinate the news reporting
of the branches in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demands of its development, Xinhua has officially
registered the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said Zhang, who is also
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong SAR Branch.
</P>
<P>
He noted the unveiling of the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau,
along with the launch of the Hong Kong SAR Branch of Xinhua on
January 18 this year, shows the importance attached by Xinhua to
the Hong Kong SAR and marks a new leaf in Xinhua's undertaking in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Xinhua has maintained fine ties with the people from
all walks of life in Hong Kong, especially with the media for a
long time, and also benefited from Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
As a registered press institution, he pledged, Xinhua will more
resolutely uphold the "one country, two systems" principle, more
conscientiously abide by the Basic Law and other laws of Hong Kong
SAR, and make more contribution to the implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle and the maintenance of the
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has now more than 100 overseas branches, including five
regional bureaus.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau, the first overseas regional
bureau of Xinhua, offers news service directly to some 500
subscribers. It released 64 pieces of English news, 26 pieces of
Chinese news and 45 pieces of photo news every day on average in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Those who were present at the unveiling ceremony were Wang
Fengchao, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR; Tang Guoqiang, deputy
commissioner of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR; and
representatives from some Hong Kong-based media.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto Fit to Face Questioning: Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto is healthy enough to face questioning for alleged
corruption during his three-decade rule, according to a report
from an independent medical examination team.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was declared medically fit after undergoing two
examinations last week, the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted a source
close to the state-appointed medical team as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the source would not say whether questioning the 78-year-
old former ruler would be feasible since he has trouble in
speaking.
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm the report, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said that it was possible to assume Soeharto was fit to face
questioning.
</P>
<P>
"I have read the report and it is possible to conclude that
from the report of the RSCM (Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital) medical
team it is possible to hold further questioning on Pak Harto (
Soeharto)," Marzuki said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post, the Attorney General's Office
received the report from the state-appointed doctors on Wednesday.
Earlier the six-member medical team was seen visiting President
Abdurrahman Wahid at presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Director of Corruption Affairs in the Attorney General's Office
Chaerul Umam acknowledged that the report had been received but
refused to divulge whether it had given a green light for
prosecutors to start questioning Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was examined by six doctors from RSCM twice last week
to determine whether he is fit to face questioning. The doctors
included an internist, a cardiologist, a neurologist and a
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
The decision to conduct an independent medical examination on
Soeharto was taken after the former president's lawyers insisted
that their client was medically unfit to undergo questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was twice hospitalized last year, once for a mild
stroke and again for intestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect for alleged corruption during
his rule after Marzuki decided to reopen the case in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business magazine Forbes last year estimated Soeharto's
family fortune at some 4 billion U.S. dollars. Time magazine, also
from U.S., has put the figure at about 15 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Join ASEAN Scheme to Monitor Foreign  Currency Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will join a cooperative
effort by ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries
to monitor foreign currency traffic to counter speculative
practices by international money brokers in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia should and will take part in such a cooperation, or
else we will get into trouble," Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor
Dono Iskandar Djojosubroto said.
</P>
<P>
Dono just attended an ASEAN Central Bank Forum in Bandar Seri
Begawan, capital of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy of monitoring foreign exchange traffic with
countries within the region of ASEAN had been recommended by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Indonesia supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had also strongly suggested to widen the cooperation to
other countries in the Asia and Pacific region such as China,
Japan and South Korea, Dono was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Dono, another outstanding topic discussed at a
meeting of ASEAN finance ministers in Bandar Seri Begawan was
Japan's proposal for the creation of an Asian Monetary Fund (AMF).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, forwarded by Japan for the first time in 1997,
was fully supported by ASEAN countries despite strong opposition
from the United States and the European Economic Community which
had argued that the AMF's activities would duplicate the IMF's.

Ogata told a news conference that over the past year ethnic
Albanian leaders have not only been against the return of non-
Albanian refugees, but have also sought to drive all remaining non-
Albanian residents out of the Yugoslav province, in serious
violation of the UNHCR principle providing for the return of all
refugees.
</P>
<P>
She said the UNHCR mission in Kosovo will do its best to
persuade Serbs in Kosovo not to leave their homeland.
</P>
<P>
During her visits to refugee camps in Smederevo and Kragujevac
on the same day, Ogata said that although all the refugees at the
camps said they wanted to return home, "safety conditions for
their return do not exist."
</P>
<P>
She reiterated the U.N. position that all ethnic groups,
including Albanians and Serbs, should co-exist in Kosovo
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Ogata arrived in Belgrade earlier Wednesday for a visit to
Yugoslavia, during which she will tour some towns in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Seeks Resumption of EBRD Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine on Wednesday urged the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to resume
loans to support the country's construction of new nuclear
stations.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting EBRD Vice President Charles Frank,
Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko told a press conference
that the Ukrainian government has been "responsibly" meeting its
commitments under agreements on bilateral cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government would shut down the Chernobyl
nuclear station in accordance with regulations in the memorandum
signed in 1996 with the Group of Seven industrialized countries
and the Commission of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure Ukraine's energy supply after the shutdown,
Yushchenko said he hoped the EBRD loans earmarked for the
construction of nuclear stations in Rovno and Khmelnitskiaya will
be in place at an early date.
</P>
<P>
As of March 15, the bank had endorsed for Ukraine 1.4 billion
euros (about 1.32 billion U.S. dollars) in credits for 33 programs,
but only 380 million euros (about 358 million dollars) had been
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Frank said the former Soviet republic has not fully carried out
its commitments, stressing that his bank will resume the loans for
building new nuclear power stations only after it sees the
timetable for the close of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear station in Chernobyl developed terrible leaks in
April 1986 and repeatedly went wrong afterwards. Under the 1996
memo, Ukraine is to close the plant during the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Globe 2000 Environment Conference Opens in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Globe 2000 Conference and
Trade Fair opened here Wednesday kicking off a three-day
international discussion on systematic development of business and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Minister of Environment David Anderson said in an
opening speech that development calls for a new architecture based
on prudence, and the old style of environment management that
responded only to immediate problems should be discarded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates from some 50 countries, he emphasized
that human activity places a great strain on the global eco-sphere.
</P>
<P>
"With the population doubling every 80 years, we are on a
course that will exceed global productivity in several generations,
unless we drastically change our patterns of consumption," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that over the past 20 years, though
economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development have grown by 40 percent, human activity has, at the
same time, increased production of waste by an identical 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we have not yet turned enough of our attention to
efficiency," the minister said, urging the world to join in
creating the new environment architecture to ensure a strong
economy and a better quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people attended the sixth biennial conference in
the western coast city of Canada, which focuses on three major
topics: energy and climate change, corporate environmental
strategies and global environmental markets.
</P>
<P>
About 400 technology exhibits are displayed to promote business
solutions to global environmental challenges such as climate
change and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The Globe 2000 Conference and Trade Fair is sponsored by the
Canadian government's Climate Change Action Fund and organized by
the Globe Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to
developing environmental business.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- FIFA Wednesday said it was to
consider granting media credentials to journalists who publish
their reports only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Zurich, FIFA said it would consider
creating a new category for online editors before the 2002 World
Cup in South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"In line with other major international sports organizations,
FIFA has so far refused to grant credentials to specialist online
media on the grounds of potential rights infringements and limited
space at events.
</P>
<P>
"With the Internet coming of age and being embraced on a truly
global scale, FIFA will reconsider its stance."
</P>
<P>
The media committee of the FIFA stressed that credentials would
only be considered for editors of online text services, not for
television or radio. Broadcasting rights are granted to specific
media organizations in contracted deals.

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Olajuwon Should Stop Playing for up to Three Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Doctors wanted center of the
Houston Rockets Hakeem Olajuwon to stop playing for up to three
weeks because of his disease.
</P>
<P>
After examining the NBA star, Dr. James Muntz said Wednesday: "
He is still having problems so we asked him to take some time off.
" "We told him he would probably be out two to three weeks and
that's getting toward the end of the season."
</P>
<P>
The NBA regular season ends April 19.
</P>
<P>
37-year-old Olajuwon was diagnosed March 1 with a disease that
restricts the flow of air through his bronchial passages during
heavy exercise, causing spasms in his lungs.
</P>
<P>
The breathing problem has limited Olajuwon's playing time. He
is averaging 24 minutes a game for the season. His numbers this
season are 10 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon's career averages were 23.6 points and 11.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon missed seven weeks earlier in the season to recover
from hernia surgery.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Female Weightlifter Indriyani Injuries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian national weightlifting
coach Imron Rosadi expressed disappointment with Sri Indriyani's
injury, which likely will prevent her from competing in the 2000
Olympics Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
While accompanying Indriyani to the National Sports Council (
KONI) sports science commission, Imron said he would not force the
lifter to continue training because it could destroy her career.
</P>
<P>
Indriyani, who competes in the 48-kilogram division, was
training for the Olympics. She injured her right knee while
attempting to lift 110 kilograms earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"She unexpectedly injured herself. I have been training her and
other weightlifters to become champions. I don't have any
intention to hurt them," Imron was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Imron said during her Olympic training in Lampung province,
Indriyani had approached world-record lifts.
</P>
<P>
"She could lift 90kg in the snatch, or six kilograms better
than the world record of 84 kgs. She also lifted 115kg in the
clean and 120kg in the standard jerk. In the clean and jerk,
Indriyani could lift 112.5kg. She was close to the world record of
113kg," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imron also said Indriyani managed a total lift of 200kg in
October and on February 18. The world record was 192.5kg.
</P>
<P>
Indriyani said she would undergo physiotherapy to recover from
her injury. She was optimistic she would be able to compete in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Imron said another weightlifter Winarni, who competes in the 53-
kg division, had recovered from typhoid and had begun training.
</P>
<P>
Winarni can lift 117.5kg in the clean and jerk and would likely
have equaled the world record of 121kg before getting typhoid. In
the snatch, Winarni's lift equals the world record of 97.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"After lifting in the snatch, she got typhoid that night. I'm
only human, I can't make any mathematical estimations about
Winarni's chances in the Olympics. We are faced with health
problems here. After all, this is bad luck. This is a tough
challenge for me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's female weightlifters earned three tickets to the
Olympics after finishing eighth at the World Weightlifting
Championship in Athens last year, with one gold and four silver
medals. The Indonesian Weightlifting, Powerlifting and
Bodybuilding Association is training four female weightlifters for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Rumbewas, who competes in the 48kg division, is training
in South Kalimantan and Supeni (53kg) trains in South Jakarta.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Starting from mid-June, a large
wastewater treatment plant in Beijing will daily channel 100,000
tons of purified wastewater to spray the downtown roads as one of
the water-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest one in the Chinese capital, is
expected to be initiated soon and completed in mid-June at the
Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant. And then every day 200,000 tons
of purified wastewater, instead of tap water, will be transferred
to the Beijing No.1 Thermal Power Plant and another 100,000 tons
be used to water trees and grass patches and clean the main roads
in the city, said related officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources and the Beijing municipal
government predict that the city's annual water demand will be
around five billion tons annually before 2005, with a shortfall of
800 million to 1.6 billion tons a year, while the figures for the
year 2010 will be 5.2-5.4 billion tons and 1.2-2 billion tons
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Environment Monitoring Network Built Along Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
built up an environment monitoring network in the Huaihe River's
drainage area to control pollution and improve environment.
</P>
<P>
The central government has invested 16 million yuan in the
province to build the environment monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the environment monitoring network, the
province will be able to launch a general pollution control
project, and prevent serious pollution accidents from happening.
</P>
<P>
Environment monitoring is one of the major environment
management measures in the province. In 1989, Anhui Province led
the country in establishing water quality monitoring stations
along the Huaihe River, which played a positive role in reducing
water pollution of the river.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe drainage area is one of the major grain producing
areas in China, with one sixth of the country's population and
arable land.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, a large-scale pollution control program has been
launched in the area and by the end of 1997, all the polluting
enterprises along the river had met the state standards of
pollution discharge control.

<HEADLINE> EU Probes Microsoft Purchase of British Cable Company Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Wednesday that it has extended its anti-trust investigation into
Microsoft's planned purchase of MediaOne's stake in the British
cable company Telewest Communications.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of 29.7 percent of MediaOne's stake in Telewest
Communications would give Microsoft joint control of the cable
company with the Liberty Media Group.
</P>
<P>
European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, "We
have decided to open a full second-phase investigation and will
make a detailed assessment of the impact of the transaction on
competition conditions in various areas of the digital cable
industry."
</P>
<P>
The EU regulations allow the commission, its executive body and
anti-trust authority, four months to decide whether to clear the
deal.
</P>
<P>
The commission rarely blocks mergers or acquisitions, but
demands that competition concerns be met.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft agreed last May to buy the stake in Britain's number
two cable firm as part of a complex three-way deal.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a statement that it had serious concerns
that the deal would strengthen Telewest's existing dominant
position as an exclusive supplier of cable services to consumers
within the area of its franchise.

LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Lazio broke one of the longest
unbeaten streak in modern football history to take one of the last
two berths in the quarter-finals of the European Champions League

for the Wenzhou-Fuzhou Railway line which will stretch along the
southeast China coast from Wenzhou, China's most famous production
center of small commodities in Zhejiang Province, to Fujian
Province starting at Fuding and ending at Fuzhou, the provincial
capital of Fujian.
</P>

The new coastal railway line will have a total length of 360 km,
consisting of 263 km in Fujian and 97 km in Zhejiang. It is
estimated to cost seven billion yuan, five billion yuan of which
will be provided by Fujian and the remainder by Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Mountains and hills cover over 90 percent of Fujian's land,
with an area of 120,000 sq km. Building of the two new railways
will help promote local economic development and lift more poor

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has appointed Martina Hingis, the world number one women's tennis
player, as its Goodwill Ambassador for Polio Eradication.
</P>
<P>
In her new role, Hingis Wednesday launched a campaign to raise
awareness and funds to help eradicate polio, a highly infectious
disease which can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
"As WHO Ambassador, I will do everything I can to smash this
frightening disease off the planet," said Hingis on launching "
Match Point Against Polio". "I think all children should have the
chance to be active, to use their legs to run around the
playground, to swim, kick a ball, or play tennis."
</P>
<P>
"Match Point Against Polio" will promote polio eradication and
encourage large pulic support and participation throughout the
year, particularly at the Grand Slam tennis tournaments. These
include the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.
</P>
<P>
As part of her campaign, Hingis will travel to a polio-endemic
country where she will help immunize children against the disease.

<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- French striker Frederic Kanoute
has joined West Ham on loan until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The former France Under-21 player, currently with Lyon, could
now be in line for a home debut against Wimbledon on Sunday. A
spokesman for the French club said: "At the end of this loan
period the player will come back to Lyon where he is under
contract until 2003."
</P>
<P>
The recruitment of 22-year-old Kanoute follows the news that
Joe Cole has signed a lucrative two-year extension to his contract
which ties him to West Ham until 2004.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old midfielder has broken into the first team this
season and won his first England Under-21 cap last month.
</P>
<P>
Cole's new deal is part of West Ham's aim to keep their young
stars at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
Michael Carrick, also 18, has also extended his contract until
2004. England stars Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand, both 21, are
signed up until 2006.
</P>
<P>
Company secretary Graham Mackrell said: "It's great news for
the club. We've tied up the people we want."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson has rounded on Manchester United's critics, claiming they
are all jealous of the club's success.
</P>
<P>
He is angry at the flak aimed at his players over their antics
in recent matches against Middlesbrough and Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson admitted they overstepped the mark and chastised them
at the time, but he claimed despite these incidents his players
are still the best behaved in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
He felt United have been singled out unfairly and that they are
hated even more because of their Treble success of last season.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics show that Manchester United are one of the best
behaved teams in the country, in spite of all the high-pressure
games that we play in," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, other recent incidents have helped to place increased
focus on the conduct of my team.
</P>
<P>
"I accept that we're not exempt from the situation, but it is
wrong to victimise Manchester United when the whole country is the
same. We're getting criticised for protesting, yet we're in a
society now where everyone is more confrontational. Everyone
contests decisions of all kinds. Players argue every call and it's
not just United.
</P>
<P>
"The nation was warming towards us in the build-up to last
season's Champions League final, though not everyone because there
is so much tribalism in this country," he said.

<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- English football legend George
Best will have to stay in hospital for at least another week, his
doctor said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old had hoped to leave the private Cromwell
Hospital in west London a week ago after being admitted with
alcohol-related liver problems.
</P>
<P>
But the former Manchester United star has been told he faces at
least another week's stay in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Professor Roger Williams, from the liver unit where Best is
being treated, said: "There have been further slight but definite
improvements over the past 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Best is feeling well in himself and is fully ambulant but
it is likely he will be in hospital for at least another week."
</P>
<P>
Best was taken to hospital on 8 March complaining of "severe
stomach pains".
</P>
<P>
He has now given his 27-year-old wife Alex a pledge that he
will stop drinking.
</P>
<P>
His personal assistant Philip Hughes said: "George will be
quite happy to spend another two or three weeks in hospital, or
whatever it takes, to get his health back to normal."

BEIRUT, March 23 (Xinhua) -- One militiaman of pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and two others wounded Thursday
morning in attacks launched by Hezbollah guerrillas in Baet Leef in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel shortly bombed several villages in the western sector of
the Israeli occupied security zone as retaliation, damaging four
houses and a mosque. But there were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Syrian-backed resistance movement
Amal issued a statement, saying they launched two missile and
mortar attacks on Israeli positions and hit the targets Thursday
noon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a so-called "security zone" in 1985 in south
Lebanon with the claimed aim to protect its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
On March 5, Israeli cabinet decided to withdraw Israeli troops
from south Lebanon by July this year, with or without an agreement
with Lebanon and its powerbroker Syria. But Hezbollah repeatedly
announced they will not forgive the SLA militiamen that were
regarded as traitors.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
waging a guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli troops and the SLA

<HEADLINE> EU's Nomination of IMF Head Accepted: Portuguese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guterres announced the acceptance during the summit of EU heads
of state and government who are discussing the issue of employment
Thursday and Friday in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and German Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder congratulated Guterres on his way in which he
handled the delicate negotiations which led to the EU re-
nomination of Horst Koelher for the top job of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The post was left open after the departure of French incumbent
Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc originally nominated German deputy finance
minister Caio Koch-Weser for the post but the United States
opposed to the nomination on the ground that the German was not
well qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
The EU then nominated Horst Koelher as a substitute in the race
for the IMF managing director. Koelher currently runs the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the bank
channels international aid funds to the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Koelher is respected in Europe for his role in the preparation
for the creation of the single currency -- euro.
</P>
<P>
The post of IMF managing director has been customarily held by
a European while an American has been holding the top job of the
World Bank. But Stanley Fischer of the United States has joined
Japanese Eisuke Sakakibara in the pursuit for the IMF managing
director.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Achieve Breakthrough in Holocaust Compensation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 23 (Xinhua)-- Germany and the United States
Thursday made a key breakthrough in Berlin in their 11th round
negotiation over how to compensate the survivors of Nazi slave
labor system.
</P>
<P>
After more than one year of talks in Washington, Bonn, and
Berlin, the two governments, central and east European countries,
the Jewish groups, and the German business finally achieved an
agreement on the allocation of the 10-billion-mark German
foundation.
</P>
<P>
Under their plan, each former slave laborer in Nazi
concentration camps will get 15,000 mark as compensation, and
laborers forced to work in German firms in Nazi regime are due to
get 5,000 marks each.
</P>
<P>
Totally, over one million Nazi slave and forced labor victims
will get 8.10 billion marks as direct compensation. The sum will
reach 8.15 billion after being increased by interest earnings of
50 million marks.
</P>
<P>
And one billion marks are prepared for the losses of public
property caused by Nazi. Some 700 million marks will be allocated
for a "Future Fund" for historical and educational memorials.
</P>
<P>
The German cabinet Wednesday passed a draft "Foundation Law"
that committed the half-to-half contributions of German government
and business to the 10-billion-mark foundation. The bill is due be
passed in German parliament, the Bundestag, in this July.
</P>
<P>
A group of Switzer banks are expected to add further 100
million marks to German foundation initiative.
</P>
<P>
Two governmental representatives, Otto Graf Lambsdorff of
Germany and Stuart Eizenstat of the U.S., called Thursday's
agreement "a huge step forward."
</P>
<P>
"All participants defended their positions vigorously, but all
recognized the larger imperative of reaching agreement now, so
that the funds could promptly go to survivors," Eizenstat, U.S.
deputy Finance Secretary, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to report that all participants have agreed on
our joint proposal, this should not have been done without all
parties' flexibility and compromise," he added.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said the compromise was "a fair agreement that takes
account of the interests of all parties."
</P>
<P>
The German business is not fully satisfied with the agreement
while what it wanted, a "judicial conclusion" from Washington, is
remained for further talks as last important issue.
</P>
<P>
Under a German-U.S. agreement in last December, U.S. courts
will protect German companies from victims' further compensation
claims as repaying for their participation in the foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to Manfred Gentz, the representative of German
business in the talks, 676 German firms have agreed to join the
foundation initiative and they have paid 2.3 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
But Washington will still wait until the Bundestag passes the
Foundation Law before giving German business any promise, said
Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
"The final law will be the linchpin of the legal settlement, I
can not overemphasize this point," he said, adding, "the German
legal basis for the foundation will be examined carefully by our
courts."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Replaces Patriots in Gulf, South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has replaced
hundreds of Patriot missiles deployed in the Gulf and South Korea
after discovering a problem with the air defense system, the
Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told reporters
that the problem could be in the missile's ability to receive a
radio frequency downlink that helps guide them to their speeding
targets, although nothing had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The missiles were withdrawn from approximately 11 batteries in
the Gulf and South Korea. Each battery has about 64 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Raytheon Co., which build the weapon, said it was working with
the U.S. Army to find the cause of potential flaws in the system.
</P>
<P>
"Raytheon is working with the Army to identify and resolve the
problem," said Raytheon spokesman Dave Shea.

<HEADLINE> Legislation to Grant China PNTR Introduced in U.S. Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A bill was introduced in the U.
S. Senate Thursday to grant China permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) status.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was introduced by William Roth, Chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee and the committee's ranking Democrat,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to announce that this morning I and Senator Moyhihan
introduced in the Senate the legislation the President sent up to
Congress that would enact permanent normal trade relations for
China," Roth said at a hearing on U.S. trade with China.
</P>
<P>
"We will require the President's continued strong support and
an equally strong bipartisan effort here in Congress to ensure the
consideration and movement of this legislation," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton submitted the legislation of granting China
PNTR status to Congress earlier this month to ensure that U.S.
companies benefit from a landmark trade agreement between the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Republican-led Congress must grant China PNTR
in exchange for market opening by China, a country now enjoys PNTR
status only after an annual congressional review.
</P>
<P>
The vote on the legislation is considered to be the biggest
trade battle since the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (
NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The trade initiative enjoys strong support in the Senate, but
it faces opposition in the House of Representatives under pressure
of the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The White House, hoping to get the legislation approved by June,
is pressing for a swift vote in the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, responsible for trade legislation in the Senate,
is expected to approve the trade bill soon, Senate sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The vote on PNTR will not decide whether China gets into the
World Trade Organization (WTO). China will accede to the WTO
regardless of how Congress votes on PNTR," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
The Delaware Republican Senator said that the question before
Congress is whether U.S. exporters will gain access to the Chinese
market on the same terms as their competitors and whether the U.S.
will now forego the benefits of the U.S.-China trade deal signed
in November last year after 13 years of hard negotiations.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Representative For Iraq Phased Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The post of the United
Nations Special Representative For Iraq was being phased out
entirely, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Indian diplomat Prakash Shah was named by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan in 1998 as U.N. Special Representative for Iraq
to coordinate relations between Iraq and the United Nations,
especially in connection with U.N. arms inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last August his status was changed from that of a full-time U.
N. employee based in Baghdad to employment on an as needed basis,
returning to Iraq only when required.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the Security Council's new plan for
inspection and monitoring in Iraq, the Secretary-General considers
that a Special Representative is not required at this time,"
Eckhard said
</P>
<P>
"He has informed Mr. Shah and thanked him for his contribution
over the past two years as the Secretary-General's Special
Representative," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council last December adopted a
resolution on Iraq which created the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission to replace the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> IMF Appoints Koehler as New Managing Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on Thursday selected Germany's Horst Koehler as its new
managing director to succeed France's Michel Camdessus, who
resigned in mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today
agreed unanimously to select Horst Koehler as Managing Director
and Chairman of the Executive Board of the International Monetary
Fund," the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, a former German finance ministry official who now
heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was
the Europe Union's second candidate to head the IMF. The first
nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, withdrew from the race this month after
the United States said it would not support him.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply honored that the membership of the IMF has placed
its trust in me as its new managing director," Koehler said in a
statement released in London on Thursday. "I look forward to
working closely with all member countries and with the fund staff
to meet the challenges ahead."
</P>
<P>
Koehler, 57, will take office at a difficult time for the IMF,
which is under fire in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere for its
response to the world financial crisis of 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
A controversial report to U.S. Congress wants the IMF to curb
its lending activities sharply, eliminating concessionary loans to
poor countries and lending only to countries which had "pre-
qualified" for financial help.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Banking Committee on Thursday, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that some of the more
radical ideas could put U.S. security at risk by preventing the
lender from helping a wide range of countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that taken literally they would straitjacket these
institutions to the point where they would no longer be able to
advance America's core values," Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Demonstrate Outside EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- At least around 50,000 people took
to the Lisbon streets on Thursday to demand quality employment and
fight against poverty outside the European Union summit.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, organized by local trade unions, filed
through streets from downtown Lisbon to the old municipal
exhibition center that houses the two-day summit of EU heads of
state and government that is focusing on the issue of employment.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators came from various parts of the country and
from various professions. Some police even estimated the total
number of demonstrators as many as 100,000, unprecedented in the
Portuguese capital.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has long been haunting the EU citizens and the EU
leaders as well. EU-wide, some 15 million men and women remain
jobless, corresponding to 8.8 percent of the active population of
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, however, the jobless population was 18 million
and the figure has been reduced by a million each year in the
ensuing two years.
</P>
<P>
Yet still the average unemployment rate for the European Union
was at 9.6 percent in January this year, with Spain at the highest
end of the gamut with 15.1 percent and Luxembourg at the other end
with 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
France, Finland and Germany are also suffering from alarming
unemployment rates at 10.3 percent, 10.0 percent and 8.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The European Union tried to reduce the unemployment sore in
December 1997 but ended up with only a declaration of intent to
fight the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The Lisbon summit of EU heads of state and government is
expected to come out with some detailed time limits for certain
employment-orientated objectives to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, that is holding the six-month rotating presidency of
the union, proposed to set an annual growth rate of 3 percent as
one of tangible measures to boost employment while the EU leaders
are expected to decide on a shift onto e-commerce to help enlarge
employment of available work force.
</P>
<P>
Local demonstrators demanded the Portuguese authorities to work
out some detailed measures and timetable to help improve job
creation.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rejects Paramilitary Proposal About Neutral Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidential advisor rejected the offer of the United Self
Defenses of Colombia (AUC) leader Carlos Castano, of providing a
municipality in the Bolivar department to hold there the opening
convention of dialogues with the ELN.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary leader said Sunday that the AUC is willing to
permit the Tiquisio municipality in the department of Bolivar to
become the seat of the meeting of civilian delegates and ELN
rebels foreseen since 1998 and postponed because of the lack of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner for peace said that the government and the ELN
delegates "are advancing in the definition of a place and time for
the convention through confidential negotiations led by the
president, the former foreign minister and now ambassador in Cuba
Julio Londono Paredes.
</P>
<P>
The ELN and the government delegates have met at several
preparatory phases for a peace process in Havana and in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
However, the convention of delegates of the civil society that
should have been held in 1999, was postponed for an undetermined
time because of the ELN demand to demilitarize four Bolivar
municipalities, which was rejected by the government because it is
a strategic zone.

<HEADLINE> More Demonstrations in Costa Rica Against Reform Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of workers and students
marched Thursday from the central park in the Costa Rican capital
to the Presidential House, to protest against the approval of a
law of reform for the Costa Rican Energy Institute (ICE).
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican radio and television reported that the
demonstrators occupied several kilometers of streets that lead to
the Presidential House in the capital, which partially paralyzed
vehicular traffic.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched peacefully shouting slogans like "The
ICE yes, no to the combo" (combo is what the ICE reform law is
called).
</P>
<P>
The country authorities asked the citizens to maintain order
and prudence, not to cause disturbances and repeated that the ICE
will not e sold, while the labor unions were distributing
pamphlets in which they insisted on 20 reasons for which the ICE
must not be reformed or privatized.
</P>
<P>
If the government does not desists, the demonstrations will
continue to the end, they said. Workers of hospitals and
insurance, companies, as well as educators also took part in the
march.
</P>
<P>
The most important ports in the Pacific and the Atlantic
suspended their operations, and the Costa Rican Oil Refinery also
was paralyzed in Puerto Limon, which could create a possible fuel
supply crisis Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many stores in the capital closed their doors as a preventive
measure to avoid possible damage.
</P>
<P>
The situation continues tense, so President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez canceled Wednesday the trip he had programmed to the
United States, because of any unforeseen incident.

LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 leading UK artists
from Tracey Emin to Howard Hodgkin Thursday relaunched the Tate
Gallery as a home for British works only.
</P>
<P>
The event followed the departure of the Tate's international
collection to its new home - the Tate Modern, located beside the
Thames in London.
</P>
<P>
Tate Britain, as the old Tate building will now be named,will
hold the major collection of British artworks ranging from
Elizabethan miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard to contemporary artist
David Hockney.
</P>
<P>
Key works by van Dyck, Gainsborough and Stanley Spencer will be

Turner.
</P>
<P>
Six new galleries to open next spring will allow more paintings
to be brought out of the Tate's vast archive.Currently the gallery

</P>
<P>
The gallery's director, Stephen Deuchar, said Tate Britain will
bring a new zest to the world's largest display of art from the UK.
</P>
<P>
"We have an almost limitless capacity in the years ahead to
explore British art," he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Leader Faces Leadership Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble said Thursday that he has"every
confidence in the collective good judgement" of his party as he
faces a leadership challenge on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the announcement by South Belfast MP Martin Smyth
that he will attempt to take the party leadership from him at the
Ulster Unionist Council meeting, Trimble said he was"surprised and
disappointed".
</P>
<P>
Trimble has been criticized by hard-line members in his party
for saying that he would be prepared to reform the suspended
powersharing government with Sinn Fein before IRA arms
decommissioning, provided guarantees were given.
</P>
<P>
But he challenged Smyth to "explain to people clearly what the
object is and what policy is being pursued" in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist leader indicated that he believed the 860
member ruling council of the UUP would back him, as they have done
in recent crucial votes on policy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident to leave the decision to the delegates and I
hope that this will finally clear the air. The party then will be
able to unite around the democratic decision that the council has
taken, which decision I'm sure will be in line with the council's
decision again and again over the last couple of years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smyth told BBC Radio Ulster he would "set out his stall" at a
press conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said his campaign would be neither pro nor anti the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he added he would be representing a significant number of
anti-Agreement unionists who have been increasingly critical of
Trimble's leadership, and would have the support of hard-line UUP
MP Willie Ross and other party officers.
</P>
<P>
Smyth said it was "time for a more vigorous promotion of Ulster
Unionist policy than all the in-fighting that is going on because
of the departure from it".
</P>
<P>
He said he believed he had a "50/50 chance of succeeding unless
other folk come forward" with alternative challenges.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the UUP ruling council will also vote on an
emergency motion from the London-based unionist, David Burnside.
</P>
<P>
Smyth had said he will vote in favor of the motion asking the
party to refuse to take part in a new devolved government unless
the title of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is retained.The RUC's
name is due to be changed under the Patten reforms.
</P>
<P>
If passed, the motion would amount to a significant toughening
of party policy.

BOGOTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police intelligence
services agents have captured Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) 14th front leader Gildardo Gonzalez, who has been
charged with the killing of three U.S. missionaries in January
1998, authorities said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was detained in Saravena municipality in the
department of Arauca.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that Gildardo Gonzales identified himself
with a citizenship identification card to the name of Nelson
Vargas Rueda, issued in Tibu, Norte de Santander province.
</P>
<P>
The insurgent chief was sought together with German Briceno
Suarez, also known as "Grannobles," for kidnapping, torture and
assassination of Terence Freitas, a 24-year-old environmentalist,
and two women of American Indian background, Ingrid Washinawatok,
41, and Laheenae Gay, 39.

<P>
The bodies of the three U.S. missionaries were abandoned with
signs of torture in the Colombia-Venezuela border zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
formally launched negotiations on agriculture Thursday although
members are still far apart from reaching consensus to appoint a
person to chair the Committee on Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We still have no solution," Chairman of the General Council
Kare Bryn told reporters about the WTO hunt for a chairman
acceptable both to supporters and opponents of agricultural trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO rules, the Norwegian diplomat said, he had
named New Zealand ambassador Roger Farrell, outgoing chairman of
the WTO's Council for Trade in Goods, to chair Thursday's meeting
as members believed that it was vital that the agricultural talks
should begin as planned.
</P>
<P>
Trade sources said that the initial meeting had been mainly
devoted to organizational matters like timetables and restatement
of existing views, rather than any new proposals.
