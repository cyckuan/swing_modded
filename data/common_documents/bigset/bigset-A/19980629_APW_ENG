Peruvian president Fujimori in Tokyo to attend symposium 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has arrived in
Tokyo to attend a two-day international symposium on promoting
economic ties between Japan and Latin American nations, the
Japanese Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   On Tuesday, the first day of the symposium, Fujimori will speak
as a special guest, the ministry said. The event is co-sponsored by
the Export-Import Bank of Japan and Washington-based Inter-American
Development Bank.
	   Top officials from several other Latin American nations,
including Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Colombia, as well as Japan's
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Finance Minister Hikaru will
participate in the symposium to discuss economic, trade, investment
and social development issues, organizers said.
	   Many Japanese business leaders also plan to attend.
	   For Fujimori, this visit marks his ninth trip to Japan since
becoming president of Peru in 1990. He arrived in Tokyo on Sunday.
	   Fujimori is scheduled to pay a courtesy visit to Japanese
Emperor Akihito and meet with Prime Minister Hashimoto during his
three-day visit through Wednesday.
	   He will also seek to obtain dlrs 100 million credit from Japan
for a project to rehabilitate areas affected by the El Nino weather
phenomenon, Kyodo News said, quoting reports from Lima.
	   The 46-member Inter-American Development Bank was created in
1959 to help accelerate the economic and social development of its
member countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and to promote
regional integration.
	   Last year, the bank approved dlrs 6 billion in loans and dlrs 73
million in grants for technical cooperation.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Rubin to meet Malaysian premier 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin was scheduled to meet Monday with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to discuss the Asian economic crisis.
	   Rubin, who flew into the capital city of Kuala Lumpur Sunday
evening after a weekend of talks with Chinese officials in Beijing,
met with Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim to discuss Asia's
financial turmoil and bilateral trade.
	   The U.S. Treasury Secretary leaves later Monday for Thailand and
South Korea.
	   In recent speeches, Malaysia's Mahathir has lashed out at the
West, accusing foreigners of engineering the Asian financial crisis
to stage a recolonization of the region.
	   But in an unusual call for assistance last week, Mahathir asked
the United States to help shore up Malaysia's sliding currency, the
ringgit.
	   The appeal came days after the United States and Japan
intervened in the foreign exchange markets to halt the free-fall in
the Japanese currency, the yen.
	   ``It's so easy to revalue the yen. Simply by Japan and U.S.
getting together,'' he said. ``Please ask them (the U.S.) to work
with us to revalue our ringgit,'' he told reporters.
	   Mahathir has been a fierce critic of foreign currency traders
and international financial institutions, blaming speculative
trading and rigid fiscal policy recommendations for pushing his
Southeast Asian nation toward recession.

World Cup: Can Denmark pull off another upset? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous.
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ After snuffing out the hopes of
favored Nigeria, little Denmark is gunning for another upset when
it meets defending World Cup champion Brazil in the quarterfinals.
	   Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal in Denmark's 4-1 rout of
Olympic champion Nigeria, thinks the Danes have a fighting chance.
	   ``We know that it's a dream come true for any footballer to play
against Brazil,'' Laudrup said after Sunday's win at the Stade de
France that gave Denmark its first-ever quarterfinal berth.
	   ``Everybody expects Brazil to win. We might be able to do it
again. You never know. We were criticized a lot after the first
three (first-round) games, but tonight I think we showed the whole
football world that we can play attractive football as well.''
	   The Danes got off to a dream start as surprise starter Peter
Moller, who had not played a single minute in the first round,
scored with barely two minutes gone. He set up another goal for
Laudrup nine minutes later.
	   Moller wasn't even a regular on his club team PSV Eindhoven this
season, but he practiced hard in training camp throughout the first
round.
	   ``I think he practiced more than the other players. He was
patient. When you're patient, it pays off,'' said Denmark's Swedish
coach Bo Johansson.
	   Moller is strong in the air but has a reputation for
inconsistency with PSV. Most of the time, he has warmed the bench,
although he did play a few matches in the Dutch league.
	   ``It was a dream for me ... ,'' Moller said of his goal. ``I'm
not that kind of player who makes those nice moves. I'm a
hard-working man.''
	   Laudrup warned that other teams could be in for a nasty surprise
if they underestimate Denmark.
	   ``I think Nigeria was thinking about Brazil today,'' he said.
``We played extremely well. It was one of the best games I've been
involved (in) with the Danish team. It's just fantastic.''
	   Michael Laudrup, Brian's older brother who's retiring after the
World Cup, set up Moller for the opening goal. Unmarked, Moller
took the pass and fired a left-footed strike from the top of the
box 2:06 after kickoff.
	   Brian Laudrup made it 2-0 in the 12th minute, pouncing on a
rebound and slotting home from 8 meters (yards) after Nigerian
goalkeeper Peter Rufai could only slap down a strong 20-meter
(yard) free kick by Moller.
	   Striker Ebbe Sand increased it to 3-0 in the 60th minute, a
World Cup-record 22 seconds after entering the match as a
substitute for Moller. Sand took the ball from Michael Laudrup,
headed it around defender Taribo West and volleyed in from the
penalty spot in the 60th.
	   Denmark's fourth goal _ one more than it totaled in its first
three games here _ came in the 76th, as Rufai's inability to hold
another shot cost Nigeria. Sand chased down the ball after Rufai
bobbled it and passed back to Jorgensen, who crossed to Thomas
Helveg. The 27-year-old midfielder ripped a blast into the roof of
the net.
	   Nigeria finally tallied in the 78th, when substitute Tijani
Babangida turned in Mutiu Adepoju's cross for a meaningless goal.
	   Johansson, who took over as Denmark's coach two years ago when
1992 European champion coach Richard Moller Nielsen left for
Finland, said his team played like the old ``Danish Dynamite''
teams of the late 1980s and early '90s.
	   ``This was the old Danish way of playing, like Mexico in the
1986 World Cup,'' he said. ``Then, Denmark played a couple of
fantastic games like this one.
	   Johansson, naturally, was looking ahead to the Brazilians.
	   ``We have to try,'' he said after his biggest thrill as a coach.
``Nigeria can't try any longer. We play the world's best team
(Brazil). We'll give them a hard game. It will be fantastic for
us.''

Faction squabble simmers as premier rules out reshuffle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A legal victory enabling Thailand's
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to keep a renegade faction of
legislators inside his governing coalition has been challenged for
violating the country's new constitution.
	   Chuan was cited by The Nation newspaper Monday as saying that he
had no plans to shuffle his Cabinet or to bring the Chart Pattana
Party, the second largest in the opposition, into the government _
a sign of confidence that his coalition is stable.
	   But last week, a civil court intervened in a dispute within the
small Prachakorn Thai party that could undo Chuan's coalition. Even
some of Chuan's natural allies are saying that the court lacks the
jurisdiction to do so under the constitution approved last year.
	   Chuan was able to take power last November at the low point of
Thailand's economic crisis with the help of a dozen breakaway
members of Prachakorn Thai, which was part of the government he
replaced and is now officially part of the opposition.
	   Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej, an avowed Chuan enemy,
has embarked on a complex legal campaign to expel the renegades,
whom he has branded as ``cobras,'' and strip them of their
parliamentary seats. The move would tip the balance of power
against Chuan.
	   The faction has been expelled from Prachakorn Thai's board of
directors, pending endorsement by the Election Commission. But the
Civil Court approved an appeal last week from the renegades to
block the commission from making any decision.
	   Samak, one of the old-school politicians that the
anti-corruption constitution is aimed at, has found a longtime
enemy as an ally _ the top charter drafter, former premier Anand
Panyarachun _ in attacking the court's interference.
	   Anand said that the constitution specifies that only the newly
created Constitutional Court can make rulings affecting the
Election Commission and other bodies set up by the charter.
	   Otherwise, Anand was cited as saying by the Bangkok Post, they
will lose the hard-won independence given to them by the charter to
clean up Thai politics of corruption seen as essential to improving
the government and restoring investor confidence.
	   Chuan's government is generally seen as the cleanest in years,
but has come under some pressure to seek a fresh mandate under the
new charter before its legal term ends in the year 2000.
	   Chuan has said he will not step aside until Thailand's economy,
the first to fall in the Asian crisis, is firmly headed toward
recovery. The economy is expected to shrink up to 5.5 percent this
year.

UNDATED: seven innings. Mets 2, Yankees 1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In New York, the Mets avoided a sweep in the final game of their
Subway Series against the Yankees with a controversial run in the
bottom of the ninth inning.
	   With runners at first and third and one out, pinch-hitter Luis
Lopez hit a fly to right off Ramiro Mendoza (5-2) that Paul O'Neill
raced back to catch for the second out. Carlos Baerga tagged up at
third and crossed the plate for what appeared to be the winning
run.
	   But Brian McRae, who had taken off from first when the ball was
hit, tried to get back to avoid a double play and was called out
when first baseman Tino Martinez made a diving catch of Derek
Jeter's throw.
	   The Mets protested, thinking the run wasn't going to count. But
after several anxious moments, home plate umpire Frank Pulli
pointed toward the plate, indicating the run had scored before the
double play was completed.

Pirates 6, Dodgers 4 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A bench-clearing brawl seemed to wake up the
Pittsburgh Pirates, who rallied from three runs down Sunday night
to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-4 and avoid a three-game sweep.
	   Gary Sheffield homered and drove in three runs for the Dodgers
before initiating the scuffle in the bottom of the sixth. Sheffield
exchanged words with Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and then
wrestled with him, and both players were ejected.
	   The Pirates trailed 4-1 at the time of the brawl. But Al
Martin's two-run homer off Dave Mlicki _ only his second home run
in a 47-game span _ started the Pirates' comeback in the seventh.

Legislator with Chinese background resigns from premier's party 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's first ethnic Chinese
legislator resigned from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
party Monday, saying she is outraged over its deference to Pauline
Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation Party.
	   The resignation of New South Wales state legislator Helen Sham
Ho from the Liberal Party _ the most conservative mainstream party,
despite its name _ was announced Monday.
	   Sham Ho, born in Hong Kong in 1943, has been critical of the
conservative governing coalition's soft stance on Pauline Hanson's
One Nation party.
	   She said Monday she will become an independent and seek the
Labor Party's support to become upper house president in New South
Wales following the resignation of Max Willis last week.
	   ``As an Australian who has served the people of New South Wales
for over ten years I have been deeply distressed over the growing
politics of division that is turning Australians against
Australians.
	   ``To be told by the Liberal Party that I cannot contest the
presidency because I would offend the One Nation party is offensive
and insulting to all Australians,'' she said.
	   The disgruntled lawmaker said the Liberal Party in Queensland
had actively assisted One Nation in that state, forming a deal to
swap votes with each other in districts they did not win.
	   This was ``a great disappointment,'' she said.
	   ``This decision can be contrasted with the Australian Labor
party, which has taken a strong stand against One Nation party and
has demonstrated that it has a real commitment to equality for all
Australians,'' she said.
	   Willis quit his post last Friday amid allegations he was under
the influence of alcohol during a late night parliamentary session.

Dissidents urge Clinton to meet ousted Chinese leader 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A group of 125 dissidents in China has urged
visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton to meet with former Chinese
Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted during the 1989
student-led protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
	   ``We strongly urge President Clinton to take just one hour of
his time in Beijing to meet with Mr. Zhao Ziyang,'' the group said
in a statement faxed to news agencies in Beijing early Monday by
the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   Chinese activists have repeatedly urged Clinton to meet with a
dissident during his visit to China to underscore his criticism of
Beijing's human rights records.
	   In public remarks since his arrival, Clinton has emphasized his
desire to see more freedom permitted by the Chinese government. He
sparred with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the topic during a
post-summit news conference. However, his official schedule has
included no meetings with dissidents.
	   Clinton was due to leave Beijing later Tuesday for Shanghai.
	   The open letter urged Clinton to pressure Chinese leaders to
free Zhao, who has not appeared in public since he spoke to student
protesters in Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989, saying tearfully,
``I came too late.''
	   Hours later party elders purged him for refusing to back a
military crackdown, and declared a state of martial law. On June
3-4, Chinese troops shot their way into Beijing and forced
protesters from the square, killing hundreds, if not thousands.
	   Last week, Zhao reportedly sent a letter to party leaders urging
them to use the occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their
condemnation of the protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   Clinton's arrival in China, in the northern city of Xi'an, was
marred by the detentions of four activists, who were later released
following U.S. protests. Yang Hai, one of those detained in Xi'an,
signed the appeal.
	   In the letter, dated Sunday, the dissidents took issue with
President Jiang's insistence that the government had to use force
to ensure stability.
	   ``We feel it is exactly the opposite. If the government had not
prevented Zhao from dealing with the protests in his own way, the
democracy movement certainly would have been peacefully resolved,''
it said.
	   ``Economic and democratic reforms would have made more progress
and many social problems such as corruption and unemployment would
not have gotten so severe.''
	   ``God bless you,'' it said in conclusion.
	   The letter was signed by a number of veteran activists, who
claimed to have obtained the endorsement of 125 dissidents from
across the country.

Opposition aims for gains in Baja California mayoral, state congress vote 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with early returns.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party had
its sights on retaining the mayorship in the largest Mexican city
along the U.S. border as voters went to the polls.
	   The PAN, as it is known by its Spanish initials, aimed for a
fourth straight victory Sunday in Tijuana over the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power, and it currently has a PAN
governor.
	   The main contenders in the five-candidate race for Tijuana mayor
were Francisco Vega de la Madrid of the PAN, Amador Rodriguez
Lozano of the PRI and Jesus Ruiz Barraza of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party.
	   At stake were five key mayoral posts in Baja California and all
25 seats in the state congress.
	   With 3 percent of the polling places counted Sunday night, Vega
was leading with 3,073 votes, or 46 percent, to Rodriguez Lozano's
2,641 votes, or 40 percent. Final results in Mexican elections can
often take several days.

Ford Vietnam seeks ban on imported autos 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Foreign automakers have asked the
Vietnamese government to ban car imports to help their sales of
locally-made vehicles in the country's fledgling auto market, the
newspaper Investment reported Monday.
	   The proposal was reportedly made by Ford Vietnam, a joint
venture between Ford Motor Co. and a local company which is backed
by Toyota Vietnam.
	   ``Vietnam's auto industry can hardly develop in the near-future
if the government allows the import of second-hand cars and
completely built car units,'' Murray Gilbert, managing director of
Ford Vietnam, was quoted as saying.
	   Fourteen car joint ventures, with a total capacity of 140,000
units per year, have been licensed in Vietnam.
	   Eight are operational, competing in a small market that saw only
22,000 cars sold last year. About 95 percent of the traffic in
Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, is on two wheels,
either small motorbikes or bicycles.
	   ``Vietnam has to protect its fledgling car industry now as it
faces the challenge of opening its car market to ASEAN competition
by 2006 under the ASEAN Free Trade Area,'' Gilbert reportedly said,
referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Ford Vietnam, inaugurated in 1997, has only assembled 250 cars
this year, the paper said.
	   Takashi Hasegawa of Toyota Vietnam agreed with Ford Vietnam's
proposal.
	   ``The Vietnamese government should ban car imports for a certain
period of time if it wishes to develop the car industry,'' he was
quoted by Investment as saying.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Human rights ``are the birthrights of people
everywhere,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton told students at Peking
University in a speech broadcast Monday across China.
	   Clinton also fielded tough questions from Chinese students on
America's human rights and defense policies.
	   He urged China's communist leaders not to fear an open society.
``Freedom is a powerful engine of progress,'' he said in a speech
that challenged some aspects of China's system of government but
also extolled economic reforms that have lifted tens of millions of
people from poverty into a lifestyle that would have been
unthinkable 20 years ago.
	   Clinton praised China for having a positive economic role in the
region.
	   ``China has steadfastly shouldered its responsibility to the
region and the world in this latest financial crisis, helping to
prevent another cycle of dangerous devaluations,'' he said.
	   Students and faculty members warmly welcomed the American leader
as he strode into a hall on the quiet, leafy campus whose students
were the driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
	   There was no sign of such protest on campus Sunday, but the New
York-based Human Rights in China released a letter purportedly from
125 Chinese dissidents urging Clinton to meet with former Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted during the 1989 protests.
	   Last week, Zhao, who has remained under house arrest in Beijing,
reportedly sent a letter to party leaders urging them to use the
occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their condemnation of the
protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   Clinton noted that some of the questions posed by students had a
critical tone, but he said their questions were good and he had
learned from them.
	   He assured one student that the United States is sincere in its
desire for a partnership with China and did not have a secret
agenda for containing the communist giant.
	   ``I'm not hiding another design behind a smile,'' Clinton said.
	   Banners in English and Chinese hung in the hall. One declared:
``The U.S. and China An Enduring Friendship.''
	   ``We are convinced certain rights are universal,'' Clinton said,
although he said the United States does not seek to impose its
vision on others.
	   Asked by a student to defend U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan,
Clinton said the United States was sticking to its policy of
encouraging reunification talks between China and Taiwan, and that
any U.S. weapons sold to the island nation are strictly for
defensive purposes.
	   ``U.S. policy is not an obstacle to China-Taiwan
reunification,'' Clinton said.
	   He also sought to dispel China's contentions that the United
States' security treaty with Japan is aimed at containing China's
military development.
	   ``We cannot see the agreements of today through the mirror of
yesterday's conflicts,'' Clinton said.
	   Outside the auditorium, some students sharply disagreed with
Clinton.
	   Zhang Yun, a junior who listened to the remarks on a small
radio, said Clinton's arguments about human rights ``do not suit
the conditions in today's China. His understanding of China is not
very deep or complete.''
	   Wang Yushi, a 20-year-old computer major, said he and his
classmates had been discussing Clinton's visit in their
dormitories. ``We can't go in one step from a stable socialist
country to everyone having freedom of speech, freedom of assembly.
It would lead to chaos. We need to go slowly, stably,'' Wang said.
	   The live broadcast by government television followed the
broadcast Saturday of Clinton's vigorous debate over human rights
with President Jiang Zemin. U.S. officials were delighted by the
government's openness, which they said was unprecedented during a
visit by a foreign leader.
	   Clinton said some people in both America and China question
whether closer relations are worthwhile.
	   ``But everything we know about the way the world is changing and
the challenges your generation will face tell us that our two
nations will be better off working together than apart,'' Clinton
said.
	   The president departed from his text at one point to stress
concern about the environment, telling university faculty and
students they would have to help ``lead the way'' in saving the
world from greenhouse gases that are destroying the ozone layer.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, Peking
University is closely monitored by the government, which restricts
visitors. Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded
100 years ago.
	   Clinton said, ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be
treated with dignity ... to give voice to their opinions ... to
choose their own leaders .. to associate with whom they wish ... to
worship how, when and where they want.
	   ``These are not American rights or European rights or developed
world rights,'' Clinton said. ``They are the birthrights of people
everywhere.''
	   Clinton's address came after a day of sightseeing at the Great
Wall and in the ancient palaces of the walled Forbidden City.
	   The university appearance was Clinton's final stop in this
capital city before an evening flight to Shanghai, the booming
commercial center at the mouth of the Yangtze River. A highlight
will be Clinton's participation in a Shanghai radio call-in show
Tuesday.

Thousands march peacefully for independence for East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of pro-independence protesters
marched through East Timor's capital Monday, demanding a referendum
on Indonesian control over the territory and the release of an
imprisoned rebel leader.
	   It was the fourth straight day of demonstrations in East Timor
by groups that either support Indonesian rule or want greater
independence.
	   The territory's governor called for calm.
	   Hundreds of soldiers with automatic weapons and police armed
with shields and tear gas canisters, stood by as a procession of
protestors, stretching five kilometers (3 miles), moved peacefully
from the University of East Timor through Dili's streets.
	   Shops and offices were closed. Some storekeepers said they were
worried that the march, organized by college students, might turn
violent.
	   The demonstration took place as three Jakarta-based ambassadors
continued with a three-day fact-finding tour on behalf of the
European Union. Rival groups have clashed on several occasions in
recent days in attempts to impress the visiting envoys.
	   Monday's protesters held up pictures of guerrilla chief Xanana
Gusmao, demanding that he be released from a Jakarta prison where
he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian forces.
	   The crowd also called for a ballot to determine the future of
the former Portuguese colony, invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and
annexed by Jakarta the following year.
	   ``Dead or alive. We want a referendum,'' hundreds of marchers
chanted in the local Tetum language.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered to free Gusmao and
to grant special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory. But he has
ruled out any referendum.
	   The United Nations and many other governments don't recognize
the legitimacy of Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island,
which has endured more than two decades of guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses.
	   Meanwhile, East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares Monday asked security
personnel to take stern but restrained action against violent
troublemakers.
	   ``I ask security officials to take wise action to prevent the
protest erupting into anarchy,'' he told reporters.
	   ``People who violate law and order should be arrested. But they
should not be shot or killed,'' he said.
	   On Saturday, rival protesters clashed in front of a Catholic
church in Manatuto, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Dili.
Troops opened fire when fighting broke out among pro-independence
and pro-Indonesian groups.
	   Witnesses said troops killed one man and seriously wounded two
others, but the military denied playing a role in the incident.
	   Also on Saturday rock-throwing mobs damaged Soares' office.
	   Soares said that the military should protect the homes and
offices of all government officials.
	   The ambassadors, from Britain, the Netherlands and Austria, left
Dili early Monday for a visit to the territory's second largest
town, Baucau, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili.
	   They were scheduled to leave East Timor on Tuesday.

Opposition party leads in Tijuana mayor's race 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new returns.
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party was
leading in votes late Sunday night to retain the mayoral post in
the largest Mexican city along the U.S. border.
	   The PAN, as it is known by its Spanish initials, aimed for a
fourth straight victory in Tijuana over the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   The main contenders in the five-candidate race were Francisco
Vega de la Madrid of the PAN, Amador Rodriguez Lozano of the PRI
and Jesus Ruiz Barraza of the left-center Democratic Revolution
Party.
	   With 32 percent of the polling places counted, Vega was ahead
with 35,000 votes, or 46 percent, to Rodriguez Lozano's 29,267
votes, or 38 percent. Ruiz trailed with 6,734 votes, or 9 percent.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power, and it currently has a PAN
governor.
	   The PAN was expected to hang onto the mayorships of both Tijuana
and Mexicali, the state capital.
	   ``We see that it (the PAN) has done many things for Tijuana,''
said voter Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, who works in a Sony
maquiladora, or assembly plant near the U.S. border. She said she
has noticed improvements in the streets and schools.
	   But Juana Flores Rodriguez, 29, said she liked the promises of
the PRI's Rodriguez Lozano, who has said he would bring paved
roads, storm drains and running water to shantytowns.
	   Rodriguez Lozano, a 47-year-old federal senator, is someone
``who you can present problems to and who can bring solutions,''
Flores said.
	   Vega, 43, is a former state finance director running for his
first elective post, while Ruiz, 58, is the founder of Centro
Universitario Tijuana, a private university.
	   Election officials and police reported few problems while the
state's 2,337 polling places were open. At stake were five key
mayoral posts and all 25 seats in the state congress.
	   Turnout among the state's 1,231,667 registered voters was light
despite good weather, as state residents apparently stayed home to
watch World Cup soccer play.
	   Polls favored the PAN to take the port of Ensenada, currently
governed by the PRI.
	   The PRD was positioned to take the border city of Tecate from
the PRI, according to recent polls. In the fifth race, the town of
Rosarito Beach was holding its first mayoral election.

Final report: No North Korean agents from sub remain in South 
</HEADLINE>

By KYONG-HWA SEOK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A North Korean submarine briefly
landed three espionage agents in South Korea before being captured
last week, the Defense Ministry said Monday.
	   The ministry ruled out the possibility that any agents remained
behind in South Korea, saying the three who came ashore were among
the nine North Koreans found dead in the sub Friday.
	   All nine had been shot to death, apparently to avoid capture.
	   Their bodies were discovered when the sub's hatches were finally
opened, four days after the 85-foot (26-meter), 70-ton craft was
found entangled in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, in his first official comment on the
case on Monday, asked North Korea to admit the incursion and take
action to prevent a recurrence.
	   He said, however, that the episode would not affect his policy
of expanding civilian exchanges and increasing government
cooperation to open up the North's reclusive communist society.
	   Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek said the American-led U.N.
Command plans to lodge a formal protest with North Korea on
Tuesday.
	   The Defense Ministry based its conclusions about the activities
of the submarine's occupants on an analysis of logbooks and other
documents found in the vessel.
	   ``An operational logbook in the form of memos and other items
seized indicate that there were no extra agents who had infiltrated
into the country,'' said Brig. Gen. Park Sung-chun, who headed the
ministry's investigation.
	   Analysis of gunshot wounds indicated that five of the North
Koreans, all believed to be crewmen, were killed by the sub's
captain and three agents, who then killed themselves, the ministry
said.
	   It was the second North Korean submarine intrusion in less than
two years. In 1996, a larger sub was found stranded roughly in the
same area. That touched off a massive manhunt that left 24
communist infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead.
	   As it did in 1996, North Korea claimed the latest sub drifted
into South Korean waters after developing mechanical problems. It
accused Seoul of failing to save the sub's crew and demanded an
immediate return of the bodies and the vessel.
	   The Defense Ministry said the documents found in the sub showed
it left its home port of Wonsan on the North's east coast on June
20 and arrived off South Korea's east coast the following day.
	   Three agents came ashore and stayed for about an hour, the
ministry said. As the sub sailed out with the agents, it developed
mechanical problems and then was entangled in the fishing net, it
said.
	   In view of their short stay on land, the agents's mission may
have been to establish a ``contact point'' with North Korean spies
already operating in South Korea, the ministry said.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

Chinese government pays farmers for cows killed by tiger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hoping to prevent angry farmers from avenging the
deaths of their cattle, authorities in northern China have paid
1,000 yuan (dlrs 120) apiece for cows killed by a rare Siberian
tiger, the official newspaper China Daily reported Monday.
	   Payments were made to four farmers after three of them sued the
government for compensation, the report said.
	   Efforts to save the endangered species of tiger have been
hampered by poaching, sometimes by farmers who have lost livestock.
	   Tigers have killed at least 12 cows since last August in the
remote, wild Changbai mountains, in northern Jilin province, the
report said.
	   It said the farmers expressed satisfaction with the payments,
which amounted to 70 percent of the value of their livestock.
	   The farmers also said they would do more to help protect
wildlife _ and take better care of their cattle.

Sorenstam soars in ShopRite LPGA Classic AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>

By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam is leaving little to
chance this year, and it could mean the best season yet in her
remarkable career.
	   A year ago, she took a two-stroke lead into the final round of
the ShopRite LPGA Classic and shot a safe 71 as Michelle McGann
blew past her with a 64 to steal the victory.
	   Sorenstam took another two-stroke lead into Sunday's final
round, but made certain no one could sweep past her, shooting a 65
and a tournament-record 17-under-par 196 to win by four strokes
over Juli Inkster.
	   The victory was the 14th in the remarkable career of the
27-year-old Swede and the second in her last two starts. It also
was her 10th top-10 finish in 11 tournaments this year.
	   And the breathtaking performance makes Sorenstam the favorite in
the U.S. Women's Open this week. She made only one bogey in 54
holes on the Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort and hit 17
of 18 greens in the final round.
	   Playing the same relentless game of hitting fairways and greens
that won the U.S. Open in 1995 and '96, Sorenstam grabbed a share
of the lead after the first round and never surrendered it,
shooting rounds of 66, 65 and 65.
	   ``This is a tough course,'' she said after hitting all but one
fairway Sunday. ``I can't believe I hit so many fairways.''
	   While others made mistakes, Sorenstam was sensational, just as
she was when she won her last U.S. Open in 1996 by hitting 51 of 56
fairways at Pine Needles in North Carolina.
	   Her only bogey of the week came on No. 12 on Saturday when she
had a 30-foot (9.14-meter) putt from above the hole and hit it 15
feet (4.57 meters) past down the slippery slope, missing the par
putt coming back.
	   She shattered the tournament record of 6-under par on this
course set by Betsy King in 1987 and also broke the 12-under
ShopRite record set last year by McGann on the Greate Bay Resort
course.
	   Lorie Kane closed with a 67 to finish third at at 203, and Helen
Dobson was fourth at 204.
	   Donna Andrews, who had finished second in each of her last four
starts, made a run early with birdies on two of the first three
holes but cooled off and shot a 69 and was among those at 205.
	   Karrie Webb lifted her spirits going into the U.S. Open with a
course-record 64 that included her first hole-in-one in competition
when she sank a 6-iron shot from 169 yards (154 meters) on No. 7.
Webb finished at 207.
	   Even if Inkster had matched that record 64 she would have
finished second.
	   Paired in the final group, Sorenstam started the day with a
two-stroke lead over Inkster and had the margin cut to a single
stroke going to the final nine after Inkster ran off three
consecutive birdies starting at No. 4.
	   ``I needed to play the perfect round today,'' Inkster said after
shooting a strong 67 and losing ground to Sorenstam. ``It's tough
giving the best player in the world a two shot lead starting out.''
	   Inkster stayed within a stroke through 13 holes, but she made a
three-putt bogey from 45 feet (13.72 meters) off the fringe on No.
14, missing a 7-footer (2.13-meter shot) for par, then fell threes
strokes behind when Sorenstam rolled in a 15-foot (4.57-meter)
birdie putt on No. 15.
	   Sorenstam then closed the tournament with four consecutive
birdies.
	   ``I got it going on Friday and just kept it there,'' Sorenstam
said. ``Hopefully, I can carry it into next week.''
	   If she plays anything like this, she will have her third U.S.
Open title in four years.

E.U. to help Laos clear unexploded ordnance from Vietnam War 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union will help Laos clear
unexploded ordnance from one of the provinces most heavily bombed
by U.S. planes during the Vietnam War.
	   The Nation newspaper Monday cited the E.U.'s regional director,
Emiliano Fossati, as saying that the E.U. will announce about dlrs
3 billion in aid next month for Laos to boost clearance and
community awareness in Savannakhet province.
	   Savannakhet was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, through which
North Vietnam transported men and war materials to U.S.-backed
South Vietnam through officially neutral Laos during the Vietnam
conflict.
	   U.S. planes dropped more explosives on Laos than on all of
Germany during World War II, with much of the payload being
baseball-sized bomblets that failed to explode.
	   The so-called bombies and other ordnance that didn't go off then
now kill or maim 200 Laotians a year. The United States and several
European countries and charities are trying to clear it.

India-New Zealand cricket match abandoned due to rain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Independence Cup cricket match
between India and New Zealand was called off due to bad weather
Monday in the southern city of Galle.
	   It was the third game to be abandoned without a ball being
bowled, with monsoon rains sweeping southwestern Sri Lanka.
	   On Thursday, the match between Sri Lanka and India was called
off, and two days later the Sri Lanka versus New Zealand game was
canceled.
	   The two points for Monday's match were shared. India currently
heads the standings, with five points, followed by Sri Lanka which
has four. New Zealand have three, all from rain affected games.
	   Three more league matches will be played to decide the two
finalists.
	   The next match is on Wednesday between Sri Lanka and India at
the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo.

Legislator with Chinese background resigns from premier's party in bottom four grafs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with prime minister criticizing Sham Ho's resignation
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's first ethnic-Chinese
legislator resigned from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
party Monday, saying she is outraged over its obeisance to Pauline
Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation Party.
	   The resignation of New South Wales state legislator Helen Sham
Ho from the Liberal Party _ which, despite its name, is the more
conservative of the mainstream parties _ was announced the same
day.
	   Sham Ho, born in Hong Kong in 1943, has been critical of the
conservative governing coalition's stance on Hanson's party.
	   Sham Ho said she will become an independent and seek the Labor
Party's support to become upper house president in New South Wales
after being discouraged from contesting the post by the Liberals,
who wanted to avoid offending One Nation.
	   The position became vacant following the resignation of Max
Willis last week.
	   ``My decision to run for the presidency was a difficult one. It
comes after much soul searching and deliberation with my family,''
she said.
	   ``As an Australian who has served the people of New South Wales
for over ten years I have been deeply distressed over the growing
politics of division that is turning Australians against
Australians.
	   ``To be told by the Liberal Party that I cannot contest the
presidency because I would offend the One Nation party is offensive
and insulting to all Australians,'' she said.
	   She said the Liberal Party in Queensland had actively assisted
One Nation in that state, forming a deal to swap votes with each
other in districts they did not win.
	   This was ``a great disappointment,'' Sham Ho said.
	   ``This decision can be contrasted with the Australian Labor
party, which has taken a strong stand against One Nation party and
has demonstrated that it has a real commitment to equality for all
Australians,'' she said.
	   Willis quit his post last Friday amid allegations he was under
the influence of alcohol during a late night parliamentary session.
	   Speaking in federal Parliament, Prime Minister John Howard
dismissed Sham Ho's reasons for quitting his party as ``sour
grapes.''
	   ``I think the principal reason that Mrs. Sham Ho has resigned
and is contesting the position from the crossbenches is that she
thinks she's got a better chance of winning through doing that.
	   ``I think it is rather disappointing, even verging on the
ungracious, of somebody who's had great loyalty from the Liberal
Party for a long period of time to seek to raise the matters that
she has.
	   ``I don't think for a moment the allegations (she) made are with
any foundation at all,'' he said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary calls for Malaysian reforms 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Rubin's comments
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin on Monday urged Malaysia to reform its economy and introduce
``sound'' fiscal and monetary policies.
	   Malaysia should also reduce limits on foreign investment in its
banking and financial sector and issue credit on a ``purely
commercial basis,'' Rubin said at the start of a meeting with
Malaysian businessmen and officials.
	   ``Obviously, all of these are difficult to do, and all of these
will be taking place at a difficult period of time,'' Rubin said.
	   But he warned that it would be ``far worse'' if Malaysia did not
reform because of the current economic crisis.
	   ``Reform is the answer,'' he said.
	   Rubin's prescriptions are likely to be ignored by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad who sees the international financial system as the
culprit and not the alleged structural weaknesses of Malaysia's
banking and financial sectors.
	   Mahathir has favored a softer monetary policy and urged banks to
increase lending to struggling companies so that they could grow
themselves out of the crisis.
	   He has repeatedly blamed the international financial system for
pushing the Southeast Asian nation toward recession and the
International Monetary Fund for pushing for high interest rates.
	   In recent speeches, Mahathir has lashed out at the West,
accusing foreigners of engineering the Asian financial crisis so
that they could recolonize the region.
	   But in an unusual call for assistance last week, Mahathir asked
the United States to help shore up Malaysia's currency that has
lost nearly 40 percent of its value in one year.
	   The appeal came days after the United States and Japan
intervened in the foreign exchange markets to halt the free-fall in
the Japanese currency, the yen.
	   The two leaders were scheduled to meet later Monday before Rubin
flew to Thailand and South Korea for the next leg of his Asia tour.
He flew into Kuala Lumpur Sunday after a weekend of talks with
Chinese officials in Beijing.
	   In his comments on Monday, Rubin raised concerns about Japan's
economy and the weakness of the yen.
	   The U.S. has been pushing Japan to implement sweeping banking
sector reforms designed to address bad loan problems and reverse a
cycle of weakening investor and consumer confidence.

Students pose tough questions to Clinton With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Following his speech Monday at Peking University,
U.S. President Bill Clinton fielded tough questions from students
on topics ranging from U.S. policy on Taiwan and how he handles
protesters to the motive for pursuing a new relationship with
China.
	   In the end, Clinton commended the students for asking questions
with ``an element of criticism to them that have been very helpful
to me.''
	   ``They have helped me understand how what I say is perceived by
others, not just in China but around the world,'' Clinton said.
``So I feel very good that we've had this interchange and, from my
point of view, the questions were more important than my speech.''
	   Wang Yushi, a 20-year-old computer major, found Clinton's
comments useful.
	   ``On human rights, we Chinese can get something out of listening
to others' opinions,'' Wang said.
	   But the president's speech did not win raves from Zhang Yun, a
junior who listened to the remarks on a small radio. Standing on a
retaining wall among hundreds of onlookers, Zhang said Clinton's
arguments about human rights ``do not suit the conditions in
today's China.''
	   ``His understanding of China is not very deep or complete,''
Zhang said. ``China is putting a lot of hard work into resolving
its own problems.''
	   One student asked whether Clinton had designs on containing
China, much as it did with the communist Soviet Union during the
Cold War.
	   Clinton said the United States wants a partnership with China,
rather than ``having to spend enormous amounts of time and money
trying to contain China.''
	   ``I'm not hiding another design behind a smile. That is what I
really believe.''
	   Clinton said that if he had been met at the university by
demonstrators protesting U.S. policy toward Taiwan, he would have
sought to talk and listen to them, rather than suppress what they
had to say.
	   ``I would try to find out what they were demonstrating against,
and then I would ask my hosts if they minded if I would go over and
talk to them,'' Clinton said. ``They could say what is on their
minds and I could answer. Remember what I said before about what
Benjamin Franklin said: `Our critics are our friends, for they show
us our faults.'''

Philippine stocks rise, peso slips 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks finished higher
Monday, buoyed by end-of-the-quarter portfolio revaluations and the
Japanese yen's advance against the dollar, traders said.
	   Philippine financial markets will be closed Tuesday for the
inauguration of President Joseph Estrada.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 36.76 points,
or 2.1 percent, to 1,760.13 after gaining 14.34 points Friday.
	   The market started weak but picked up at midsession, closing
just off its high as fund managers window-dressed their portfolios,
traders said.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, president of Diversified Securities, said
there should be some follow-through buying in coming days.
	   But he doubts the gains can be sustained given the absence of
fresh market-moving news and the still-cautious attitude of most
investors.
	   ``There is not a big market reversal so far,'' he said.
	   The bright spot on the horizon is the yen's gain, Garcia said.
``If it has actually bottomed out, it will be one bit of positive
news,'' he said.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said
window-dressing should wind down in coming days, refocusing
investors' attention on events in the region and the first days of
the incoming administration of President Estrada.
	   ``Nothing has changed fundamentally so the market's direction
remains downward,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso was lower in morning trading as
some investors bought dollars.
	   The dollar averaged 42.131 pesos in the morning session, up from
Friday's 42.091 pesos.
	   Early gains by the Japanese yen, however, were starting to rub
off on the peso, traders said.
	   But companies were taking the dollar's dip as an opportunity to
buy, keeping the peso weak despite the yen's gains, a dealer for a
local commercial bank said.
	   But dealers said the peso was likely to advance against the
dollar if the yen continues to strengthen.

Opposition party leads in Tijuana mayor's race mayor's races. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with returns from all five cities with
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party was
leading in votes late Sunday night to retain the mayoral post in
the largest Mexican city along the U.S. border.
	   The PAN, as it is known by its Spanish initials, aimed for a
fourth straight victory in Tijuana over the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   The main contenders in the five-candidate race were Francisco
Vega de la Madrid of the PAN, Amador Rodriguez Lozano of the PRI
and Jesus Ruiz Barraza of the left-center Democratic Revolution
Party.
	   With 64 percent of the polling places counted, Vega was ahead
with 72,738 votes, or 45 percent, to Rodriguez Lozano's 62,747
votes, or 39 percent. Ruiz trailed with 14,845 votes, or 9 percent.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power, and it currently has a PAN
governor.
	   The PAN had been expected to hang onto the mayorships of Tijuana
and Mexicali, the state capital. With 52 percent of the polling
places counted in Mexicali, the PAN candidate there led the PRI
candidate 44 percent to 40 percent.
	   ``We see that it (the PAN) has done many things for Tijuana,''
said voter Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, who works in a Sony
maquiladora, or assembly plant near the U.S. border. She said she
has noticed improvements in the streets and schools.
	   But Juana Flores Rodriguez, 29, said she liked the promises of
the PRI's Rodriguez Lozano, who has said he would bring paved
roads, storm drains and running water to shantytowns.
	   Rodriguez Lozano, a 47-year-old federal senator, is someone
``who you can present problems to and who can bring solutions,''
Flores said.
	   Vega, 43, is a former state finance director running for his
first elective post, while Ruiz, 58, is the founder of Centro
Universitario Tijuana, a private university.
	   Election officials and police reported few problems while the
state's 2,337 polling places were open. At stake were five key
mayoral posts and all 25 seats in the state congress.
	   Turnout among the state's 1,231,667 registered voters was light
despite good weather, as state residents apparently stayed home to
watch World Cup soccer play.
	   In the port city of Ensenada, currently governed by the PRI, the
PAN led with 42 percent of the vote to 35 percent, with more than
half of the polling places counted.
	   Meanwhile, it appeared that the PRI would hold onto the border
city of Tecate, where it had 45 percent of the vote despite a
strong showing of 24 percent by the PRD. In the fifth race, it
looked like the PAN would win the town of Rosarito Beach, which was
holding its first mayoral election.

On the air: Talk radio gives voice to China's masses 
</HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ At midday they talk business. Evening is
public affairs and advice. The hours after midnight are for the
lovelorn _ weeping Romeos and Juliets seeking advice on rekindling
a faltering romance or solace in burying a failed one.
	   This is talk radio, not American-style, but Chinese.
	   The hosts are a far cry from the ``shock jocks'' who fill
American airwaves with sex jokes and acid political jibes. Chinese
broadcasters gently murmur encouragement to callers, engage in
chummy chats with guests _ and stay far away from politics.
	   Talk radio emerged on the Chinese scene in the 1980s, offering
the first populist outlet in decades after the late leader Deng
Xiaoping loosened rigid controls that had kept newspapers, radio
and television filled with turgid propaganda.
	   It quickly found an eager following among Chinese who under
communist rule had been expected to keep quiet about personal
problems, hopes and fears, and who had no outlet to discuss them
anyway.
	   On Tuesday, Shanghai People's Radio will break new ground when a
call-in show features an unusual celebrity guest _ visiting
President Bill Clinton.
	   Talk radio faltered in the late 1980s, when an explosion of
increasingly frank talk about sex, adultery and other previously
unspeakable topics scandalized conservative Chinese leaders. But
after a crackdown on the more risque programs, the more mainstream
broadcasters got back to work.
	   Today, the bulk of talk radio is devoted to everyday problems _
coping with problem children, rising joblessness, fears about
China's slowing economy and housing reforms.
	   Programs are devoted to women's issues, public health and other
special topics.
	   At nearly any hour of the day, there is talk somewhere on the
radio dial.
	   Education, marriage, health, housing woes _ for nearly every
topic, there is a talk show on China's airwaves, and many give the
public a chance to call in and share their grievances or ask
advice.
	   One recent Saturday evening on Shanghai radio, the topic was
education and the guest was schoolteacher Zhou Yaozhi, who tutors
students in her spare time.
	   ``My husband and I aren't rich, but we are rich in spirit.
Nothing is more important than to educate our kids and make them
useful talents for our country,'' Zhou, who teaches at the
Zhenguang Middle School, tells listeners.

Treasurer rejects suggestions Australia to go into recession Asian economic fallout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with prime minister blaming party's Queensland loss on
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Treasurer Peter Costello on Monday
rejected predictions Australia is heading for a recession,
insisting strong domestic economic growth will cushion it from the
full impact of the Asia crisis.
	   In the afternoon, Prime Minister John Howard appeared to
undercut his argument by blaming the conservatives' loss of the
Queensland state election two weeks ago on the fallout of the Asian
economic crisis.
	   ``There is no doubt that there are many areas of rural poverty
in our nation,'' Howard told Parliament.
	   ``I have little doubt that the major driving force behind the
recent political events is economic vulnerability rather than
anything else.
	   ``The reality is that a lot of Australians in the bush work very
hard, they run very very efficient businesses, they've been
savagely mauled by the downturn in world markets, commodity prices
are very low.''
	   A survey of 11 academic economists published in newspapers
Monday placed the chances of a recession striking in the next two
years from between ``probable'' to ``very high.''
	   But responding to the survey's findings on an Adelaide radio
station, Costello said: ``Oh no. It is true there has been a
serious downturn in Asia and that will affect the Australian
economy, in fact most of Asia is now in recession.
	   ``But the Australian economy has been remarkably strong in the
last quarter, probably the fastest growing economy amongst
developed nations in the world, and whilst Asia will affect it and
it will make it harder for Australia in the future, the fact that
we're coming into it with strong growth means that we'll be able to
withstand it.''
	   The economy expanded 1.3 percent in the first quarter and 4.9
percent over the last year.
	   The Australian dollar fell against the U.S. dollar recently when
dealers linked Australia to the Asia crisis, although it has since
managed to regain some ground.
	   Asked whether it was wrong in retrospect for the government to
have tried to talk up the currency, Costello replied: ``We don't
try and talk a particular level for the Australia dollar.''
	   Costello said he merely made the point that the currency should
be based on fundamentals including the inflation and growth rates,
``And they have been very strong in Australia.''
	   A volatile world environment, particularly for the yen, made it
easier for other currencies to become caught up in events.
	   ``But my point has always been that when you're looking at the
Australian dollar, it's the Australian fundamentals that are
important,'' he said.

E.U. to help Laos clear unexploded ordnance from Vietnam War

Eds: CORRECTS figure to dlrs 3 million in 2nd graf
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union will help Laos clear
unexploded ordnance from one of the provinces most heavily bombed
by U.S. planes during the Vietnam War.
	   The Nation newspaper Monday cited the E.U.'s regional director,
Emiliano Fossati, as saying that the E.U. will announce about dlrs
3 million in aid next month for Laos to boost clearance and
community awareness in Savannakhet province.
	   Savannakhet was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, through which
North Vietnam transported men and war material to U.S.-backed South
Vietnam through officially neutral Laos during the Vietnam
conflict.
	   U.S. planes dropped more explosives on Laos than on all of
Germany during World War II, with much of the payload being
baseball-sized bomblets that failed to explode.
	   The so-called bombies and other ordnance that didn't go off then
now kill or maim 200 Laotians a year. The United States and several
European countries and charities are trying to clear it.

Indonesian capital jittery amid fears of more riots over prices

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ When traffic lights blink red at big
intersections, beggars, vendors and street musicians swarm around
cars, insistently tapping on rolled-up windows.
	   Cadgers abound now in Jakarta, the jobless victims of a yearlong
economic crisis in Asia that refuses to let up. Most evenings, two
dozen hustlers jostle on a curb near a cluster of luxury hotels. A
few months ago, just a couple lingered.
	   This capital of 10 million people, where slums lined with
sewage-choked canals nestle near high-walled mansions and gleaming
office towers, is beset by uncertainty and worry about social
chaos.
	   Some residents fear spreading poverty will trigger more violence
like the riots over price increases last month that killed as many
as 1,200 people and drove President Suharto from office. Many
ethnic Chinese, who were targeted in the mayhem, fled overseas and
have not returned.
	   ``There's still food around, but the money is gone,'' said
Jumaedi, a truck driver sitting in a rundown restaurant with a few
buddies and eating a rice and egg dish that cost the equivalent of
10 cents.
	   While new President B.J. Habibie pushes an agenda of democratic
reform, doubts are rife about his ability to harness this vast
nation of 17,000 islands and 202 million people.
	   Many view a swelling of daily street rallies tied to myriad
causes as an omen of looming political chaos. Growing testy,
military commanders sent hundreds of soldiers to block workers
trying to march last week to Parliament to demand Habibie's ouster.
	   ``Politically, we just do not know where to go at present. There
is no clear direction,'' said Harry Tjan of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a private think-tank.
	   Some foreigners who were evacuated during the riots never came
back, and those still in town are edgy. One real estate
advertisement in The Jakarta Post, an English-language newspaper,
offers a home with a swimming pool in a ``riot-free location.''
	   ``Protect your family and your budget,'' tempts another ad for
an apartment in a complex with security guards.
	   The military is on alert. Soldiers in berets sometimes lounge on
sidewalks outside shopping centers or cruise the streets aboard
olive-green trucks.
	   Armored cars park at both ends of the tree-lined lane where
Suharto lives, extra security for the authoritarian leader who quit
May 21 after 32 years in power. Anger over the vast wealth he and
his family amassed is widespread.
	   Candor in government is a new, refreshing trend. Information
Minister Yunus Yosfiah suggested his office be disbanded because it
wasted money and, ironically, had only stalled the spread of
information.
	   Habibie has pledged general elections next year and freed some
political prisoners. He even visited riot-damaged malls to
sympathize with bereft shopkeepers, a campaign-style gesture that
his aloof predecessor would never have made.
	   Yet political reform is abstract for millions of Indonesians
with no jobs and little money.
	   In Jakarta, teen-age prostitutes now beckon drivers near the
city's national monument, a tall spire of marble topped by a
gold-leaf sculpture in the shape of a flame.
	   Many bus drivers can't work because there is no cash for
imported spare parts. Occupancy in some hotels hovers at a paltry
10 percent, and cranes sit idle on construction sites.
	   Partly gutted in an electrical fire in November, a shiny,
blue-glassed tower in the central bank complex is empty and
unrepaired. There are no funds to fix it.
	   Hundreds of buildings damaged in May's rioting remain boarded
up, their windows still smashed.
	   The economic crisis, which erupted last July and has stripped
the rupiah of more than 80 percent of its value, threatens
commercial distribution networks splintered by the flight of ethnic
Chinese entrepreneurs. Many have stayed in Singapore, Malaysia and
elsewhere.
	   ``Some of my friends in the office, especially Chinese, have
already resigned and gone to Australia,'' said Mai Mara Tando, who
works for a shipping company.
	   Ethnic Chinese have long been resented for their business acumen
and relative wealth, and their stores bore the brunt of the
looting. There were unconfirmed reports that dozens of Chinese
women were raped.
	   Indonesia may get a lift in July, when the International
Monetary Fund is expected to resume disbursing billions of dollars
in loans, suspended because of the turmoil last month.
	   But unemployed youths, like one hustler selling a laptop
computer, are desperate. He approached a car with his merchandise,
possibly a spoil from the looting in May.
	   ``Do you want to buy my calculator? It's too big for me,'' he
declared. The delighted driver picked it up for 50,000 rupiah _ or
dlrs 3.30 at the current exchange rate.

Four Cambodians charged with murder of Iraqi in visa scam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Four Cambodian men have been
arrested and accused of the kidnap and murder of an Iraqi citizen
whose bound and bloated body was discovered a week ago on a rural
highway, police said Monday.
	   The victim, Falah D. Mohamad, 36, was accused by his assailants
of running a visa scam and making off with dlrs 68,000 collected
from 17 Cambodian students who were seeking to continue their
studies in the United States.
	   The suspects, all in their mid-20s, will be sent to the Phnom
Penh municipal court Tuesday to face a string of charges, said Mak
Chito, head of the police division in charge of foreigners.
	   It was unclear if any were the students. One was said to be a
middleman who collected the money from them.
	   Mohamad's body was discovered by villagers 30 kilometers (20
miles) southwest of the capital. He had been handcuffed, his legs
were bound and his mouth was taped shut.
	   Mohamad had recently been in Thailand but was lured back by the
men with a party invitation, Mak Chito said. When he arrived at
Phnom Penh's airport they allegedly kidnapped him and beat him to
death.
	   The suspects then wrote a ransom letter to Mohamad's wife in
Bangkok, telling her to deliver 25 million baht (dlrs 595,000), Mak
Chito said, but she instead alerted the Iraqi Embassy in Bangkok.

With luxury cars on board, vessels ship out without scrutiny 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Investigators were wearily studying their
umpteenth shipping manifest when there it was.
	   A Mercedes-Benz, loaded on a ship steaming out of the busiest
U.S. port and headed for Hong Kong, matched the identification
number of a sedan reported stolen from a Northern California
shopping mall.
	   The discovery launched an international investigation that has
netted 72 suspects and recovered millions of dollars worth of
Lexus, BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars destined for Asia. Millions more
in Landcruisers, Broncos and Suburbans headed for Latin America
have also been traced.
	   The Associated Press first reported in 1992 that the vast crush
of legitimate traffic at more than 300 American ports was working
to smugglers' advantage because inspectors can search only a
minuscule portion _ perhaps 1 percent _ of vessels leaving American
waters.
	   Cars, motorcycles, computers, hi-fi gear, software, guns,
appliances _ all are stolen here and smuggled to eager buyers
around the world.
	   But investigators have focused only relatively recently on the
steady, lucrative traffic that dwarfs all the rest _ stolen
high-end, luxury automobiles, a commodity estimated by insurers to
be worth dlrs 1 billion or more a year.
	   Government and insurance industry investigators say more than
200,000 ``stolens'' slip out of the United States annually _
perhaps 550 vehicles a day. Most believe that figure is low.
	   ``It's probably higher, and the truth of the matter is nobody
knows how many cars are going out,'' said Shan Haider, claims
investigation manager for Farmers Insurance Co.
	   ``It's like looking at the tip of an iceberg _ you wonder how
much more is underneath the water,'' said Mark Stowell, a National
Insurance Crime Bureau investigator assigned to the Long Beach-Los
Angeles port.
	   About 160,000 vessels enter or leave West Coast ports annually,
most of them freighters. Aboard are millions of boxy, sealed cargo
containers, ``intermodal'' units that can be carried on a ship,
loaded on a railroad flatcar or plopped onto a tractor trailer.
	   Most containers leave the country untouched, their contents
verified by voluminous paperwork but not by the personal scrutiny
of a federal agent.
	   ``It's a momentous task,'' said Jeff Benzing, a spokesman for
the Illinois-based NICB. ``It is just physically impossible to
search every one of those ships (leaving the United States). You'd
probably have to have a million customs agents just to do it.''
	   Take a Mercedes-Benz SL600 that retails for dlrs 130,000 in a
Los Angeles showroom. It might sell for dlrs 350,000 or more in
some Asian black markets, where luxury cars are unavailable or _ at
best _ can be had only after a wait of months.
	   Most stolen cars leave the West Coast for Asia and Latin
America, where they fetch the highest prices. Some go through
Miami, a popular export point for the Caribbean.
	   Foreign criminals hire gangs to steal specific cars. In one
case, U.S. investigators traced 14 stolen luxury cars to a Thai who
had put in an `order' with an Orange County Asian gang.
	   The scam is simple. ``Straw buyers'' purchase luxury cars in the
United States, drive them for a couple of weeks, then place them in
sealed shipping containers. They're loaded on a ship, then unloaded
in Asia some 10 weeks later.
	   Sometimes paperwork correctly identifies the container's
contents as a car; other times the paperwork is bogus, or it
describes the contents as appliances, or textiles, or motor oil.
	   If the container is opened, it may appear to be filled with
legal products. The car is behind a false wall.
	   The buyer reports the car stolen only after it leaves the
country. He collects the insurance payment, which goes back to the
ring that supplied the cash for the original purchase.
	   The scheme's success depends on two things _ the rarity of a
physical search and the delay in reporting the ``theft'' until
after the vehicle has been shipped.
	   The Customs Service tracks the thieves through random searches,
computers, undercover agents and an array of other techniques _
including many they don't want to reveal.
	   Agents are familiar with legitimate exporters, and they often
sense when something isn't right.
	   ``We are not operating in a vacuum. They know us and we know
them,'' U.S. Customs Service spokesman Mike Fleming said.
	   The Mercedes-Benz case provided the link to dozens of other
thefts and offered a glimpse into the enormity of the problem.
	   State and federal agents compared the vehicle identification
numbers, or VINs, with the identification numbers of vehicles that
had been reported stolen. They used databases compiled from the
Commerce Department, shipping companies and the manufacturers.
	   On the first computer run, they came up with 102 ``hits.''
	   ``I remember that day very well: March 2, 1995,'' said Earl
Door, a top fraud investigator for the state Insurance Department.
	   ``We ran the VINs and _ boom! _ we had 102 stolen vehicles. All
of them had been reported stolen. We've had cases where we had,
maybe, 10 cars. But this was 102. That's a lot of cars.''
	   Investigators from an array of agencies have formed a new group
called FEAR _ Foreign Export Auto Recovery _ and are pooling their
resources.
	   One new tool: a gamma ray scanner, a kind of huge X-ray machine,
that the Customs Service in Miami began using on containers in
February. Long Beach hopes to get one of the dlrs 250,000 scanners
soon.
	   ``Those (Customs) guys are good, and they are very, very
aggressive,'' Door said. ``They want to rock and roll, but there's
only so much you can do in a day. Basically, that's the problem we
all have in this _ not enough people.''

Official: Singapore, Malaysia water agreement stalling 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ No progress has been made in talks between
Singapore and Malaysia regarding water, which Singapore is forced
to import from its northern neighbor, Singapore's foreign minister
S. Jayakumar said Monday.
	   Roughly half of the 1.2 million cubic meters (42 million cubic
feet) of water consumed in Singapore each day comes from Malaysia,
and the sometimes strained relations between the neighbors have
brought the water issue to the fore.
	   Though the two countries' prime ministers in February
tentatively agreed to renew the water contract, the 60-day deadline
for confirming the terms had meanwhile expired.
	   ``What Singapore seeks is a formal, legally binding water
agreement, which sets out clearly the terms and conditions of the
supply of water after the present water agreements run out in 2011
and 2061,'' Jayakumar said in Parliament.
	   ``We will continue discussions with the Malaysian when they are
ready,'' he added.
	   In May, Singapore announced that it was working on plans to
build two seawater desalinization plants by 2011 in addition to one
already under construction, to replace the water supplied by its
northern neighbor. Desalinization would provide an expensive, but
controlled source of water for the island.
	   And last week, Singapore launched a water conservation campaign,
announcing higher water tariffs and conservation taxes.

Prime minister: 36 percent of state-owned enterprises in red 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai says about 36
percent of the 6,000 state-owned enterprises are losing money and
should be sold or restructured, the Vietnam Economic Times reported
Monday.
	   Khai was quoted as telling senior provincial leaders and
industries at a meeting last week that equitization and
restructuring ``therefore need to be speeded up.''
	   Valuation of such enterprises' assets should be done in a way to
allow workers and other citizens to buy shares, he said.
	   Less than 20 enterprises have been sold off since Vietnam
started its privatization process, called equitization, in
mid-1992.
	   Originally, the government planned to have 150 enterprises go
public this year, but the National Assembly voted in May not to set
that as a target.
	   Vietnam has been trying to revamp its economy, but the efforts
have been complicated by the fallout of the Asian economic crisis.

Dollar higher, stocks advance in Tokyo prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained stronger against the yen
in afternoon trading Monday, but profit-taking following the
release of a key central bank report left it off earlier highs.
Tokyo stocks finished higher.
	   The dollar bought 141.98 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.70 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late Friday level in New York of
142.44 yen.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 143.40 yen, its
strongest level since Japan and the United States jointly
intervened to stop the yen's slide on June 17.
	   But the U.S. currency shed some of its early gains on
profit-taking after the Bank of Japan's ``tankan'' quarterly survey
of business sentiment came in not quite as dismal as economists had
expected.
	   That result caused U.S. hedge funds and European investors to
sell dollars for yen, traders said.
	   The survey's ``business condition diffusion index'' _ which
measures the percentage of major manufacturers seeing conditions
improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen _ fell to
minus 38 from minus 31 in the previous survey released in early
April.
	   Still, the figure was better than an average forecast of minus
44 by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The weakness of Japan's economy has been pulling down the yen.
Analysts fear that a falling yen will rekindle the Asian currency
crisis by further weakening the already battered currencies of many
countries in the region.
	   ``We are concerned about the weakness of the yen,'' Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Finance
Ministry, said Monday.
	   On the stock exchange, share prices advanced on improved market
sentiment following news Friday about the possible merger of a
troubled major Japanese credit bank.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 155.69 points, or 1.02
percent, closing at 15,365.73 points. On Friday, the index closed
up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,202.22.
The TOPIX gained 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, on Friday.
	   Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. announced Friday that they were in negotiations for to
merge in a year's time. Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank had been
looking for a partner to save it from problems caused by massive
bad loans.
	   ``The merger of LTCB has temporarily eased fears about Japan's
financial system,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities.
	   The merger talk is seen as a test for the nation's financial
system, which is under a mountain of bad loans.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.270 percent from Friday's finish of 1.230
percent, driving its price down to 111.43 yen from 111.73 yen.

Sex-abuse charges jar communal Christian sect in western Canada 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ While the Amish community in the U.S. state of
Pennsylvania reels from revelations of drug abuse, an equally
wrenching scandal is jarring another communal Christian sect on the
Canadian prairies _ this one involving sexual abuse.
	   Ten men and boys from two Hutterite farming colonies in Alberta
have been charged with committing a total of 34 sex offenses over a
10-year period, ranging from incest to fondling the genitals of
young girls.
	   The six Hutterites facing the most serious charges are awaiting
trial. On Friday, four young men, ranging in age from 17 to 22,
were placed on probation and ordered to perform community service
after pleading guilty to fondling 6- and 7-year-old girls several
years ago.
	   In issuing the sentence, Provincial Court Judge Gordon Clozza
urged Hutterite community leaders to establish some sort of
sex-education program.
	   ``Sex is a part of life, and the sooner you address the
question, the more available the answers will be,'' he said.
``Young people may not then have to go out and explore the
questions on their own.''
	   Hutterites, a communal sect similar to the Mennonites and the
Amish, originated in eastern Europe in 1528.
	   The Hutterites immigrated to North America in the late 1800s to
escape religious persecution. There are about 20,000 in western
Canada and about 40,000 in the United States, mainly on the
Northern Plains.
	   Like the Amish, they live communally, dress simply and try to
live apart from modern society. Unlike the Amish, they embrace
technology that helps them develop large, prosperous farms.
	   Traditionally, the sect has been male-dominated, an issue
addressed by Clozza on Friday when he expressed hope that Hutterite
women would be encouraged to report sexual assaults.
	   ``There is a new age here,'' Clozza told Hutterite leaders.
``There is a new feeling that everybody is equal, and I would
expect that to be respected throughout this country.''
	   A prosecutor, Darlene Oka, told the court earlier that one of
the 6-year-old girls who was fondled had been spanked by her father
when he became aware of the incident.
	   Oka said there are elders among the Hutterites ``who continue to
blame the victims, who claim the victims have distorted the
facts.''
	   The case has some similarities to the recent revelations of drug
problems among conservative Amish people of southeastern
Pennsylvania. Two Amish men have been charged with dealing cocaine
to Amish youth at hoedowns.
	   In each case, other members of the sects were dismayed about the
sudden negative attention focused on their communities.
	   In Alberta, even though the judge banned publication of any
details that might identify the victims, Hutterites in the
courtroom hissed at reporters, indicating they resented the way the
case had been covered in the media.
	   ``They are terribly embarrassed and ashamed,'' said Hugh
Sommerville, a lawyer advising the accused Hutterites.

Police guard power project after attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ More than 70 police guarded Fiji's main power
station Monday following an attack allegedly by landowners
demanding compensation for land lost to a hydroelectric project.
	   Attackers on Sunday set fire to the administration block of the
Wailoa power station at Monasavu on the main island of Viti Levu,
causing about 100,000 Fiji dollars (US dlrs 50,000) damage. Police
were on guard nearby at the time.
	   The fire followed a threat last week by landowners to set up
road blocks and disrupt the power station if the government did not
pay 35 million Fiji dollars (U.S. dlrs 17.5 million) compensation
for forest land flooded in the creation of a 12 1/2-mile- (20-km-)
long reservoir in the early 1980s.
	   The power station, built by the Fijian Electricity Authority,
provides electricity for about 80 percent of Viti Levu.
	   An additional 22 police were sent to Monasavu to supplement 55
officers already there over the weekend to guard the power station,
police Sgt. Ambika Sharma said.
	   Several landowners were being questioned Monday about the fire,
Sharma said.
	   Landowners had already been compensated for lost land, said
former Fijian Electricity Authority chief executive David
Pickering, now a government minister.
	   ``The money was not paid to the landowners then but held in
trust by government for the Fijian landowners' future
generations,'' Pickering said.
	   Pickering does not know what happened to the money.
	   ``The FEA should know,'' he added.
	   Landowners were also given about 50 houses formerly used by
project staff.
	   ``They receive a number of perks which included the provision of
electricity and a water supply system,'' Pickering said. ``They are
very fortunate people.''

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party
retained the mayoral post in the largest Mexican city along the
U.S. border, unofficial ballot returns showed on Sunday.
	   The PAN, as it is known by its Spanish initials, won its fourth
straight mayor's race since 1989 over the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   The main contenders in the five-candidate race were Francisco
Vega de la Madrid of the PAN, Amador Rodriguez Lozano of the PRI
and Jesus Ruiz Barraza of the left-center Democratic Revolution
Party.
	   With 83 percent of the polling places counted, Vega was ahead
with 96,083 votes, or 45 percent, to Rodriguez Lozano's 82,556
votes, or 39 percent. Ruiz trailed with 19,848 votes, or 9 percent.
	   Official results were not expected until Wednesday.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power, and it currently has a PAN
governor.
	   The PAN had been expected to hang onto the mayorships of Tijuana
and Mexicali, the state capital. With 80 percent of the polling
places counted in Mexicali, the PAN candidate led the PRI candidate
44 percent to 40 percent.
	   The PAN ``has done many things for Tijuana,'' said voter
Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, who works in a Sony maquiladora, or
assembly plant near the U.S. border. She said she has noticed
improvements in the streets and schools.
	   But Juana Flores Rodriguez, 29, said she liked the promises of
the PRI's Rodriguez Lozano, who has said he would bring paved
roads, storm drains and running water to shantytowns.
	   Rodriguez Lozano, 47, is a federal senator. Vega, 43, is a
former state finance director running for his first elective post,
while Ruiz, 58, is the founder of Centro Universitario Tijuana, a
private university.
	   Election officials and police reported few problems while the
state's 2,337 polling places were open. At stake were five key
mayoral posts and all 25 seats in the state congress.
	   Turnout among the state's 1,231,667 registered voters was light
despite good weather, as state residents apparently stayed home to
watch World Cup soccer.
	   In the port city of Ensenada, currently governed by the PRI, the
PAN led with 41 percent of the vote to 36 percent with three
quarters of the polling places counted late Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, it appeared that the PRI would hold onto the border
city of Tecate, where it had 45 percent of the vote despite a
strong showing of 24 percent by the PRD. In the fifth race, it
looked like the PAN would win the town of Rosarito Beach, which was
holding its first mayoral election.

Report: 12 bodies found, 30 people missing in ferry sinking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers have found the bodies of 12
people who died when a ferry capsized last week, a news agency
reported Monday. Thirty people remained missing and were presumed
dead.
	   The ferry, carrying 94 passengers and crew, sank Thursday night
in the straits of Alas, between the islands of Sumbawa and Lombok,
a popular tourist destination. The region is 1,125 kilometers (700
miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.
	   Since Friday, authorities have found a total of 12 bodies, the
official Antara news agency said. One of the victims was found 11
kilometers (7 miles) from the accident site.
	   Relatives of the dead and missing have gathered daily on a dock
on Lombok Island to wait for navy boats that have been searching
the site.
	   Fifty-two people were rescued. Authorities are investigating the
cause.

Former Oilers defensive lineman dies of Lou Gehrig's disease 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Glenn Montgomery, the former Houston Oilers and
Seattle Seahawks defensive lineman, died Sunday of Lou Gehrig's
disease. He was 31.
	   Montgomery died in Dallas, according to KHOU-TV's Jeff McShan,
who was working with Montgomery on a story about amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, the neuromuscular disease named for the former
first baseman for baseball's New York Yankees.
	   ALS is a fatal neuromuscular disease diagnosed in more than
5,000 Americans each year. Those stricken usually have a life
expectancy of between two and five years.
	   Montgomery, who played at the University of Houston, was
diagnosed with the disease in 1996 while playing for the Seahawks.
	   Montgomery went public with news of his disease in October 1997.
	   ``I felt like the Lord wouldn't have put me in this position if
he knew I couldn't handle it,'' Montgomery said in that interview.
``I'm very happy with the way my life is going up to this point.
And I believe that everything happens for a reason.
	   ``Maybe God chose me because he knew I'm strong, you know, a
strong-willed person, and I just want to try to help a lot of
people out there that have what I have.''
	   Montgomery had been in relatively good health in recent weeks,
although steadily affected by the debilitating advance of the
disease.

Official: Singapore, Malaysia water agreement stalling 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS to Malaysians, 5th graf
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ No progress has been made in talks between
Singapore and Malaysia regarding water, which Singapore is forced
to import from its northern neighbor, Singapore's foreign minister
S. Jayakumar said Monday.
	   Roughly half of the 1.2 million cubic meters (42 million cubic
feet) of water consumed in Singapore each day comes from Malaysia,
and the sometimes strained relations between the neighbors have
brought the water issue to the fore.
	   Though the two countries' prime ministers in February
tentatively agreed to renew the water contract, the 60-day deadline
for confirming the terms had meanwhile expired.
	   ``What Singapore seeks is a formal, legally binding water
agreement, which sets out clearly the terms and conditions of the
supply of water after the present water agreements run out in 2011
and 2061,'' Jayakumar said in Parliament.
	   ``We will continue discussions with the Malaysians when they are
ready,'' he added.
	   In May, Singapore announced that it was working on plans to
build two seawater desalinization plants by 2011 in addition to one
already under construction, to replace the water supplied by its
northern neighbor. Desalinization would provide an expensive, but
controlled source of water for the island.
	   And last week, Singapore launched a water conservation campaign,
announcing higher water tariffs and conservation taxes.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Following his speech Monday at Peking University,
U.S. President Bill Clinton fielded tough questions from students
on topics ranging from U.S. policy on Taiwan and how he handles
protesters to the motive for pursuing a new relationship with
China.
	   In the end, Clinton commended the students for asking questions
with ``an element of criticism to them that have been very helpful
to me.''
	   ``They have helped me understand how what I say is perceived by
others, not just in China but around the world,'' Clinton said.
``So I feel very good that we've had this interchange and, from my
point of view, the questions were more important than my speech.''

comments useful.

Jailed Serb war crimes suspect commits suicide in cell 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor on trial for war
crimes and crimes against humanity hanged himself in his jail cell
early Monday, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door of his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague, tribunal spokesman Chrisian Chartier said.
	   Chartier said authorities considered the death a suicide but
were investigating. Tribunal officials and Dutch police were
conducting separate probes.

Tokyo develops pepper bomb to scare off crop-eating monkeys 
</HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After years of unsuccessful attempts at keeping
crop-eating monkeys out of the fields, a Tokyo research team says
it may have finally found a solution _ red hot chili peppers.
	   The team has successfully produced a new weapon which shoots
chili powder up into the air, irritating the eyes and noses of
hapless monkeys that pass in front of carefully-placed sensors.
	   ``We've tried electrified wires, fences and all kinds of other
preventive measures, but monkeys are smart enough to outwit the
tricks,'' Toshiaki Wada, director of the Tokyo Forestry Experiment
Station in western Tokyo, said Monday.
	   The problem with bands of monkeys invading farms has gotten so
bad that two years ago four towns on the western fringes of Tokyo
gave farmers permission to shoot to kill after other methods _ such
as loud noises _ failed to scare off the monkeys.
	   The mammals are blamed for pilfering 67 million yen (dlrs
468,500) worth of produce in the towns in 1996 alone, according to
the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's agricultural affairs division.
	   Although hunters have bagged 10 of the gray-colored macaques
since then, the thieving continues unabated.
	   Among the monkey's favorite vegetables are young horse radish,
potatoes, turnips and carrots.
	   ``They seem to enjoy playing with the vegetables,'' said Tokyo
government official Mineo Jona. ``They usually take a bite or two,
then throw it out and pull new ones.''
	   Jona said that the potato season is now underway, making the
monkey problem more acute in some areas.
	   The pepper shooters are erected at the foot of mountainous areas
to keep the monkeys from coming further down. Though non-fatal, the
pepper spray can be painful, and Wada said a safer version is
currently under development.
	   In the meantime, the four worst-hit towns installed either
electric trip wires or chili bombs, or both, last year, spending a
total of 22 million yen (dlrs 154,000).
	   Tokyo government officials say farmers reported their crops have
been almost untouched since.
	   But Wada warned monkeys are quick learners, and may soon learn
how to outwit the pepper-spraying device.

Bombings target damage army camp, housing office; officer injured 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AJACCIO, Corsica (AP) _ Two bombings overnight targeted a
housing office and a military police camp, injuring an officer,
police said Monday, in the latest attacks on this French
Mediterranean island.
	   The gendarme was hospitalized in shock after a package bomb was
thrown at the camp near the town of Borgo, outside the northern
port of Bastia, late Sunday night, authorities said on customary
anonymity.
	   The second bombing before dawn Monday damaged the low-cost
housing agency Logirem in the western port of Ajaccio, police said.
No injuries were reported.
	   No one claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on Corsican
nationalists who have waged a 23-year campaign of bombings against
French government targets to press their demands for autonomy or
independence.
	   Overnight Friday, bombings in northern Corsica targeted police
stations in Saint-Florent and Corte, causing minor damage and no
injuries.
	   The February assassination of France's top administrator on the
island _ Prefect Claude Erignac _ sparked a new crackdown by
authorities and another spate of bombings.
	   Last month, a bombing on the mainland damaged a regional
government building in Marseille, and three men were arrested on
Corsica with explosives outside a state bank.
	   In a poll early this year, more than one-third of mainland
French were in favor of cutting the cord on heavily subsidized
Corsica, and more than half backed a referendum on independence.
More than 80 percent of Corsicans opposed independence.

Israeli president calls for early elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In apparent frustration over the deadlock in
Mideast peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial. However, the president is
very popular and his statements carry great moral weight. The next
general elections are to be held in 2000.
	   Last week, the president expressed frustration over the stalled
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the scope of a
West Bank troop withdrawal. Weizman reportedly complained at the
time that he had been misled by Netanyahu, with the prime minister
having assured him agreement on a troop withdrawal was imminent.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, began floating the idea of a referendum on a
troop withdrawal. However, the proposal faded from the headlines
several days ago after it became apparent that Netanyahu would not
have a majority in parliament for preparatory legislation.
	   With Netanyahu backing off a referendum, another gauge of public
opinion is needed, Weizman said Monday.
	   ``If he does not conduct a referendum, in my opinion the next
solution needs to be elections,'' Weizman said. ``The sooner we go
to elections the sooner we will know what the public thinks.''
	   Opinion pulls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.

	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that he played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200
Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended last Thursday and a verdict was expected in two
weeks. He had faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well. The guards checked on him
every half-hour and last saw him alive at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, he
said.
	   The lights were on in his cell at that time, but shortly
thereafter, Dokmanovic somehow managed to short-circuit the

	   Prosecutors had charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in the

	   The massacre is widely considered to be the worst atrocity of
the 1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   According to prosecutors, the day of Nov. 20, 1991, began at
Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought refuge
after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army, known
as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croatians and others from the hospital were
rounded up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to
a nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege. The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic was responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure to prevent and
stop the crimes as a civic leader.

Activists: Clinton should press Hong Kong leaders for rights guarantees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton should press Hong
Kong leaders during his visit for commitments to protect human
rights, an international rights body said Monday.
	   Although human rights are largely intact a year after Hong
Kong's return to Chinese rule, there are some ``subtle, creeping''
changes, said Amnesty International's newly released report on Hong
Kong.
	   ``President Clinton should flag that the international community
will continue to watch developments in Hong Kong very, very
closely,'' Rory Mungoven, Asia Pacific director of the London-based
body, told a news conference.
	   Clinton's message for Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
``should be in the spirit of his speech at Beijing University,'' he
said.
	   Clinton told Beijing students Monday that human rights are ``the
birthrights of people everywhere,'' and urged China's communist
leaders not to fear an open society.
	   Tung, Beijing's choice to run Hong Kong, often is criticized as
too conservative and too willing to bow to pressure from Beijing.
He has warned repeatedly that Hong Kong shall not become a center
for activities to overthrow China's communist leadership.
	   China guarantees that Hong Kong's freewheeling capitalist system
will be unchanged for 50 years under the ``one country, two
systems'' reunification formula.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on Thursday for a
brief visit to conclude his historic China tour. He will meet with
Tung and other political and business leaders.
	   In the report, Amnesty said changes in public order laws last
year ``expanded the grounds for intervention in legitimate,
peaceful political activity and protest.''
	   A law giving Beijing state organizations blanket legal
exemptions also raised fears of possible legal abuse, the report
said.
	   Freedom of expression also may be rolled back with the expected
introduction of national security laws banning treason and
sedition.
	   The government says such laws are needed according to the
post-handover constitution, but Mungoven said the legislation,
``one of the biggest tests for the future of civil liberties in
Hong Kong,'' is not necessary because Hong Kong is socially and
politically stable.
	   ``President Clinton should express concern about changes that
have been made to the Hong Kong system, which can strain community
participation, and which open up legal ambiguities that could put
human rights at risk in the future,'' Mungoven said.

South Korea reports record current account surplus in May 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Decreasing imports helped South Korea
post a record dlrs 4.26 billion current account surplus in May, its
seventh straight monthly gain, the Bank of Korea said Monday.
	   The May surplus compared to a current account deficit of dlrs
900 million in the same month last year, the central bank said in a
preliminary report.
	   The previous record current account surplus was dlrs 3.99
billion in February.
	   Bank officials attributed the surplus to declining imports of
raw materials and consumer goods because of the weakening Korean
currency, the won. The won has lost nearly half of its value in the
past year.
	   The May surplus increased South Korea's combined current account
surplus in the first five months of the year to dlrs 18.8 billion,
compared to a deficit of dlrs 9.85 billion in the same period last
year, they said.
	   The current account measures a nation's trade in goods and
services plus certain other capital flows. It is a key yardstick
for gauging a nation's economic health.
	   ``We expect to continue to make current account surpluses in the
coming months as imports continue to drop sharply,'' said Kim
Sung-hwan, a spokesman for the Bank of Korea.
	   But experts expressed concern about the nature of the current
account surplus, resulting mainly from declining imports.
	   ``Imports of raw material, the basis of our exports, are
decreasing sharply. The impact was already shown partially last
month. It will get bigger and bigger,'' said Lee Pil-sang, an
economist at Korea University.
	   Exports in May dropped by 2.6 percent from the same month last
year to dlrs 11.4 billion, the first monthly drop since January.
	   Imports in May fell 37.5 percent to dlrs 7.7 billion, mainly
because of depressed domestic consumption and facility investment
and falling oil prices.
	   That created a dlrs 3.7 billion trade surplus in May, the
seventh straight monthly gain, and pushed South Korea's total trade
surplus for the first five months of the year to dlrs 16.1 billion.

Dying Sri Lankan sues tobacco company over lung cancer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Sri Lankan tailor dying of lung
cancer is suing a British- and U.S.-owned tobacco company, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   It is the first time a tobacco company is being sued by a smoker
on the Indian Ocean island, where health authorities estimate more
than half of all adult men smoke.
	   Kurukulasuriyage Cecil Perera, 46, filed the lawsuit for 2.5
million rupees (dlrs 38,500) on Friday against the Ceylon Tobacco
Co., claiming it was responsible for his addiction to nicotine, the
Island newspaper reported.
	   Ceylon Tobacco, which has a monopoly on the country's tobacco
industry, is a publicly listed company, in which London based
British American Tobacco holds 84 percent of the stock and Philip
Morris Companies of New York holds eight percent.
	   The case in Colombo's district court is likely to have
far-reaching consequences because Ceylon Tobacco is the country's
largest private-sector taxpayer. It paid taxes of 16.3 billion
rupees (dlrs 250 million) in 1997, more than combined state
expenditures on health of 9.58 billion rupees (dlrs 147 million).
	   Perera said he began smoking when he was 15. By the time he was
35, he was smoking 18 cigarettes a day and couldn't stop or even
cut down.
	   Perera, who was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996, says Ceylon
Tobacco is responsible for his addiction because it manufactured an
addictive product and influenced consumers to buy it through
advertising.
	   The court has not yet set a date to hear the case. Sri Lankan
law prevents both Perera and Ceylon Tobacco from commenting
publicly.
	   The lawsuit came days after Sri Lanka's government announced
steps to curb tobacco use. Legislation is to be introduced to stop
the duty-free import of cigarettes, foreign investors in tobacco
will not be given tax breaks that investors in other industries
receive and President Chandrika Kumaratunga has banned cigarette
advertisements on radio and television and in state newspapers
starting next January.

Cambodian opposition activist found dead, mutilated 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBIN McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The mutilated body of an opposition
party activist has been discovered outside Phnom Penh, raising new
fears of violence in the run-up to elections July 26, human rights
workers said Monday.
	   The remains of Thong Sophal, 45, were discovered a week after he
was reported missing. His fingers and left ear were cut off,
indicating torture, and he had suffered at least one heavy blow to
the head, said a human rights worker, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Thong Sophal was an active campaigner for FUNCINPEC, the
royalist party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
last year as co-prime minister by his rival, Hun Sen.
	   Eng Chhay Eang, an official of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party,
said that foreign countries that so far have given a green light to
the electoral process were deluding themselves that it would be
free and fair.
	   ``The main candidates have been traveling around with only minor
problems so far, but our organizers in the city and the countryside
are still being threatened, attacked and murdered by CPP thugs,''
Eng Chhay Eang said.
	   The body of most recent Sam Rainsy Party victim, he said, had
been discovered June 19 in the eastern province of Kompong Cham.
Police say they are still investigating the death of Em Eam, 62.
	   FUNCINPEC is the main challenger to Hun Sen's formerly communist
Cambodian People's Party in the upcoming elections, and Thong
Sophal's death is the fourth this month of someone tied to the
party.
	   Party members believe the three previous killings were
politically motivated, though Hun Sen's government claims they were
the result of personal disputes. Human rights workers are
conducting their own investigations.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore legitimacy and aid
lost after he deposed Ranariddh. But critics say the polls will be
a sham because Hun Sen has used violence and intimidation against
opponents and stacked the electoral bodies in his favor.

Jailed Serb suspect commits suicide in cell tribunal. ADDS byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS details, first suicide at
By JENIFER CHAO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide. The detention
center holds 27 other people awaiting trial.
	   Although authorities considered the death a clear case of
suicide, tribunal officials and Dutch police were conducting
separate investigations, Chartier said.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that he played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200
Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended last Thursday and a verdict was expected in two
weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges, faced
up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well, and he was placed on a
suicide watch. The guards checked on him every half-hour and last
saw him alive at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, he said.
	   ``It is known that Mr. Dokmanovic complained yesterday afternoon
at 6 p.m. that he was not feeling very well,'' Chartier said. ``The
doctor was called in ... and placed him under supervision.''
	   The lights were on in his cell at that time, but shortly
thereafter, Dokmanovic managed to short-circuit the electricity in
his cell using an electric razor, and the lights went out, Chartier
said.
	   When a guard next passed by his cell just after midnight, the
body was found.
	   Dokmanovic's body was taken to a nearby hospital morgue, and his
defense attorney was notified, Chartier said. It was not
immediately known whether Dokmanovic left a note.
	   During his trial, Dokmanovic had complained through his lawyers
of feeling depressed and had been visited by a psychiatrist, but he
never hinted he was suicidal. In fact, he was seen as having a good
chance at acquittal because the evidence against him was not
overwhelming.
	   Prosecutors had charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in the
massacre near Vukovar, where he was mayor.
	   The massacre is widely considered to be the worst atrocity of
the 1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   According to prosecutors, the day of Nov. 20, 1991, began at
Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought refuge
after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army, known
as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croatians and others from the hospital were
rounded up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to
a nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege. The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic was responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure to prevent and
stop the crimes as a civic leader.

Jewish cemetery desecrated in Moscow 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Jewish graves were desecrated at a Moscow cemetery
maintained by an Orthodox synagogue that was itself damaged in a
bomb attack in May, Jewish leaders said Monday.
	   Several tombstones were knocked over and anti-Semitic graffiti
was painted on others at the graveyard connected to the Marina
Roshcha synagogue, which is run by Lubavitch Jews, a news release
said.
	   Synagogue leaders believed the vandalism was carried out Friday
night, but was not discovered until late Sunday. They said they had
not yet determined exactly how many graves had been desecrated.
	   ``We will not cower to cowardly acts of terror,'' Rabbi Berel
Lazar was quoted as saying in a news release. ``Lubavitch leaders
in particular will work only harder to ensure that Jewish life
flourishes here.''
	   The synagogue, near central Moscow, has been the scene of
several attacks in recent years.
	   The synagogue was badly damaged and two people were injured when
a bomb exploded May 13, just minutes after congregants left a
holiday celebration.
	   The Marina Roshcha synagogue was destroyed by a 1993 arson fire.
In 1996, another bomb exploded at the center.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
neo-fascists have been blamed.
	   The neo-Nazi movement is growing in Russia, where many
disaffected youths blame their economic troubles on racial and
religious minorities.

Police discover seven tortured bodies 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police discovered seven bodies in
different parts of this troubled city on Monday, with some of the
corpses bearing signs of torture and all of them riddled by
bullets, police said.
	   Only one body has been identified, but police officials say that
the condition of the other bodies indicates that their deaths were
likely linked to the ongoing feud between rival factions of the
militant ethnic group, the Mohajir Qami Movement.
	   Since June 1, more than 150 people have been killed in Karachi _
many of them civilians caught in the crossfire.
	   Late on Sunday a gun battle that raged for most of the night in
the violent Korangi neighborhood of Karachi left three people dead,
bringing the death toll over the last 24 hours to 10.
	   Federal authorities have warned the provincial government of
Sindh, of which Karachi is the capital, to stop the relentless
bloodletting.
	   The federal government has said it may increase the powers of
the paramilitary Rangers force, which is currently helping police
patrol the troubled streets. The Rangers could be given the powers
to detain people without charges.
	   Hundreds of police and Rangers are patrolling neighborhoods in
armored personnel carriers and jeeps mounted with machine guns.
	   The combatants in the feud are rival factions of the MQM, which
represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan after the Asian
subcontinent was partitioned in 1947.
	   The MQM split apart several years ago into two factions, and in
recent months a third faction has emerged. The factions have been
fighting for control of various neighborhoods in Karachi.
	   The MQM was initially formed to pressure the government to give
them better access to education and government jobs. Some mohajirs,
an Urdu word meaning refugees, want to be recognized as a fifth
ethnic group in Pakistan, like Pathans, Baluch, Punjabis and
Sindhis.
	   Successive governments have refused.

Outgoing Philippine president wants to be remembered as peacemaker 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos bade goodbye
Monday to his staff in a tearful ceremony marking the end of a
high-profile presidency that tamed armed insurgents and erased the
Philippines' image as Asia's ``sick man.''
	   Ramos' single six-year term ends Tuesday. His successor, former
movie star Joseph Estrada, has vowed to continue his wide-ranging
political and economic reforms.
	   Ramos, a former general known for working from dawn to late at
night, thanked his Cabinet and staff for ``the hard work, the
forgone lunches, the late nights, the arduous trips.''
	   In turn, the staff serenaded Ramos, his wife and a daughter with
three farewell songs, moving many, including Cabinet members, to
tears.
	   ``The bottom line of our accomplishments is that we were able to
enhance our liberty and restore the pride and dignity of Filipinos
as a freedom-loving, peace-sustaining and globally competitive
people,'' Ramos said in the two-hour ceremony in the garden of the
presidential palace.
	   Ramos has sought to prove that democracy and progress can go
together, rejecting advice offered by former Singapore Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew that the Philippines should limit democracy
to attain economic prosperity.
	   Ramos cited the generally peaceful May 11 presidential
elections, which Estrada won by a large margin, and an orderly
transfer of power as proof of the country's flourishing democracy.
	   Ramos said he wants to be remembered for forging peace accords
with military and Muslim rebels and bringing Marxist guerrillas to
the negotiating table, laying the ground for economic growth.
	   ``If I should be remembered here and abroad only by one word, I
would wish that it be as peacemaker,'' Ramos said.
	   In 1996, Ramos' administration forged a peace pact with the Moro
National Liberation Front, then the largest Muslim separatist
guerrilla group, ending a quarter-century of rebellion that killed
at least 120,000 people.
	   Talks with Communist rebels are continuing.
	   Ramos also dismantled monopolies and deregulated key industries,
allowing Filipinos to enjoy a measure of prosperity after more than
a decade of stagnancy.
	   Although some of the country's economic gains were eroded by the
currency storm that hit Asia last year, many economists say the
economic reforms set in place by Ramos have enabled the Philippines
to ward off the worst effects of the crisis.
	   Ramos said poverty declined by 10 percent in his term, although
30 percent of the country's 70 million people officially remain
impoverished.
	   The 70-year-old leader also kept a high profile in regional
affairs. In 1996, he was host to a meeting of leaders of the
18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   He also journeyed to more than 40 countries on 35 foreign trips
in an aggressive quest for investment. Officials said his trips
helped generate about dlrs 20 billion worth of business for the
Philippines.

Japan, US to research submarine detection technology 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and the United States will conduct joint
research on detection of submarines in shallow waters around Japan,
a major newspaper said Monday.
	   The research is apparently aimed at beefing up detection of
North Korean submarines, which have been increasing reconnaissance
activities in recent years, said Japan's leading business daily,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
	   A Defense Agency spokesman said officials from the U.S. Defense
Department and its Japanese counterpart have begun discussing new
joint research projects, but refused to provide further details.
	   Since the end of the Cold War, Japan has been paying more
attention to North Korean and Chinese submarines passing through
shallow waters in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, the
spokesman said.
	   North Korea has 22 Romeo-class submarines and about 60 midget
submarines, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative
military reference book.
	   Last week, a 70-ton North Korean submarine was found entangled
in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast and captured by South
Korea.
	   South Korea's Defense Ministry said Monday three spies from the
sub briefly landed on South Korean soil before being captured. All
nine crew of the craft were found dead.
	   Submarine detection in shallow waters is difficult because sound
waves from a craft become distorted afer hitting the shallow sea
bottom, military analysts say.
	   The report also said the two nations will jointly conduct
research to develop safer firing powder for launching missiles.
	   In 1994, Japan and the United States agreed to expand exchanges
of ``dual-use'' technology that can be applied to both military and
commercial purposes.
	   Under a mutual security treaty, the United States is committed
to defend Japan in case of attack. The United States is the only
country to which Japan can transfer military technology.

Floods ebb in Clinton's path, but damage in south China mounts deaths 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with additional reports of
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rainy season landslides and hailstorms have
killed at least 22 people across China, even as flood-swollen
rivers receded in a city U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit,
state media reported Monday.
	   In Guilin, a south China scenic spot that Clinton will tour
Thursday, city residents mopped up after weeks of flooding, the
China Daily reported.
	   The rains had stranded 800,000 people, left more than 200,000
homeless and killed ``dozens of people'' in the Guilin area over
the past few weeks, the report said. The damage had raised
speculation Clinton might have to cancel the visit.
	   At least 390 people have died this year in floods triggered by
unusually heavy and early torrential rains.
	   In eastern Zhejiang province's Maoyang village, rains sent 5,000
square meters (55,000 square feet) of rock and mud tumbling from a
hillside on June 22, the Legal Daily reported. The landslide swept
away 14 homes, killing 16 people and leaving seven others missing.
	   Heavy winds and hailstones, some weighing as much as 3 kilograms
(6 pounds) killed six people and injured 157 others around central
Henan province's Anyang city on June 21, Sunday's Yangcheng Evening
News reported. The storm flattened more than 30,000 structures and
uprooted more than 10,000 electricity poles.
	   Although flood waters reportedly were retreating in southern
Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, flooding still blocked
traffic on the main rail trunk between Beijing and Guangdong's
provincial capital, Guangzhou, the China Daily said.
	   To prevent flood waters from sweeping away a key bridge along
the line, engineers had towed a ``specially weighted'' train on to
the line.
	   Medical workers were trying to prevent possible flood-related
epidemics, as rescue operations continued in other flood stricken
regions, the report said.

Legislator with Chinese background resigns from prime minister's party Wales upper house 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sham Ho losing bid for presidency of New South
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's first Asian-born legislator
resigned from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative party
Monday, saying she is outraged over its obeisance to Pauline
Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation Party.
	   New South Wales state legislator Helen Sham Ho, born in Hong
Kong in 1943, was the only Asian-born legislator in the Liberal
Party, which, despite its name, is the more conservative of the
mainstream parties.
	   Sham Ho said she will become an independent, and she sought the
Labor Party's support to become upper house president in New South
Wales after being discouraged from contesting the post by the
Liberals, who wanted to avoid offending One Nation.
	   The position became vacant following the resignation of Max
Willis last week.
	   But she narrowly lost the contest Monday by 21-19 to Virginia
Chadwick, who becomes the first woman president of the New South
Wales upper house.
	   ``My decision to run for the presidency was a difficult one. It
comes after much soul-searching and deliberation with my family,''
she said.
	   ``As an Australian who has served the people of New South Wales
for over 10 years I have been deeply distressed over the growing
politics of division that is turning Australians against
Australians.
	   ``To be told by the Liberal Party that I cannot contest the
presidency because I would offend the One Nation party is offensive
and insulting to all Australians,'' she said.
	   She said the Liberal Party in Queensland had actively assisted
One Nation in that state, forging a deal to swap votes with each
other in districts they did not win.
	   This was ``a great disappointment,'' Sham Ho said.
	   ``This decision can be contrasted with the Australian Labor
party, which has taken a strong stand against One Nation party and
has demonstrated that it has a real commitment to equality for all
Australians,'' she said.
	   Willis quit his post last Friday amid allegations he was under
the influence of alcohol during a late night parliamentary session.
	   Speaking in the federal Parliament, Prime Minister John Howard
dismissed Sham Ho's reasons for quitting his party as ``sour
grapes.''
	   ``I think the principal reason that Mrs. Sham Ho has resigned
and is contesting the position from the cross benches is that she
thinks she's got a better chance of winning through doing that.
	   ``I think it is rather disappointing, even verging on the
ungracious, of somebody who's had great loyalty from the Liberal
Party for a long period of time to seek to raise the matters that
she has.
	   ``I don't think for a moment the allegations (she) made are with
any foundation at all,'' he said.

AIDS epidemic termed ``truly out of control'' in parts of world AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Despite progress in treating AIDS and slowing its
spread, the head of the United Nations AIDS program cautioned that
the epidemic ``is truly out of control'' in many parts of the
world.
	   Peter Piot spoke Sunday evening at the opening ceremony of the
12th World AIDS Conference, the largest scientific gathering in the
nearly two decades of the epidemic. About 13,200 scientists,
doctors, advocates and journalists have gathered to hear 5,400
presentations.
	   The week-long meeting is likely to involve a mixture of upbeat
reports on new drugs and combinations to protect infected people
and the unborn, along with gloomy assessments of the wildfire
spread of HIV in some parts of Asia, Africa and eastern Europe.
	   Scientists also will discuss encouraging findings that a quick,
inexpensive dose of the AIDS drug AZT cuts in half the risk that
infected mothers will pass the virus to their babies during birth.
More intensive treatment, coupled with Caesarean delivery,
virtually eliminates the possibility that an unborn baby will be
infected.
	   The spread of the virus has leveled off or declined in wealthy
countries and is slowing as well in some poorer nations, such as
Brazil, Senegal, Thailand, Uganda and parts of Tanzania.
	   ``But together with this news of progress there is news so
devastating that few in this room could have predicted or imagined
it a decade ago,'' Piot said.
	   He noted that one-quarter of the population is infected in
Botswana and Zimbabwe. Four million people have HIV in India, along
with 3 million in South Africa.
	   His organization estimates that 12 million people around the
world already have died of AIDS, and another 31 million are alive
but infected. Each day, 16,000 more people contract the virus.
	   Since the last international AIDS conference in Vancouver two
years ago, 10 million people have been infected, said Piot. ``That
represents a collective failure of the world,'' he said.
	   Sunday's opening ceremonies were briefly disrupted by chanting,
horn-blowing demonstrators protesting the high cost of AIDS drugs.
A year's treatment with protease inhibitors and other drugs can
cost dlrs 10,000 or more. More than 90 percent of HIV-infected
people live in parts of the world where these medicines are simply
too expensive to be widely used.
	   ``We forget that, of the millions of people living with AIDS,
most are condemned to death because of the absence of care,'' said
Peter Lamptey of Family Health International, an anti-AIDS
organization in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
	   Strategies that helped tame AIDS in some places have included
government-sponsored safe-sex campaigns, increased availability of
condoms and treatment for other sexually transmitted disease.
	   Ruth Cardoso, wife of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, told the conference that governments should ``stop the
self-defeating attitude of downplaying the problem's urgency'' and
make AIDS a major priority.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ Residents of this devastated city slept
outdoors Sunday night as aftershocks from a deadly earthquake
continued to rock the area.
	   This southern city and the nearby town of Ceyhan were hardest
hit by Saturday's 6.3 magnitude quake, which killed 116 people,
according to the latest toll.
	   Almost half of Ceyhan's 80,000 residents fled the town, 48
kilometers (30 miles) east of Adana, and as many as 70 aftershocks
kept panicky residents away from their homes. Hospitals set up
makeshift outdoor facilities to treat the more than 1,000 injured
people.
	   ``I want my bed,'' cried Olgay Tan, 38, as she lay on a blanket
in a park.
	   But her husband, Ahmet, was more cautious. ``I am terribly
scared. I can't enter my home without thinking of an imminent
quake.''
	   Another survivor, Nevin Ozsener, said sleeping outside didn't
bother her. She was far more concerned about finding the money to
rebuild her badly damaged house.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she might be lucky enough
to benefit from the 250 billion Turkish Lira (about dlrs 1 million)
that business magnate Sakip Sabanci promised to donate to the
stricken region about 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of the
capital, Ankara.
	   The Sabancis, who control Turkey's second-largest conglomerate,
come from Adana. The family is among the world's richest, according
to Forbes magazine.
	   Rescuers discovered only one survivor in Ceyhan Sunday, an
11-year-old boy who, despite spending close to 24 hours trapped
beneath a collapsed building, seemed to be in good health. Rescuers
were still searching for five members of his family.
	   Three other children, trapped inside a building during a
birthday party, were not as fortunate. Their dead bodies were dug
from the rubble Sunday.
	   ``About 25 people may still be trapped under the rubble in
Ceyhan,'' fireman Ekrem Dogdu said Sunday evening.
	   Rescue operations were halted late Sunday because of darkness.
	   The dead include 50 people in Ceyhan and 44 in Adana, where most
victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums. Most of these
areas are crowded with ethnic Kurds who have fled the war in
southeastern Turkey between the army and autonomy-seeking Kurdish
guerrillas.

Russian stocks, bonds resume slide 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds took another
tumble amid ongoing fears Monday that the country's currency will
be devalued.
	   The Russian Trading System's stock index was down 4.2 percent by
midday Monday, and benchmark 1-year government bond issues were
yielding up to 83 percent, from around 75 percent on Friday.
	   Traders said the fall was a continuation of nervous selling on
Friday.
	   However, the ruble rallied, and was slightly stronger Monday at
around 6.20 rubles to the U.S. dollar.
	   The shaky ruble is one of several problems that have combined to
cause Russia's economic crisis.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been using hard
currency reserves to keep the value of the ruble steady.
	   Until now, relatively low inflation and the ruble's stability
have been seen as one of President Boris Yeltsin's most important
successes, and the economic crisis has been confined to the
financial markets.
	   Devaluation would increase consumer prices, and the Kremlin
fears that could lead to social unrest.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide. The detention
center holds 27 other people awaiting trial.
	   Although authorities considered the death a suicide, tribunal
officials and Dutch police were conducting separate investigations,
Chartier said.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that as mayor of the eastern Croatia city of Vukovar, he
played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended just last Thursday and the verdict was expected
in two weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges,
faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication and
that Fila asked for a higher dose last Friday because he was
``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal. He was under
medication so he could stand the trial,'' Fila said.
	   ``This is awful. I am very shaken up,'' he added. ``For a whole
year we had talked every day on the phone. We spent 15 days
constantly together... I feel as if I'd lost someone close, a
family member.''
	   It was not immediately known whether Dokmanovic left a note.
	   Dokmanovic's wife, son and pregnant daughter were informed of
the suicide, Fila said, and the corpse was taken to a nearby
hospital morgue.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well, and he was placed on a
suicide watch. The guards checked on him every half-hour and last
saw him alive at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, he said.
	   The lights were on in his cell at that time, but shortly
thereafter, Dokmanovic managed to short-circuit the electricity in
his cell using an electric razor, and the lights went out, Chartier
said.
	   When a guard next passed by his cell just after midnight, the
body was found dangling in the darkened cell.
	   A graying man with a heavy, drooping mustache, Dokmanovic had
complained through his lawyers of feeling depressed and had been
visited regularly by a psychiatrist, but he never hinted he was
suicidal.
	   In fact, he was seen as having a good chance at acquittal
because the evidence against him was not overwhelming. It was
unclear whether the 11-judge tribunal would go ahead with a
posthumous verdict.
	   Prosecutors had charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in the
massacre near Vukovar, widely considered to be the worst atrocity
of the 1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   According to prosecutors, the day of Nov. 20, 1991, began at
Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought refuge
after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army, known
as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croats and others from the hospital were rounded
up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to a
nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege. The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic was responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure as a civic
leader to prevent or stop the crimes.
	   Dokmanovic was arrested last July on the pretense of being asked
to attend a meeting with U.N. officials. His secret indictment and
seizure triggered protests at home by angry supporters who said he
was a victim of subterfuge.

Israeli president calls for early elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In apparent frustration over the deadlock in
Mideast peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial. However, the president is
very popular, and his statements carry great moral weight. The next
general elections are to be held in 2000.
	   Last week, the president expressed frustration over the stalled
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the scope of a
troop withdrawal from the occupied West Bank. Weizman reportedly
complained at the time that he had been misled by Netanyahu, with
the prime minister having assured him agreement on a troop
withdrawal was imminent.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, began floating the idea of a referendum on a
pullback of troops from the territory, which Israel seized from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. However, the proposal faded from
the headlines several days ago after it became apparent that
Netanyahu would not have a majority in parliament for preparatory
legislation.
	   With Netanyahu backing off a referendum, another gauge of public
opinion is needed, Weizman said Monday.
	   ``If he does not conduct a referendum, in my opinion the next
solution needs to be elections,'' Weizman said. ``The sooner we go
to elections the sooner we will know what the public thinks.''
	   Opinion polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb exploded in eastern Punjab
province on Monday, killing one person while he slept, police said.
	   The bomb, hidden in a paper bag, was put under the bed of
Mohammed Ali, who was sleeping outside his home, police said.
	   It wasn't immediately clear if Ali was the target of the bomb or
whether the culprits panicked and left the bag under his bed, said
police.
	   Several bomb explosions have rocked Punjab province in recent
weeks. While no one has taken responsibility, Pakistan has blamed
its uneasy neighbor India.

PowerGen to buy East Midlands Electricity from Dominion Resources 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ PowerGen, Britain's third-largest power generator,
announced Monday it will buy East Midlands Electricity PLC from
Dominion Resources Inc. for 1.9 billion-pound (dlrs 3.2 billion) _
less than two years after the American group bought the British
utility.
	   The deal has to be approved by British regulators. But it if
goes through it will mark the first time a big British power
generator has been allowed to buy one of Britain's 12 regional
utility companies.
	   Dominion, based in Richmond, Virginia, is the parent company of
Virginia Power. It bought East Midlands in November 1996 for 1.3
billion pounds (then dlrs 2.1 billion), and was hit by a 96 million
pound (dlrs 159 million) windfall tax in July 1997 when the newly
elected Labor Party government taxed what it said were the excess
profits of privatized utility companies.
	   Monday's deal involves PowerGen taking on about 1 billion pounds
(dlrs 1.7 billion) in debt and paying 851 million pounds (dlrs 1.4
billion) in cash.
	   ``The Americans could not take the company forward
strategically, it could only be a cash earner for them,''' PowerGen
chairman Ed Wallis said Monday.
	   ``We can knit together generation, distribution and supply in a
very effective way ... I think the customers will really see some
benefits out of this move even though they didn't out of the last
one,'' Wallis added in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview.
	   Wallis denied that Dominion had made nearly half a billion
pounds (some dlrs 800 million) from its brief ownership of the
British company, saying the figure ``was absolutely nothing like
that.''
	   The purchase by Dominion was part of a 1996 string of big
acquisitions of British power companies by American counterparts.
	   PowerGen also said Monday that group managing director Deryk
King has quit. Wallis will continue as chief executive.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Search teams found 16 more bodies Monday
in the rubble of this devastated town, bringing the death toll from
an earthquake in southern Turkey to 128.
	   Others were feared still trapped under collapsed buildings in
Ceyhan, rescue workers said. There was no indication whether they
were alive.
	   Ceyhan and the nearby city of Adana, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to
the west, were the hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake Saturday.
	   Up to 70 aftershocks kept panicked residents away from their
homes, forcing them to sleep outside overnight Monday. Hospitals
set up makeshift outdoor treatment centers to treat the more than
1,000 injured.
	   A survivor, Nevin Ozsener, said sleeping outside didn't bother
her. She was far more concerned about finding the money to rebuild
her badly damaged house.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she may be lucky enough to
benefit from the 250 billion lira (dlrs 1 million) that business
magnate Sakip Sabanci promised to donate to the disaster-stricken
region.
	   The Sabancis, who control Turkey's second-largest conglomerate,
come from Adana.
	   Rescue teams pulled out only one survivor in Ceyhan Sunday, an
11-year-old boy who, despite spending close to 24 hours trapped
under a collapsed building, seemed to be in good health. Rescuers
were still searching for five members of his family.
	   Three other children, trapped under a building during a birthday
party, were not as lucky. Their bodies were dug out from the rubble
Sunday.
	   The dead include 62 people in Ceyhan, and 44 in Adana, where
most victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums. Most of
these areas are crowded with Kurds who have fled the war in
southeast Turkey between the army and the autonomy-seeking
guerrillas.

	   Dokmanovic had complained through his lawyers of feeling
depressed and had been visited regularly by a psychiatrist. Still,
he never hinted he was suicidal.
	   In fact, he was seen as having a good chance at acquittal
because the evidence against him was not overwhelming. It was
unclear whether the 11-judge tribunal would go ahead with a
posthumous verdict.
	   Prosecutors had charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in the
massacre near Vukovar, widely considered to be the worst atrocity
of the 1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   According to prosecutors, the atrocity of Nov. 20, 1991, began
at Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought refuge
after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army, known
as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croats and others from the hospital were rounded
up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to a
nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege. The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic was responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure as a civic
leader to prevent or stop the crimes.
	   Dokmanovic was arrested last July on the pretense of being asked
to attend a meeting with U.N. officials. His secret indictment and
seizure triggered protests at home by angry supporters who said he
was a victim of subterfuge.

Report: Asia dominates list of world's most expensive cities 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Seven of the world's 10 most expensive cities
are in Asia, with Hong Kong replacing Tokyo atop the list,
Corporate Resources Group said in a yearly report released Monday.
	   Moscow, No. 4 on the list, has remained Europe's most expensive
city, while the cost of living in Southeast Asia has dropped due to
the region's financial crisis, the Geneva-based organization said
in findings that are utilized by governments and international
corporations.
	   The study, conducted in 150 cities in March, measures the
relative cost of goods and services. New York City is used as the
comparison base with 100 index points.
	   Hong Kong, topping the list with an index of 157, is closely
followed by Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow and Shanghai. The world's
cheapest place to live is Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, with an
index of 43.
	   Southeast Asian financial turmoil has been the primary force
shaping this year's rankings, the study said.
	   Currently, Singapore remains the only city in the region more
expensive than New York, while Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and
Manila, which last year were comparable to New York, now rank among
the world's least expensive cities.
	   Meanwhile, inflations rates across the globe continued to
plunge, reaching the lowest levels since 1969.
	   Moscow, St. Petersburg and London are the only European cities
to rank among the world's 10 most expensive. Geneva and Zurich,
previously ranked among the top five, continued to fall and now
occupy 17th and 18th position, respectively.
	   The weakening yen has knocked down Tokyo and other Japanese
cities, while Chinese cities are becoming more expensive despite
flattening inflation rates, the report said.
	   New York City is now the 21st most expensive place in the world,
having jumped up 10 places from the last year's ranking. Its rapid
rise is explained by rising real estate prices and steady low
inflation, combined with the strength of the U.S. dollar.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific reported Monday that its May
revenue was 22 percent below budget, and said things might not
improve soon.
	   ``With the continued volatility of the yen, some believe that
there could yet be another round of Asian currency meltdown and, in
the worst-case scenario, a global recession,'' the Hong Kong-based
airline said in its in-house newsletter.
	   May revenue fell 18 percent compared with last May, when Cathay
grounded its fleet of A330-300 aircraft for 14 days because of a
gearbox problem, the company said.
	   It said revenue for the first five months of 1998 was 16 percent
below budget.
	   Revenue from Indonesian operations was 2 percent below budget,
but better than recent performance. The airline said that
previously, Indonesian revenue had been about 30 percent below
budget.
	   Singapore was 4 percent ahead of budget, and Taiwan exceeded
budget by 12 percent.
	   Tourist arrivals have fallen 23 percent in the first five months
of 1998 compared with a year ago because of Asia's economic
problems. Many countries have had to devalue their currency, making
travel too expensive.
	   Cathay's earnings fell 55.5 percent last year, and passengers
loads are at a 10-year low.
	   Cathay has built a U.S. dlr-1 billion headquarters at the new
Chek Lap Kok Airport, which will open on July 5.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toshiba Corp. and General Electric Co. said Monday
they would set up two joint ventures to produce steam turbine
components.
	   One of the companies, GE Toshiba Turbine Components de Mexico
S.R.L. de C.V., will be located in Mexico, while the other, Toshiba
GE Turbine Components Co., will be located in Japan.
	   The company in Mexico will be 66 percent owned by General
Electric and 34 percent by Toshiba, while the one in Japan will be
51 percent owned by Toshiba and 49 percent by GE. Production is
slated to begin in the second quarter of 1999 at both locations.
	   The company in Mexico will produce medium and short-length
airfoils, while the company in Japan will make long-length
airfoils.
	   ``The joint ventures will enable us to share investment expenses
to reduce manufacturing costs, and to meet the cost and quality
demands of the global power generation market,'' said Robert
Nardelli, president of GE Power Systems, in a statement.
	   The companies didn't give investment amounts, nor did they make
any sales forecasts.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying the doomsayers, Chinese officials on
Monday predicted their stalling economy would pick up speed later
in the year as demand-driving investment took effect.
	   Recent statistics indicate that China, like its neighbors, has
begun to suffer the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Sluggish domestic demand, slowing export growth and declining
foreign investment have led many economists, Chinese and Western
alike, to forecast that China would fall below its 1998 economic
growth target of 8 percent.
	   Not so, says the government-run State Information Center, which
estimated in a report published Monday by the state-run newspaper
China Daily that economic growth would hit 8.2 percent this year.
	   The report noted that the government and state-owned firms had
invested 400.6 billion yuan (dlrs 48.27 billion) in the first five
months of the year, up 12.7 percent from the year before.
	   The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily reported Monday
that total investment in construction and other fixed assets would
rise 15 percent in 1998 over last year.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
will arrive in Seoul Tuesday for a two-day visit aimed at assessing
South Korea's economic situation.
	   Rubin will meet President Kim Dae-jung, Finance Minister Lee
Kyu-sung and local business leaders, the Ministry of Finance and
Economy said Monday.
	   Accompanied by his deputy, David Lipton, Rubin will also visit
the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone
separating North Korea and South Korea, it said.
	   After accompanying President Clinton on his visit to China,
Rubin is on a tour of Asia's economic trouble spots, including
Malaysia and Thailand.
	    &UR; ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim made an about-face on Monday and announced the country's
interest rates were too high.
	   His remarks echo the thinking of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and newly-appointed economic czar, Daim Zainuddin, who have been
calling for an easier monetary policy to reduce the debt burden for
distressed companies.
	   ``The interest rates, although lower than in the rest of the
region, are already prohibitively high, thus raising the cost of
doing business in this country,'' Anwar said in a speech to
Malaysian business leaders. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
later addressed the same round table meeting.
	   Anwar noted the banking system still suffers from insufficient
liquidity as a result of the outflow of short-term capital over the
last year.
	   ``Given the poor business climate, the private sector cannot be
relied upon to stimulate growth. For this reason, I have recently
announced a counter-cyclical package to pump-prime the economy,''
Anwar said. ``Our basic philosophy that the private sector should
be the engine of growth remains unchanged. It will resume that task
when it regains its vigor after the economy recovers.''
	   The Malaysian economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter, compared with 6.9 percent growth the previous quarter.
Private economists expect Malaysia will slide into full-blown
recession in the second quarter.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Foreign automakers are asking the
Vietnamese government to ban car imports to help their sales
efforts in the fledgling local market, the newspaper Investment
reported Monday.
	   The proposal was made by Ford Vietnam, a joint venture near
Hanoi between Ford and a local company, and backed by Toyota
Vietnam.
	   ``Vietnam's auto industry can hardly develop in the near-future
if the government allows the import of secondhand cars and
completely built car units,'' Murray Gilbert, managing director of
Ford Vietnam, was quoted as saying.
	   Fourteen car joint ventures, with a total capacity of 140,000
units per year, have been licensed.
	   Eight are operational, competing in a small market that saw only
22,000 cars sold last year. About 95 percent of the traffic in
Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, is on two wheels,
either small motorbikes or bicycles.
	   ``Vietnam has to protect its fledgling car industry now as it
faces the challenge of opening its car market to ASEAN competition
by 2006 under the ASEAN Free Trade Area,'' Gilbert said, referring
to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Ford Vietnam, inaugurated in 1997, has only assembled 250 cars
this year, the paper said.

Cambodian opposition activist found dead, mutilated 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with prominent FUNCINPEC member calling killings
political, 4th graf
By ROBIN McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The mutilated body of an opposition
party activist has been discovered outside Phnom Penh, raising new
fears of violence in the run-up to elections July 26, human rights
workers said Monday.
	   The remains of Thong Sophal, 45, were discovered a week after he
was reported missing. His fingers and left ear were cut off,
indicating torture, and he had suffered at least one heavy blow to
the head, said a human rights worker, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Thong Sophal was an active campaigner for FUNCINPEC, the
royalist party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
last year as co-prime minister by his rival, Hun Sen.
	   Ahmad Yahya, a prominent FUNCINPEC member, said he believed the
latest killing was political and that if such murders continue,
``it will seriously impact the elections.''
	   Eng Chhay Eang, an official of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party,
said that foreign countries that so far have given a green light to
the electoral process were deluding themselves that it would be
free and fair.
	   ``The main candidates have been traveling around with only minor
problems so far, but our organizers in the city and the countryside
are still being threatened, attacked and murdered by CPP thugs,''
Eng Chhay Eang said.
	   The body of most recent Sam Rainsy Party victim, he said, had
been discovered June 19 in the eastern province of Kompong Cham.
Police say they are still investigating the death of Em Eam, 62.
	   FUNCINPEC is the main challenger to Hun Sen's formerly communist
Cambodian People's Party in the upcoming elections, and Thong
Sophal's death is the fourth this month of someone tied to the
party.
	   Party members believe the three previous killings were
politically motivated, though Hun Sen's government claims they were
the result of personal disputes. Human rights workers are
conducting their own investigations.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore legitimacy and aid
lost after he deposed Ranariddh. But critics say the polls will be
a sham because Hun Sen has used violence and intimidation against
opponents and stacked the electoral bodies in his favor.

Three men arrested in Bavaria for threatening to poison food 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TRAUNSTEIN, Germany (AP) _ Three men who threatened to poison
food products unless the manufacturer paid them 4 million marks
(dlrs 2.2 million) have been arrested, Bavarian police said Monday.
	   The men, between 20 and 39 years old, did not carry out their
threat, police said. They were arrested Thursday.
	   Police identified the extortion victim only as ``a larger
manufacturer'' in southeastern Bavaria. They said they would not
release any other details to protect the company and prevent
copycat crimes.
	   Germany has seen a spate of extortion cases against supermarket
chains and food companies in recent years, usually by people in
financial trouble. But few threats of poisoning have been carried
out and nobody is known to have been killed or sickened.

Oil spill captain pleads guilty in Singapore court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Polish captain of a supertanker involved in
Singapore's worst oil spill pleaded guilty Monday to charges of
reckless navigation, Singapore television reported.
	   The plea was made by Jan Sokolowski, captain of the Thai tanker
Orapin Global, which collided with the Cypriot oil tanker Evoikos
last October. About 29,000 tons of heavy fuel oil spilled into the
Singapore Strait from a gash in the side of Evoikos.
	   Following Sokolowski's plea, the judge gave prosecutors time to
decide what to do about similar charges against Michael Chalkitis,
the Greek captain of Evoikos.
	   Some 16 government and private organizations, 650 workers and a
total of 80 boats joined in a massive clean-up after the oil spill.
Singapore is expected to claim compensation for it.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Colombian president heads home with new pacts 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombian President
Ernesto Samper left the Dominican Republic Sunday night, taking
with him fresh agreements to fund new power plants and fight money
laundering.
	   Samper agreed to set aside 20 percent of profits from petroleum
sales to the Dominican government to underwrite development loans
to that country. Dominican President Leonel Fernandez said the
loans would be used for building new power plants to resolve
frequent electricity shortages.
	   During Samper's one-day visit, the two leaders also agreed to
exchange information about large transactions moving across their
borders in an attempt to thwart money laundering in the two
countries.
	   Samper and Fernandez also signed a declaration rejecting
economic pressure from wealthier countries _ a jab at the United
States, which has tied economic aid to ``certification'' that
countries are cooperating with anti-drug efforts.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Air carriers to resume direct charter flights to
Cuba
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Several air carriers have received approval from
the Treasury Department to resume direct charter flights between
South Florida and Cuba as of July 2.
	   The companies now must wait for landing permits from Cuba before
the flights can start, said Vivian Mannerud, manager of Miami's
Airline Brokers Co.
	   ``We have to get airplanes and landing permits and I don't know
when (flights) are going to start,'' Mannerud said. ``I can't see
it happening until the earliest the 10th.''
	   American Airlines and Marazul Charters of Miami also have
licenses, said Mannerud, a leading charter organizer before flights
were canceled two years ago.
	   Island Air Charters, in Fort Lauderdale, and Cuba Paquetes Inc.,
in Hialeah, also have said they received notice from the Treasury
Department's Office of Financial Asset Control, which supervises
all embargoes, that direct flights could resume.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Coalition agrees to island-wide work stoppage
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Leaders of a labor coalition
representing as many as 50,000 workers agreed Sunday to hold a work
stoppage to protest privatization of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   The Greater Committee of Labor, Religious and Cultural
Organizations said the date of the work stoppage has not been set,
but that it would probably occur sometime after Wednesday. Several
labor leaders at the meeting in Carolina, just east of San Juan,
said they were planning for a 48-hour stoppage.
	   About 6,400 telephone workers are in the 11th day of a strike to
protest the 1.9 billion sale of the company to a consortium led by
U.S. communications firm GTE Corp.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello signed a law finalizing the deal last week,
ignoring a wave of sabotage, bombings, clashes with riot police and
bomb threats.
	   On Sunday, police reported more bomb threats but no violence,
and picket lines in front of company offices were calm.
 &UR; HONDURAS: Government considers re-establishing ties with Cuba
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras' foreign minister said
Sunday his country is considering establishing diplomatic relations
with Cuba for the first time since 1961.
	   Foreign Minister J. Fernando Martinez sounded optimistic about
the chances for renewed relations, but said a final decision would
have to be made by Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse.
	   ``Many positive things are happening in the world, with changes
every day ... and obviously, Honduras cannot hold back the clock,''
Martinez said.
	   Martinez did not set a date for a decision on the issue.
	   Ruben Chavez, director of the Cuban Interest Section which
opened seven months ago in the Honduran capital, said: ``Havana is
willing to maintain any kind of ties with Honduras.''
 &UR; JAMAICA: Crowds welcome Reggae Boyz home
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Eliminated from their first chance at a
World Cup, Jamaica's national soccer team returned home to a hero's
welcome nonetheless.
	   Thousands of fans waved flags and cheered as the team, named the
Reggae Boyz, walked off an airplane at Kingston's international
airport Saturday night and were greeted warmly by dignitaries on
the tarmac.
	   The Jamaicans lost 1-3 to Croatia and 0-5 to Argentina, dashing
their hopes of a championship. They managed a win over Japan, a
fellow World Cup newcomer, by 2-1 on Friday.
	   The win was the first for a Caribbean team in any World Cup
match since a victory by Cuba in 1936.
	   ``I thought the boys' performance was good, especially in the
last game,'' said assistant coach Carl Brown. ``The only
disappointment was that we did not play as well as we could in the
first two games.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds took another
tumble Monday while parliament worked on a dozen economic measures
aimed at digging Russia out of its financial crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin urged the Communist-dominated parliament
to swiftly approve the government's austerity plan. But the
Communists in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
generally want more government spending, not less, and may be
reluctant to support Yeltsin's proposals.
	   ``Let the Duma hurry up,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by
Interfax news agency. ``I have done my part of the job _ I've
signed the decrees.''
	   At the same time, however, Yeltsin denied that Russia is in the
midst of an economic crisis.
	   ``We have no crisis,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. ``I do not describe the program as an anti-crisis
program.''
	   The austerity plan, outlined by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
earlier this month, focuses on Russia's complicated and outdated
tax system. The new plan has won praise from the International
Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan to Russia.
	   But to become effective, the plan needs to be passed by the
State Duma, which has threatened to sink any bills that reduce
salaries or freeze pension payments. Parliament's Budget Committee
was examining the measures on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's markets began dropping as soon as they
opened Monday, and traders said it was continuation of nervous
selling on Friday.
	   The Russian Trading System's stock index was down 4.2 percent by
midday, and benchmark 1-year government bond issues offered yields
as high as 83 percent, up from around 75 percent on Friday.
	   However, the ruble rallied, and was slightly stronger Monday at
around 6.20 rubles to the U.S. dollar.
	   The shaky ruble is perhaps the most urgent problem of the many
economic woes facing Russia at present.
	   The government desperately wants to prevent a devaluation of the
ruble, and the Central Bank has been using hard currency reserves
to keep its value relatively steady.
	   Until now, low inflation and the ruble's stability have been
among President Boris Yeltsin's most important successes, and the
economic crisis has been confined so far to the financial markets.
	   But a ruble devaluation would increase consumer prices and
inflict further pain on ordinary Russians. The Kremlin fears such a
develop could lead to social unrest.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a business magnate and executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, said Monday that the
government has two to three weeks to lay out ``clear trends in the
country's economy, otherwise the situation may be further
aggravated,'' Interfax news agency reported.

Tokyo's main index rises for fourth straight day, dollar higher

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose moderately Monday, pushing the
market's main index higher for the fourth consecutive session, as
worries over Japan's finance industry eased slightly. The U.S.
dollar gained against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 155.69 points, or
1.02 percent, closing at 15,365.73. The Nikkei index now has gained
a total of 311.13 points in four trading days, including Friday's
77.82-point gain, or 0.51 percent.
	   Traders said stocks advanced on expectations the government may
come up with effective steps to resolve the problem of bad debts
held by Japan's financial institutions.
	   The government has promised to unveil a ``total plan'' by
Thursday to revive the economy and accelerate reform of the ailing
banking system.
	   Last Friday, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said that they were in negotiations to
merge within a year. Ailing LTCB, Japan's second-largest long-term
credit bank, had been looking for a partner to save it from
problems caused by massive bad loans.
	   ``The merger of LTCB has temporarily eased fears about Japan's
financial system,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities.
	   The merger talks are seen as a test for the nation's financial
system, which is under a mountain of bad loans totaling 76 trillion
yen (dlrs 535 billion).
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 398 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Friday's 424
million. Advances outnumbered retreats 791 to 299, with 169 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,202.22. It
had gained 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, on Friday.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 142.12 yen, up 0.84 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late Friday level in New
York of 142.44 yen.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 143.40 yen in
anticipation of gloom in a key index of Japanese business
confidence. It was the dollar's highest level since Japan and the
United States jointly intervened to stop the yen's slide on June
17.
	   The dollar, however, shed some of its early gains on
profit-taking after the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of
business sentiment turned out not quite as dismal as economists had
expected.
	   That result led U.S. hedge funds and European investors to sell
dollars for yen, traders said.
	   The survey's ``business condition diffusion index'' _ which
measures the percentage of major manufacturers expecting conditions
to improve minus the percentage expecting a worsening _ fell to
minus 38 from minus 31 in the previous survey, released in early
April.
	   Still, the figure was better than an average forecast of minus
44 by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The weakness of Japan's economy has been hammering the yen.
Analysts also fear that a falling yen will drag down other
currencies in the region, reigniting the Asian financial crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.275 percent from Friday's finish of 1.230
percent, driving its price down to 111.39 yen from 111.73 yen.

NOTEBOOK: Clintons include own writings in book donation AP SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
</HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Among the books that U.S. President Bill Clinton
donated to Peking University's library Monday were the popular ``It
Takes a Village'' by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton _ and a
not-so-popular book by her husband.
	   Even Clinton admitted his lackluster performance as author of
``Between Hope and History'' when presenting more than 500 books to
a group of students and university officials.
	   ``If you're trying to decide which one to read first, I have to
tell you in America her book sold a lot more copies than mine
did,'' Clinton said.
	   Mrs. Clinton's book, about child-rearing and published in 1996,
was a best-seller. Its audiotape version won her a Grammy Award. In
its first year it raised royalties of dlrs 742,000, which Mrs.
Clinton donated to charity. Last year, the book generated dlrs
281,898 in royalties, also donated to charity.
	   Clinton's book, mainly a compilation of his political speeches,
quickly found its way into bookstore bargain bins. The book
plummeted in price from dlrs 16.95 at its release late in the 1996
campaign to just dlrs 5 during Clinton's January 1997 inauguration.
	   ___
	   Here's a quick rundown of Clinton's life, according to Peking
University President Chen Jiaer:
	   He was born in ``Hopetown, Arkansas,'' completed Georgetown
University in 1968 and Yale Law School in 1973, the same year he
went to the University of Arkansas as a law professor. Then he was
elected president in 1992 and re-elected in 1996.
	   ``He has made important contributions to the development of
U.S.-Chinese relations, which we highly appreciate,'' Chen said.
	   There was no mention of Clinton's lengthy tenure as governor of
the U.S. state of Arkansas.
	   ___
	   Flood-swollen rivers are starting to recede in Guilin, a scenic
spot where Clinton will stop on Thursday to discuss _ ironically _
the environment.
	   Residents of Guilin had feared Clinton would have to cancel his
visit due to weeks of flooding. But state media China Daily
reported they now have begun cleaning up after rainstorms that
killed dozens, left 800,000 people stranded and more than 200,000
homeless, China Daily said.
	   The president is scheduled to take a boat tour of the Li River,
and see pointy limestone mountains called ``karst topography'' by
geologists. The area's natural beauty draws more than six million
tourists _ including about 500,000 foreigners _ each year.
	   China has launched several environmental programs along the Li
River, including cleaning of the water after years of abuse and
restoring rolling hillsides at the river's banks that 20 years ago
were plucked clean of trees by villagers seeking firewood.

Dutch prince celebrates 87th birthday by cheering Dutch team 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Queen Beatrix's father was
celebrating his 87th birthday Monday by joining most of his
subjects in cheering on the Dutch soccer team.
	   Prince Bernhard planned to spend a low-key, laid back birthday
at home ``and enjoy himself by watching the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match on television'' Monday evening, the royal family announced.
	   The popular German-born prince isn't the only member of the
Dutch family to be transfixed by the fortunes of the Dutch squad,
who meet Yugoslavia in Toulouse, France. His grandson, Crown Prince
Willem Alexander, was in the stands when the Orangemen drew with
Mexico last week.
	   Bernhard, the husband of former Queen Juliana, remains in
generally good health despite surgery last year on an enlarged
prostate, a common complaint among older men.

China, U.S. sign deals worth dlrs 1.87 billion context 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES throughout with Daley comment,
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to China began
paying dividends for American businesses Monday, with major U.S.
corporations announcing contracts worth some dlrs 1.87 billion.
	   The deals _ signed at a ceremony attended by U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley and Chinese foreign trade officials _
included the dlrs 1.2 billion sale of 27 Boeing aircraft to the
Civil Aviation Administration of China.
	   ``This helps address the trade situation,'' Daley said, adding
that he hoped China-U.S. business ties would become stronger and
more stable.
	   The package of deals was part of an overall effort during
Clinton's visit to emphasize the positive, despite continued
disagreement over the Chinese government's slow pace in opening the
country's relatively closed markets.
	   Clinton's visit has set a good precedent for future commercial
cooperation with China, said Boeing China President Ray Bracy, ``We
are pleased.''
	   Bracy said 10 of the aircraft are new orders worth about dlrs
400 million. The remaining 17 were carried over from a 50-plane
deal signed in October during Chinese Leader's Jiang Zemin's trip
to the United States last fall.
	   In other deals:
	   _General Electric Co. signed an agreement to sell the Chinese
utilities company Huaneng Group dlrs 161.7 million worth of power
turbines, a company statement said.
	   _China's Sinochem agreed to import dlrs 400 million worth of
phosphate fertilizers from U.S. Phoschem, Cargill Trading and Hydro
Farmland.
	   _International Business Machines Corp. signed an accord with
China Great Wall Computer and Shenzhen Kaifa Technology Co. to
invest an additional dlrs 76.8 million in their joint venture. IBM
holds an 80 percent stake in the company.
	   Smaller contracts included accords for Sino-U.S. joint
exploration of coal bed methane _ an environmentally friendly fuel
resource _ and the import of air quality monitoring equipment.
	   Other companies announced new contracts just ahead of President
Clinton's arrival in China last Thursday.
	   General Motors Corp. signed a dlrs 230 million agreement with
First Auto Works Jinbei Automotive Co. to manufacture light trucks.
And Motorola and Lucent Technologies signed contracts for
telecommunication equipment sales valued at more than dlrs 408
million.
	   Despite the slew of contracts, Chinese and U.S. officials failed
before and during the summit to agree on a market-opening proposal
by Beijing intended to hasten its long-awaited entry into the World
Trade Organization.
	   Daley and other officials emphasized that they viewed China's
dlrs 50 billion trade surplus as an unjustifiable obstacle to
better ties.
	   ``Since 1980, our sales to China are up 230 percent. China's
sales to America are up 1,380 percent,'' said Daley. ``This cannot
continue. It doesn't sit well with me, with President Clinton, with
members of Congress, or with American workers. The lack of openness
is not only bad for business, it is bad for our overall
relationship.''

Cyprus rescues 115 aboard shift drifting in Mediterranean 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday aboard a ship adrift for two days off the island's coast.
	   The ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol early
Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were taken to a hospital for treatment for dehydration
and exposure, a hospital official said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for two days before it was spotted by a
Ukrainian-flagged ship, the police spokesman said, also on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The ship, carrying 109 passengers and six crew, was officially
headed for Libya. The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq,
Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower Monday,
pushed down by the continued weakness of the Japanese currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 147.15 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 8,460.71. On Friday,
the index had slipped 57.97 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
797 million), up from Friday's 5.36 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 687 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened higher on futures-related
buying, but fell shortly before midday when the Japanese yen
slipped to 142 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Investors were concerned about the impact of the weak Japanese
currency on local interest rates and sentiment on the stock market,
said Peter Lai, a director at OCBC Securities (HK) Ltd.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.10 Hong Kong dollars to
37.80, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 40 cents to 32.90.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar to 185.00,
and Hang Seng Bank fell 60 cents to 43.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 40 cents to 40.50, and Hong

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide. The detention
center holds 27 other people awaiting trial.
	   Although authorities considered the death a suicide, tribunal
officials and Dutch police were conducting separate investigations,
Chartier said. Any decisions on tightening security or making
psychiatric evaluations of the others in custody will await the
outcome of those probes, he added.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that as mayor of the eastern Croatia city of Vukovar, he
played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended just last Thursday and the verdict was expected
in two weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges,
faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication and
that Fila asked for a higher dose last Friday because he was
``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal. He was under
medication so he could stand the trial,'' Fila said.
	   ``This is awful. I am very shaken up,'' he added. ``For a whole
year we had talked every day on the phone. We spent 15 days
constantly together... I feel as if I'd lost someone close, a
family member.''
	   It was not immediately known whether Dokmanovic left a note.
	   Dokmanovic's wife, son and pregnant daughter were informed of
the suicide, Fila said, and the corpse was taken to a nearby
hospital morgue.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well, and he was placed on a
suicide watch. The guards checked on him every half-hour and last
saw him alive at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, he said.
	   The lights were on in his cell at that time, but shortly
thereafter, Dokmanovic managed to short-circuit the electricity in
his cell using an electric razor, and the lights went out, Chartier
said.
	   When a guard next passed by his cell just after midnight, the
body was found dangling in the darkened cell.
	   A graying man with a heavy, drooping mustache, Dokmanovic had
complained through his lawyers of feeling depressed and had been
visited regularly by a psychiatrist, but he never hinted he was
suicidal.
	   In fact, he was seen as having a good chance at acquittal
because the evidence against him was not overwhelming. His death
means the case is closed and no verdict will be released
posthumously, Chartier said.

China forecasts economy will improve 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying the doomsayers, Chinese officials
predicted Monday that their stalling economy would pick up speed
later in the year as demand-driving investment took effect.
	   Recent statistics indicate that China, like its neighbors, has
begun to suffer the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Sluggish domestic demand, slowing export growth and declining
foreign investment have led many economists, Chinese and Western
alike, to forecast that China would fall below its 1998 economic
growth target of 8 percent.
	   Not so, says the government-run State Information Center, which
estimated in a report published Monday by the state-run newspaper
China Daily that economic growth would hit 8.2 percent this year.
	   The report noted that the government and state-owned companies
had invested 400.6 billion yuan (dlrs 48.27 billion) in the first
five months of the year, up 12.7 percent from a year earlier.
	   The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily reported Monday
that total investment in construction and other fixed assets would
rise 15 percent in 1998 from last year.
	   The China Daily report noted that the government's decision to
end the allocation of low-rent public housing _ obliging many
apartment dwellers to buy their homes at discounted rates or face
much higher rents _ had stimulated the real estate sector.
	   Real estate investment in the first five months rose 21.6
percent from the same period a year earlier.
	   The report noted, however, that the abolition of public housing
and higher health care costs had made consumers more frugal and
that the government would have to do more to stimulate consumer
demand if it expects to reach its economic growth goals.

Loud foreign tourists force Tokyo firm to scrap Kabuki tour 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bowing to complaints foreign tourists were
disrupting performances, a Japanese tour company has replaced
kabuki on its Tokyo-by-night tour with a trip to a nightclub
featuring transvestite cabaret dancers.
	   Hato Bus Co., one of the most popular tour operators in Japan,
has included the Ginza district's Kabuki-za theater in its
nighttime tour since 1954. Some 4,500 people, predominantly
foreigners, took the nighttime tour last year.
	   But company spokeswoman Keiko Ono on Monday said complaints from
the theater patrons about noisy behavior by overseas visitors on
the bus tours have forced the company to change its itinerary.
	   ``Some of our foreign guests were a bit raucous,'' she said.
	   The night bus tour package, which includes dinner at a Japanese
restaurant and a bus drive through central Tokyo, costs 10,950 yen
(dlrs 77).
	   The Kabuki-za, originally built in 1925, is home to Japan's
preeminent cadre of elaborately attired actors specializing in
kabuki theater. Kabuki, which dates back to the 17th century, is
one of the best known forms of classical Japanese dance and song.
	   Ono acknowledged the cabaret in Tokyo's Roppongi nightlife
district lacks the historic appeal of the kabuki tour.
	   ``It's not so traditional, but we haven't been able to find
anything else so far,'' she said.
	   She added that Hato Bus doesn't anticipate any complaints,
however.

Government posts biggest jobs gain: 190,000 in 1997 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The number of jobs in the
Netherlands rose by a record 190,000 to 7.3 million in 1997, the
Dutch government's statistics agency said Monday.
	   The increase is the highest growth ever, the Central Bureau for
Statistics said.
	   Employment rose in almost all sectors, except in energy and
water works companies, the CBS said, adding that growth was highest
in the information technology sector and among temporary employment
agencies.
	   The number of full-time jobs rose by 62,000 from 1996 and the
number of part-time jobs by 60,000. So-called ``flexible'' jobs
increased by 50,000 and jobs generated by the self-employed rose by
18,000.
	   The gains come as the Netherlands, enjoying a robust economy,
watches its jobless rate drop to well below 5 percent.
	   Registered unemployment in the Netherlands dropped to an
unadjusted 4.2 percent in the three months ending May 31, down from
5.6 percent a year ago, the government said last week.
	   That lower rate brought the total number of unemployed people to
an unadjusted 289,000 _ the first time the number of jobless has
dropped below 300,000 since June 1981 _ the CBS said.

Five financially weak Korean banks ordered closed unable to take over business 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with banking regulators allowed to go into banks but
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of employees of five
financially shaky banks picketed or refused to work Monday to
protest a government order shutting down the institutions.
	   Police were mobilized to enforce the order, but banking
regulators were initially barred by picketing employees from
entering the headquarters and many branch offices of the five
banks.
	   Even after government regulators gained access to some banks,
workers refused to cooperate with them. In some banks, workers
turned off their computer systems.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the closure of the
banks Monday as part of the government's effort to restore the
confidence of foreign investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   ``Liquidation of the weak banking sector is an imperative task
we can no longer postpone,'' said Lee Hun-jae, the supervisory
commission's chairman.
	   Lee identified the five banks to be closed as Kyungki, Chung
Chong, Daedong, Donghwa and Dongnam. Together, they hold bad loans
estimated at ``several billion dollars,'' his office said.
	   Lee said five bigger commercial banks _ Korea Housing, KorAm,
Shinhan, Hana and Kookmin _ will take over the five insolvent
banks. He did not spell out the takeover conditions, but local
media reported that the government has promised to write off much
of the failed banks' debts.
	   Lee indicated that more financially weak banks could fold in the
coming months. The closures announced Monday were the first in the
nation's history.
	   Analysts agreed that the closures would help restore foreign
investor confidence.
	   ``It marks the first important step toward reorganizing the
troubled banking sector and left an important lesson that even
banks can collapse,'' Kim Ho-hwan, an economic analyst, said.
	   Despite a government promise of job security for most employees,
thousands of workers staged sit-downs or did not report to work
after turning off their banks' main computer systems.
	   About 1,000 helmeted riot police with meter-long (yard-long)
batons and plastic shields ringed the head office of failed Donghwa
Bank in Seoul, where 1,500 bank employees staged a sit-down
overnight.
	   After several pushing and shoving matches, Donghwa workers
allowed 150 government officials and financial experts into the
head office, but refused to cooperate with them.
	   Similar protests were reported at other banks and their branch
offices throughout the country.
	   In the western city of Inchon, a Chung Chong Bank official drove
his passenger car into the main glass door of his branch bank,
injuring two police officers on guard.
	   In a statement designed to head off a run on the insolvent
banks, the supervisory commission said the government will
guarantee payment of their deposits.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments and even financially shaky banks could
survive with preferential government loans and other favors.
	   But the environment has changed as South Korea undergoes radical
reforms under stiff conditions that came with a dlrs 58 billion
bailout by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The government previously had shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies. In mid-May, it named 55 heavily
indebted companies subject to liquidation.
	   The supervisory commission said the five banks to be closed were
selected from among 12 banks ordered early this year to improve
their capital-to-asset ratio to internationally accepted levels.
	   The 12 banks were given until the end of May to improve their
financial status or face closure or merger. The government finished
reviewing the progress of their restructuring programs Saturday.
	   The commission allowed the other seven banks to stay open
temporarily, with an order to improve their finances within the
next month or face closure or merger.
	   Word of the government's list leaked last Friday, prompting
massive withdrawals of deposits.

Israeli president calls for early elections coalition members, chief Palestinian negotiator saying U.S. proposed watering down original West Bank withdrawal plan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more Weizman quotes, president under attack from
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to
set a new election date. However, the president is very popular and
his statements carry great moral weight.
	   Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition accused Weizman of
overstepping his authority and siding with the opposition.
	   The next general elections are to be held in 2000. Polls
indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak of Labor
would tie if elections were held now.
	   Weizman said Monday he feared for the future of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, which have been stalled for the
past 15 months over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   He also noted that Netanyahu has backed off the idea of holding
a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``The peace process is limping and has hit several pitfalls in
recent months,'' Weizman said. ``If he (Netanyahu) does not conduct
a referendum, in my opinion the next solution needs to be
elections. The sooner we go to elections the sooner we will know
what the public thinks.''
	   Opinion pulls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, meanwhile, said Monday
the Palestinians have rejected a U.S. proposal to water down the
original withdrawal plan submitted by Washington in January.
	   Under the new proposal, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of
the land. However, in 3 percent of that area, the Palestinians
would only have restricted authority, particularly in granting
building permits.
	   Erekat said he rejected the proposal when he met two weeks ago
with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, and the Israeli
Cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh. The Palestinians also turned down a
U.S. request to hold more meetings with the Israelis.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had assured the
Palestinians that the original U.S. plan would not be diluted,
Erekat said. ``We see they are trying to change it which is ...
absolutely incomprehensible,'' Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The negotiator complained that the Clinton administration was
not pressing Netanyahu to make a decision. ``They (the Americans)
said they would continue their efforts to get the Israeli yes,''
Erekat said. ``As long as they keep giving Netanyahu the extra
mile, he will keep wasting time.''

Vladivostok mayoral elections scheduled ... again 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After much squabbling, the eastern port city of
Vladivostok plans to hold a mayoral election on Sept. 27, and
residents hope the ballot will help resolve the relentless
political feuding in the region.
	   Mayor Viktor Cherepkov set the date for the poll after a
prolonged fight with his political rivals, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Most recently, the city's electoral commission _ run by a
Cherepkov opponent _ set the mayoral election for July 12.
	   Cherepkov, whose term expires July 5, said the commission had no
right to call the vote. He then scheduled elections for the day his
term ends.
	   A court later called off the July election entirely, declaring
the procedure used by both Cherepkov and his opponents illegal.
	   Under city law, Cherepkov will continue to lead the city until a
new mayor is elected.
	   Cherepkov, who plans to seek re-election, has been locked in
political battle with regional Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko for years,
and the city's economy and infrastructure have suffered as a
result.
	   The governor had Cherepkov ousted in 1994, only to see him
reinstated by by President Boris Yeltsin in 1996. The regional
parliament, backed by governor, tried to boot Cherepkov from office
last September, only to be foiled again.

Swiss air carrier links up with Cathay Pacific 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair group, the Swiss parent of
Switzerland's national air carrier Swissair, said Monday it has
struck a deal to collaborate with the Hong Kong-based airline
Cathay Pacific Airways.
	   The agreement means Cathay Pacific and Swissair will operate
seven non-stop flights a week between between Zurich and Hong Kong
and add more flights on that route a year from now. The two
carriers will also coordinate connecting services on both ends of
the route.
	   The agreement was long rumored after Singapore Airlines pulled
out of a similar pact with Swissair in favor of Germany's Lufthansa
last year.
	   Swissair sought an Asian connection to fill out its alliances in
Europe and the United States, where it is linked with Delta
Airlines.
	   Earlier this year, Swissair promised new destinations and more
frequent flights from its link-up with Austrian Airlines, Belgium's
Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines and AOM of France. The route
network of the new alliance will include 294 destinations in 125
countries.

Thai finance minister predicts successful debt restructuring 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Recent government initiatives,
including tax and fee exemptions for debt restructuring, should
allow Thai banks to turn problem loans into performing assets
within two years, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said
Monday.
	   ``We have all the ingredients to build an efficient process of
corporate debt restructuring. We have high hopes that this process
will get us out of the NPL (non-performing loan) trap,'' he said.
	   The financial sector came under severe stress last year after a
slowdown in the economy triggered a series of defaults in the
business sector and led to a depreciation of the currency. The
cascading series of problems left almost all Thai banks and finance
companies with huge amounts of bad debt.
	   Fearing an increase in non-performing loan levels, the financial
institutions now shun lending to struggling Thai companies.
	   The lack of credit creates more problems for companies, and
causes non-performing loans to rise further, said Tarrin, speaking
at a seminar about corporate restructuring.
	   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. has estimated that non-performing
loans account for 30-35 percent of total loans at Thailand's
strongest financial institutions.
	   Tarrin said a package of two-year tax and fee exemptions
approved by the Cabinet last week to expedite private-sector
restructuring efforts should be in place within a few weeks,
pending approval by Parliament.
	   He also said a newly formed policy committee chaired by central
bank Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul will take charge of government
support for private-sector restructuring efforts. The committee
includes representatives of foreign and local financial
institutions and chambers of commerce.
	   Tarrin's timetable for the reduction of non-performing loans
assumes government forecasts of a contraction of 4-5.5 percent in
gross domestic product this year and growth of 1-2 percent next
year.
	   But private analysts are predicting a contraction of 6-7 percent
this year, with the economy hitting bottom sometime in 1999.
	   The central bank has spent more than 1 trillion baht (dlrs 24
billion) propping up the liquidity of financial institutions. It
has taken over four commercial banks and seven finance companies
since the beginning of the year after ordering 56 finance companies
into liquidation last year.
	   The central bank, meanwhile, dismissed as ``groundless'' a
report in a Bangkok newspaper that it was about to shut down the
four banks it seized.
	   The Thai-language daily Wattachak reported Monday that Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank, First Bangkok City Bank, Siam City Bank and
Bangkok Bank of Commerce would be shut down Tuesday. The government
seized the four in January and February after they failed to raise
capital on schedule.
	   Salinee Wangtal, an assistant director in the central bank's
financial institutions regulations department, said the Bank of
Thailand hasn't yet decided what to do with the four banks, but
intends to privatize them under a proposal being drafted by the
U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Inc.
	   ``No matter what will happen to (the four banks), depositors and
creditors will be guaranteed by the government,'' she said.

Annan urges steps to prevent `second Bosnia' in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Monday urged swift international steps to prevent a ``second
Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the Security Council must
approve any military action.
	   The council was set to take up the Kosovo issue later in the day
in New York, with Russia likely to block any resolution on
intervention. The United States maintains that the Security
Council's blessing is not needed for NATO action aimed at halting
the Kosovo conflict.
	   Annan, speaking at a news conference at United Nations offices
in Vienna, said the focus remains on diplomacy, and the possibility
of military action should be considered carefully.
	   ``That is an issue for the Security Council,'' he reiterated.
The possibility of intervention ``is for the council to decide.''
	   ``But I think the international community should do what it can
to stop what could be a second Bosnia ... and contain the conflict
before it spreads,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people have died this year in Kosovo, a Serbian
province in Yugoslavia populated largely by ethnic Albanians, in
clashes between Serb security forces and Albanian militants.
	   Annan also said he was flying Monday to Abuja, Nigeria, on the
invitation of the nation's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   He planned to meet with Abubakar, who promised a return to
civilian rule after assuming power this month, and other leading
figures as part of a push to free political prisoners and ensure
democracy.
	   Annan said he has been ``much encouraged'' by his recent
intensive discussions with Abubakar, as well as the general's early
actions in power, and decided the time is right for such a trip.
	   The U.N. chief's trip is further evidence that years of Nigerian
isolation could be ending. On Friday, Abubakar met with a European
Union delegation and talked about possible ways for Nigeria to
return to the international stage.
	   Annan was in Vienna for a weekend commemoration of the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, made in an
attempt to ensure that the Holocaust would never recur.
	   He praised U.S. President Bill Clinton for his human rights
remarks in China.
	   ``It's not every day Chinese leaders hear that kind of
statement,'' he said.

Cyprus rescues 115 aboard shift drifting in Mediterranean 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday aboard a ship adrift for two days off the island's coast.
	   The ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol early
Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were taken to a hospital for treatment for dehydration
and exposure, a hospital official said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for two days before it was spotted by a
Ukrainian-flagged ship, the police spokesman said, on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The ship, carrying 109 passengers and six crew, was officially
headed for Libya. The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq,
Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a

EU comes to view Kosovo militants must be part of any peace deal. 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union, endorsing a new U.S. tack,
was coming around to the view Monday that although they reject a
pacifist approach, Kosovo militants must be part of a peace deal in
Serbia's secessionist province.
	   Arriving at an EU foreign ministers meeting, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said peace talks must ``include those who
represent all shades of Kosovo opinion,'' including representatives
of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Diplomats stressed this did not mean the EU supported an
independent Kosovo, only a return to the autonomy the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province had until 1989.
	   They added EU governments want to fall in line with a new
American position that became clear last Friday when U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard met with people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The KLA _ which says it controls up to 40 percent of Kosovo _
rejects the pacifist approach to independence of Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian leader in the southern Serbian province.
	   In a related measure, the foreign ministers planned to formalize
a decision taken at an EU summit in Cardiff, Wales, this month to
ban all commercial flights between Yugoslav and EU airports.
	   It was not clear when that ban could take effect. The EU has
already imposed a ban on new investments, frozen Serbian country's
assets abroad, prohibited arms exports to Belgrade and restricted
travel visas for Yugoslav officials to punish Serbian strongman
Slobodan Milosevic for his crackdown in Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo crisis again dominated an EU foreign ministers
meeting as the outlook for a peaceful settlement remained bleak.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said it was imperative for
the international community to cast the net wider. ``We have to
talk to everybody who has the possibility to end the violence,'' he
said.
	   Cook called Rugova ``the elected and legitimate head of the
Kosovo Albanians ... the man with whom we have been dealing.''
	   Yet he sounded more conciliatory toward the KLA, even though it
tried to organize a boycott of elections two months ago that made
Rugova the leader of Kosovo Albanians and is committed to seeking
independence through armed resistance.
	   The foreign ministers were expected to issue a declaration later
Monday restating their view Kosovo must not become independent but
that Belgrade must end its crackdown, withdraw its security forces
and negotiate a peace deal with ethnic Albanians through which it
would reinstate Kosovo's autonomous status.
	   Any peace negotiations would have to be attended by ``all those
in a leadership role'' in Kosovo, according to the draft of the
statement.

Four Pakistanis arrested in U.S.-Thai operation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The chief of Thailand's immigration
police said Monday that four Pakistani citizens arrested in a joint
operation with the FBI could be expelled to their homeland in about
a month for ``illegal activities.''
	   Lt. Gen. Chidchai Vanasaidya refused to specify of what crimes
the four were suspected, though he again denied Thai newspaper
reports that they were linked to New York's World Trade Center
bombing or an alleged plot to kill the U.S. ambassador.
	   The four were arrested Friday in a raid by Thai police and the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on a condominium building. The
only crimes they have been charged with so far are overstaying
their visas and illegal entry.
	   Chidchai said they could be sent back to Pakistan in about a
month after serving time for violating Thailand's immigration law.
He rejected suggestions by reporters at a news conference Monday
that an FBI raid seemed unjustified for Thai visa violations.
	   ``We received information about their intention to carry out
illegal activities in Thailand,'' Chidchai said. ``I can't say
where that information came from or who gave the order to conduct
the raid.''
	   Chidchai denied persistent reports by the newspaper The Nation,
citing Thai sources close to the case, that the four were wanted in
connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New
York by Islamic extremists.
	   ``If they are linked to the World Trade Center, they would have
been on the blacklist and we would have known,'' Chidchai said.
	   The Nation has also reported that the four were part of a plot
to assassinate the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, William H. Itoh,
and to attack the U.S. Embassy. The embassy has declined to discuss
the U.S. involvement or Thai handling of the case.
	   Chidchai has met officials from the Pakistani and U.S. embassies
in Bangkok about the case but refused to give details.
	   The Nation has identified the four men as Mohamad Rahim, 30,
Hadja Pahu Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Husen, 25.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack and sentenced
to life imprisonment.
	   In November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Yousef of Pakistan
on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as the
mastermind of the bombing at the twin 110-story buildings in
Manhattan.

Parliament: India trade links vital despite nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A parliamentary committee on Monday
glossed over last month's nuclear tests by India, describing them
as a ``comma'' in relations with Australia and urging the
government to continue to build trade and investment links.
	   Its report, ``Australia's Trade Relationship with India,'' also
urged Prime Minister John Howard to visit India as soon as
relations are normalized, accompanied by a trade mission.
	   The 15-month report by parliament's Joint Standing Committee on
Trade, Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade was completed just as
India's five nuclear tests triggered Australian sanctions and a
major downgrading in relations.
	   Howard condemned the tests, and accused India of threatening
international safety and security.
	   Despite this, Committee Chair Nick Dondas said Australia had to
continue to build its trade ties with India.
	   ``India has been described as a country with no full stops and
the latter event has put a comma in the Australia-India
relationship at both a political and commercial level,'' Dondas
told Parliament.
	   ``The committee maintains that Australia must continue to
develop its links west and to build on its trade and investment
relationship with India.''
	   The report found Australia's trade with India had doubled over
the past six years, making that country one of its biggest export
markets.
	   But it found there was still enormous potential for trade, and
recommended the strengthening of trade offices in India and a
feasibility study into the supply of liquefied natural gas from
Australia's northwest shelf to India.

Israeli president calls for early elections coalition members, chief Palestinian negotiator saying U.S. proposed watering down original West Bank withdrawal plan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more Weizman quotes, president under attack from
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to
set a new election date. However, the president is very popular,
and his statements carry great moral weight.
	   Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition accused Weizman of
overstepping his authority and siding with the opposition.
	   The next general elections are to be held in 2000. Polls
indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak of Labor
would tie if elections were held now.
	   Weizman said Monday he feared for the future of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, which have been stalled for the
past 15 months over the scope of a troop withdrawal from the
Israeli occupied West Bank.
	   He also noted that Netanyahu has backed off the idea of holding
a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``The peace process is limping and has hit several pitfalls in
recent months,'' Weizman said. ``If he (Netanyahu) does not conduct
a referendum, in my opinion the next solution needs to be
elections. The sooner we go to elections the sooner we will know
what the public thinks.''
	   Opinion pulls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, meanwhile, said Monday
that the Palestinians have rejected a U.S. proposal to water down
the original withdrawal plan submitted by Washington in January.
	   Under the new proposal, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of
the land. However, in 3 percent of that area, the Palestinians
would only have restricted authority, particularly in granting
building permits.
	   Erekat said he rejected the proposal when he met two weeks ago
with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, and the Israeli
Cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh. The Palestinians also turned down a
U.S. request to hold more meetings with the Israelis.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had assured the
Palestinians that the original U.S. plan would not be diluted,
Erekat said.
	   ``We see they are trying to change it which is ... absolutely
incomprehensible,'' Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The negotiator complained that the administration of U.S.
President Bill Clinton was not pressing Netanyahu to make a
decision.
	   ``They (the Americans) said they would continue their efforts to
get the Israeli yes,'' Erekat said. ``As long as they keep giving
Netanyahu the extra mile, he will keep wasting time.''

31 arrested for gambling on World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Police in Ho Chi Minh City said Monday
they have arrested 31 people for gambling on the World Cup soccer
tournament.
	   The arrests came in a raid last Thursday on a coffee shop where
people were betting on the Mexico-Netherlands match, a police
officer said by telephone.
	   Shop owners Tran Duc Khanh, 35, and Tran Hoa, 28, were arrested
along with 29 patrons. Police seized dlrs 11,500, 10 mobile phones
and 10 notebooks that contained names and the amounts they wagered.
	   Khanh and Hoa bought two big-screen television sets to show
World Cup matches and underwrote the wagering, charging 3 percent
of winning bets.
	   Vietnam has become obsessed with the World Cup, even though it
never has had a team qualify for soccer's big event. Last week, a
man committed suicide after losing a motorcycle in a bet.

One protester shot dead, four wounded in East Timor during EU visit 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with shootings
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Security officers shot one protester to
death and wounded four others near a cathedral in East Timor on
Monday as a European Union diplomatic team held talks with a
Catholic bishop.
	   Witnesses said the plainclothes officers opened fire when their
van was mobbed by demonstrators soon after the ambassadors from
Britain, the Netherlands and Austria arrived in the town of Baucau,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili.
	   About 5,000 demonstrators, who want independence from Indonesia,
had rallied in front of Baucau's St. Antonio Cathedral.
	   Vilidiu Gusmao, 32, a lay member of the church's Justice and
Peace Commission, said the crowd cheered when two vans carrying the
Jakarta-based envoys arrived for talks with Bishop Bacilio Do
Nascimento.
	   However, the situation turned violent when a third van arrived
later with several security agents, carrying automatic weapons.
	   ``The people got angry because the security agents came here
with guns,'' Gusmao said.
	   He said several shots were fired directly into a mob that had
surrounded the vehicle and pounded and kicked its doors and
windows.
	   Hundreds of onlookers fled into the cathedral or jumped over a
wall to take shelter when the shots rang out.
	   The agents ran to a nearby army post.
	   The dead man was identified as Orlando Marcelinu da Costa, 35.
	   Three other men and one woman were hospitalized with gunshot
wounds.
	   Two more people were injured when they were hit by the besieged
van as it tried to force its way through the crowd.
	   ``It is true that one man was shot after protesters attacked
some security agents,'' said a military intelligence officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate comment from the European diplomats.
	   Earlier, thousands of pro-independence protesters marched
through East Timor's capital Monday, demanding a referendum on
Indonesian control over the territory and the release of an
imprisoned rebel leader.
	   It was the fourth straight day of demonstrations in East Timor
by groups that either support Indonesian rule or want greater
independence.
	   The territory's governor called for calm.
	   Hundreds of soldiers with automatic weapons and police armed
with shields and tear gas canisters stood by as a procession of
protesters, stretching five kilometers (3 miles), moved peacefully
from the University of East Timor through Dili's streets.
	   Shops and offices were closed. Some storekeepers said they were
worried that the march, organized by college students, might turn
violent.
	   The demonstration took place as three Jakarta-based ambassadors
continued with a three-day fact-finding tour on behalf of the
European Union. Rival groups have clashed on several occasions in
recent days in attempts to impress the visiting envoys.
	   Monday's protesters held up pictures of guerrilla chief Xanana
Gusmao, demanding that he be released from a Jakarta prison where
he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian forces.
	   The crowd also called for a ballot to determine the future of
the former Portuguese colony, invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and
annexed by Jakarta the following year.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered to free Gusmao and
to grant special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory. But he has
ruled out any referendum.
	   The United Nations and many other governments don't recognize
the legitimacy of Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island,
which has endured more than two decades of guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses.
	   Meanwhile, East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares asked security
personnel Monday to take stern but restrained action against
violent troublemakers.
	   On Saturday, rival protesters clashed in front of a Catholic
church in Manatuto, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Dili.
Troops opened fire when fighting broke out among pro-independence
and pro-Indonesian groups, and one man was killed.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a no-win situation, a
commission on Moday barred an annual Protestant march through a
hostile Catholic neighborhood, with the British government
deploying troops in anticipation of trouble no matter what the
decision.
	   ``We cannot see at this stage how a parade could proceed again
this year without having a very serious impact on community
relations, both locally and more widely across Northern Ireland,''
said Parades Commission chairman Alastair Graham.
	   The long-postponed verdict came just four days after the
election of a new 108-seat Assembly for Northern Ireland, bedrock

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide.
	   Although authorities considered the death a suicide, tribunal
officials and Dutch police were conducting separate investigations,
Chartier said.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that as mayor of the eastern Croatia city of Vukovar, he
played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended last Thursday and the verdict was expected in
two weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges,
faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication and
that Fila asked for a higher dose last Friday because he was
``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal. He was under
medication so he could stand the trial,'' Fila said.
	   Dokmanovic's corpse was taken to a nearby hospital morgue. It
was not immediately known whether he left a note.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well, and he was placed on a
suicide watch. Guards last saw him alive at 11:30 p.m. (2130 GMT)
Sunday, Chartier said.
	   Shortly thereafter, Dokmanovic short-circuited the electricity
in his cell using an electric razor, and the lights went out, the
spokesman said. Dokmanovic's body was found dangling in the
darkened cell.
	   Dokmanovic had complained through his lawyers of feeling
depressed and had been visited regularly by a psychiatrist, but he
never hinted he was suicidal.
	   In fact, he was seen as having a good chance at acquittal
because the evidence against him was not overwhelming. His death
means the case is closed, and no verdict will be released
posthumously, Chartier said.
	   Prosecutors had charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in the
massacre near the eastern Croatian city of Vukovar, where he was
mayor.
	   The massacre is widely considered to be the worst atrocity of
the 1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   According to prosecutors, hundreds of people had sought refuge
on Nov. 20, 1991, at Vukovar's hospital after the city fell to the
Yugoslav National Army, known as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croatians and others from the hospital were
rounded up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to
a nearby farm, where they were beaten, taken to a ravine, shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors said. The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic was responsible for both his active
participation and for his failure to prevent and stop the crimes.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday aboard a ship adrift for days off the island's coast. Two
passengers reportedly died of thirst and were thrown overboard.
	   The ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol early
Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were taken to a hospital for treatment for dehydration
and exposure, a hospital official said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for days before it was spotted by a Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Sierra Leone,
Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Earlier, two other African passengers died of thirst and their
bodies were thrown overboard, Suheib Anwar Saleh, a 25-year-old
Iraqi passenger, told The Associated Press.
	   The ship, with a crew of six, was officially headed for Libya,
but Saleh said passengers were destined for Crete or Italy and paid
as much as dlrs 2,400 for the journey.
	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.

China's top trade official: China committed to keep yuan stable 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China's top trade official on Monday reiterated
Beijing's commitment to keep the yuan stable, even though the
Japanese yen's sharp drop is hurting China's export growth.
	   Speaking at a conference in Hong Kong, Shi Guangsheng, minister
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said not devaluing the
yuan is a ``responsible approach.''
	   A stable yuan is good for the stability of the region, as well
as world economies in general, he said.
	   Beijing can avoid devaluation because of its large foreign
exchange reserves, Shi said.
	   Shi's comments echo those of Premier Zhu Rongji, who pledged to
U.S. President Bill Clinton over the weekend to keep the yuan
stable.
	   Shi said Asia's yearlong financial crisis, particularly the
yen's recent slide, ``has created more difficulties for Asian
economies and also has put increasing pressure on China's export
growth.''
	   China and Southeast Asian countries compete for similar export
markets, so the devaluation of regional currencies has weakened
China's competitiveness, the trade official said.
	   In May, China's total exports fell 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, the first drop in 22 months. Prices for China's exports
have also dropped 10-20 percent, he said.
	   ``The Asian financial crisis has a significant negative impact
on China's exports as well as on the overall economy. The aftermath
will last for a fairly long period of time, and the amount of
damage cannot be underestimated,'' Shi added.
	   In the first five months of the year, China's exports to members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell 10.5 percent,
while exports to Japan dropped 5.7 percent and to South Korea 29.6
percent, he said.
	   Investments from the rest of Asia, which constitute about 80
percent of the total investment in China, are slowing because of
the Asian financial crisis, Shi said.
	   In the first quarter of this year, direct investment from
Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and Thailand plunged by 89.2 percent,
55.8 percent, 42.2 percent and 35.5 percent, respectively.
	   Shi said Beijing has introduced measures including increasing
tax rebates for selective products in a bid to revive exports.
	   He predicted a recovery in the second half of this year, with
exports growing faster than the 8.6 percent recorded in the first
five months. Shi also reiterated that Beijing is confident of
achieving 8 percent growth in gross domestic product and keeping
inflation below 3 percent in 1998.

Opposition party claims three mayorships in Baja California old material. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with latest voting results; TRIMS to delete
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's opposition National Action Party
has held on to two key mayorships and captured at least one more in
the five municipalities of Baja California state.
	   Unofficial results from Sunday's election showed that the PAN,
as it is known by its Spanish initials, won its fourth straight
mayor's race in Tijuana over the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   Official results were not expected until Wednesday. But with 89
percent of the polling places counted early Monday, the PAN's
Francisco Vega de la Madrid had 103,086 votes, or 45 percent,
compared with 88,187 votes, or 39 percent, for the PRI's Amador
Rodriguez Lozano. Three other candidates each drew less than 10
percent of the vote.
	   The PAN has held both the Tijuana mayoral post and the Baja
California governship since 1989, when the state made history by
becoming one of the first in Mexico to vote an opposition-party
governor into power.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems.
	   Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, the mother of a 5-year-old girl,
said she voted for the PAN because she has noticed improvements in
streets and schools.
	   The PAN ``has done many things for Tijuana,'' said Gonzalez, who
works in a Sony Corp. maquiladora, or assembly plant near the U.S.
border.
	   But Juana Flores Rodriguez, 29, said she liked the promises of
the PRI's Rodriguez Lozano, who has said he would bring paved
roads, storm drains and running water to shantytowns.
	   Mayors in Mexico serve three-year terms, and they cannot succeed
themselves.
	   Vega, 43, is a businessman and former state finance director.
	   The PAN had been expected to hang onto the mayorships in Tijuana
_ the largest Mexican city along the U.S. border _ and Mexicali,
the state capital. With 89 percent of the polling places counted in
Mexicali, the PAN candidate had 79,845 votes, or 44 percent, over
the PRI candidate, who had 72,569 votes, or 40 percent.
	   It was a closer race in the port city of Ensenada, which had
three PAN mayors from 1986 to 1995, when the PRI retook the post.
Early Monday, the PAN was leading with 26,721 votes, or 39 percent,
to the PRI's 25,159 votes, or 37 percent.
	   The PAN was victorious in Rosarito Beach, drawing 44 percent of
the votes to 39 percent for the PRI _ with 69 percent counted.
	   The PRI claimed the border city of Tecate, where it had 45
percent of the vote despite a strong showing of 24 percent by the
left-center Democratic Revolution Party and 22 percent by the PAN.
	   Besides the mayoral posts, voters cast ballots for all 25 seats
in the state congress.

World Cup: Romania plays Croatia in all-Balkan battle 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ In an encounter that highlights regional
rivalry and stature, Romania clashes with debutant Croatia on
Tuesday for a spot in the quarterfinals and the sparks are already
flying.
	   ``The Croatian team hasn't shown its true face yet. I say: Watch
out, Romania,'' a cocky Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic said.
	   His Romanian counterpart, Anghel Iordanescu, sounded more
diplomatic, if equally confident.
	   ``Croatia is the team we wanted to face. We are familiar with
their technical style. They are from the same region. If things go
the normal way, we could meet Germany in the quarterfinals.''
	   Croatia, a World Cup newcomer, finished second in Group H after
beating Jamaica 3-1 and Japan 1-0 and losing to Argentina 1-0.
	   Romania, which made the quarterfinals in 1994 where it was
eliminated by Sweden after a penalty shootout, clinched Group G
with a near-perfect record: victories over Colombia 1-0 and England
2-1 and a 1-1 tie with Tunisia.
	   Pep talk aside, the two squads showed more respect for each
other.
	   ``We know in our minds that we have to play better against
Romania,'' Croatian defender Slaven Bilic of Everton said after the
match with Argentina.
	   And Iordanescu found words of praise for the Croats. ``Through
its offensive force, ability and individual value of its players,
Croatia is a strong contender which can score against any teams.
They're very competitive,'' the Romanian coach said.
	   Iordanescu's plan to rest some of his best players for the
Croatia game almost backfired when Tunisia was leading Romania 1-0
after the first half. Only after standout strikers Ilie Adrian of
Valencia and Viorel Moldovan of Coventry were sent to the pitch
after the break did Romania bring more bite in its offense and
tallied the equalizer.
	   At their one-hour team practice Sunday, the Romanians, who dyed
their hair yellow for clinching their group, exercised passing and
goal shooting. They skipped another scheduled practice on Saturday
to recuperate, team officials said.
	   Iordanescu said all the regulars were fit, with the exception of
Dan Petrescu of Chelsea, a pillar of defense who complained of pain
in his right knee after the game with Tunisia. Petrescu, who scored
the winner against England, skipped the practice and did some
running and stretching exercises.
	   Iordanescu would not say if Petrescu, who had surgery on his
right knee several years ago, would make the team on Tuesday.
	   ``We're optimistic and we hope we will play in the
quarterfinals,'' he said.
	   Croatia is expected to field its strongest starting lineup, no
major injuries having been reported. But the Croats will miss key
central defender Zvonimir Soldo of VfB Stuttgart, who was suspended
after getting his second yellow card of the tournament in the game
against Argentina.
	   Blazevic was expected to give Soldo's spot to Igor Stimac of
Derby County, another veteran defender, but left the final lineup
open until Tuesday.
	   ``Missing Soldo will be a handicap, but it's not such a problem.
Stimac will replace him well,'' Bilic said.
	   In a bid to give their attack more punch, the Croats may throw a
fresh forward into their game against Romania.
	   Blazevic said Sunday he had not ruled out starting with
Valencia's Goran Vlaovic, a substitute who had Croatia's closest
shot _ a long drive that hit the post _ in Friday's 1-0 loss to
Argentina.
	   The Croatian coach also told reporters Monday that he plans to
start the game without midfiedler Robert Prosinecki who has been in
poor shape recently. He will be replaced by Krunoslav Jurcic who
plays for Croatia Zagreb in the domestic league.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin on Monday defended International Monetary Fund policy in
Asia, treading on delicate ground in a country whose leader has
repeatedly lambasted the IMF.
	   ``On balance, what the IMF has done is about right,'' Rubin told
a news conference after meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. ``They don't have a one-formula-fits-all
program.''
	   Mahathir has repeatedly blamed IMF-like policies for his
Southeast Asian country's slumping economy and pointed to the
IMF-backed austerity measures in neighboring Indonesia, which led
to soaring inflation and deadly riots.
	   Rubin said countries with weak monetary policy were to blame for
failing economies, not the IMF.
	   ``If you have a looser monetary policy, the risks that you take
are substantial,'' he said. Those risks include capital flight,
currency slides and difficulty to repay debt.
	   ``Each country is immensely complex,'' Rubin said. ``The IMF
makes judgments for each situation.''
	   Last Thursday, Mahathir accused economic policies endorsed by
the IMF of devastating the Malaysian economy, which shrank by 1.8
percent in the first quarter of this year.
	   In recent speeches, Mahathir has accused foreigners of
engineering the Asian financial crisis so that they could
recolonize the region.
	   Economists are predicting a full-blown recession for Malaysia as
the full impact of the Asian financial crisis hits. Malaysia,
unlike its economically battered neighbors, Indonesia and Thailand,
has resisted turning to the IMF for a financial bailout.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim introduced an austerity program
in December to curb inflation and protect the ringgit, which has
lost some 38 percent of its value in the last year. Many economists
welcomed it as an IMF-like program.
	   Mahathir, however, has favored a softer monetary policy and has
urged banks to increase lending to struggling companies so that
they can grow out of the crisis.
	   He also has called for lower interest rates, which currently
range from 12 to 16 percent.
	   When asked whether the interest rates should be kept high in
Malaysia, Rubin said, ``It's an issue that needs to be resolved by
the Malaysian authorities. It's a question of reaching the right
balance.''
	   Mahathir, however, told reporters that Rubin had agreed with his
contention that high interest rates were harmful.
	   Earlier in the day, Rubin urged Malaysia to reform its economy
and introduce ``sound'' monetary policies.
	   Malaysia should reduce limits on foreign investment in its
banking and financial sector and issue credit on a ``purely
commercial basis,'' Rubin said at the start of a meeting with
Malaysian businessmen and officials.
	   He warned that it would be ``far worse'' if Malaysia did not
reform because of the current economic crisis.
	   ``Reform is the answer,'' he said.
	   Rubin headed to Thailand and South Korea for the next leg of his
Asia tour. He flew into Kuala Lumpur Sunday after a weekend of
talks with Chinese officials in Beijing.

Menem: Argentina might help Ukraine deal with Chernobyl

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Argentina is prepared to help Ukraine deal
with the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and wants
to boost economic ties with Kiev, Argentine President Carlos Menem
said Monday.
	   ``We would like to help Ukraine more with the Chernobyl
problem,'' Menem said after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart
Leonid Kuchma.
	   Kuchma told reporters the ``friendly and constructive'' talks
focused on a wide range of political and economic issues, as well
as cooperation between his country and Argentina in international
organizations.
	   He said Menem's visit, the first state visit by an Argentine
president, was an ``historic event,'' noting that Argentina was the
first Latin American country to recognize Ukraine's post-Soviet
independence and has a significant Ukrainian minority.
	   ``We have a lot to learn from Argentina'' in the economic
sphere, Kuchma said, adding that his economically struggling nation
was going through some ``difficult times'' at present.
	   Menem, who arrived in Kiev from Moscow, said Argentina could be
involved in repairing the leaky concrete sarcophagus, which covers
Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor ruined in the 1986 explosion and fire.
	   Speaking at a joint news conference with Kuchma, he did not
elaborate on further possible help.
	   Menem said trade balance between the two countries grew from
zero to about dlrs 40 million within several years, but added that
the figure was too low.
	   He said the sides planned to sign two economic agreements
Monday, ``which we hope would bring trade turnover to dlrs 200
million in two years.''
	   One possible area of cooperation involves energy production.
Today, about 37 percent of Argentine's electric energy production
involves Ukrainian-made equipment, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   ``Ukraine is widely represented today in Argentina's energy
production. This is a fact,'' Kuchma said.
	   Ukraine also is interested in taking part in building projects
and in car and tractor production in Argentina.
	   The two presidents said the sides would also be discussing
agreements on migration and work toward signing an agreement on
military cooperation. The defense minister of Argentina, who
accompanied the Argentinean leader, would come on a separate visit
in October, Menem said.
	   Menem arrived in Ukraine Sunday and leaves early Tuesday.

Annan urges steps to prevent `second Bosnia' in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Monday urged swift international steps to prevent a ``second
Bosnia'' in Kosovo but reiterated that the Security Council must
approve any military action.
	   The council was set to take up the conflict in Kosovo later in
the day in New York, with Russia likely to block any resolution on
intervention. The United States maintains that the Security
Council's blessing is not needed for NATO action aimed at halting
the violence.
	   Hundreds of people have died this year in Kosovo, a Serbian
province in Yugoslavia populated largely by ethnic Albanians, in
clashes between Serb security forces and Albanian militants.
	   Annan, speaking at a news conference at United Nations offices
in Vienna, said the focus for ending the fighting remains on
diplomacy and that the possibility of military action should be
considered carefully.
	   ``That is an issue for the Security Council,'' he reiterated.
The possibility of intervention ``is for the council to decide.''
	   ``But I think the international community should do what it can
to stop what could be a second Bosnia ... and contain the conflict
before it spreads,'' he said.
	   Annan also said he was flying Monday to Abuja, Nigeria, at the
invitation of the nation's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   He planned to meet with Abubakar, who promised a return to
civilian rule after assuming power this month, and other leading
figures as part of a push to free political prisoners and ensure
democracy.
	   Annan said he has been ``much encouraged'' by his recent
intensive discussions with Abubakar, as well as the general's early
actions in power, and decided the time is right for such a trip.
	   The U.N. chief's trip is further evidence that years of Nigerian
isolation could be ending. On Friday, Abubakar met with a European
Union delegation and talked about possible ways for Nigeria to
return to the international stage.
	   Annan was in Vienna for a weekend commemoration of the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, made in an
attempt to ensure that genocide like the Nazi killings of European
Jews would never recur.
	   He praised U.S. President Bill Clinton for his human rights
remarks in China.
	   ``It's not every day Chinese leaders hear that kind of
statement,'' he said.

Khalaf off to Kuwait on first visit by Cabinet minister 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's planning minister left for Kuwait
Monday on the first visit by a Jordanian Cabinet official since
relations soured during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   The minister, Rima Khalaf, will meet with Moussa Hamad, the head
of the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development,
and sign agreements for loans to Jordanian projects, an official at
Khalaf's office said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   She will also meet Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed and her
Kuwait counterpart, Ali Moussa, during her three-day visit.
Meetings with Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, and the crown
prince, Sheikh Saad, are possible, the official said.
	   Jordan fell out with Kuwait for its perceived tilt toward Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the seven-month
occupation that followed. Kuwait closed the Jordanian Embassy and
recalled its ambassador from Amman following the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Relations warmed up somewhat in 1995 when Jordan distanced
itself from Baghdad, publicly criticizing the policies of its
neighbor and calling for political change in Iraq.
	   But Kuwait's Parliament snubbed the gestures from Jordan _ a
resource-barren country which once depended on aid from Kuwait and
other oil-rich states _ saying it was not ready for normalization.

World Cup: Sampson quits after disappointing World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Steve Sampson, the target of bitter criticism from
U.S. players after they finished dead last at the World Cup, quit
Monday as the national team coach.
	   The resignation was announced by U.S. Soccer Federation
president Alan Rothenberg, who met with Sampson in Paris. The
decision to leave was Sampson's and the departure was amicable, a
source familiar with the breakfast meeting said.
	   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' Rothenberg
said in a statement. ``His tireless work has helped advance our
sport and on balance it was an era of growth. I compliment him on
his many achievements with our team.''
	   Neither Sampson, who was returning to the United States with his
wife and son, nor Rothenberg were available for comment.

Emirates approves sales of anti-impotency drug 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Emirates has approved
the sale of Viagra, the second Gulf state to do so.
	   The Ministry of Health decided in a meeting Sunday to allow the
anti-impotency drug to go on sale after conducting a series of
tests, the Khaleej Times reported Monday. It said Viagra should be
available in pharmacies by the end of the year.
	   Kuwait was the first Gulf state to approve its use.
	   Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Sheik Abdul-Aziz
bin Baz, declared that the drug is permitted under Islam, provided
it does not contain ingredients that harm or intoxicate.
	   Viagra has sold on the local black market in Saudi Arabia at
dlrs 80 a pill, eight times its price in the United States.

	   Sampson was hired as coach in August 1995 and led the U.S. team
to a 26-22-14 record, including a 1-0 victory over world-champion
Brazil in the Gold Cup in Los Angeles last February.
	   The U.S. qualified for its third straight World Cup and players
and officials openly talked of at least duplicating the performance
of 1994, when the Americans reached the second round.
	   But the team never lived up to those expectations, and was
shrouded in controversy even before it arrived in France.
	   Sampson feuded with players and upset many by leaving longtime
captain and field leader John Harkes off the World Cup squad.
	   Once at the Cup, it quickly became obvious that this U.S. team
was not on the same level as the European and Latin American squads
it had boasted it would challenge.
	   It lost its opener to Germany 2-0 in a game it had
optimistically hoped to draw, then lost the one game it had to win
_ against Iran. The 2-1 defeat in Lyon a week ago Sunday sent shock
waves through the U.S. soccer community and left the team in a deep
funk.
	   Already eliminated from the any chance of advancing, the
Americans then lost their finale to Yugoslavia 1-0, finishing 0-3-0
with just one goal _ the worst performance of any of the
tournament's 32 teams.
	   Several players, including veterans Alexi Lalas and Tab Ramos,
said they would never play for the U.S. again as long as Sampson
was coach. Other players criticized Sampson's tactics and lineups.
	   Sampson said he resented the criticism and felt betrayed by
players he had tried to accommodate.
	   ``Maybe there's a sense of frustration that international
careers are coming to an end and they needed a scapegoat,'' Sampson
said. ``It's unfair it was pointed at me, the individual who stuck
with them for a long time.''
	   Rothenberg said in his statement that a ``thorough process for
hiring a national team coach'' would be launched but gave no
timetable for naming a successor for Sampson.
	   ``We have a clean blackboard, so to speak,'' he said.
	   Rothenberg also said the federation was committed to Project
2010, aimed at a U.S. World Cup championship in the next 12 years.
	   He said the project was essential, ``further underscored by our
experience in France '98.''

Commission bars Protestants from marching into Catholic area 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS, RECASTS throughout with decision, reaction
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Confronting a dilemma, a
commission on Monday ordered an annual Protestant march to avoid a
hostile Catholic neighborhood, a sectarian showdown that has
triggered violence across Northern Ireland for the past two
summers.
	   The Parades Commission's long-postponed verdict came just four
days after the election of a new 108-seat Assembly for Northern
Ireland _ bedrock of April's peace agreement _ and six days before
the Orange Order march in embittered Portadown, a staunchly
Protestant town southwest of Belfast.
	   Anticipating confrontations with Protestant hard-liners in the
coming week, the British government has already deployed more than
1,000 extra soldiers from bases in England, boosting the overall
garrison above 19,000. The Orange Order has some 80,000 members and
many more supporters in Northern Ireland's majority community.
	   The commission chairman, Alistair Graham, said allowing some
2,000 Portadown Orangemen to march along the Garvaghy Road on
Sunday _ its route since 1807 _ would threaten ``to wreck all the
gains of the last few months.''
	   ``We see the need to break the cycle in 1998,'' said Graham, a
former labor union negotiator from England who leads the panel of
three Catholic and three Protestant professionals.
	   ``The opportunity provided by such a break should be seized by
political and religious leaders to demonstrate greater political
responsibility and to bridge the chasm between both sides of the
community, so laying the foundation for a more tolerant atmosphere
in the future,'' he added.
	   Local anti-Orange protesters led by a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner, Breandan MacCionnaith, had threatened to mobilize
thousands of Catholics and block the road with a rival parade.
	   MacCionnaith welcomed the decision but said he didn't trust the
predominantly Protestant police force to enforce it. ``Our
community's fear is naturally that the British authorities will
gave in again to the `greater threat' posed by the massed Orange
mobs,'' he said.
	   Two years ago, police blocked the Orangemen outside the church
and ordered them to march a different way back to town. But after
four nights of Protestant mob mayhem _ during which major highways
were blocked, businesses torched, the airport closed, the port
blockaded, and a Catholic taxi driver abducted and executed _ the
police caved in and forced the march past enraged Catholic
residents.
	   Last year, police endured three nights of intense Catholic
rioting and IRA gun attacks after launching a predawn raid on
Garvaghy Road and clubbing several hundred protesters off the
roadway.
	   A hard-line Orange faction, calling itself ``the Spirit of
Drumcree'' after the name of the Anglican church that is the
march's focal point, is threatening to organize a repeat of the
1996 chaos.
	   Spirit of Drumcree leader Joel Patton said the commission had
put the police and army ``on a headlong collision course with the
Protestant community.''
	   ``The first policeman or soldier that batons an Orangeman coming
out of his place of worship at Drumcree will kill this so-called
peace agreement dead in the water,'' Patton said.
	   The Portadown Orangemen have refused to talk directly with the
Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition, which it calls a front for the
IRA.
	   The commission originally intended to publish its Portadown
verdict six weeks ago. British Prime Minister Tony Blair told
Graham to suppress his report until after May's public referendum
on the Belfast peace agreement and last week's Assembly election.
	   Orange leaders, reflecting the group's favorite slogans of ``No
surrender,'' ``Not an inch'' and ``What we have, we hold,'' refused
to meet the commission.

Russia's markets fall again, parliament works on austerity plan 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES new 8th graf with comment from prime minister and
finance minister in 14th graf.
By NICK WADHAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds took another
tumble Monday while parliament worked on a dozen economic measures
aimed at digging Russia out of its financial crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin urged the Communist-dominated parliament
to swiftly approve the government's austerity plan. But the
Communists in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
generally want more government spending, not less, and may be
reluctant to support Yeltsin's proposals.
	   ``Let the Duma hurry up,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by
Interfax news agency. ``I have done my part of the job _ I've
signed the decrees.''
	   At the same time, however, Yeltsin denied that Russia is in the
midst of an economic crisis. ``We have no crisis,'' he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I do not describe the
program as an anti-crisis program.''
	   The austerity plan, outlined by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
earlier this month, focuses on Russia's complicated and outdated
tax system. The new plan has won praise from the International
Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan to Russia.
	   But to become effective, the plan needs to be passed by the
State Duma, which has threatened to sink any bills that reduce
salaries or freeze pension payments. Parliament's Budget Committee
was examining the measures on Monday.
	   Failure to implement the plan immediately ``would pose a threat
to state security and integrity,'' Kiriyenko said after meeting
Monday with Yeltsin.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's markets began dropping as soon as they
opened Monday, and traders said it was continuation of nervous
selling on Friday.
	   The Russian Trading System's stock index was down 4.2 percent by
midday, and benchmark 1-year government bond issues offered yields
as high as 83 percent, up from around 75 percent on Friday.
	   However, the ruble rallied, and was slightly stronger Monday at
around 6.20 rubles to the U.S. dollar.
	   The shaky ruble is perhaps the most urgent problem of the many
economic woes facing Russia at present.
	   The government desperately wants to prevent a devaluation of the
ruble, and the Central Bank has been using hard currency reserves
to keep its value relatively steady.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Monday the government
could not rule out a ruble devaluation if tax collection is not
improved. ``The situation is critical,'' he said, according to
Interfax.
	   Until now, low inflation and the ruble's stability have been
among President Boris Yeltsin's most important successes, and the
economic crisis has been confined so far to the financial markets.
	   But a ruble devaluation would increase consumer prices and
inflict further pain on ordinary Russians. The Kremlin fears such a
develop could lead to social unrest.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a business magnate and executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, said Monday that the
government has two to three weeks to lay out ``clear trends in the
country's economy, otherwise the situation may be further
aggravated,'' Interfax news agency reported.

Asian stock markets close mixed

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
the key index in Tokyo rising for the fourth straight session on
expectations the Japanese government may come up with an effective
plan to reform the country's ailing banking industry.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 155.69 points, or
1.02 percent, closing at 15,365.73. The Nikkei index now has gained
a total of 311.13 points in four trading days, including Friday's
77.82-point gain, or 0.51 percent.
	   The Japanese government has promised to unveil a ``total plan''
by Thursday to revive the economy and accelerate reform of the
ailing banking system.
	   Last Friday, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said that they were in negotiations to
merge within a year. Ailing LTCB, Japan's second-largest long-term
credit bank, had been looking for a partner to save it from
problems caused by massive bad loans.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 142.12 yen,
up 0.84 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late Friday
level in New York of 142.44 yen.
	   Philippine stocks closed sharply higher, boosted by
end-of-the-quarter portfolio revaluations on the eve of the
inauguration of President Joseph Estrada.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 36.76 points,
or 2.1 percent, to 1,760.13 after gaining 14.34 points Friday.
	   Shares on the Manila market opened weak but picked up at
midsession, with the index closing just off its high as fund
managers window-dressed their portfolios, traders said.
	   The key index in Bangkok surged 2.3 percent as bargain hunters
picked up stocks with large market capitalization.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 6.22 points to 271.20.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower, pushed down by the
continued weakness of the Japanese currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 147.15 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at
8,460.71. On Friday, the index had slipped 57.97 points.
	   Brokers said share prices opened higher on futures-related
buying, but fell shortly before midday when the Japanese yen
slipped to 142 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Malaysian shares closed generally mixed as the fall in the
Malaysian currency limited buying by local fund managers to boost
the prices of stocks they are holding, dealers said.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks
the prices of 100 key stocks, rose 1.1 percent, or 5.10 points, to
450.77.
	   Meanwhile, the Malaysian ringgit was quoted at 4.1800 to the
dollar, compared with late Friday's 4.0320.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower because of a strong sell-off
in technology stocks. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index
fell 146.23 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,535.73.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on worries of labor trouble
after the government shut down five financially weak banks. The
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 3.30 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 298.60.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed little changed. The benchmark
Straits Times Industrial Index slipped 0.44 point to 1,085.15.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in lackluster
trading. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 16.40 points, or 0.8
percent, to 1,956.84.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with support
coming from a handful of the major industrial stocks. The All
Ordinaries index of share prices rose 11.2 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 2,621.1.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed in thin trading. The
Composite Index edged up 0.361 point to 431.231.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide. The detention
center holds 27 other people awaiting trial.
	   Although authorities considered the death a suicide, tribunal
officials and Dutch police were conducting separate investigations,
Chartier said. Any decisions on tightening security or making
psychiatric evaluations of the others in custody will await the
outcome of those probes, he added.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that as mayor of the eastern Croatia city of Vukovar, he
played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended just last Thursday and the verdict was expected
in two weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges,
faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication and
that Fila asked for a higher dose last Friday because his client
was ``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal. He was under
medication so he could stand the trial,'' Fila said.
	   ``This is awful. I am very shaken up,'' he added. ``For a whole
year we had talked every day on the phone. We spent 15 days
constantly together... I feel as if I'd lost someone close, a
family member.''
	   No suicide note was found.
	   Dokmanovic's wife, son and pregnant daughter were informed of
the suicide, Fila said, and the corpse was taken to a nearby
hospital morgue.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well. Guards were then ordered to
check on him every half-hour, and they last saw him alive at 11:30
p.m. Sunday, Chartier said.

Official: Russia cannot support military action in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia ``cannot support'' NATO military action in
Kosovo and insists on a political solution to the crisis, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Monday.
	   The question of military action became more pressing following
remarks by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke who said that ``we are only
a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo.
	   Russia has stressed that any military action in Kosovo by NATO
or the United States must be approved by the U.N. Security Council.
American officials insist that there is no legal need for that.
	   Russia ``cannot support a military operation against a sovereign
state and member of the United Nations, such as Yugoslavia,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency.
	   He said both Russia and the United States are still trying to
use political methods to end the conflict between Serb forces and
increasingly militant ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Talk about a military operation in the current situation, when
a search for political methods of regulations are going on, has in
our view a largely hypothetical nature,'' Rakhmanin said.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who met with his
Vatican counterpart Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran on Monday, said the
Vatican shares Russia's opposition to use of force in Kosovo.
	   ``We highly appreciate the Vatican's role in resolving various
crisis situations,'' Primakov said. ``The statement by the Pope
that he was and remains against the use of force in Iraq and Kosovo
brings our positions closer'' despite the rift between the Russian
Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches.

Palestinians head toward showdown with Israel over statehood 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Over the past four years,
Palestinians have slowly built up a political entity that looks
very much like a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   There is a 30,000-member police force, a quarrelsome
legislature, myriad government offices and a sparkling new
international airport with everything but airplanes.
	   The success of self-rule can be seen in the little things, too:
glassed-in bus stops in Ramallah, white-and-black street signs in
Arabic and English, metal trash containers and, in some towns,
telephone booths.
	   Yasser Arafat, who has the title of president of the Palestinian
Authority, is promising to make it official at midnight on May 4,
1999.
	   That's when the Oslo accords negotiated between Israel and the
Palestinians expire, at least according to Palestinian
interpretation.
	   ``We are already a state in terms of the land, the people, an
elected government and recognition. What is left is to exercise
sovereignty over the territory by that date,'' said Mahdi Abdel
Hadi, head of the independent Passia think tank in Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted that if the
Palestinians declare statehood on their own, he might annex large
tracts in the West Bank, where the Palestinians govern only 27
percent of the land.
	   ``We will be ready with a response if such an event does occur,
and we are discussing all the options available to us in case the
Palestinians decide to cancel the (Oslo peace) agreement,'' said
David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu.
	   A declaration of statehood might be headed off if the current
impasse over further Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank can
be resolved and final status talks start on the most sensitive
issues, such as Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.
	   Some believe Arafat is using the statehood card to create a
crisis in hopes of a diplomatic rescue from the United States.
	   But both sides are planning for the possibility of a showdown
over statehood.
	   Insiders say Arafat is trying to rally Palestinian dissidents to
his side before next May. Regionally, he is seeking an Arab summit
to map strategy for a declaration of statehood.
	   Arafat, who expects more than 100 nations to recognize a
Palestinian state, hopes international backing will hold Israel in
check and prevent reprisals. He has begun his international
campaign with an effort in the United Nations to upgrade the
observer status the Palestinians now have.
	   At the ground level, there are also preparations. These include
a recent live-fire military drill by Shabiba, the youth wing of
Arafat's Fatah faction, in the Gaza Strip city of Rafah.
	   Israel's outgoing army commander in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Uzi
Dayan, said in an interview Friday that the Palestinians are
training to defend their areas and have prepared their hospitals
for emergencies.
	   Israeli planning also involves military exercises on dealing
with any conflict with Palestinian forces. Israeli soldiers and
tanks trained Thursday in the West Bank near the Jewish settlement
of Maale Amos, although there was no statement about the purpose of
the maneuvers.
	   ``If the question is whether the army has prepared for or
thought about May '99, not just as a date, but as a concept, the
answer is yes,'' Dayan told the Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
	   With a vastly superior military, Israel could easily retake
Palestinian cities. But few in Israel welcome the idea of renewed
occupation or the possibility of a guerrilla war of attrition in
the narrow alleys and sprawling refugee camps.
	   Yoel Singer, who helped draft the Israel-PLO accords as the
Israeli Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, predicts the mix of
Israeli soldiers, Jewish settlers and Palestinian police _ all of
them armed _ will eventually lead to violence.
	   ``Everyone is using the same roads, and there would be no
agreement on the do's and don'ts,'' said Singer, now a lawyer in
Washington. ``This is a recipe for war.''
	   However, many people believe Israel could shut down a fledgling
Palestinian state without firing a shot.
	   Israel collects tens of millions of dollars in custom duties and
taxes for Arafat's autonomy government, and the Palestinians depend
on Israel for jobs, telephone lines, electricity and imported food.
	   ``Israel may retaliate by closing the borders, and that will
affect us deeply,'' said Mohammed Ishtayeh, head of the Palestinian
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
told reporters that Israel holds too many cards to allow for a
truly independent Palestinian state.
	   ``The state can only exist when we have no occupation. Under the
occupation, there is no sense or meaning to any state,'' Yassin
said.

Search teams find more bodies in southern Turkey

<TEXT>
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Search teams found 16 more bodies Monday
in the rubble of this devastated town, bringing the death toll from
an earthquake in southern Turkey to at least 128.
	   Little hope was left for others still feared trapped under
collapsed buildings in Ceyhan, rescue workers said.
	   Relatives of those still missing pleaded with rescue teams to
keep up the search.
	   ``I want my nephew's body,'' shouted Ismail Karayaka, as he was
pushed back by soldiers surrounding the rescue sites.
	   Ceyhan and the nearby city of Adana, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to
the west, were the hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake Saturday.
	   Up to 1,500 people were injured, with 300 people currently being
treated in hospitals, according to the crisis center in Adana.
	   ``I was riding my bicycle when the quake hit. I fell on the
ground and bricks began to fall over me,'' said Sevilay Zenger, an
11-year-old girl, lying in a stretcher in one of the tents in the
garden of Balcali hospital in Adana.
	   ``If God wants, she will get well,'' said Hayriye Yildiz, as she
looked at her unconscious 7-year-old daughter, Ayse, who is
suffering from internal bleeding.
	   Most residents slept outdoors as up to 70 aftershocks hit the
region since Saturday.
	   Nevin Ozsener said sleeping outside didn't bother her. She was
far more concerned about finding the money to rebuild her home.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she may be lucky enough to
benefit from the 250 billion lira (dlrs 1 million) that the
country's second richest business magnate Sakip Sabanci donated to
the disaster-stricken region. Sabanci comes from Adana.
	   Rescue teams pulled out only one survivor, an 11-year-old boy,
in Ceyhan Sunday, 24 hours after being trapped under a collapsed
building. Among those found dead Monday were his father and
18-year-old brother.
	   ``My parents, grandparents and my brother stopped breathing and
passed away,'' Sercan Guvercin told the NTV station from his
hospital bed.
	   The dead include 62 people in Ceyhan, and 44 in Adana, with the
remaining victims living in nearby villages.
	   Most victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums,
generally crowded with Kurds who have fled the war in southeast
Turkey between the army and the autonomy-seeking guerrillas.
	   Ceyhan authorities said they would launch an investigation into
contractors who built buildings that collapsed.
	   At the outskirts of Adana is Incirlik air base, used by U.S. and
British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
	   U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Joel Langton said 35 people affiliated
with the base suffered minor bruises and cuts. He did not give
their nationalities.
	   The quake was slightly felt along the Mediterranean coast of
Turkey, but hotel officials said foreigners at resorts remained
calm.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

Israeli president calls for early elections, Netanyahu says no elections 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu rejecting Weizman's call for early
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu quickly dismissed the idea, saying elections would be
held as scheduled, in 2000.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to
set a new election date. However, the president is very popular,
and his statements carry great moral weight.
	   Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition accused Weizman of
overstepping his authority and siding with the opposition.
	   Polls indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak
of Labor would tie if elections were held now.
	   Weizman said, 5th graf pvs

Iranian delegations in Egypt to improve ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a fresh sign of reconciliation between
key Muslim nations, two Iranian delegations have begun a series of
meetings with Egyptian officials on improving ties.
	   A delegation headed by Fereydoun Vardinejad, the
director-general of Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, met senior
officials in Egyptian news organizations Monday.
	   Vardinejad, who was accompanied by a high-ranking delegation, is
scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Wednesday, said
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   On Sunday, a delegation from Tehran University met Sheik
Mohammed Seyed Tantawi, the head of Al-Azhar, Egypt's highest
center of theology, to discuss relations between the two
institutions.
	   The delegation asked Egypt to provide Iran with Arabic teachers
for Tehran University, Omer Bestawousi, a spokesman for Al-Azhar,
told The Associated Press.
	   The visits followed an overture by President Mohammad Khatami,
who called for better ties between Iran and the Arab world. He made
a similar gesture to the United States.
	   Egypt, a major U.S. ally in the region, has been wary about
Khatami's hints at friendship and repeatedly said that deeds rather
than words will prove Iran's intentions.
	   Relations between the two countries have been strained since the
1979 Islamic Revolution, with Egypt accusing Iran of supporting
radicals trying to overthrow Egypt's secular government. Iran was
angered that Egypt gave refuge to the shah after his overthrow.

Doctors report that giving pregnant women AZT reduces babies with HIV EDITS to conform AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from Monday's conference;
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Giving the drug AZT to pregnant women who have the
HIV virus could dramatically reduce the number of infected babies
born around the world, doctors reported Monday.
	   Still, large hurdles remain in the effort to prevent infants
from getting AIDS, including finding safe alternatives to
breast-feeding.
	   Each day, 1,600 babies are born with HIV, the virus which causes
AIDS. Doctors have known since 1994 that intensive treatment with
AZT during pregnancy can substantially cut the risk that infected
mothers will pass the AIDS virus to their babies during birth.
	   However, at a typical cost of dlrs 800, this treatment is too
expensive for most nations where AIDS poses the biggest risk to the
unborn.
	   But a recent study from Thailand shows that a much shorter
course of treatment just before birth can cut the risk for only
dlrs 80. Bringing this kind of treatment to the developing world is
one of the chief topics at this week's 15th World AIDS Conference,
the largest scientific gathering in the nearly two decades of the
epidemic.
	   Mercy Makhlamena of Durban, South Africa, who lost a child to
AIDS, predicted that poor women will be willing to take medicine
that can lower the risk of passing on HIV to their infants.
	   ``Women will move mountains to have a healthy child,'' she said.
``They will be motivated to enroll if they are told this could save
their babies' lives.''
	   However, Lynne Mofenson of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, said women must
know they are infected before they take AZT, and in most places,
routine testing for HIV is not available.
	   Furthermore, she said, the treatment needs to be part of
prenatal care, something one-third of women around the world do not
receive.
	   One of the most difficult issues is breast-feeding, which
international health organizations have promoted for years over
infant formula.
	   Even if babies escape HIV during childbirth, it can still be
transmitted during breast-feeding. A study to be presented
Wednesday found that three years of breast-feeding carries a 9
percent risk babies will contract the virus.
	   The week-long meeting is likely to involve a mixture of upbeat
reports on new drugs and combinations to protect infected people
and the unborn, along with gloomy assessments of the wildfire
spread of HIV in some parts of Asia, Africa and eastern Europe.
	   During Sunday night's opening session, Dr. Peter Piot, head of
the United Nations AIDS program, cautioned that the epidemic ``is
truly out of control'' in many parts of the world.
	   The spread of the virus has leveled off or declined in wealthy
countries and is slowing as well in some poorer nations, such as
Brazil, Senegal, Thailand, Uganda and parts of Tanzania.
	   ``But together with this news of progress there is news so
devastating that few in this room could have predicted or imagined
it a decade ago,'' Piot said.
	   He noted that one-quarter of the population is infected in
Botswana and Zimbabwe. Four million people have HIV in India, along
with 3 million in South Africa.
	   His organization estimates that 12 million people around the
world have died of AIDS, and another 31 million are alive but
infected. Each day, 16,000 more people contract the virus.
	   Since the last international AIDS conference in Vancouver two
years ago, 10 million people have been infected, said Piot. ``That
represents a collective failure of the world,'' he said.
	   Sunday's opening ceremonies were briefly disrupted by chanting,
horn-blowing demonstrators protesting the high cost of AIDS drugs.
A year's treatment with protease inhibitors and other drugs can
cost dlrs 10,000 or more. More than 90 percent of HIV-infected
people live in parts of the world where these medicines are too
expensive to be widely used.
	   ``We forget that, of the millions of people living with AIDS,
most are condemned to death because of the absence of care,'' said
Peter Lamptey of Family Health International, an anti-AIDS
organization in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

Leaders of U.N. and Commonwealth visit Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The United Nations and Commonwealth
stepped up efforts to bridge the international diplomatic gulf with
Nigeria with visits Monday to the sprawling West African country by
the leaders of the two organizations.
	   Nigerian-born Emeka Anyaoku, the Secretary General of the
Commonwealth, was in his home country for talks with the country's
new military leader Monday morning as U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan was preparing to arrive for talks later in the day.
	   ``My being here is the beginning of the process of
re-integrating Nigeria into the international community,'' Anyaoku
told reporters after arriving late Sunday. ``The whole Commonwealth
and the international community has welcomed the steps so far taken
by the new leader and our hope is that this is just the
beginning.''
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of the
late Gen. Sani Abacha, who took power following a coup in 1993.
Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was succeeded by Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation club of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks after leading playwright
and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in November 1995.
	   British Foreign Office junior minister Tony Lloyd visited the
former British colony last Friday on behalf of the European Union
and praised Abubakar's action in releasing political prisoners and
moving towards restoring democracy.
	   Annan was flying from Vienna late Monday afternoon to Nigeria's
capital of Abuja on the invitation of Abubakar, who promised a
return to civilian rule after assuming power.
	   Annan said he has been ``much encouraged'' by his recent
intensive discussions with Abubakar, as well as the general's early
actions in power, and decided the time is right for such a trip.

Taiwan anxious about warming China-U.S. relations 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Officials tried Monday to allay fears that
a warming of U.S.-Chinese relations following President Bill
Clinton's China visit would harm Taiwan.
	   But scholars and newspapers urged a rethinking of policy to
demonstrate more willingness to pursue reunification
	   Analysts said Taiwan has tried for years to make its sovereignty
disputes with China an international issue by launching a vigorous
campaign for world recognition. China has sought support and
appeared to have gained the upper hand in its effort to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically.
	   ``If we can't cope with the changing situation, we shall be
scared to death again should there be another U.S.-China summit,''
the China Times editorialized.
	   Nervous Taiwanese officials have expressed relief that no new
agreements over Taiwan's status were reached during Clinton's
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Clinton reaffirmed a ``one-China policy,'' and urged Taiwan and
China to resolve their dispute peacefully.
	   Washington is required by law to ensure Taiwan can defend
itself. At a session with Beijing University students Monday,
Clinton stressed that U.S. weapons sales should not be an obstacle
to reunification of Taiwan with the mainland.
	   China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province to be reunified with
the mainland by force, if necessary. It is the seat of the
Nationalist government that fled the Communist takeover of the
mainland in 1949.
	   Taiwan had feared Clinton might formalize the U.S. position of
not supporting Taiwan's independence.
	   ``It's been our policy as well not to support independence,''
said Shen Lu-shuun, a Foreign Ministry official in charge of North
American affairs. ``But we believe it is something the United
States should have discussed with us, instead of going there to
discuss with the Chinese communists.''
	   ``The United States has demonstrated its good will,'' Shen said.
``But some people acted as if President Clinton ever made those
pledges in the public, our country would collapse.''
	   Foreign Minister Jason Hu also tried to allay public fears.
However, he told state radio that China may maneuver Clinton into
stronger reiterations of U.S. pledges over Taiwan at his remaining
public appearances.
	   Some scholars said Taiwan should take more concrete actions to
prove it is not moving toward independence. Wariness over that
issue prompted China to freeze dialogue with Taiwan three years ago
following Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United
States.
	   Political scientist Chang Ling-cheng said China has stalled on
resuming the talks because of a lack of assurance that Taiwan is
sincerely pursuing reunification.
	   ``The United States has already slanted toward China's position,
so there was no need for Clinton to reiterate them in public,'' she
said.
	   Shaw Yu-ming, head of the official Institute of International
Relations, said Taiwan, with its democracy and freedoms, ``remains
Washington's ace in the hole.'' But Shaw said Taiwan should do
more.
	   ``We must not count on an arms race,'' he said. ``What shall we
do in case we stop getting new arms supplies one day?''

Reactor stopped at Ukraine's Yuzhnaya plant 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The reactor No. 2 at the Yuzhnaya nuclear
power plant in southern Ukraine was shut down for planned repairs,
officials said Monday.
	   The reactor will be undergoing repair works until October,
according to the state nuclear energy company Energoatom. No
dangerous radiation leaks were registered during the closure of the
reactor.
	   The Yuzhnaya plant, Ukraine's second-largest, has three
pressurized-water VVER-1000 reactors. The plant's reactor No. 1 is
also undergoing repairs planned to be completed until mid-July.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants have a total of 14 reactors,
with seven currently being repaired, said Energoatom. The former
Soviet republic's nuclear power plants accounted for about a half
of the country's electricity production last year.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Soldiers shot and killed two Russian army
deserters in Russia's north on Sunday, a Defense Ministry spokesman
said Monday. Another deserter was captured and a fourth escaped.
	   The four men were under guard in a prison stockade in the town
of Pechenga, 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) north of Moscow near
Russia's border with Norway. One managed to disarm his guard,
wounded him, and freed the other three.
	   The men fled with stolen AK-47s and pistols, but by Monday
morning a search party had surrounded them, the spokesman told The
Associated Press.
	   After the men refused to give up their weapons, two were killed
in a shootout. The army search party arrested one deserter, but is
still searching for the fourth man, the spokesman said.

Outgoing army commander: Israel's military doctrine is outdated 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's military doctrine of deterrence is
outdated and might prove inadequate to prevent an attack on the
Jewish state, the outgoing deputy commander of the armed forces
warned Monday.
	   Israel is considered to have the strongest army in the Middle
East, backed by what is widely believed to be a nuclear weapons
arsenal.
	   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, the deputy armed forces chief of staff,
said Monday that Israel's policy of deterrence is not sufficient in
the age of non-conventional weapons.
	   ``We boast that we are the kind of power that others would not
dare provoke because everyone knows we would respond to an attack
in such a way that it would not be worthwhile for them (Israel's
enemies),'' Vilnai said.
	   ``Today one can say with full confidence, and I am not revealing
any secret, that our doctrine and security position have not been
updated and could probably not respond to the threats developing
against Israel,'' Vilnai said.
	   Vilnai, the leading contender for chief of staff, was passed
over for the position last month when the post went to Shaul Mofaz,
a long-time friend of the defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai.

Sino-U.S. effort opening children's hospital in Shanghai 
</HEADLINE>

By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In an unassuming pink-tiled building, an
ambitious Sino-U.S. partnership is creating China's first high-tech
children's hospital, equipped with the latest medical equipment and
ready to teach Chinese doctors the newest medical advances.
	   Project Hope, a U.S. health-oriented charity, and the Shanghai
government have spent some dlrs 100 million equipping the Shanghai
Children's Medical Center and sending doctors, nurses and other
staff abroad for training. U.S. specialists are to visit for a
program of seminars with Chinese doctors from throughout the
country.
	   ``This hospital will see 250,000 children a year, but its major
influence will be in training doctors and spreading pediatric
knowledge throughout China,'' said William Walsh, president of
Project Hope.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will
participate with children from Shanghai in a ribbon-cutting for the
facility, which started treating patients June 1.
	   The hospital grew out of a Project Hope training program in the
1980s for Chinese pediatric heart surgeons run by Dr. Richard
Jonas, a specialist at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School. After training, the surgeons raised the survival
rate of their patients from 65 percent to 97 percent, and began
taking on harder cases, according to Project Hope.
	   ``We said, `This is going so well, let's have a whole hospital
like this,''' Walsh said.
	   Although Project Hope and corporate donors are supplying
equipment and specialized skills, the city of Shanghai will pay for
two-thirds of the project by supplying the land, building and
staff, as well as operating costs, Walsh said.
	   The 38,000-square-meter (410,000-square-foot) hospital is set
amid lawns on a 5-hectare (13-acre) plot in Pudong, across the
Huangpu River from downtown Shanghai.
	   The 250-bed facility's light, airy building and latest equipment
contrast sharply with Chinese hospitals where staffs lack supplies,
struggle with aging equipment and see patients in dingy, noisy open
wards.
	   Mickey and Minnie Mouse decals adorn waiting room walls and
paintings by Shanghai schoolchildren line the hallways.
	   On hand full time to train the 400-member staff are Dr. Frieda
Law, a pediatrician from Melbourne, Australia, and nurse Maggie
Kong of Hong Kong. Over time, the staff is expected to expand to
1,200 doctors, nurses, pharmacists, X-ray technicians and others.
	   Equipment worth more than dlrs 23 million was donated by General
Electric, Hewlett Packard, Sony, Kodak and other U.S., Japanese and
Hong Kong companies. It includes the most advanced X-ray,
ultrasound and other diagnostic equipment.
	   Carpenters are still installing a dlrs 1 million
magnetic-resonance imaging machine that produces internal images of
the body using a 10-ton, tunnel-shaped magnet that was wrestled
into place by 20 Chinese workmen.
	   ``They're starting out state of the art _ 100 percent,'' said
Frank Watts, an engineer from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, Tennessee, who is helping to set up the equipment.
	   Teaching facilities include a 260-seat auditorium with a huge
television screen linked to an operating room to let surgeons
demonstrate new techniques.
	   The hospital will be part of Shanghai's general medical system,
treating any sick children, as well as difficult and unusual cases
sent from other provinces.
	   On a recent Sunday, doctors in the clinic were attending to an
8-year-old boy recovering from pneumonia, a 3-year-old boy with a
broken arm and a screaming toddler with bronchitis.
	   ``In this hospital, the equipment is very advanced and we can do
a lot of things, but the price (to patients) is still the same, so
they can come here and get better service,'' said Dr. Zhu Ming,
chief of radiology.
	   The hospital is the biggest undertaking so far by Project Hope,
whose operations in 28 countries range from AIDS education in
Africa to training hospital administrators in Eastern Europe, Walsh
said.
	   While much of China still lacks basic medical care, Zhu said
Project Hope took the right step by giving the country one
high-tech center instead of more rural clinics.
	   ``Basic medical treatment is very important, but we also need a
higher level. Without a high-level hospital, the general level
cannot rise,'' he said.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was found hanging on the
hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N. court's detention unit in
The Hague shortly after midnight, tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said.
	   It was the first time a suspect being held in the tribunal's
high-security cell block has committed suicide. The detention
center holds 27 other people awaiting trial.
	   Although authorities considered the death a suicide, tribunal
officials and Dutch police were conducting separate investigations,
Chartier said. Any decisions on tightening security or making
psychiatric evaluations of the others in custody will await the
outcome of those probes, he added.
	   Dokmanovic was awaiting a verdict in his war crimes trial on
charges that as mayor of the eastern Croatia city of Vukovar, he
played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   The trial ended just last Thursday and the verdict was expected
in two weeks. Dokmanovic, who had pleaded innocent to all charges,
faced up to life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication and
that Fila asked for a higher dose last Friday because his client
was ``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal. He was under
medication so he could stand the trial,'' Fila said.
	   ``This is awful. I am very shaken up,'' he added. ``For a whole
year we had talked every day on the phone. We spent 15 days
constantly together... I feel as if I'd lost someone close, a
family member.''
	   No suicide note was found.
	   Dokmanovic's wife, son and pregnant daughter were informed of
the suicide, Fila said, and the corpse was taken to a nearby
hospital morgue.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic had complained to guards Sunday
afternoon that he was not feeling well. Guards were then ordered to
check on him every half-hour, and they last saw him alive at 11:30
p.m. Sunday, Chartier said.

Fired pilots file suit against Philippine Airlines to recover jobs 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In an attempt to regain their jobs,
hundreds of Philippine Airlines pilots who staged a devastating
22-day strike accused the airline Monday of shutting them out in an
illegal lockout.
	   The pilots' union also sought to prevent PAL from hiring
replacements, including Indonesian and Malaysian pilots.
	   PAL fired 620 striking pilots after they ignored a labor
department order to return to work by June 9. The union was
protesting an airline plan to retire some pilots with 20 years of
service or 20,000 flight hours, which is allowed under a collective
bargaining agreement.
	   In a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations
Commission, a labor department agency, the union claimed the
strikers complied with the order when they ended their strike
Friday and tried to return to work.
	   The union said it was PAL that had violated the order by
refusing to accept back the pilots, one of the order's conditions.
	   PAL officials said they would be allowed back only if they
applied as new applicants.
	   A back-to-work order normally takes effect when it is served to
the union's legal counsel, but the counsel repeatedly foiled the
labor department's attempts to deliver the document until last
Thursday.
	   In the interim, the labor secretary ruled that the order had
been effectively served to the union in meetings with union
officials and in a newspaper advertisement.
	   The strike, which began June 5, worsened the financial
difficulties of Asia's oldest airline, bringing it to the brink of
closure. Airline officials say the strike caused more than 2
billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue.
	   At the height of the walkout, the airline laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and stave off
more losses, causing the airline's flight attendants and ground
personnel to threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL said more employees may be laid off under an airline
rehabilitation plan that calls for a leaner work force, disposal of
40 out of 54 planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its
routes and sale of some subsidiaries. PAL says it now needs only
200 pilots.

World Cup: Nigeria's Super Eagles peaked too soon 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Clearly, Nigeria peaked too soon.
	   After a boisterous start to France '98, rallying twice from
one-goal deficits to shock favored Spain and then holding off
Bulgaria to clinch Group D with a game to spare, the Super Eagles
tailed off considerably.
	   A loss to Paraguay was dismissed as a half-hearted effort by a
lineup filled with reserves in a meaningless group match, but there
was no denying that Nigeria was in over its head against Denmark in
the round of 16.
	   The 4-1 thumping absorbed from the Danes at the Stade de France
on Sunday night exposed the two glaring weaknesses of a squad some
thought could bring Africa its first World Cup title: defense and
discipline.
	   ``As a team we broke down,'' 'keeper Peter Rufai said. ``We
really lacked a lot of organization.''
	   That missing cohesion is in part attributable to the short
amount of time coach Bora Milutinovic had with the squad. He was
hired in December and didn't have the full complement of players _
none of whom plays in Nigeria _ all together until about two months
before arriving in France.
	   The only coach to take four different countries to the second
round _ after Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica in 1990 and the United
States in 1994 _ Milutinovic was never able to imbue the side with
defensive consistency or tactical discipline.
	   ``A coach would really need one year to understand our
players,'' defender Ben Iroha said, ``and Bora only had months.''
	   Even after trailing 2-0 within 12 minutes of the start against
Denmark, the Nigerians were losing balls by trying heel passes or
fancy dribbling when the simple pass might have been the better
option.
	   ``We did not play intelligently,'' midfielder Sunday Oliseh
acknowledged.
	   Nigeria bore the weight of expectations, having made it to the
second round at USA '94 and following that up by taking the 1996
Olympic title at Atlanta with a core of players on the roster here.
	   It was supposed to bring its high-flying, lightning-quick
attacking style to France, but only showed glimpses of it, for
about 20 minutes against Spain and even less against Bulgaria.
	   Four years ago, Nigeria's defense let it down in the waning
seconds against second-round foe Italy. Leading 1-0 and playing
with a man-advantage, Nigeria allowed Roberto Baggio to tie the
match at the end of regulation and win it in extra time.
	   The mental breakdown came right after kickoff against both
Denmark and Paraguay, which slotted in the quickest World Cup goal
since 1982 _ 51 seconds after kickoff.
	   ``From the 1994 loss, we learned how to concentrate in the last
15 minutes of a match,'' Oliseh said. ``Obviously, we forgot how to
concentrate for the first 15 minutes and paid badly for it.''

Hero of anti-Communist uprising admits collaborating with Securitate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The cleric whose opposition to Nicolae
Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolution against the communist
dictator acknowledged on Monday that he collaborated with
Ceausescu's feared secret police.
	   Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian bishop of the Reformed
Church, said in a statement that he was forced to inform for the
Securitate secret police after years of harassment. He called
himself ``a victim of the Securitate.''
	   Although about a fourth of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, Toekes' revelation was
surprising, considering the key role he played in bringing down
Ceausescu and his communist regime.
	   A plan by communist authorities to forcibly move Toekes from the
city of Timisoara to a village led to protest, first by ethnic
Hungarians, then by Romanians as well. The protests quickly changed
into anti-Ceausescu demonstrations, then into the anti-communist
revolt that swept Ceausescu from power. He and his wife, Elena were
executed in December 1989, after a summary and secret trial.
	   ``As a result of constraints, I had to write hundreds of pages
of declarations, mainly being obliged to write as they dictated to
me,'' said Toekes in a statement. He offered no details but said he
had never harmed anyone.
	   Toekes' revelation was the latest in a series of shock exposes.
The health minister and a senior member of the anti-communist
Peasant Party - the main party in power _ resigned last week after
acknowledging similar collaboration.
	   The 125 million files belonging to the Securitate are in the
custody of its successor, the Romanian Information Service. It is
unlikely that these files will be made public, but leaks on
collaborators are relatively frequent.

Cyprus rescues 115 aboard drifting ship, two reported dead days, quotes, ADDS byline.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with two reported dead, shift adrift for
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday aboard a ship adrift for days off the island's coast. Two
passengers reportedly died of thirst and were thrown overboard.
	   The ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol early
Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were taken to a hospital for treatment for dehydration
and exposure, a hospital official said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for days before it was spotted by a Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Sierra Leone,
Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Earlier, two other African passengers died of thirst and their
bodies were thrown overboard, Suheib Anwar Saleh, a 25-year-old
Iraqi passenger, told The Associated Press.
	   The ship, with a crew of six, was officially headed for Libya,
but Saleh said passengers were destined for Crete or Italy and paid
as much as dlrs 2,400 for the journey.
	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.

Iranian journalists call for lifting of ban on popular paper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 200 journalists have asked Iran's
president to intervene on behalf of a popular Iranian newspaper
whose licence to publish was revoked, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency said Monday.
	   The journalists wrote President Mohammad Khatami an open letter
asking him to try to reverse the court order which canceled the
publication licence of the Jameah newspaper June 10.
	   The license of Jameah, or ``Society,'' was revoked after its
editor was convicted of defamation. The decision was appealed.
	   In their letter, the 220 journalists ``expressed deep concern
over the court's ruling.'' They said the courts should distinguish
between newspapers and their publishers.
	   ``One of the bitter realities in the history of the press in the
country, especially the newspapers, is their short lifespan. This
is brought about by a lack of distinction between the corporate
identity of the dailies and that of their publishers,'' the agency
quoted the letter as saying.
	   Another liberal newspaper, Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Daily Report,''
stopped publication earlier this month after the government Press
Supervisory Board charged it with violating press ethics. The
Justice Ministry is reviewing the complaint.
	   The two moves are seen as a setback for press freedoms
introduced since Khatami, a moderate cleric, took office in August.
	   Jameah has not stopped publishing and it will continue to do so
until the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, in charge of
licencing newspapers, officially informs it of the revocation.
	   Jameah, an afternoon paper with a circulation of 200,000 copies,
sells out within hours.
	   Jameah's editor, Hamid Reza Jalaipur was accused of publishing
``insults and lies.'' The substance of the charge was not
disclosed, but state-run television has said that the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps had accused the paper of falsely
publishing that its commander was opposed to liberalization.
	   A court banned Jalaipur from working in a similar position for
one year and fined him 16 million rials (dlrs 3,500).

VW says no longer plans to revive Horch or Bugatti nameplates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Having won the battle for Rolls-Royce
and with a deal for Lamborghini in the works, Volkswagen said
Monday that it was shelving plans to revive two other luxury car
nameplates: Horch and Bugatti.
	   VW spokesman Kurt Rippholz said reviving one or both historic
brand names had been under consideration while VW was competing
with its German rival BMW for Rolls-Royce and Bentley.
	   ``With the execution of the purchase of both English brands,
(it) is no longer relevant for the foreseeable future,'' he said.
	   VW's upscale Audi subsidiary owns the rights to the Horch name,
but would have had to purchase the Bugatti rights.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, has been moving into the
luxury market with the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Co. for 1.25
billion marks (about dlrs 700 million).
	   This month it also announced Audi has signed a letter of intent
to buy Lamborghini for a reported dlrs 40 million.

One protester shot dead, four wounded in East Timor during EU visit foreign minister, grafs 16-17 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS bishop calling for calm, graf 10; comment from Indonesian
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Security officers shot one protester to
death and wounded four others near a cathedral in East Timor on
Monday as a European Union diplomatic team held talks with a
Catholic bishop.
	   Witnesses said the plainclothes officers opened fire when their
van was mobbed by demonstrators soon after the ambassadors from
Britain, the Netherlands and Austria arrived in the town of Baucau,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili.
	   It was the second time in three days that military personnel had
killed a pro-independence protester in the troubled territory.
	   About 5,000 demonstrators, who want independence from Indonesia,
had rallied in front of Baucau's St. Antonio Cathedral.
	   Vilidiu Gusmao, 32, a lay member of the church's Justice and
Peace Commission, said the crowd cheered when two vans carrying the
Jakarta-based envoys arrived for talks with Bishop Bacilio Do
Nascimento.
	   However, the situation turned violent when a third van arrived
later with several security agents, carrying automatic weapons.
	   ``The people got angry because the security agents came here
with guns,'' Gusmao said.
	   He said several shots were fired directly into a mob that had
surrounded the vehicle and pounded and kicked its doors and
windows.
	   Hundreds of onlookers fled into the cathedral or jumped over a
wall to take shelter when the shots rang out.
	   The agents ran to a nearby army post and the bishop later called
on the crowd to disperse peacefully as the dead victim was taken
into the cathedral.
	   The dead man was identified as Orlando Marcelinu da Costa, 35.
	   Three other men and one woman were hospitalized with gunshot
wounds.
	   Two more people were injured when they were hit by the besieged
van as it tried to force its way through the crowd.
	   ``It is true that one man was shot after protesters attacked
some security agents,'' said a military intelligence officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate comment from the European diplomats.
	   Earlier, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had called for
further negotiations rather than demonstrations.
	   ``Violence and protests won't resolve the problem,'' he said.
``It is better to find a peaceful solution that can be accepted by
the majority of East Timorese as well as foreign countries and the
United Nations.''
	   Thousands of pro-independence protesters marched through East
Timor's capital earlier Monday, demanding a referendum on
Indonesian control over the territory and the release of an
imprisoned rebel leader.
	   It was the fourth straight day of demonstrations in East Timor
by groups that either support Indonesian rule or want greater
independence.
	   The territory's governor called for calm.
	   Hundreds of soldiers with automatic weapons and police armed
with shields and tear gas canisters stood by as a procession of
protesters, stretching five kilometers (3 miles), moved peacefully
from the University of East Timor through Dili's streets.
	   Shops and offices were closed. Some storekeepers said they were
worried that the march, organized by college students, might turn
violent.
	   The demonstration took place as three Jakarta-based ambassadors
continued with a three-day fact-finding tour on behalf of the
European Union. Rival groups have clashed on several occasions in
recent days in attempts to impress the visiting envoys.
	   Monday's protesters held up pictures of guerrilla chief Xanana
Gusmao, demanding that he be released from a Jakarta prison where
he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian forces.
	   The crowd also called for a ballot to determine the future of
the former Portuguese colony, invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and
annexed by Jakarta the following year.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered to free Gusmao and
to grant special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory. But he has
ruled out any referendum.
	   The United Nations and many other governments don't recognize
the legitimacy of Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island,
which has endured more than two decades of guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses.
	   Meanwhile, East Timor Gov. Abilio Soares asked security
personnel Monday to take stern but restrained action against
violent troublemakers.
	   On Saturday, rival protesters clashed in front of a Catholic
church in Manatuto, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Dili.
Troops opened fire when fighting broke out among pro-independence
and pro-Indonesian groups, and one man was killed.

Singapore unveils measures to boost economy as growth dwindles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hoping to keep the Asian crisis at bay and fend
off recession, Singapore unveiled much-anticipated plans Monday to
stimulate the economy as growth continues to dwindle.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced
wide-ranging special economic measures worth 2 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion) to help business cope with the economic
downturn.
	   He also announced a reduced growth estimate for the year of 0.5
to 1.5 percent, much lower than the previously optimistic
government forecast but still above many private economists'
predictions for mild recession.
	   The government's earlier estimate of 2.5 to 4.5 percent growth
was made in February before the full impact of the Asian crisis was
apparent.
	   ``Now that developments are clearer, and we have revised our
growth forecasts downward, we are ready to act to mitigate the
impact of the regional troubles on our economy,'' Hu said.
	   He said the package aims to ``cut business costs and to
stimulate the economy'' amid prospects for ``continued turbulence
and uncertainty'' in the region.
	   The measures will result in the government's first budget
deficit in more than a decade. Including revised revenue estimates,
the current budget will have a deficit of 800 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 468 million), compared with the originally planned
surplus of 2.68 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.57 billion).
	   To help businesses, the government introduced tax rebates; cuts
in fees and surcharges; lower commercial property rentals;
increased government funding for some business enterprises; and
reduced port, telecommunication and electricity tariffs. It also
encouraged moderation of wages.
	   Hu also announced accelerated spending for several large
infrastructure projects, such as the country's national rail
system. The government also will introduce additional enterprises,
including a number of projects for educational facilities and
industrial developments.
	   In addition, it plans to boost the ailing property market by
suspending the sale of almost all land for private residential use,
government-subsidized condos and commercial developments for the
rest of 1998 and 1999.
	   Hu said the government will resume the supply of land when the
property market recovers. It also will suspend some developers'
levies and defer stamp duties for purchasers of property.
	   In the financial sector, the government said it will help banks
with bad loans by increasing tax deductions allowed on their
provisions, and it will suspend stamp duties on stock market
transactions.
	   Singapore was suffering because ``the external economic
environment has deteriorated significantly ... (and) the regional
economic situation has worsened,'' Hu said.
	   Citing recent instability in Indonesia, recession in various
Asian economies, the depreciating Japanese currency and other
global economic patterns, he said Singapore's problems have been
``largely outside our control.''
	   Singapore's key electronics and finance sectors have ``weakened
significantly'' as trade slowed. Initial figures for the second
quarter show growth slackening to 1.9 percent.
	   Hu said that in the second half of the year, the economy would
remain very weak, dragging growth for the year's gross domestic
product close to nil.

Six civilians, nine rebels dead in weekend clashes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Clashes between the army and rebels in
western Uganda killed four civilians and nine rebels, and caused
dozens of residents to flee, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The fighting took place as several hundred religious and civic
leaders met in the troubled northern Gulu region to call on the
government to negotiate with rebels.
	   Two girls, aged 7 and 9, and two other civilians were killed
Friday in the crossfire between the Ugandan army and about 80
rebels they were pursuing in the Kichwamba region, 300 kilometers
(190 miles) west of the capital, Kampala, the New Vision newspaper
said.
	   The rebels belonged to the Allied Democratic Forces, who killed
at least 80 people and abducted 100 more in an attack June 8 on a
technical school in the same region.
	   That attack was the bloodiest carried out by the ADF since it
began operating two years ago, often abducting students and
children to beef up their ranks.
	   Lt. Nasur Kibirige, a military spokesman, told the newspaper
that three of the nine rebels were killed in the Bigando village.
Another six rebels' bodies were counted at the nearby village of
Ruhita, the newspaper said.
	   The New Vision said two more people were killed in a rebel
ambush in northwestern Arua, near the Sudanese border.
	   The attack was launched by the West Nile Bank Front. That rebel
group was reported to have been destroyed when the Sudan People's
Liberation Front captured 100 of its top fighters and leaders in
early 1997.
	   In Gulu, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of Kampacks again inside
the camps for displaced people.
	   ``Death, hunger, suffering, displacement, break up of families
and incapacitation of our people is everywhere and everyone is
traumatized,'' the statement said. ``Peace talks with the LRA
should be implemented immediately.''
	   The statement condemned the LRA for using children in the
fighting, but blamed the army for failing to end the conflict.
	   President Yoweri Museveni has insisted that he will continue to
fight the LRA, although he acknowledged last week that his army
suffers from indiscipline, drunkenness and laziness, allowing rebel
activities to continue unabated.

Ivorian officials confirm crash death of U.N. envoy to Angola 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Government officials have officially
confirmed the deaths of all eight people _ including the U.N. envoy
to Angola _ aboard a plane that crashed Friday night in dense
forest surrounded by swamps east of Ivory Coast's commercial
capital.
	   A statement issued late Sunday by the Ivory Coast government
said the envoy, Alioune Blondin Beye, and seven others perished in
the small charter plane which crashed on a stretch of dry land
surrounded by expansive marshlands shortly before the plane was due
to land at the Abidjan international airport.
	   There were no survivors.
	   Ivory Coast President Henri Konan Bedie paid tribute to Beye in
an open letter to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   ``His death is a great loss not only for Africa, but the
international civil service,'' Bedie said.
	   The number of people on board the aircraft had earlier been
disputed, with Ivorian authorities variously saying seven or eight,
while aviation officials in Togo saying seven.
	   Searchers recovered six personal identity documents, including
one belonging to 59-year-old Beye.
	   The other five documents bore the names of Senegalese journalist
Moktar Gueye, Chad citizen Beadegar Dessandde, Togolese foreign
ministry official Koffi Adoyi and two people of unidentified
nationality _ Jason McNeill and Ibikunle Williams.
	   Aside from Beye, five of the passengers were believed to be
members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, and the other two
were pilots of the South African-registered charter plane.
	   Searchers reached the wreckage on Sunday afternoon, more than 36
hours after the plane went down, after trekking through water, mud
and tangled forest.
	   Mangled body parts, luggage and personal identity documents were
littered in the wreckage. Pieces of the aircraft continued to
smolder in the grass and bushes.
	   Beye, a well-respected diplomat from Mali, is credited with
leading U.N. peace efforts in Angola, which has suffered from an
intermittent civil war since independence from Portugal in 1975.

Iranian delegations in Egypt to improve ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a fresh sign of reconciliation between
key Muslim nations, two Iranian delegations have begun a series of
meetings with Egyptian officials on improving ties.
	   A delegation headed by Fereydoun Vardinejad, the
director-general of Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, met senior
officials from Egyptian news organizations Monday.
	   Vardinejad, who was accompanied by a high-ranking delegation, is
scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Wednesday, said
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   On Sunday, a delegation from Tehran University met Sheik
Mohammed Seyed Tantawi, the head of Al-Azhar, Egypt's highest
center of theology, to discuss relations between the two
institutions.
	   The delegation asked Egypt to provide Iran with Arabic teachers
for Tehran University, Omer Bestawousi, a spokesman for Al-Azhar,
told The Associated Press.
	   The visits followed an overture by President Mohammad Khatami,
who called for better ties between Iran and the Arab world. He made
a similar gesture to the United States.
	   Egypt, a major U.S. ally in the region, has been wary about
Khatami's hints at friendship and repeatedly said that deeds rather
than words will prove Iran's intentions.
	   Relations between the two countries have been strained since the
1979 Islamic Revolution, with Egypt accusing Iran of supporting
radicals trying to overthrow Egypt's secular government. Iran was
angered that Egypt gave refuge to the shah after his overthrow.

Singapore unveils measures to boost economy as growth dwindles 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS byline
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hoping to keep the Asian crisis at bay and fend
off recession, Singapore unveiled much-anticipated plans Monday to
stimulate the economy as growth continues to dwindle.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced
wide-ranging special economic measures worth 2 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion) to help business cope with the economic
downturn.
	   He also announced a reduced growth estimate for the year of 0.5
to 1.5 percent, much lower than the previously optimistic
government forecast but still above many private economists'
predictions for mild recession.
	   The government's earlier estimate of 2.5 to 4.5 percent growth
was made in February before the full impact of the Asian crisis was
apparent.
	   ``Now that developments are clearer, and we have revised our
growth forecasts downward, we are ready to act to mitigate the
impact of the regional troubles on our economy,'' Hu said.
	   He said the package aims to ``cut business costs and to
stimulate the economy'' amid prospects for ``continued turbulence
and uncertainty'' in the region.
	   The measures will result in the government's first budget
deficit in more than a decade. Including revised revenue estimates,
the current budget will have a deficit of 800 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 468 million), compared with the originally planned
surplus of 2.68 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.57 billion).
	   To help businesses, the government introduced tax rebates; cuts
in fees and surcharges; lower commercial property rentals;
increased government funding for some business enterprises; and
reduced port, telecommunication and electricity tariffs. It also
encouraged moderation of wages.
	   Hu also announced accelerated spending for several large
infrastructure projects, such as the country's national rail
system. The government also will introduce additional enterprises,
including a number of projects for educational facilities and
industrial developments.
	   In addition, it plans to boost the ailing property market by
suspending the sale of almost all land for private residential use,
government-subsidized condos and commercial developments for the
rest of 1998 and 1999.
	   Hu said the government will resume the supply of land when the
property market recovers. It also will suspend some developers'
levies and defer stamp duties for purchasers of property.
	   In the financial sector, the government said it will help banks
with bad loans by increasing tax deductions allowed on their
provisions, and it will suspend stamp duties on stock market
transactions.
	   Singapore was suffering because ``the external economic
environment has deteriorated significantly ... (and) the regional
economic situation has worsened,'' Hu said.
	   Citing recent instability in Indonesia, recession in various
Asian economies, the depreciating Japanese currency and other
global economic patterns, he said Singapore's problems have been
``largely outside our control.''
	   Singapore's key electronics and finance sectors have ``weakened
significantly'' as trade slowed. Initial figures for the second
quarter show growth slackening to 1.9 percent.
	   Hu said that in the second half of the year, the economy would
remain very weak, dragging growth for the year's gross domestic
product close to nil.

Russian impeachment committee plans summers sessions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliament commission set up to consider an
impeachment motion against President Boris Yeltsin will work
through the summer, its chairman said Monday.
	   ``We are going to work all summer regardless of whether some of
the deputies are formally on vacation,'' commission chairman Vadim
Filimonov said, according to an ITAR-Tass report.
	   Several attempts since 1994 to impeach Yeltsin have collapsed
and the latest initiative is also unlikely to succeed.
	   Communists and their allies in the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, have accused Yeltsin of several transgressions,
including instigating the collapse of the Soviet Union, launching
the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's economy.
	   Filimonov said he hoped to commission would finish its work by
autumn.
	   The commission will consider whether to prepare an indictment
against Yeltsin. If it does, a two-thirds majority in parliament's
lower house will be needed to launch an impeachment motion. Then it
would have to win confirmation from both the Constitutional and
Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the
Federation Council.

Hero of anti-Communist uprising admits collaborating with Securitate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The cleric whose opposition to Nicolae
Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolution against the communist
dictator acknowledged on Monday that he collaborated with
Ceausescu's feared secret police.
	   Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian bishop of the Reformed
Church, said in a statement that he was forced to inform for the
Securitate secret police after years of harassment. He called
himself ``a victim of the Securitate.''
	   Although about a fourth of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, Toekes' revelation was
surprising, considering the key role he played in bringing down
Ceausescu and his communist regime.
	   A plan by communist authorities to forcibly move Toekes from the
city of Timisoara to a village led to protest, first by ethnic
Hungarians, then by Romanians as well. The protests quickly changed
into anti-Ceausescu demonstrations, then into the anti-communist
revolt that swept Ceausescu from power. He and his wife, Elena were
executed in December 1989, after a summary and secret trial.
	   ``As a result of constraints, I had to write hundreds of pages
of declarations, mainly being obliged to write as they dictated to
me,'' said Toekes in a statement. He offered no details but said he
had never harmed anyone.
	   Toekes' revelation was the latest in a series of surprises. The
health minister and a senior member of the anti-communist Peasant
Party - the main party in power _ resigned last week after
acknowledging similar collaboration.
	   The 125 million files belonging to the Securitate are in the
custody of its successor, the Romanian Information Service. It is
unlikely that these files will be made public, but leaks on
collaborators are relatively frequent.

Israeli president calls for early elections, Netanyahu says no 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes in grafs 2-3, 11-12, 18-19
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu quickly dismissed the idea, saying elections would be
held as scheduled, in 2000, and insisting the Palestinians _ not
Israel _ were responsible for the impasse.
	   ``Peace is very, very close _ if the Palestinians do their
part,'' he told reporters.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to
set a new election date. However, the president is very popular and
his statements carry great moral weight.
	   Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition accused Weizman of
overstepping his authority and siding with the opposition.
	   Polls indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak
of Labor would tie if elections were held now.
	   Weizman said Monday he feared for the future of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, which have been stalled for the
past 15 months over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   He also noted that Netanyahu has backed off the idea of holding
a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``The peace process is limping and has hit several pitfalls in
recent months,'' Weizman said. ``If he does not conduct a
referendum, in my opinion the next solution needs to be elections.
The sooner we go to elections the sooner we will know what the
public thinks.''
	   Opinion polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Netanyahu, while refusing to go into specifics, said Monday that
Israel has made compromises in the past eight weeks, and that only
a ``small gap that in my opinion can be breached easily'' remains
on the scope of the withdrawal.
	   He said the Palestinians have failed to make concrete
commitments to fulfilling their obligations _ such as reducing the
size of their police force, collecting illegal weapons, and
annulling sections of the Palestinian National Covenant calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, meanwhile, said Monday
the Palestinians have rejected a U.S. proposal to water down the
original withdrawal plan submitted by Washington in January.
	   Under the new proposal, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of
the land. However, in 3 percent of that area, the Palestinians
would only have restricted authority, particularly in granting
building permits.
	   Erekat said he rejected the proposal when he met two weeks ago
with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, and the Israeli
Cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh. The Palestinians also turned down a
U.S. request to hold more meetings with the Israelis.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had assured the
Palestinians that the original U.S. plan would not be diluted,
Erekat said. ``We see they are trying to change it which is ...
absolutely incomprehensible,'' Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The negotiator complained that the Clinton administration was
not pressing Netanyahu to make a decision. ``They (the Americans)
said they would continue their efforts to get the Israeli yes,''
Erekat said. ``As long as they keep giving Netanyahu the extra
mile, he will keep wasting time.''
	   Netanyahu said Monday he would not give in to American pressure.
	   ``No pressure and no person will sway me,'' he said.

Shen Lyu-shun in graf 12, RECASTS his quote in graf 13; UPDATES

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Officials tried Monday to allay fears that
a warming of U.S.-Chinese relations following President Bill
Clinton's China visit would harm Taiwan.
	   But scholars and newspapers urged a rethinking of policy to
demonstrate more willingness to pursue reunification with China.
	   Clinton's visit benefits peace and stability in the region,
President Lee Teng-hui told a Cabinet meeting, according to Foreign
Minister Jason Hu.
	   Taiwan needs to consider additional measures to promote
``positive interaction'' with China, Hu quoted Lee as saying,
without providing details.
	   Analysts said Taiwan has tried for years to make its sovereignty
disputes with China an international issue by launching a vigorous
campaign for world recognition. China has sought support and
appeared to have gained the upper hand in its effort to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically.
	   ``If we can't cope with the changing situation, we shall be
scared to death again should there be another U.S.-China summit,''
the China Times editorialized.
	   Nervous Taiwanese officials have expressed relief that no new
agreements over Taiwan's status were reached during Clinton's
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Clinton reaffirmed a ``one-China policy,'' and urged Taiwan and
China to resolve their dispute peacefully.
	   Washington is required by law to ensure Taiwan can defend
itself. At a session with Beijing University students Monday,
Clinton stressed that U.S. weapons sales should not be an obstacle
to Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
	   China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province to be reunified with
the mainland by force, if necessary. It is the seat of the
Nationalist government that fled the Communist takeover of the
mainland in 1949.
	   Taiwan had feared Clinton might formalize the U.S. position of
not supporting Taiwan's independence or entry into the United
Nations.
	   ``It's been our policy as well not to support independence,''
said Shen Lyu-shun, a Foreign Ministry official in charge of North
American affairs. ``But we believe it is something the United
States should have discussed with us, instead of going there to
discuss with the Chinese Communists.''
	   ``The United States has demonstrated its good will,'' Shen said.
``But some people acted as though our country would collapse if
President Clinton ever made those pledges in public.''
	   Foreign Minister Hu also tried to allay public fears. However,
he told state radio that China may maneuver Clinton into stronger
reiterations of U.S. pledges over Taiwan at his remaining public
appearances.
	   Some scholars said Taiwan should take more concrete actions to
prove it is not moving toward independence. Wariness over that
issue prompted China to freeze dialogue with Taiwan three years ago
following Taiwan President Lee's visit to the United States.
	   Political scientist Chang Ling-cheng said China has stalled on
resuming the talks because of a lack of assurance that Taiwan is
sincerely pursuing reunification.
	   ``The United States has already slanted toward China's position,
so there was no need for Clinton to reiterate them in public,'' she
said.
	   Shaw Yu-ming, head of the official Institute of International
Relations, said Taiwan, with its democracy and freedoms, ``remains
Washington's ace in the hole.'' But Shaw said Taiwan should do
more.
	   ``We must not count on an arms race,'' he said. ``What shall we
do in case we stop getting new arms supplies one day?''
	   Washington is delaying a sale of Stinger missiles to Taiwan
until after Clinton's visit, underscoring the sensitivity
surrounding such transfers, a newspaper reported.
	   The Pentagon planned to send Taiwan an itemized price list for
the 1,299 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in May, but has postponed
that until August, the China Times Express reported.
	   That was to avoid providing China an ``excuse'' to pressure
Washington over arms sales during Clinton's visit, it said, quoting
an unidentified top military official.
	   The Defense Ministry said in a statement it hadn't yet received
the price list for the missiles, but did not believe it was being
delayed because of Clinton's China visit.

category codes:
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Search teams found 16 more bodies Monday
in the rubble of this devastated town, bringing the death toll from
an earthquake in southern Turkey to 128. Others were feared still
trapped under collapsed buildings in Ceyhan, rescue workers said.
There was no indication whether they were alive. Ceyhan and the
nearby city of Adana, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the west, were
the hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake Saturday. Up to 70
aftershocks kept panicked residents away from their homes, forcing
them to sleep outside overnight Monday. Hospitals set up makeshift
outdoor treatment centers to treat the more than 1,000 injured.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Human rights ``are the birthrights of people
everywhere,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton told students at Peking
University in a speech broadcast Monday across China. Clinton also
fielded tough questions from Chinese students on America's human
rights and defense policies. He urged China's communist leaders not
to fear an open society. ``Freedom is a powerful engine of
progress,'' he said in a speech that challenged some aspects of
China's system of government but also extolled economic reforms
that have lifted tens of millions of people from poverty into a
lifestyle that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. (CLINTON

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The mutilated body of an opposition
party activist has been discovered outside Phnom Penh, raising new
fears of violence in the run-up to elections July 26, human rights
workers said Monday. The remains of Thong Sophal, 45, were
discovered a week after he was reported missing. His fingers and
left ear were cut off, indicating torture, and he had suffered at
least one heavy blow to the head, said a human rights worker,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Thong Sophal was an active
campaigner for FUNCINPEC, the royalist party led by Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, who was deposed last year as co-prime minister by his
rival, Hun Sen. (CAMBODIA ELECTIONS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections. Weizman's role is
largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to set a new election
date. However, the president is very popular, and his statements
carry great moral weight. Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition
accused Weizman of overstepping his authority and siding with the
opposition. The next general elections are to be held in 2000.
Polls indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak of
Labor would tie if elections were held now. (ISRAEL PALESTINIANS)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Serb ex-mayor implicated in a
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his jail cell while
awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Monday. The body of Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, was
found hanging on the hinge of the door to his cell in the U.N.
court's detention unit in The Hague shortly after midnight,
tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said. It was the first time a
suspect being held in the tribunal's high-security cell block has
committed suicide. (CROATIA WAR CRIMES)

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with
the key index in Tokyo rising for the fourth straight session on
expectations the Japanese government may come up with an effective
plan to reform the country's ailing banking industry. Tokyo's
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 155.69 points, or 1.02
percent, closing at 15,365.73. The Nikkei index now has gained a
total of 311.13 points in four trading days, including Friday's
77.82-point gain, or 0.51 percent. The Japanese government has
promised to unveil a ``total plan'' by Thursday to revive the
economy and accelerate reform of the ailing banking system. (ASIAN

	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to China began
paying dividends for American businesses Monday, with major U.S.
corporations announcing contracts worth some dlrs 1.87 billion. The
deals _ signed at a ceremony attended by U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley and Chinese foreign trade officials _ included the
dlrs 1.2 billion sale of 27 Boeing aircraft to the Civil Aviation
Administration of China. ``This helps address the trade
situation,'' Daley said, adding that he hoped China-U.S. business
ties would become stronger and more stable. (CHINA US TRADE)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Recent government initiatives,
including tax and fee exemptions for debt restructuring, should
allow Thai banks to turn problem loans into performing assets
within two years, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said
Monday. ``We have all the ingredients to build an efficient process
of corporate debt restructuring. We have high hopes that this
process will get us out of the NPL (non-performing loan) trap,'' he
said. The financial sector came under severe stress last year after
a slowdown in the economy triggered a series of defaults in the
business sector and led to a depreciation of the currency. The
cascading series of problems left almost all Thai banks and finance
companies with huge amounts of bad debt. (THAILAND BANKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds took another
tumble Monday while parliament worked on a dozen economic measures
aimed at digging Russia out of its financial crisis. President
Boris Yeltsin urged the Communist-dominated parliament to swiftly
approve the government's austerity plan. But the Communists in the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, generally want more
government spending, not less, and may be reluctant to support
Yeltsin's proposals. ``Let the Duma hurry up,'' Yeltsin was quoted
as saying by Interfax news agency. ``I have done my part of the job
_ I've signed the decrees.'' (RUSSIA ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ PowerGen, Britain's third-largest power generator,
announced Monday it will buy East Midlands Electricity PLC from
Dominion Resources Inc. for 1.9 billion-pound (dlrs 3.2 billion) _
less than two years after the American group bought the British
utility. The deal has to be approved by British regulators. But it
if goes through it will mark the first time a big British power
generator has been allowed to buy one of Britain's 12 regional
utility companies. Dominion, based in Richmond, Virginia, is the
parent company of Virginia Power. It bought East Midlands in
November 1996 for 1.3 billion pounds (then dlrs 2.1 billion), and
was hit by a 96 million pound (dlrs 159 million) windfall tax in
July 1997 when the newly elected Labor Party government taxed what
it said were the excess profits of privatized utility companies.

Regional U.N. drug conference opens in Beirut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A regional U.N. drug conference opened
Monday in Beirut to find ways for Middle Eastern countries to
cooperate in the campaign against drug trafficking and production.
	   The five-day conference also will deal with efforts to curb
terrorist groups involved in the illicit drug trade.
	   Tony White, an official of the U.N. Drug Control Program, told
the opening session that efforts were beginning to bear fruit.
	   ``The challenges are formidable but the level of international
support has never been so great,'' he said. ``I am confident that
the balance of power will gradually shift in our favor.''
	   The conference heard complaints from Lebanon about the lack of
U.N. funding for encouraging alternatives to drug production.
	   Brig. Gen. Rafik Hassan, chief of the Lebanese Internal Security
Forces, said Lebanon did not reap the benefits of his country's
successful eradication of the drug trade as promised.
	   The government, which extended its authority over much of the
country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, began in 1993 to
destroy hashish plantations in the eastern Bekaa Valley.
	   Under a U.N. program, hashish growers were promised help in
order to grow alternative crops.
	   Hassan complained that the program's ``returns were negligible
and farmers are complaining and threatening with disobedience.''
	   Among those attending the conference were representatives from
Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The United States, France
and Germany also were represented.

Pope welcomes Orthodox presence at Mass 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II welcomed the return of an
Orthodox delegation Monday at a Mass celebrating the feast day of
St. Peter and St. Paul, calling it a sign of hope for better
relations among Christians.
	   After sending representatives to the Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica for two decades, the Orthodox church boycotted last year's
service because of strained relations.
	   The Russian Orthodox church, in particular, has accused Roman
Catholic clergy in Russia of proselytism.
	   John Paul said the attendance this year was a source of ``joy
and comfort'' and that improved relations among various
denominations was particularly important with the approach of 2000,
the start of Christianity's third millennium.
	   The delegation was sent by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,
spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Christian Orthodox.
	   John Paul, wearing red robes, walked slowly and leaned
frequently on his staff on a day when temperatures reached 33
degrees Celsius (91 F).
	   During the Mass, in an ancient rite, 19 new archbishops received
the pallium, a band of white wool decorated with black crosses that
symbolizes their bond with the Vatican.

One protester shot dead, four wounded in East Timor during EU visit

Eds: UPDATES with comments from British ambassador. Trims
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Security officers shot one protester to
death and wounded four others near a cathedral in East Timor on
Monday as a European Union diplomatic team held talks with a
Catholic bishop.
	   Witnesses said the plainclothes officers opened fire when their
van was mobbed by demonstrators soon after the ambassadors from
Britain, the Netherlands and Austria arrived in the town of Baucau,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili.
	   Later, speaking to a crowd of protesters in a cathedral, British
Ambassador Robin Christopher said he regretted the incident and
hoped the conflict in East Timor would be resolved as soon as
possible.
	   ``I will let the United Nations know about what I saw and heard
in Dili and Baucau,'' Christopher said.
	   It was the second time in three days that military personnel had
killed a pro-independence protester in the troubled territory.
	   About 5,000 demonstrators, who want independence from Indonesia,
had rallied in front of Baucau's St. Antonio Cathedral.
	   Vilidiu Gusmao, 32, a lay member of the church's Justice and
Peace Commission, said the crowd cheered when two vans carrying the
Jakarta-based envoys arrived for talks with Bishop Bacilio Do
Nascimento.
	   However, the situation turned violent when a third van arrived
later with several security agents, carrying automatic weapons.
	   ``The people got angry because the security agents came here
with guns,'' Gusmao said.
	   He said several shots were fired directly into a mob that had
surrounded the vehicle and pounded and kicked its doors and
windows.
	   Hundreds of onlookers fled into the cathedral or jumped over a
wall to take shelter when the shots rang out.
	   The agents ran to a nearby army post and the bishop later called
on the crowd to disperse peacefully as the dead victim was taken
into the cathedral.
	   The dead man was identified as Orlando Marcelinu da Costa, 35.
	   Three other men and one woman were hospitalized with gunshot
wounds.
	   Two more people were injured when they were hit by the besieged
van as it tried to force its way through the crowd.
	   ``It is true that one man was shot after protesters attacked
some security agents,'' said a military intelligence officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas earlier called for
further negotiations rather than demonstrations.
	   ``Violence and protests won't resolve the problem,'' he said.
``It is better to find a peaceful solution that can be accepted by
the majority of East Timorese as well as foreign countries and the
United Nations.''
	   Earlier, thousands of pro-independence protesters marched
through East Timor's capital Monday, demanding a referendum on
Indonesian control over the former Portuguese colony and the
release of an imprisoned rebel leader.
	   It was the fourth straight day of demonstrations in East Timor
by groups that either support Indonesian rule or want greater
independence.
	   Hundreds of soldiers with automatic weapons and police armed
with shields and tear gas canisters stood by as a procession of
protesters, stretching five kilometers (3 miles), moved peacefully
from the University of East Timor through Dili's streets.
	   The protesters held up pictures of guerrilla chief Xanana
Gusmao, demanding that he be released from a Jakarta prison where
he is serving a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian forces.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   President B.J. Habibie has offered to free Gusmao and to grant
special status to East Timor in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's claim over the territory. But he has
ruled out any referendum.
	   The United Nations and many other governments don't recognize
the legitimacy of Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island,
which has endured more than two decades of guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses.

English World Cup hero still recovering after stroke 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Alf Ramsey, England's only World Cup winning
manager, had a mild stroke three weeks ago but was still ``resting
comfortably'' in hospital, it was revealed Monday.
	   Ramsey, who guided England to World Cup glory in 1966, suffered
a small brain hemorrhage and was admitted to Ipswich Hospital,
Suffolk, on June 9, the hospital said Monday.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper, which published the news of Ramsey's
illness on its front page Monday, said the 78-year-old soccer
legend's health had become ``increasingly fragile'' in recent
months.
	   ``Friends said he had been suffering from a heart condition and
worsening senile dementia. Fears first arose in 1993 when he failed
to attend a memorial service for his World Cup captain Bobby
Moore,'' the paper reported.
	   The England squad, currently preparing for its must-win World
Cup match against Argentina Tuesday, was informed of Ramsey's
condition Sunday.
	   England manager Glenn Hoddle said Ramsey would always have a
special place in soccer history.
	   ``His achievement in 1966 remains an inspiration to everybody,
including me, more than 30 years later,'' Hoddle said from the
team's La Baule training center.
	   England captain Alan Shearer said the news coming during the
World Cup was ``especially upsetting.''
	   ``The team he led to World Cup success in 1966 is an example to
us all today. We desperately want to achieve the same thing,'' he
said.
	   Sir Bobby Charlton, a key player and goal scorer in England's
1966 team, said he was hoping his former manager made a swift
return to full fitness.
	   ``I think everybody in football will want him to make a full
recovery and I'm sure all the other lads will be wishing him all
the best,'' Charlton said.
	   Ramsey was knighted by the Queen in 1967 and remained England
manager until 1974, when he was controversially sacked after his
team failed to qualify for the World Cup finals.
	   As a player he was regarded as a tenacious defender, winning 32
England caps, including three as captain.
	   He played for Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur before becoming
Ipswich manager in 1955.
	   He took over as England manager in 1962 after guiding Ipswich
from the old Third Division competition to the First Division
title.

Report: Airbus close to winning British Airway jet deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Airbus Industrie, the European consortium
competing against U.S.-based Boeing Co., is near a deal to sell 100
jets to British Airways for dlrs 3.8 billion, The Wall Street
Journal reported Monday.
	   British Airways has not yet formally agreed to buy the
short-haul planes, but the proposal will be on the agenda of the
company's board meeting on Friday, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified source. The choice should be announced within several
weeks.
	   British Airways spokeswoman Kate Gay dismissed the report as
``purely speculative. ... No decision has been made yet,'' she
said. ``It's very much a level playing field.'' She said more
information could be released after the meeting.
	   Both Airbus and Boeing have aggressively pursued the contract.
British Airways has traditionally bought Boeing aircraft, though
the airline has said that it was seeking flexible ways of financing
the new purchase.
	   The jets are to be used by regional subsidiaries in Britain,
France and Germany.
	   Also Monday, the Chinese government signed firm orders for 16
new Boeing 737s and one 747 in a deal worth dlrs 800 million, and
letters of intent to buy 10 new 737s worth dlrs 400 million,
according to Alan Turley, senior commerce representative at the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Last fall, China signed a letter of intent to buy dlrs 3 billion
of new planes.

Karachi Stock Exchange tumbles another 65.87 points, sets new record low 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The Karachi Stock Exchange continued to
tumble Monday dropping 65.87 points by the end of the day's
trading.
	   The stock exchange closed at 811.03, down from Friday's close of
876.90 -- which was a new record low for the market.
	   Brokers are blaming the downward slide on chaotic government
policy and the ongoing feud between the government and independent
power companies.
	   On Saturday the government canceled its power purchasing
agreement with Southern Electric Company, a 1,112 megawatt power
station in eastern Punjab province, and served notice to six other
private power companies that it plans to cancel its agreement with
them.
	   The government accused the power companies of corruption saying
they paid kickbacks to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's
government in exchange for inflated power purchasing rates.
	   Both the power companies and Ms. Bhutto have denied the charges.
	   The feud has driven stocks in the largest power company, Hubco
Power Company, down. Hubco wasn't among the companies served with a
notice of cancellation, however it has not received its June
payment of dlrs 2 million from the government-run power and water
department.
	   The Karachi Stock Exchange president Yasin Lakhani earlier
called for the resignation of the governor of the State Bank of
Pakistan.
	   He blasted the government's recent policies, including freezing
of foreign currency accounts. That decision was made last month
after Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices in response to India's
five nuclear explosion.
	   Pakistan feared a mass exodus of foreign currency by the rich
who feared debilitating international sanctions as a result of the
testing.
	   The sanctions in fact amount to about dlrs 1.5 billion and will
not effect Pakistan this year and may not kick in for another two
years, said economists in the federal capital of Islamabad. But
still the government has maintained the freeze.

Truck hits houses, one dead

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A truck loaded with paint careered into
houses Monday in the eastern Belgian town of Stavelot, bursting
into flames and setting homes alight. One person was reported
killed and 11 injured.
	   Police evacuated several streets as firefighters battled to put
out the fire in the town center, Belgium's RTBF television
reported. About 15 houses were reported damaged.
	   News reports said the truck lost control on a downhill street
leading into the town at the same spot where a bus crashed in 1986
killing eight people.
	   Firefighters from the nearby cities of Liege and Verviers and
from the capital Brussels 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the west
were called in to fight the blaze.
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.

Hyundai makes its layoff plan official 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's largest automaker,
Hyundai Motors Co., made official Monday its layoff plan, and a
labor union vowed to organize a massive strike against the move.
	   In a report to the Labor Ministry, Hyundai said it plans to lay
off 4,800 workers by the end of this year.
	   Under South Korean law, a company can legally lay off workers 30
days after it notifies the government of its layoff plan.
	   Hyundai's labor union has long said it would strike if the
company went ahead with the layoff plan.
	   ``We cannot accept layoffs. We will fight against the decision
through strike,'' said Yoon Ki-ho, a spokesman for Hyundai's labor
union, adding that a strike schedule will be announced Tuesday.
	   In May, Hyundai announced plans to lay off 8,200 _ or 27 percent
_ of its 30,000 workers, citing sluggish domestic car sales that
dropped to less than half of those last year.
	   Since then, some 3,400 workers have volunteered for early
retirement with extra wages for 12 months in addition to their
regular retirement payment.
	   Hyundai said it has no other option but to cut manpower amid a
deepening economic crisis in South Korea.

France to press for southern Africa debt relief, says Chirac 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said
former colonial powers, Western creditor nations and financial
institutions must consider alleviating debt burdens that are
stunting development in countries like Mozambique.
	   Impoverished by 16 years of civil war, Mozambique owes more than
dlrs 6 billion in foreign debt. As much as 50 percent of the
nation's annual revenue is in loans and aid.
	   Chirac, continuing his thrust to promote French interests in
southern Africa, vowed France will press for foreign debt relief
and back economic reconstruction for Mozambique.
	   ``It is a question of principle'' for former colonial powers,
Western creditor nations and financial institutions to address the
problem, Chirac told reporters. He said France favors debt relief
in southern Africa to give momentum to democratic and economic
reforms.
	   Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said he welcomed Chirac's
initiatives.
	   Chirac is on a four-nation tour of southern Africa to widen
French policy on the continent after focusing for decades mainly on
French-speaking former colonies. It was the first-ever trip to
Mozambique by a French president.
	   Chirac met privately with former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama,
now head of the political opposition. No details were released of
the talks.
	   Dhlakama signed a peace accord with the government in 1992 to
end a civil war waged by his Mozambique National Resistance _ known
by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO.
	   French officials said Chirac was impressed by internal stability
in Mozambique that has led to record economic growth of 12 percent
in gross domestic product in the past year. The country's first
democratic elections were held in 1996.
	   Chissano said he asked Chirac for France to help train and
rebuild Mozambique's armed forces so they are on par with
neighboring armies that were able to engage in regional and African
peace keeping.
	   Earlier Monday, Chirac laid a wreath at a shrine honoring
Mozambicans who died in the bush war that led to independence from
Portugal in 1974.
	   About 50 top French business executives traveling with him met
with Mozambican officials and business leaders at a
French-sponsored economic forum. French officials were to sign four
cooperation agreements in health, education, energy and transport.
	   Chirac arrived Sunday from South Africa, the key stop on a trip
that included Namibia. He was to leave later Monday for Angola,
another former Portuguese colony.
	   There, Chirac will assess the ailing preace process there that
has limited French economic cooperation in Angola mainly to
offshore oil production, officials said.

Israeli president calls for early elections, Netanyahu says no 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes in grafs 2-3, 11-12, 18-19
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In frustration over the deadlock in Mideast
peacemaking, President Ezer Weizman on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to call early elections.
	   Netanyahu quickly dismissed the idea, saying elections would be
held as scheduled, in 2000, and insisting the Palestinians _ not
Israel _ were responsible for the impasse.
	   ``Peace is very, very close _ if the Palestinians do their
part,'' he told reporters.
	   Weizman's role is largely ceremonial, and he has no authority to
set a new election date. However, the president is very popular and
his statements carry great moral weight.
	   Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition accused Weizman of
overstepping his authority and siding with the opposition.
	   Polls indicate that Netanyahu and opposition leader Ehud Barak
of Labor would tie if elections were held now.
	   Weizman said Monday he feared for the future of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, which have been stalled for the
past 15 months over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   He also noted that Netanyahu has backed off the idea of holding
a referendum on a withdrawal.
	   ``The peace process is limping and has hit several pitfalls in
recent months,'' Weizman said. ``If he does not conduct a
referendum, in my opinion the next solution needs to be elections.
The sooner we go to elections the sooner we will know what the
public thinks.''
	   Opinion polls have suggested that two-thirds of Israelis support
a U.S. plan for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer.
	   Netanyahu, while refusing to go into specifics, said Monday that
Israel has made compromises in the past eight weeks, and that only
a ``small gap that in my opinion can be breached easily'' remains
on the scope of the withdrawal.
	   He said the Palestinians have failed to make concrete
commitments to fulfilling their obligations _ such as reducing the
size of their police force, collecting illegal weapons, and
annulling sections of the Palestinian National Covenant calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, meanwhile, said Monday
the Palestinians have rejected a U.S. proposal to water down the
original withdrawal plan submitted by Washington in January.
	   Under the new proposal, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of
the land. However, in 3 percent of that area, the Palestinians
would only have restricted authority, particularly in granting
building permits.
	   Erekat said he rejected the proposal when he met two weeks ago
with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, and the Israeli
Cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh. The Palestinians also turned down a
U.S. request to hold more meetings with the Israelis.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had assured the
Palestinians that the original U.S. plan would not be diluted,
Erekat said. ``We see they are trying to change it which is ...
absolutely incomprehensible,'' Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The negotiator complained that the Clinton administration was
not pressing Netanyahu to make a decision. ``They (the Americans)
said they would continue their efforts to get the Israeli yes,''
Erekat said. ``As long as they keep giving Netanyahu the extra
mile, he will keep wasting time.''
	   Netanyahu said Monday he would not give in to American pressure.
	   ``No pressure and no person will sway me,'' he said.

EU comes to view Kosovo militants must be part of any peace deal. 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union, endorsing a new U.S. tack,
was coming around to the view Monday that Kosovo's militants must
be part of a peace deal in the secessionist Serbian province.
	   Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said peace talks must ``include those who
represent all shades of Kosovo opinion,'' including representatives
of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Diplomats stressed this did not mean the EU supported an
independent Kosovo, only a return to the autonomy that the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province had until 1989.
	   They added that EU governments want to fall in line with a new
American position that became clear last Friday when U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard met with people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The KLA, which says it controls up to 40 percent of Kosovo,
rejects the pacifist approach to independence of Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian leader in the southern Serbian province.
Hundreds of people, many of them civilians, have died since Serb
forces began cracking down on ethnic Albanian militants in March.
	   In a related measure, the foreign ministers planned to make
formal a decision taken at an EU summit in Britain this month to
ban all commercial flights between Yugoslav and EU airports.
	   It was not clear when that ban could take effect. The EU has
already imposed a ban on new investments, frozen Serbian country's
assets abroad, prohibited arms exports to Belgrade and restricted
travel visas for Yugoslav officials _ all in an effort to punish
Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic for his crackdown in Kosovo.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said it was imperative for
the international community to cast the net wider. ``We have to
talk to everybody who has the possibility to end the violence,'' he
said.
	   Cook called Rugova ``the elected and legitimate head of the
Kosovo Albanians ... the man with whom we have been dealing.''
	   Yet he too sounded more conciliatory toward the KLA, even though
it tried to organize a boycott of elections two months ago that
made Rugova the leader of Kosovo's Albanians and is committed to
seeking independence through armed resistance.
	   The foreign ministers were expected to issue a declaration later
Monday restating their view Kosovo must not become independent but
that Belgrade must end its crackdown, withdraw its security forces
and negotiate a peace deal with ethnic Albanians through which it
would reinstate Kosovo's autonomous status.

Gavel falls on tradition as Britain holds final tea auction AP Business Writer

	   LONDON (AP) _ The gavel fell Monday on the last batch of tea to
be auctioned in London, closing three centuries of tradition for
dealers who now find the fax and Internet more convenient.
	   ``This is the end of an era,'' said Mike Bunston, the auctioneer
with Wilson, Smithett and Co. ``Obviously, there's a twinge of
sadness over that. Nevertheless, we move on.''
	   Bunston thought for a moment he might not find a buyer for the
final lot of Zimbabwe Pekoe Dust, which he admitted was just so-so
tea.
	   But wholesaler Tea Services struck the last deal with an
unchallenged offer of 60 pence (dlrs 1) per kilo. The bidder, Jim
Vart, saw nothing emotional about the trade.
	   ``Not at all,'' Vart said. ``It was quite cheap.''
	   London once was a vital center of tea trading, when British
companies shipped in chests of tea from colonies spread through
Asia and Africa.
	   The auctions used to run for days, but in recent years the
London sales dwindled as tea growers established their own auctions
closer to home, such as those in Calcutta, India, and Mombasa,
Kenya.
	   The London auctions finally took up just one day a week, Monday,
before fading to the point where all sales could be done in an
hour.
	   Monday's last auction took about 45 minutes, and brought lots of
nostalgia to gray-haired tea dealers and some retired ones who came
along just to witness the end.
	   ``I can't contemplate it, really,'' said Harald Grieve, who's
been in the tea industry since 1936 with the blending and packing
company Matthew Algie, in Glasgow, Scotland.
	   ``It's a sad old day,'' said Malcolm Ferris-Lay, sales director
with the merchant Williamson and Magor.
	   The tea dealers predict they'll still enjoy a healthy business.
Britons still consume more tea than they do coffee or soft-drinks,
averaging 3.39 cups per person per day last year, according to the
Tea Council.
	   ``We will be seeking to use more modern technology in the buying
and selling of tea,'' said Robin Harrison of the Tea Brokers'
Association of London. ``Developments such as e-mail and the
Internet are more cost-effective ways of trading than the current
arrangements.''
	   The auctions, first recorded as early as March 11, 1679, were
necessary in bygone years, because a fair amount of tea was ruined
at sea and buyers wanted to inspect the product after it had landed
in Britain.
	   Improved packing techniques have made bulk tea purchases from
growers much less of a hit-or-miss proposition, so many buyers have
been bypassing the London brokers by going directly to the source
or to the regional auctions.
	   ``It was inevitable, really,'' said Bunston, the auctioneer.

Rubin: Markets will judge Japan's efforts 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-US-Rubin
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said Monday the financial markets would judge the success of
Japan's attempts to clean up its banking sector.
	   ``In the final analysis, as Japan announces plans with respect
to dealing with its banking sector, the markets will make those
judgments,'' Rubin said at the end of a two-day visit to Malaysia.
	   Tokyo has promised to unveil a ``total plan'' by Thursday to
revive the economy and accelerate reform of the ailing banking
system.
	   Last Friday, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said that they were in negotiations to
merge within a year. Ailing LTCB, Japan's second-largest long-term
credit bank, had been looking for a partner to save it from
problems caused by massive bad loans.
	   ``I think it's very important that Japan's actions be effective
and well respected,'' Rubin said.
	   He said Japan's recovery was critical not only to Asia, but to
the global economy as well.
	   ``Japan is probably the greatest economic success story of the
last 50 years,'' Rubin said.
	   In the last more than half a decade, its economy had slowed

Bootleg alcohol costs Russia dlrs 18 billion in five months, official says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moonshine manufacturing and the evasion of alcohol
taxes has cost the government an estimated 18 billion rubles (dlrs
2.9 billion) in the first five months of this year, an official
said Monday.
	   The official monthly output of vodka averaged about 55 million
liters (14.4 million gallons) during the past two months, said
Vladimir Yarmosh, chief of the state-run Spirtprom association,
which controls vodka production.
	   But twice as much has been manufactured and sold illegally,
without tax payments, Yarmosh was quoted as saying by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Many Russian liquor companies evade taxes, and the government
badly needs the revenue to help pay for many basic services.
	   In Soviet times, taxes on alcohol were said to constitute more
25 percent of state revenues. They still account for a significant
portion of Russia's federal budget.

Serbs amass weaponry near coal mine held by Kosovo rebels 
</HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Explosions rocked a Kosovo
rebel-held area just outside Pristina on Monday as Serb forces
launched a new offensive against militant ethnic Albanians seeking
independence.
	   The operation was directed against a coal mine at Belacevac
village, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the capital of
Serbia's Kosovo province, and several nearby villages controlled by
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   It marked a new front in the months-long struggle between Serb
police and other armed units and militant ethnic Albanians led by
the KLA seeking independence for the Serbian province
	   At a police check point only about 200 meters (yards) away from
the mine, explosions could be heard at eight-second intervals.
Police were seen surrounding a KLA entrenchment just outside the
village. Smoked billowed overhead.
	   Sources close to the ethnic Albanian leadership said that armed
Serb civilians were backing up regular Serbian forces targeting the
coal mine and other rebel positions in nearby villages. Tanks had
been drawn up at Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac,
they said.
	   The Belacevac open-pit mine is strategically important because
it supplies coal to the nearby Obilic power plant, which in turns
provides electricity for most of the province. An 8-year-old child
was reported wounded Monday by gunfire in Lismir, a village near
Obilic.
	   At Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main hot-spot _ tensions remained
bubbling, with fighters from the Kosovo Liberation army deeply
entrenched and bracing for a new attack after black-painted
Yugoslav helicopters strafed them on the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and other support by the ring of
armed Albanian fighters around them. A child and an adult _ both
apparently ethnic Albanians _ were reported killed in the region
Sunday.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo and connects the main Kosovo cities of
Pristina and Pec. Security forces say the Kijevo posts are vital to
communications between the guerrillas on opposite sides of the
road.
	   The Belacevac region is the closest area to Pristina held by
independence fighters, who moved in about a week ago.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28
to try to extinguish growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of the
southern province in Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left
of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly supported by the ethnic
Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has met with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leaders in attempts to find
a peaceful way to end the conflict.
	   Washington and its key allies warn of NATO involvement in Kosovo
as a last resort.
	   In Vienna on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
swift international steps to prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo,
but reiterated that the Security Council must approve any military
action.
	   The council was set to take up the Kosovo issue later in the day
in New York. The United States maintains that the Security
Council's blessing is not needed for NATO action aimed at halting
the Kosovo conflict, but council member Russia disagrees.
	   Annan, speaking at a news conference at United Nations offices
in Vienna, said the focus remains on diplomacy, and the possibility
of military action should be considered carefully.
	   ``That is an issue for the Security Council,'' he reiterated.
The possibility of intervention ``is for the council to decide.''
	   ``But I think the international community should do what it can
to stop what could be a second Bosnia ... and contain the conflict
before it spreads,'' he said.
	   The Russian foreign ministry on Monday again said that Moscow
``cannot support'' NATO military action in Kosovo.
	   Senior German officials, who spoke to reporters in Bonn on
condition of anonymity, were critical of Holbrooke for permitting
himself to be photographed with KLA members recently. But they said
members of the militant organization should be included in any
talks on the province's future.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Human rights ``are the birthrights of people
everywhere,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton told students at Peking
University in a speech broadcast Monday across China.
	   Clinton also fielded tough questions from Chinese students on
America's human rights and defense policies.
	   He urged China's communist leaders not to fear an open society.
``Freedom is a powerful engine of progress,'' he said in a speech
that challenged some aspects of China's system of government but
also extolled economic reforms that have lifted tens of millions of
people from poverty into a lifestyle that would have been
unthinkable 20 years ago.
	   Clinton praised China for having a positive economic role in the
region.
	   ``China has steadfastly shouldered its responsibility to the
region and the world in this latest financial crisis, helping to
prevent another cycle of dangerous devaluations,'' he said.
	   The president later flew to Shanghai, the commercial capital of
China and the third stop on his nine-day China tour. His public
events there Tuesday were to include a speech on China's future and
an appearance on Shanghai Radio's call-in show.
	   At Peking University, students and faculty members warmly
welcomed the American leader as he strode into a hall on the quiet,
leafy campus whose students were the driving force behind the 1989
pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.

Indonesian president doesn't rule out another term 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Monday left
open the possibility that he may run for another term, saying it
was up to the Indonesian people.
	   Habibie, who took over from former President Suharto last month
amid political and economic turmoil, has pledged democratic reforms
and general elections in 1999.
	   Speaking to Muslim students at the presidential palace, Habibie
did not rule out another candidacy, although in May he had said he
had no plans to run again for office.
	   ``It is silly to ask me whether I am ready to be elected in the
next general election in 1999 because I'm concentrating on how to
overcome the crisis the nation has been dealing with,'' Habibie
said, answering a query from a student about his political
intentions.
	   Shortly after he assumed office, Habibie gave a different answer
when asked the same question at a meeting with a group from the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. He said then that he was not ready.
	   ``They should not have asked me that question at the time when I
was only a few days in office,'' he said. ``The 1999 elections will
elect a new government and whoever they choose, it is up to the
people.''
	   The presidential term is five years. Suharto was elected to
seven terms by a loyalist assembly.
	   Habibie said he hasn't seen Suharto since he stepped down on May
21 after student demonstrations for his ouster and riots over price
increases in Jakarta and other major cities.
	   Habibie said the only contact he has had with the 76-year-old
former army general was on June 8, Suharto's birthday. He said the
former president urged him to take care of his health.
	   Indonesia is grappling with the worst economic crisis in three
decades. Inflation and unemployment are soaring.

Contact group to push for Kosovo cease-fire at Bonn meeting 
</HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WIEGOLD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Backing away from demands for Serbia to
unilaterally withdraw its special forces from Kosovo, the
six-nation Contact Group for the Balkans will push instead at their
next meeting for a cease-fire leading to talks, German diplomats
said Monday.
	   The German Foreign Ministry said high-level officials from the
United States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and Italy will meet
July 8 in Bonn to discuss the Kosovo crisis. The group has an
international mandate to monitor events in former Yugoslavia.
	   Among demands the group made at its June 12 meeting in London
was that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pull back his
forces. He has refused to do so, citing continued attacks by the
guerrilla army fighting for independence for Kosovo.
	   German diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
group would shift its focus to achieving a monitored cease-fire by
mutual agreement so that negotiations can resume.
	   Leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority have refused to
re-enter talks until Serbian forces halt their attacks on
civilians. More than 300 people have been killed and tens of
thousands forced from their homes in the fighting.
	   Serbia says the guerrillas are using villages as safe havens.
	   German diplomats also criticized U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
for his meeting last week with members of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, saying it was more important to show support for
moderate ethnic Albanian leaders.

Massive abstention in abortion referendum prompts question: What now? 
</HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ After the result of Sunday's referendum
on abortion was voided because of a low turnout, lawmakers on
Monday grappled with a dilemma _ what to do now?
	   After years of squabbling in parliament over whether to relax
abortion restrictions in this mostly Roman Catholic country,
politicians believed the national referendum _ the country's first
_ would finally settle the contentious issue.
	   But a record abstention rate of almost 70 percent dumped the
issue back in parliament's lap, baffled lawmakers and further
clouded the abortion debate.
	   Daily paper Diario de Noticias devoted its entire front page to
a question mark and below it the question, ``What now, lawmakers?''
	   The apparent lack of public interest also cast doubt on plans to
hold referendums in October on the European Union's Amsterdam
Treaty and the creation of administrative regions.
	   President Jorge Sampaio, who had appealed for a high turnout in
the abortion ballot, said he believed referendums were still
worthwhile.
	   ``This first referendum did not motivate the electorate,''
Sampaio said in a statement Monday. ``We have to reflect, calmly
and seriously, on this fact''.
	   The National Electoral Commission said 68.1 percent of the
country's 8.4 million voters did not participate in the ballot on
whether to ease abortion restrictions.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, dating from 1984, termination of
pregnancy is permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or
in cases of rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   In a landmark decision, lawmakers in February narrowly approved
a bill allowing abortion on demand through the 10th week. However,
opponents successfully pushed for the referendum, which was
intended to either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   Now, lawmakers must decide whether to enact February's law
without the endorsement of a referendum.
	   Of those who did vote, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
	   Abortion rights activists and pro-life campaigners disputed
whether the abstention rate meant that voters were happy with the
1984 law or with February's proposed changes.
	   The two leading daily papers agreed that February's proposed
legislation should be dropped.
	   ``With this referendum, the (proposed) law which engendered it
has died,'' said Publico in an editorial.
	   ``With this result, should the law be enacted? The answer
appears obvious: No it shouldn't,'' said Diario de Noticias.

Indo-Pakistan summit is hopeful sign for easing tensions, says host 
</HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Host Sri Lanka will give India and
Pakistan all they need to hold their first post-nuclear summit, but
won't let nuclear tensions submerge the mundane issues of regional
economics, the foreign minister said Monday.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan's Nawaz
Sharif have confirmed their attendance at the previously scheduled
summit next month of the seven South Asian countries _ itself a
hopeful sign _ and indicated they will hold one-on-one talks.
	   ``Neither of them is ducking out of the meeting,'' said Sri
Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadiragamer. ``It will be a very
opportune time for the two prime ministers to meet.''
	   Tensions rose last month after both countries conducted
underground nuclear explosions and trumpeted a series of threats.
They already have fought three wars in their 50 years of
independence.
	   Kadiragamer declined to predict how the two would get along when
they meet, but he described both as reasonable men.
	   ``Vajpayee is a mature, balanced statesman,'' Kadiragamer told
The Associated Press. ``He is preeminently a man of peace, a
cultured man. He is not a warlike person.''
	   Sharif also ``is a very practical, down-to-earth person who has
no warlike tendencies. He is not a warmonger,'' the minister said.
	   Fears of an impending war were unfounded, he said. ``These
countries operate at different levels. You can have warlike phrases
being uttered without any intention by either party going to war.''
	   At the same time, he said both countries should coordinate
safeguards and command and control procedures to ensure a nuclear
war cannot start by accident.
	   Sri Lanka will not try to mediate or facilitate talks beyond
logistical help, he said.
	   Under the rules of the 12-year-old South Asia Association for
Regional Cooperation, or SAARC, the seven members are barred from
discussing bilateral problems except during one day of informal
head-to-head meetings, called the retreat.
	   ``I wouldn't say the nuclear issue will predominate the
retreat,'' Kadiragamer said. ``We don't want the economic agenda to
be completely eclipsed.''
	   It will be the first summit since India's elections brought
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to power in
March. During the last summit, Sharif and Vajpayee's predecessor,
Inder Kumar Gujral, claimed to have established a warm personal
rapport.
	   That meeting was followed by a series of high-level talks
between professional diplomats, but they became bogged down over
procedural differences on how to discuss the territorial dispute
over Kashmir, the Himalayan land claimed by both.
	   Both India and Pakistan have said they were interested in
reviving the talks. But Pakistan wants outside mediation on
Kashmir, while India rejects third-party involvement.

South Korea to restore fishing ban in waters close to Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Taking a conciliatory stance toward
Japan, South Korea said Monday it will restore a ban on South
Korean boats fishing in waters close to Japan.
	   The ban takes effect Wednesday, one day before officials of the
two countries meet in Seoul to discuss revising an old fisheries
agreement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.
	   Japan pulled out of the 1965 fisheries pact with South Korea in
January after nearly two years of talks failed to yield an
agreement on redrawing exclusive fishing zones under the 1994 U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
	   South Korea immediately retaliated by allowing its boats to fish
freely in waters close to Japan. Those waters outside Japan's
statutory 12-nautical mile (14-mile or 22.4-kilometer) zone were
off-limits to South Korean fishing boats under a separate bilateral
accord.
	   South Korean boats began fishing in the restricted areas and
some of their crews were detained and put on trial by Japan for
violating waters claimed by Japan. The incidents touched off angry
reactions in both nations.
	   The U.N. convention allows a nation to claim exclusive fishing
rights within 200 nautical miles (230 miles or 370 kilometers) of
its shores.
	   Since Japan and South Korea are less than 400 nautical miles
(460 miles or 740 kilometers) apart, some areas overlap, and the
two countries are still looking for a compromise.
	   Upon his inauguration in February, President Kim Dae-jung vowed
to improve relations with Japan. Officials of the two nations later
agreed to resolve the fisheries dispute before President Kim visits
Japan in the fall.
	   Working-level officials met in Tokyo in April to discuss the
issue. The meeting, the first held under South Korea's new
government, failed to make progress.
	   Another round of talks will be held in Seoul Thursday and
Friday.

Talks fail to make progress, Guinea-Bissau rebels say 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Sporadic early morning fighting
resumed in Guinea-Bissau's abandoned capital after overnight talks
between the government and rebels failed to resolve the tiny West
African country's bitter 22-day conflict.
	   Rebel radio reported ``no breakthroughs'' in meetings between
renegade leader Ansumane Mane and a government delegation aboard a
Portuguese frigate docked outside the capital of Bissau on Sunday.
	   However the two sides agreed to meet again on Tuesday, the
renegade station said. A lull descended on some parts of the city,
that has been battered by artillery and rocket fire since an army
uprising began on June 7.
	   Sunday's discussions followed an earlier meeting involving the
Portuguese and Angolan Foreign Ministers and Guinea-Bissau's
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   An exchange of gunshots could be heard Monday morning in
neighborhoods of the capital, whose 300,000 people have mostly
fled. There were also reports of fighting in the town of Buba,
southeast of Bissau.
	   In the central town of Mansoa, where the fighting spread over
the weekend, there was silence on Monday morning. Foliage lining a
road leading further into the interior towards Bafata were believed
to conceal rebel fighters in new positions.
	   Renegade and loyalist checkpoints have sprung up almost
overnight throughout the interior, where territory seems to have
changed hands at several points.
	   Roads linking rural rebel-held areas with the capital have
largely been cut off.
	   Prior to Sunday's talks, government representatives had been
hopeful of finding a solution. Earlier mediation efforts involving
church leaders and a Gambian envoy had failed to bring the sides
together.
	   Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the capital, is
overflowing with tens of thousands of refugees who fled the capital
shortly after Mane mounted a coup attempt this month. The rebels
insist Vieira's government is rife with corruption.
	   ``What we're doing here is looking for democracy, real
democracy, not the kind of democracy that is of one man,'' said
rebel Col. Viricino Ceabra on Sunday.
	   Vieiria, the elected president, has called Mane an outlaw.
	   France's President Jacques Chirac said in Maputo, Mozambique,
that there was no reason for French military intervention. France,
a former colonial power in Africa, has troops based in several

do so,'' Chirac said, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.

High-tech Singapore passes law regulating e-commerce 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Aiming to tap into the Internet's burgeoning
trade, high-tech Singapore passed a law Monday to secure and
regulate electronic commerce.
	   The Electronics Transaction Act will allow Singapore to ``play
the role of a secure and trusted node where e-commerce transactions
from the region and around the world are processed,'' said Minister
of Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan shortly before Parliament
passed the bill.
	   Noting that the advent of cyber trade has ``created some novel
legal issues,'' Lee said Singapore shouldn't be deterred from
embracing digital commerce.
	   ``We want to be plugged into this global development and
position Singapore as an international e-commerce hub,'' he said.
	   The law outlines regulations for electronic contracts, along
with the use of digital records and signatures, which will ``have
the same legal binding effect as that of written signatures.''
	   It also creates a legal framework for certification authorities
to oversee and verify electronic signatures, and will allow
government regulation of these ``trusted third parties.''
	   Government departments and statutory boards may be the first to
adopt the new electronic infrastructure on a widespread scale under
a provision in the new act that allows them to use digital
transactions immediately.
	   The legislation also shields network service providers from
criminal and civil liability when deals struck on their networks go
awry.
	   Lee said electronic trade, which some predict will soar to U.S.
dlrs 200 billion to dlrs 300 billion in sales by 2001, creates
``limitless'' opportunities.
	   ``There is little doubt that e-commerce will become an important
engine of growth for the global economy in the next millennium,''
he added.

Polish court overturns acquittal of Danish executive accused of bribery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Dane representing the House of Prince
cigarette company, who was acquitted of trying to bribe a Polish
official, will have to be retried, the Appeal Court of Lodz ruled
Monday.
	   The appeal court said the lower court did not consider all
available evidence in the case of Henrik Jelert.
	   He was acquitted in January of charges he offered dlrs 30,000 in
1995 to a Polish official in return for help in dissolving a
contract between House of Prince, the biggest tobacco company in
Scandinavia, and a Polish cigarette manufacturer.
	   The House of Prince and the state tobacco factory in the central
city of Lodz began a cooperation agreement in 1992 that gave the
Polish firm exclusive rights to manufacture two well-known Danish
cigarette brands.
	   But the Danes decided to withdraw from partnership in April 1995
after taking a majority stake in another Polish factory.
	   An executive of the Lodz company then informed prosecutors that
Jelert had offered him a bribe. He also provided a tape recording
of their conversation.
	   The lower court said the evidence did not prove clearly that
there had been any bribery attempt, but the appeals court
overturned the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

Palestinian legislature belatedly approves 1998 budget 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Halfway into the fiscal year, the
Palestinian legislature on Monday approved a 1998 state budget of
drls 1.8 billion.
	   The vote in the 88-member Legislative Council was 37-22, with
six abstentions. Twenty-three members were absent.
	   Agriculture Minister Abdel Jawad Saleh was among those who
abstained. His government's spending plan ``does not include enough
projects to develop the Palestinian economy,'' he said.
	   Half of the budget comes from foreign aid, and most of the
locally generated income goes to funding the government payroll,
including a 40,000-strong police force.
	   Legislators had been demanding to see the budget before the
beginning of the 1998 fiscal year, but the executive branch headed
by Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat shelved their
request.

Chechnya demands recognition from OSCE 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A European security group has 15 days to get
permission from Chechnya's leaders to work in the breakaway
republic, even though it already has approval from Moscow, the
Chechen Foreign Minister told reporters on Monday.
	   Movladi Udugov said that by accepting the current status of the
Grozny office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, Chechnya would be acknowledging Russian rule, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   ``By accepting the presence of the OSCE representatives under
documents issued by the Russian government, we indirectly recognize
our dependence on Russia,'' Udugov said in the Chechen capital,
Grozny.
	   Chechnya maintains it is an independent country following its
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country recognizes its independence
and Moscow says the region remains part of Russia.
	   Udugov lashed out at the 54-nation OSCE, saying its Grozny
mission wasn't helping in Chechnya anyway.
	   ``The OSCE is not solving any problems in Chechnya at present
and is ignoring Russia's failure to respect its commitments before
Chechnya,'' Udugov said.
	   The OSCE has monitored elections in Chechnya and is trying to
supervise the creation of peaceful leadership in the still violent
region. It is one of the few remaining international groups that
has not abandoned operations in Chechnya because of fear of violent
attacks from rebels.

Singapore unveils measures to boost economy as growth dwindles 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reaction from economists, grafs 7-9
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hoping to keep the Asian crisis at bay and fend
off recession, Singapore unveiled much-anticipated plans Monday to
stimulate the economy as growth continues to dwindle.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced
wide-ranging special economic measures worth 2 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion) to help business cope with the economic
downturn.
	   He also announced a reduced growth estimate for the year of 0.5
to 1.5 percent, much lower than the previously optimistic
government forecast but still above many private economists'
predictions for mild recession.
	   The government's earlier estimate of 2.5 to 4.5 percent growth
was made in February before the full impact of the Asian crisis was
apparent.
	   ``Now that developments are clearer, and we have revised our
growth forecasts downward, we are ready to act to mitigate the
impact of the regional troubles on our economy,'' Hu said.
	   He said the package aims to ``cut business costs and to
stimulate the economy'' amid prospects for ``continued turbulence
and uncertainty'' in the region.
	   But economists reacted tepidly to the scheme, arguing that the
overall impact will be mild at best.
	   ``We think the budget is neutral,'' Friedrich Wu, chief
economist at the government-owned Development Bank of Singapore,
told Dow Jones Newswires. ``It seems most of the goodies are for
the manufacturing sector. ... It will disappoint some of the other
sectors like commerce and retail.''
	   Merrill Lynch Singapore economist Tan Min Lan said the
government action will improve the economy incrementally, and that
``they could have done more.''
	   The measures will result in the government's first budget
deficit in more than a decade. Including revised revenue estimates,
the current budget will have a deficit of 800 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 468 million), compared with the originally planned
surplus of 2.68 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.57 billion).
	   To help businesses, the government introduced tax rebates; cuts
in fees and surcharges; lower commercial property rentals;
increased government funding for some business enterprises; and
reduced port, telecommunication and electricity tariffs. It also
encouraged moderation of wages.
	   Hu also announced accelerated spending for several large
infrastructure projects, such as the country's national rail
system. The government also will introduce additional enterprises,
including a number of projects for educational facilities and
industrial developments.
	   In addition, it plans to boost the ailing property market by
suspending the sale of almost all land for private residential use,
government-subsidized condos and commercial developments for the
rest of 1998 and 1999.
	   Hu said the government will resume the supply of land when the
property market recovers. It also will suspend some developers'
levies and defer stamp duties for purchasers of property.
	   In the financial sector, the government said it will help banks
with bad loans by increasing tax deductions allowed on their
provisions, and it will suspend stamp duties on stock market
transactions.
	   Singapore was suffering because ``the external economic
environment has deteriorated significantly ... (and) the regional
economic situation has worsened,'' Hu said.
	   Citing recent instability in Indonesia, recession in various
Asian economies, the depreciating Japanese currency and other
global economic patterns, he said Singapore's problems have been
``largely outside our control.''
	   Singapore's key electronics and finance sectors have ``weakened
significantly'' as trade slowed. Initial figures for the second
quarter show growth slackening to 1.9 percent.
	   Hu said that in the second half of the year, the economy would
remain very weak, dragging growth for the year's gross domestic
product close to nil.

Precede AMMAN, Jordan Khalaf in Kuwait on first visit by Cabinet minister and Kuwait's foreign minister.

Eds: UPDATES with minister arriving, CORRECTS names of fund's head
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Jordan's planning minister arrived Monday in
Kuwait on the first visit by a Jordanian Cabinet official since
relations soured during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   The minister, Rima Khalaf, will meet Abdullatif al-Hamad, the
head of the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development, and sign agreements for loans to Jordanian projects,
an official at Khalaf's office said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   She will also meet Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and
her Kuwait counterpart, Ali Moussa, during her three-day visit.
Meetings with Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, and the crown
prince, Sheikh Saad, are possible, the official said.
	   Jordan fell out with Kuwait for its perceived tilt toward Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the seven-month
occupation that followed. Kuwait closed the Jordanian Embassy and
recalled its ambassador from Amman following the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Relations warmed up somewhat in 1995 when Jordan distanced
itself from Baghdad, publicly criticizing the policies of its
neighbor and calling for political change in Iraq.
	   But Kuwait's Parliament snubbed the gestures from Jordan _ a
resource-barren country which once depended on aid from Kuwait and
other oil-rich states _ saying it was not ready for normalization.

Two pro-Israeli militiamen killed in south Lebanon bomb 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
in southern Lebanon Monday near an armored patrol, killing two
Israeli-backed militiamen, security officials said.
	   The attack occurred on a road near the South Lebanon Army
militia's mountaintop outpost at Toumat Niha on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied border zone, said the Lebanese officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group fighting Israel's
occupation, claimed responsibility. It said an armored vehicle was
destroyed, and members of its crew were killed or wounded.
	   Last Thursday, Hezbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four in a similar bombing in the occupied zone.
	   Eight Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen of the SLA, which is
armed, trained and paid by Israel, have been killed this year.
	   The zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory _ was established by Israel in 1985. It is patrolled by
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Survey: People less confident in Hong Kong's future 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ People are becoming less confident about Hong
Kong's future, one year after the territory's return to Chinese
rule, a survey showed Monday.
	   In the survey by the University of Hong Kong, 48.6 percent of
530 people interviewed said their confidence in Hong Kong's future
has decreased since the handover, compared with 18.9 percent of
those polled last July.
	   The margin of error for the poll was given as 4.2 percent.
	   Meanwhile, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said on the eve of the
first anniversary of Hong Kong's handover that the territory has
faced many unexpected challenges, with Asia's financial crisis at
the top of the list.
	   The crisis has thrown Hong Kong's once booming economy into a
recession. The economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter, the
first contraction in 14 years. Unemployment is at a 15-year high,
and the key stock index has lost nearly half of its value.
	   But Tung said he remains confident that ``Hong Kong has the
strengths to ride out the storm with our established institutions
of free market, rule of law, prudent fiscal management and robust
regulatory systems.''
	   The financial crisis has ``accelerated the pace of the
correction'' of high property prices, high inflation and high wage
increases in the past few years, he said.
	   He added China has been supportive of Hong Kong, and has allowed
the territory ``to make our own decisions and to chart our own
course.''
	   Tung issued his statement shortly after he left for Beijing to
brief Chinese leaders on the latest developments in Hong Kong. He
will return Tuesday in the company of President Jiang Zemin and
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who will attend the celebrations marking
the first anniversary of Hong Kong's handover.
	   In another development, the Hong Kong Journalists Association
said it has collected signatures from 505 local and foreign
journalists for a petition demanding the release of mainland
journalist Gao Yu.
	   It said the petition will be published by the Hong Kong
newspaper Apple Daily to coincide with the visit of the Chinese
president.
	   Gao, a former deputy editor of Beijing's Economic Weekly and a
freelance journalist for newspapers and magazines on the mainland
and in Hong Kong, was imprisoned for six years in 1994 for
``leaking state secrets.''

Russian researchers to study Black Sea pollution 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Researchers from the Emergency Situations Ministry
will begin a 20-day expedition Wednesday to locate toxic waste
dumps in the Black Sea and measure pollution levels, officials said
Monday.
	   Scientists consider the Black Sea one of the most endangered
ecosystems. Untreated sewage, pesticides and toxic waste dumps have
wiped out several fish and wildlife species, and contribute to high
rates of asthma, tuberculosis and outbreaks of cholera along the
coast.
	   There are eight known toxic dumps along the Russian coast of the
sea, the Emergency Situations Ministry said in a statement. An
expedition last year found that concentrations of Cesium-137 and
Strontium-90 in bottom sediments at two of the dumps were dozens of
times above normal levels, the statement said.
	   Researchers on the Rescuer Prokopchik ship will look for more
toxic dumps and other ``potentially dangerous underwater objects''
in Russia's sector of the sea, the ministry said.
	   These objects will include the Admiral Nakhimov ship, which sank
in 1997 with 300 tons (1,900 barrels) of oil on board, the ministry
said. No oil leaks from the ship have been registered so far, but
Russia still wants to conduct regular monitoring, it said.

World Cup: England looking to redress Argentina's 1986 ``Hand of God'' win 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ England manager Glenn Hoddle is
convinced his players can rise to the occasion and overcome
two-time champion Argentina Tuesday night for a place in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   French security officials consider the match a high-risk affair
as thousands of ticketless English fans _ including some of the
hooligans who wreaked havoc two weeks ago in Marseille _ converge
on this industrial city in south-central France.
	   The Argentinians were the only nation among the 16 survivors of
the qualifying round to win all three first round matches, which
they accomplished without conceding a goal.
	   Daniel Passarella, who captained Argentina's 1978 World Cup
winning team on home soil, believes his team is moving in the right
direction to see off England's challenge.
	   ``We have got better and better and I am feeling good about what
we could do in the competition.''
	   But the South Americans were not really stretched by the
opposition _ Japan, Jamaica, and Croatia.
	   In contrast, England was provided with a more testing
examination, a 2-1 defeat against seeded Romania, sandwiched
between impressive 2-0 victories over Tunisia and Colombia.
	   Hoddle had full confidence in his players.
	   ``I haven't seen any reason to suggest we can't beat
Argentina,'' he said after Sunday's training session. ``It's all
about who is going to take their opportunities when they get
them.''
	   Tuesday's encounter is the first competitive match between
England and Argentina since their 1986 World Cup quarterfinal clash
in Mexico City where Argentina triumphed 2-1, helped by the
Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal.
	   Hoddle, who played in the 1986 match, said victory for England
in Saint-Etienne would even out old scores.
	   ``That feeling of injustice has stayed with us a long time,'' he
said. ``We have got a chance of readdressing that balance and
turning that result round and getting it out of our system.''
	   Hoddle's confidence was fortified by England's high-class
performance against Colombia, fielding a very attacking team.
	   '' We knew we could hunt the ball collectively well against them
because they play a flat four at the back,'' Hoddle said.
``Argentina play a little bit deeper, with three at the back and
they stretch the pitch. There will be certain things we will work
at. Sometimes you don't have to change the team, you can change the
shape.''
	   Hoddle praised they way Passarella had moulded his team. ``He
has disciplined their players and brought them up in the way he
wants.''
	   Noting Argentina had not conceded a goal for eight matches,
Hoddle said: ``There comes a time when you do concede goals and if
we can keep creating chances we can score.''
	   Passarella's only injury worry is defender Roberto Sensini, who
was able to take time out for the match with Croatia, both teams
having already qualified for the second round.
	   It is difficult to assess how Argentina will react under
pressure on the basis of its group matches, especially against
World Cup debutants Japan and Jamaica who fell victim to the lethal
finishing of Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Batistuta, who has topped the scorers in the Italian league for
two of the last three seasons, netted the winner against Japan and
claimed a hat-trick in the 5-0 win over Jamaica, playmaker Ariel
Ortega weighing in with the other two Argentine goals.
	   ``For us, it's just another match, with nothing beyond soccer
involved,'' Batistuta said.
	   Meanwhile, Ortega predicted another spectacular goal, much as
the one Maradona had scored shortly after the 1986 ``Hand of God''
incident, when he dribbled past half a dozen English defenders.
	   ``I will try to score a goal like Maradona. Say, if I dribble
past one, two English, I will try to keep going,'' he said.
	   Much will depend on whether England's defense, marshalled by
Tony Adams, can nullify Batistuta and whether Sensini can perform
the same task for Argentina against sharp-shooting Alan Shearer.
	   ``England has many good things, as it showed against Colombia,
but also has weak spots. Such as getting complicted when you attack
them with low balls,'' noted midfielder Juan Veron.

Japanese business survey shows deteriorating confidence throughout, CHANGES byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with comment from business group leader, RECASTS
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Its economy is stuck in its worst recession in
decades, its currency is foundering and its government is
scrambling to save banks from an avalanche of bad debt.
	   What else could possibly go wrong?
	   A crisis of confidence, suggests a survey by Japan's central
bank. And it is already spreading.
	   In its closely watched quarterly report, the Bank of Japan said
Monday that corporate sentiment has deteriorated to its worst level
in four years, with most companies saying they have seen economic
conditions worsen over the quarter.
	   The survey showed much of corporate Japan remains worried over
anemic growth at home and the prospects for recovery in other Asian
nations hit by a financial crisis.
	   The report's ``business condition diffusion index'' fell to
minus 38 in June from minus 31 in the previous quarter. The
negative number means more major manufacturers saw conditions
worsen than saw conditions improve.
	   Plagued by slumping consumer demand and problems in its banking
system, Japan is in its worst recession since the end of World War
II.
	   Politicians have tried to restore confidence, both at home and
overseas, by promising to speed up measures to resolve bank
bad-loan problems.
	   But they have won few believers.
	   On Monday, the leader of an influential business group
criticized the government's pledge as too vague to instill
confidence that Japan will soon recover.
	   ``Japan and countries abroad don't know what concrete economic
measures Japan intends to take,'' said Takashi Imai, chairman of
the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations.
	   As long as Japan remains unclear about how it will stabilize its
financial system, the yen will likely fall further against the
dollar, Imai said.
	   Monday's survey marked the fourth consecutive drop in sentiment
and the lowest level since a minus 39 in August 1994. The worst
ever result, a minus 67, was recorded in 1975.
	   To restore faith in its financial markets, Japan has pledged
establishment of a ``bridge bank'' to resolve bad loans. But
politicians and finance officials have yet to agree on how the
institution would work.
	   Administrative Vice Finance Minister Koji Tanami said Monday the
bridge bank should take over the operations of only those financial
institutions that fail.
	   Ruling Liberal Democratic Party politicians want the bank to do
more than just clean up after bankruptcies and have said it should
be given authority to help any bank struggling with bad loans.
	   Last week, Japan got a glimpse of how urgent its bank problems
have become when shares of one of the largest lenders, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, tumbled sharply amid rumors bad loans were
threatening to sink it.
	   On Friday, Sumitomo Trust and Banking said it would rescue the
troubled lender and accepted a government offer to pay for some of
LTCB's bad loans.
	   Financial markets gave the plan a mixed reception.
	   The news halted the decline in LTCB's shares _ the stock rose
32.9 percent to 97 yen Monday _ but triggered a 6 percent fall in
Sumitomo Trust's stock as investors worried the merger will be
costly to the bank.
	   To be sure, there was a glimmer of hope in Monday's Bank of
Japan report.
	   The 9,264 companies surveyed said they expect the diffusion
index to improve to minus 34 next quarter, reflecting their ``high
expectations'' for a government stimulus package designed to jump
start the economy, said Shosaku Murayama, director for research and
statistics at the central bank.

Two pro-Israeli militiamen killed in south Lebanon bomb

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon Monday in apparent retaliation for a
roadside bomb that killed two Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   Two fighter jets fired two missiles at a Hezbollah guerrilla
position in mountains on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
zone, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid in the area between Toumat Niha, where Israeli-backed
militiamen have outposts, and guerrilla-held Mashghara in the
mountains just north of the town of Jezzine.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (about 13 miles) north of Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone.
	   Earlier, a roadside bomb exploded near the South Lebanon Army
militia's outpost at Toumat Niha, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah, which is fighting Israel's occupation with Iranian
support, said its guerrillas detonated the bomb by an armored
patrol of the Israeli-backed militia. The group said a vehicle was
destroyed and members of its crew were killed or wounded.
	   Last Thursday, Hezbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four in a similar bombing in the occupied zone.
	   Eight Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen of the SLA, which is
armed, trained and paid by Israel, have been killed this year.
	   The zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory _ was established by Israel in 1985. It is patrolled by
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Serbs amass weaponry near coal mine held by Kosovo rebels 
</HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Explosions rocked a rebel-held area
just outside Pristina on Monday as Serb forces launched a new
offensive against militant ethnic Albanians seeking independence
for Kosovo.
	   The operation was directed against a coal mine at Belacevac
village, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the capital of Kosovo
province, and several nearby villages controlled by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   It marked a new front in the months-long struggle for the
Serbian province between Serb security forces and militant ethnic
Albanians led by the KLA.
	   At a police check point only about 200 meters (yards) away from
the mine, explosions could be heard at eight-second intervals.
Police were seen surrounding a KLA entrenchment just outside the
village. Smoked billowed overhead.
	   Sources close to the ethnic Albanian leadership said that armed
Serb civilians were backing regular Serbian forces. Tanks had been
drawn up at Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac, they
said.
	   The Belacevac open-pit mine is strategically important because
it supplies coal to the nearby Obilic power plant, which in turn
provides electricity for most of the province. An 8-year-old child
was reported wounded Monday by gunfire in Lismir, a village near
Obilic.
	   At Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main hot-spot _ tensions remained
bubbling, with fighters from the Kosovo Liberation army deeply
entrenched and bracing for a new attack after black-painted
Yugoslav helicopters strafed them on the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and other support by a ring of
Albanian fighters. A child and an adult _ both apparently ethnic
Albanians _ were reported killed in the region Sunday.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo and connects the main Kosovo cities of
Pristina and Pec. Security forces say the Kijevo posts are vital to
communications between the guerrillas on opposite sides of the
road.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28
to try to extinguish growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of the
southern province in Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left
of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly supported by ethnic Albanians,
who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has met with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leaders in attempts to find
a peaceful way to end the conflict.
	   In Vienna on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
swift international steps to prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo,
but reiterated that the Security Council must approve any military
action.
	   The council was set to take up the Kosovo issue later in the day
in New York. The United States maintains that the Security
Council's blessing is not needed for NATO action aimed at halting
the Kosovo conflict, but council member Russia disagrees.
	   Annan, speaking at a news conference at United Nations offices
in Vienna, said the focus remains on diplomacy, and the possibility
of military action should be considered carefully.

Maradona looking for a top job in England 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Diego Maradona, England's nemesis against
Argentina in the 1986 soccer World Cup, wants to manage a team in
the English Premier League.
	   On the eve of England's knock-out match against Argentina at the
France '98 World Cup, Maradona said his playing career was near an
end and his ambition was to coach in the English premier division.
	   The Sun newspaper reported the 37-year-old star, who recently
admitted he hand-balled the goal which contributed to England's
1986 quarterfinal loss to Argentina, was aiming for a job in
England.
	   ``The League there has captured the imagination of every top
footballer in the world and I'd love to be part of it,'' Maradona
said in a backpage article in the Sun.
	   Maradona, speaking from Buenos Aires, was not slow to offer his
credentials to prospective employers, the paper said.
	   ``I can offer a wealth of experience at the highest level. I
would be able to tap into the huge array of talent from my own
country and around Europe where I've played,'' Maradona said.
	   ``Football is my life and will remain my life but I have to move
on from being just a player now. Becoming a coach is the next step
and I could think of no better place to do it than England.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin on Monday defended International Monetary Fund policy in
Asia, treading on delicate ground in a country whose leader has
repeatedly lambasted the IMF.
	   ``On balance, what the IMF has done is about right,'' Rubin told
a news conference after meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. ``They don't have a one-formula-fits-all
program.''
	   Mahathir has repeatedly blamed IMF-like policies for his
Southeast Asian country's slumping economy and pointed to the
IMF-backed austerity measures in neighboring Indonesia, which led
to soaring inflation and deadly riots.
	   Rubin said countries with weak monetary policy were to blame for
failing economies, not the IMF.
	   ``If you have a looser monetary policy, the risks that you take
are substantial,'' he said. Those risks include capital flight,
currency slides and difficulty to repay debt.
	   ``Each country is immensely complex,'' Rubin said. ``The IMF
makes judgments for each situation.''
	   Last Thursday, Mahathir accused economic policies endorsed by
the IMF of devastating the Malaysian economy, which shrank by 1.8
percent in the first quarter of this year.
	   Rubin arrived Monday evening in Thailand, which has closely
followed the conditions attached to a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout
loan arranged by the IMF, but has failed to pull out of a
recession.
	   David Lipton, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs,
told reporters traveling with Rubin that the brief visit will be
``a chance for us to take stock of how Thailand is doing'' a year
after the Asian crisis erupted when Thailand ended the baht's peg
to the dollar last July 2 and allowed the baht to depreciate.
	   In recent speeches, Malaysia's Mahathir has accused foreigners
of engineering the Asian financial crisis so that they could
recolonize the region.
	   Economists are predicting a full-blown recession for Malaysia as
the full impact of the Asian financial crisis hits. Malaysia,
unlike its economically battered neighbors, Indonesia and Thailand,
has resisted turning to the IMF for a financial bailout.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim introduced an austerity program
in December to curb inflation and protect the ringgit, which has
lost some 38 percent of its value in the last year. Many economists
welcomed it as an IMF-like program.
	   Mahathir, however, has favored a softer monetary policy and has
urged banks to increase lending to struggling companies so that
they can grow out of the crisis.
	   He also has called for lower interest rates, which currently
range from 12 to 16 percent.
	   When asked whether the interest rates should be kept high in
Malaysia, Rubin said, ``It's an issue that needs to be resolved by
the Malaysian authorities. It's a question of reaching the right
balance.''
	   Mahathir, however, told reporters that Rubin had agreed with his
contention that high interest rates were harmful.
	   Earlier in the day, Rubin urged Malaysia to reform its economy
and introduce ``sound'' monetary policies.
	   Malaysia should reduce limits on foreign investment in its
banking and financial sector and issue credit on a ``purely
commercial basis,'' Rubin said at the start of a meeting with
Malaysian businessmen and officials.
	   He warned that it would be ``far worse'' if Malaysia did not
reform because of the current economic crisis.
	   ``Reform is the answer,'' he said.
	   After Thailand, Rubin heads to South Korea for the next leg of
his Asia tour. He flew into Kuala Lumpur Sunday after a weekend of
talks with Chinese officials in Beijing.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Energy Ministry officials headed for
Baghdad Monday for talks on constructing an oil pipeline between
the two neighbors.
	   Ahmed Bashir, the ministry's secretary-general, said before
leaving to Iraq that he will also discuss Jordanian assistance in
exploring for oil in a field on the Jordanian-Iraqi frontier.
	   He said Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani will follow him
on Wednesday to conclude any agreements they reach.
	   Bashir said the focus of the discussions is the possible
construction of a pipeline stretching from the western Iraqi town
of Haditha to Jordan's refinery in Zarqa, 27 kilometers (17 miles)
northeast of Amman.
	   The 650-kilometer (400-mile) pipeline is expected to cost dlrs
250 million. Officials said Jordan was seeking financing from
Germany, Japan and other donors for the pipeline, which will
replace the trucks that today carry oil across the desert from
Baghdad.
	   The government says the current method is hazardous since it has
resulted in several serious fires on the highway. The cost of
street and truck maintenance runs to dlrs 56 million a year.
	   Jordan imports all its daily need of 85,000 barrels of crude and
fuel oil from Iraq.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Iraq opened talks Monday on
increasing the number of vehicles transporting goods between the
two countries under a transportation agreement.
	   Iraqi Transport Minister Ahmad Murtada told reporters before
opening talks with his Jordanian counterpart, Sami Gammo, that the
three-day discussions will also focus on the financial record of a
joint transport committee between the two countries.
	   He said he will discuss with Gammo the distribution of profits
made by the joint Jordanian-Iraqi Transport Co. last year, but
declined to disclose a number.
	   The firm, established in the late 1980s with dlrs 50 million
capital, made more than dlrs 2 million in 1996 from its 345-vehicle
fleet which transports goods between the two neighbors.
	   Iraq grew dependent on the fleet in 1990, when Jordan became a
lifeline for Iraqi food and medical imports in view of sweeping
U.N. sanctions on Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait. The embargo
included a ban on air travel to Iraq.
	   The firm also transports 85,000 barrels of Iraqi fuel and crude
oil to Jordan daily.

Massive abstention in abortion referendum prompts question: What now?

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ After the result of Sunday's referendum
on abortion was voided because of a low turnout, lawmakers on
Monday grappled with a dilemma _ what to do now?
	   After years of squabbling in parliament over whether to relax
abortion restrictions in this mostly Roman Catholic country,
politicians believed the national referendum _ the country's first
_ would finally settle the contentious issue.
	   But a record abstention rate of almost 70 percent dumped the
issue back in parliament's lap, baffled lawmakers and further
clouded the abortion debate.
	   Daily paper Diario de Noticias devoted its entire front page to
a question mark and below it the question, ``What now, lawmakers?''
	   The apparent lack of public interest also cast doubt on plans to
hold referendums in October on the European Union's Amsterdam
Treaty and the creation of administrative regions.
	   President Jorge Sampaio, who had appealed for a high turnout in
the abortion ballot, said he believed referendums were still
worthwhile.
	   ``This first referendum did not motivate the electorate,''
Sampaio said in a statement Monday. ``We have to reflect, calmly
and seriously, on this fact''.
	   The National Electoral Commission said 68.1 percent of the
country's 8.4 million voters did not participate in the ballot on
whether to ease abortion restrictions.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, dating from 1984, termination of
pregnancy is permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or
in cases of rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   In a landmark decision, lawmakers in February narrowly approved
a bill allowing abortion on demand through the 10th week. However,
opponents successfully pushed for the referendum, which was
intended to either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   Of those who did vote, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
	   Abortion rights activists and pro-life campaigners disputed
whether the abstention rate meant that voters were happy with the
1984 law or with February's proposed changes.
	   The two leading daily papers agreed that February's proposed
legislation should be dropped.
	   ``With this referendum, the (proposed) law which engendered it
has died,'' said Publico in an editorial.
	   ``With this result, should the law be enacted? The answer
appears obvious: No it shouldn't,'' said Diario de Noticias.

Estrada hopes movie roles will help him as Philippines' 13th president 
</HEADLINE>
By CLARO CORTES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former action movie
star who transformed his box-office appeal into a successful
political career, begins on Tuesday what he says will be his
greatest performance _ as president of the Philippines.
	   And Estrada is hopeful the parts he played in more than 100
movies will help in his newest role.
	   Estrada, who will be inaugurated at a historic church, gained a
devoted following among the country's many poor as a movie star
portraying tough guys who stood up to injustice.
	   Among the parts the bouffant-haired actor played are a farmer, a
fisherman, a jeep driver, a labor leader, a communist rebel, a
street vendor and a slum dweller.
	   ``I was able to get the feel of the people,'' said Estrada, a
college dropout. ``I felt their problems, wants and complaints.''
	   Many poor people agree. Estrada, who ran on a pro-poor platform,
overwhelmingly won the May 11 presidential election against nine
rivals, despite the disdain of many in the country's upper class
who saw the former vice president as an undereducated buffoon with
a string of mistresses.
	   Estrada, who has been vice president for the past six years, has
acknowledged a history of womanizing, heavy drinking and gambling,
but insists he now has given up all his vices, including cigarette
smoking.
	   ``It's because I won't have any `vice' left in my title,'' he
jokes.
	   He has a disarming straightforwardness and an ability to poke
fun at himself, especially his own fractured English. He will be
the first Philippine president to deliver his inaugural speech in
the national language instead of English or Spanish.
	   Supporters say Estrada sees issues in clear-cut terms and is
sincere about helping poor people or friends in need.
	   ``He won't back down from a fight. If he gives his word, he will
fulfill it even if the odds are against him,'' said Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon, Estrada's high school classmate at the
Jesuit-run Ateneo de Manila.
	   Estrada was expelled from the school for fighting with an
American classmate who allegedly bullied a smaller Filipino
classmate.
	   Estrada admits having little expertise in economics and has
appointed 30 advisers, who range from leftist academics to
conservative bankers, to help him pilot the country through the
troubled waters of Asia's currency crisis.
	   For other matters, he consults friends, priests and even fortune
tellers.
	   The deeply superstitious Estrada grew a goatee during the
campaign because he was told by a feng shui expert it would bring
him luck. He picked certain locations for campaign appearances and
rejected others because of considerations of luck, and believes his
ever-present wristband is a good-luck charm.
	   He takes extra efforts not to be referred as the country's 13th
president, because of the misfortune associated with the number.
	   His landslide victory caused many to predict a long
``honeymoon'' period for him as president. But he has already faced
so many problems that political scientist Alex Magno says ``no
previous president has assumed office with a much dissonance in the
air.''
	   He has taken on much of the Philippine Congress with a pledge to
eliminate ``pork barrel'' funds often misused by congressmen.
	   All three unions at beleaguered Philippine Airlines _ owned by
an Estrada backer _ plan a demonstration at the presidential palace
Wednesday demanding that Estrada take action in response to the
carrier's massive layoffs.
	   The popular head of the Subic Bay freeport, fired by Estrada
because of personal differences, is refusing to quit.
	   And anger over Estrada's decision to permit the burial of former
dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery, despite widespread
opposition, has forced Estrada to seek a postponement.
	   Estrada ``has learned a painful lesson that bullying his
opponents with the powers of state is the worst way to govern
effectively in democratic systems,'' columnist Amando Doronila
says. ``It is well that he learned the lesson early.''

Doctors say giving pregnant women AZT reduces ranks of babies with HIV dlrs 50, not dlrs 80. TRIMS. No pickup. AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE, CORRECTS figure in 5th graf to
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Giving the expensive drug AZT to pregnant women
who have the HIV virus could dramatically reduce the number of
infected babies born around the world, doctors reported Monday.
	   Still, large hurdles remain in the effort to prevent infants
from getting AIDS, including finding safe alternatives to
breast-feeding.
	   Each day, 1,600 babies are born with HIV, the virus which causes
AIDS. Doctors have known since 1994 that intensive treatment with
AZT during pregnancy can substantially cut the risk that infected
mothers will pass the AIDS virus to their babies during birth.
	   However, at a typical cost of dlrs 800, this treatment is too
expensive for most nations where AIDS poses the biggest risk to the
unborn.
	   But a recent study from Thailand shows that a much shorter
course of treatment just before birth can cut the risk for only
about dlrs 50. Bringing this kind of treatment to the developing
world is one of the chief topics at this week's 15th World AIDS
Conference, the largest scientific gathering in the nearly two
decades of the epidemic.
	   Mercy Makhlamena of Durban, South Africa, who lost a child to
AIDS, predicted that poor women will be willing to take medicine
that can lower the risk of passing on HIV to their infants.
	   ``Women will move mountains to have a healthy child,'' she said.
``They will be motivated to enroll if they are told this could save
their babies' lives.''
	   However, Lynne Mofenson of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, said women must
know they are infected before they take AZT, and in most places,
routine testing for HIV is not available.
	   Furthermore, she said, the treatment needs to be part of
prenatal care, something one-third of women around the world do not
receive.
	   One of the most difficult issues is breast-feeding, which
international health organizations have promoted for years over
infant formula.
	   Even if babies escape HIV during childbirth, it can still be
transmitted during breast-feeding. A study to be presented
Wednesday found that three years of breast-feeding carries a 9
percent risk that babies will contract the virus.
	   One attempt to deal with these issues is a pilot program
announced Monday by the U.N. AIDS program. The project will
eventually make voluntary HIV testing, AZT treatment and milk
formula available to about 30,000 women in poor countries in Asia,
Africa and South America.
	   The project will be conducted in Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Ivory Coast, Honduras, Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe and perhaps other countries.
	   The week-long meeting is likely to involve a mixture of upbeat
reports on new drugs and combinations to protect infected people
and fetuses, along with gloomy assessments of the wildfire spread
of HIV in some parts of Asia, Africa and eastern Europe.
	   The AIDS program estimates that 12 million people around the
world have died of AIDS, and another 31 million are alive but
infected. Each day, 16,000 more people contract the virus.

World Cup: Juventus teammates Del Piero and Zidane on rival World Cup sides 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero and Zinedine Zidane
produced sparkling play and goals as teammates with league champion
Juventus of Turin this year.
	   In Friday's World Cup quarterfinals they play on opposing sides
and may sorely miss each other's help.
	   Zidane, returning to France's midfield command following a
two-game suspension, told a French television network that he
considered the young Italian forward one of the most imaginative
players in the tournament and a serious threat to France's hopes to
reach the semifinals.
	   Del Piero, seeking his first World Cup goal against the French,
said at Italy's training camp on Monday that he considered Zidane
France's key player.
	   ``He is a great player, and I hope he does not prove it against
Italy,'' the 23-year-old forward said.
	   ``With Zidane supporting me I had some great seasons with La
Juve. I will miss him in the next match, but he too may feel my
absence,'' Del Piero said.
	   Del Piero tallied 21 goals in league matches and became the
Champions League top scorer ever with 10 goals this year. Zidane
added seven goals and lots of assists. They form one of the most
impressive duos in the Italian league.
	   Looking forward to Friday's match at Saint-Denis, Del Piero said
``it will be the toughest match for Italy, against the home team.''
	   ``They have individual talents and an excellent teamwork. We
will play at our best to win. We start with equal chances,'' Del
Piero said.
	   Zidane is not the only player who is well known by the Italians,
since other French internationals play for Italian clubs.
	   Didier Deschamps plays with Juventus, Lilian Thuram with Parma,
Marcel Desailly with AC Milan, Youri Djorkaeff with Inter Milan and
Alain Boghossian with Sampdoria.
	   Del Piero, just recovered from a thigh strain, was busy denying
allegations about his questionable form and rejecting criticism
about the scoring chances missed in Saturday's match against
Norway.
	   ``It's true that I missed some easy chances, but not because I'm
unfit. I'm physically okay and ready to play a full match,'' Del
Piero said.
	   Originally considered Italy's best player and one of the
would-be World Cup stars, Del Piero has been overshadowed so far by
striker Christian Vieri, who tallied five goals in four matches,
and by Roberto Baggio, his would-be substitute.
	   ``It has not been Del Piero's World Cup. I hope it can be
Vieri's or Italy's World Cup. What really counts for me is that the
team goes on in the tournament,'' he said.
	   He also noted that Italy's World Cup hero Paolo Rossi did not
score in the first four matches before becoming the top striker in
the 1982 edition with six goals in the next three games including
the final won against West Germany.
	   ``Everything still can happen,'' Del Piero noted.

Chinese dissident arrested trying to register democratic party pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with arrest of veteran dissident; no
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police detained a democracy campaigner
who tried to set up an opposition political party Monday in the
latest dissident roundup during U.S. President Bill Clinton's China
visit.
	   Plainclothes police showed up at Wang Youcai's home in eastern
Hangzhou city at around 1 p.m. and then three hours later took him
away, exiled dissident groups in the United States and Hong Kong
said.
	   Having been turned away by officials Friday, Wang planned to try
again Monday afternoon to register his China Democracy Party with
provincial authorities, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   The application marked the first time Chinese dissidents have
openly tried to gain government approval for an opposition party,
the Free China Movement, based in Washington, said.
	   Wang, student leader of the massive democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square in 1989, was at least the sixth dissident taken
into custody since Wednesday, the eve of Clinton's arrival.
	   The detention came as Clinton left Beijing for Shanghai, China's
financial center. Clinton took up the previous arrests with
President Jiang Zemin at their summit Saturday, but Jiang afterward
defended the police action as important for security.
	   During his five days in China, Clinton has emphasized the need
for the government to allow more freedoms. Addressing students and
faculty at Peking University on Monday, Clinton called a freer
society necessary to maintaining economic prosperity in the future.
	   Clinton, however, has refused appeals by Chinese democracy and
human rights campaigners to show support for change by meeting with
a dissident.
	   In the latest such appeal, a group of 125 Chinese dissidents
called on Clinton to meet former Communist Party leader Zhao
Ziyang, who was ousted by party elders for resisting the military
crackdown on the Tiananmen protesters.
	   Zhao has lived under a loose form of house arrest since being
purged nine years ago and remains a potent symbol of a more
tolerant era in Chinese politics. Last week, he reportedly sent
party leaders a letter urging a reassessment of the protests.
	   In an open letter, dated Sunday and released Monday, the 125
dissidents said Zhao would have pushed democratic reforms together
with economic ones and in the process corruption and unemployment
would have been less severe.
	   Wang Youcai spent 2 1/2 years in prison for helping lead the
1989 protests and has had repeated run-ins with police ever since.
	   Four of the six dissidents detained by police in the past six
days were arrested in Xi'an, Clinton's first stop, and released
after the president left.
	   Authorities in Guilin, however, have told the family of
democracy campaigner Li Xiaolong that he will not be freed until
sometime after Clinton tours the scenic southern city Thursday.

Palestinian legislature belatedly approves 1998 budget 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Halfway into the fiscal year, the
Palestinian legislature on Monday approved a 1998 state budget of
dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   The vote in the 88-member Legislative Council was 37-22, with
six abstentions. Twenty-three members were absent.
	   Agriculture Minister Abdel Jawad Saleh was among those who
abstained. His government's spending plan ``does not include enough
projects to develop the Palestinian economy,'' he said.
	   Half of the budget comes from foreign aid, and most of the
locally generated income goes to funding the government payroll,
including a 40,000-strong police force.
	   Legislators had been demanding to see the budget before the
beginning of the 1998 fiscal year, but the executive branch headed
by Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat shelved their
request.

Russian ambassador leaves Belarus residence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Russia does not plan to recall its
ambassador to Belarus even though he has been forced to abandon his
residence in a secluded compound and move into an apartment, the
Russian Embassy said Monday.
	   Ambassador Valery Loshchinin left his residence in the Drozdy
diplomatic compound on the outskirts of Minsk after Belarusian
officials cut off water and electricity supplies, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Loshchinin's move into Minsk was the latest development in the
housing dispute between foreign diplomats and President Alexander
Lukashenko, who declared the diplomatic compound as his personal
residence.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan left Belarus last week to consult with
their governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish
ambassadors have also been recalled home.
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman in Moscow said the Kremlin
did not plan to recall Loshchinin, and hoped the dispute could be
settled diplomatically.
	   Belarusian Prime Minister Sergei Ling said Monday that
Lukashenko acted within the law when he declared the compound his
personal residence.
	   ``Therefore, foreign ambassadors will not live there and they
should understand this,'' he said.
	   The diplomats maintain that Lukashenko's orders violate
international law, which designates ambassadors' residences as the
sovereign territory of their home countries.
	   Belarus contends that the houses are not only on Lukashenko's
property, but also are in need of urgent sewer and plumbing
repairs.

Two pro-Israeli militiamen killed by bomb blast in south Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon Monday in apparent retaliation for a
roadside bomb that killed two Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   Two fighter jets fired two missiles at a Hezbollah guerrilla
position in mountains on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
zone, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid in the area between Toumat Niha, where Israeli-backed
militiamen have outposts, and guerrilla-held Mashghara in the
mountains just north of the town of Jezzine.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (about 13 miles) north of Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone.
	   Earlier, a roadside bomb exploded near the South Lebanon Army
militia's outpost at Toumat Niha, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah, which is fighting Israel's occupation with Iranian
support, said its guerrillas detonated the bomb near an armored
patrol of the Israeli-backed militia. The group said a vehicle was
destroyed and members of its crew were killed or wounded.
	   Last Thursday, Hezbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four in a similar bombing in the occupied zone.
	   Eight Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen of the SLA, which is
armed, trained and paid by Israel, have been killed this year.
	   The zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory _ was established by Israel in 1985. It is patrolled by
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.

Germany bars six soccer fans from traveling to World Cup in France 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Six Germans known for causing trouble
at past soccer games were prevented from traveling to France for
Monday's World Cup match between Germany and Mexico, the German
border patrol said.
	   Germany has tightened border checks and heightened surveillance
of soccer hooligans in response to rioting by German fans last week
at a match in Lens, France, during which a French policeman was
severely beaten.
	   The six fans, ages 22 to 35, were stopped before the border
early Monday and not allowed to cross into France. They were known
to police as having been involved in violent incidents at German
soccer league matches, the border agency said.
	   Two of the men, from the Stuttgart area, were stopped overnight
at a border crossing at Iffezheim in southwestern Germany. A man
from Munich was halted on a night train to Strassburg, France.
Three men from eastern Germany were pulled from a busload of fans
heading for the border, the agency said.
	   None of them had tickets for the Monday afternoon match. They
were notified that they are not allowed to leave Germany during the
World Cup and would be detained if caught again.
	   The southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg also has required 24
known hooligans to register with police each day that Germany
remains in the championship.

Fired pilots file suit against Philippine Airlines to recover jobs Fukuoka after more replacement pilots available, grafs 12-14 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with airline resuming flights to Los Angeles and
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In an attempt to regain their jobs,
hundreds of Philippine Airlines pilots who staged a devastating
22-day strike accused the airline Monday of shutting them out in an
illegal lockout.
	   The pilots' union also sought to prevent PAL from hiring
replacements, including Indonesian and Malaysian pilots.
	   PAL fired about 600 striking pilots after they ignored a labor
department order to return to work by June 9. The union was
protesting an airline plan to retire some pilots with 20 years of
service or 20,000 flight hours, which is allowed under a collective
bargaining agreement.
	   In a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations
Commission, a labor department agency, the union claimed the
strikers complied with the order when they ended their strike on
June 26 and tried to return to work.
	   The union said it was PAL that had violated the order by
refusing to accept back the pilots, one of the order's conditions.
	   PAL officials said they would be allowed back only if they
applied as new applicants.
	   A back-to-work order normally takes effect when it is served to
the union's legal counsel, but the counsel repeatedly foiled the
labor department's attempts to deliver the document until last
Thursday.
	   In the interim, the labor secretary ruled that the order had
been effectively served to the union in meetings with union
officials and in a newspaper advertisement.
	   The strike, which began June 5, worsened the financial
difficulties of Asia's oldest airline, bringing it to the brink of
closure. Airline officials say the strike caused more than 2
billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue.
	   At the height of the walkout, the airline laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to scale down its operations and stave off
more losses, causing the airline's flight attendants and ground
personnel to threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL said more employees may be laid off under an airline
rehabilitation plan that calls for a leaner work force, disposal of
40 out of 54 planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its
routes and sale of some subsidiaries. PAL says it now needs only
200 pilots.
	   The airline said it is resuming thrice-weekly flights to Los
Angeles starting Tuesday and twice weekly flights to Fukuoka,
Japan, starting July 9 because of the availability of more
replacement pilots.
	   It said it now has 110 pilots but many of them cannot fly
because the pilots' union has refused to return passports and
flying permits it collected during the strike. The union has denied
the allegation.
	   PAL reduced the 30 international destinations it was serving to
four and its 39 domestic points to 15 at the height of the strike.

Two Vatican envoys to attend czar's funeral 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Vatican envoys will attend the burial of Czar
Nicholas II and his family in St. Petersburg next month, a news
agency reported Monday.
	   The pope's representative in Russia, John Bokovsky, and
Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, head of the Roman Catholic church
in Russia, will join delegations from 22 other countries at the
event, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and other
representatives from President Boris Yeltsin's administration will
also be present.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy has decided not to attend
the event, citing doubts over the identities of the remains.
However, the church has said it will permit local priests to
conduct the funeral services.
	   Nicholas, his family and four servants were executed by a
Bolshevik firing squad in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg
on July 17, 1918.
	   In 1991, nine skeletons were recovered and batteries of forensic
tests in Russia and abroad have identified the remains as belonging
to the royal entourage.

Dalai Lama's spokesman: Tibet's history of independence can't be changed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Dalai Lama's spokesman on Monday
welcomed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's apparent willingness to
talk about the status of Tibet, but said exiled Tibetans cannot
accept his insistence that their homeland was always part of China.
	   Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama reportedly
enthusiastically applauded a debate on Tibet and other issues
between Jiang and visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton that was
televised live across China over the weekend. Like the Dalai Lama,
his spokesman T.C. Tethong saw in the televised disagreement hope
for new openness in China.
	   ``We applaud President Bill Clinton for asking the Chinese
government to enter into dialogue and negotiations with his
holiness the Dalai Lama,'' Tethong said in a statement faxed to
news agencies in New Delhi from the Dalai Lama's headquarters in
the northern town of Dharmsala.
	   ``We also applaud President Jiang Zemin for publicly recognizing
the fact that Tibet is an important issue needing a solution and
for indicating his willingness to have an exchange of views and
discussions on this.''
	   But Jiang also said that in order for talks to begin, the Dalai
Lama must acknowledge ``that Tibet is an inseparable part of China
_ at the same time he also must admit that Taiwan is a province of
China.''
	   The Dalai Lama has said he seeks autonomy within China rather
than independence for Tibet. The sticking point is his insistence
that Tibet was once free.
	   ``Nobody can change the past,'' Tethong said.
	   Tethong added that it is the Dalai Lama's position that Taiwan's
status is a matter to ``be discussed and decided between China and
the people of Taiwan.''
	   The New York Times reported Monday that the Dalai Lama, while
visiting the far northern Indian Buddhist enclave of Leh on Sunday,
said the televised Clinton-Jiang debate could prompt a change of
attitude among local Chinese officials in Tibet.
	   Jiang refrained from China's usual sharp criticism of the Dalai
Lama, and Clinton portrayed him as a spiritual leader and an
``honest man'' Jiang could even like.
	   The Dalai Lama was quoted as telling the Times that he saw
change in China that helped justify his moderate approach, which
some pro-independence Tibetans have begun to question.
	   A group of younger Tibetans staged a hunger strike to protest
Chinese rule of their homeland earlier this year, though the Dalai
Lama condemned their tactic as violent. When Indian police ended
the strike, a 50-year-old former monk set himself ablaze in protest
and later died.
	   ``I tell them that if you only look at events in Tibet, there is
cause for frustration,'' he was quoted as telling the Times. ``But
if you look wide enough there is great hope. Today's China,
compared to 15, 20 years ago, is a much changed China ....''
	   Tethong said the Dalai Lama would issue a formal statement on
Clinton's visit to China only after returning to Dharmsala from
Leh, where he was delivering spiritual talks.
	   Chinese soldiers seized Tibet in 1950, the year after the
communist takeover. After an abortive uprising in 1959, the Dalai
Lama led more than 100,000 Tibetans into exile.

Prosecution witness: collapse caused by structural problems 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNY BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A footbridge at the Maccabiah Games
collapsed because of structural problems, not because heavy police
vehicles used it at one point, an engineering professor testified
Monday.
	   ``If there had not been any all-terrain vehicles, the bridge
would have collapsed anyway,'' Yitzhak Sheinman, a professor of
engineering at the Technion Institute, told the Tel Aviv
Magistrate's Court.
	   The bridge buckled as about 100 Australian athletes crossed on
their way to the opening ceremony of the games last July 14. Four
Australian athletes died and dozens were injured after being
plunged into the polluted Yarkon River below.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   Attorny Abraham Landstein, defending bridge engineer Micha Bar
Illa, suggested that the crossing of police all-terrain vehicles
ahead of the opening triggered the collapse of the footbridge.
	   Sheinbein said that while the crossing of the vehicles may have
had some effect, it was dwarfed by the structural problems.
	   On Tuesday, the court was to tour the site of the bridge
collapse outside the Yad Eliyahu sports stadium in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Ramat Gan.

Eds: UPDATES with peso closing slightly higher
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks finished higher
Monday, buoyed by end-of-the-quarter portfolio revaluations and the
Japanese yen's advance against the dollar, traders said.
	   Philippine financial markets will be closed Tuesday for the
inauguration of President Joseph Estrada.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 36.76 points,
or 2.1 percent, to 1,760.13 after gaining 14.34 points Friday.
	   The market started weak but picked up at midsession, with the
index closing just off its high as fund managers window-dressed
their portfolios, traders said.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, president of Diversified Securities, said
there should be some follow-through buying in coming days.
	   But he doubts the gains can be sustained given the absence of
fresh market-moving news and the still-cautious attitude of most
investors.
	   ``There is not a big market reversal so far,'' he said.
	   The bright spot on the horizon was the yen's moring gain, Garcia
said.
	   ``If it has actually bottomed out, it will be one bit of
positive news,'' he said.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said
window-dressing should wind down in coming days, refocusing
investors' attention on events in the region and the first days of
the incoming administration of President Estrada.
	   ``Nothing has changed fundamentally so the market's direction
remains downward,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed slightly higher against the
dollar, buoyed by dollar selling by participants unwinding their
positions after the yen's short-lived strength, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 42.036 pesos for the day, down from Friday's
42.091 pesos.
	   Traders said the peso ``merely took its cue from the yen,''
noting that the peso's gains were tempered by the yen's renewed
weakness in afternoon trading.
	   The yen was higher against the dollar at 141 yen from 143 yen in
early trading, before slipping back to 142 yen by midday. It was
trading at 142.12 yen against the dollar late Monday.

Black militants disrupt race muder inquiry as white suspect testifies 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Black militants, jostling and shouting, on Monday
burst into an inquiry chamber where the first of five white youths
suspected of eluding conviction in the fatal stabbing of a black
teen-ager had uneasily begun testifying.
	   Dressed in dark suits and red bow ties, more than 20 militants
from a group called the Nation of Islam crowded the chamber. The
inquiry into the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, 18, has raised
serious questions of police incompetence and highlighted racial
antagonism in some rundown London districts.
	   Near the entrance to the inquiry, in a building in a shopping
mall at the Elephant and Castle, south London, police sprayed a
canister of teargas at a crowd of about 100 also trying to get into
the building. Protesters shouted, ``Police protect the murderers,''
as some 50 uniformed police formed a cordon.
	   Police reported two arrests, and the chairman, Sir William
Macpherson , suspended the inquiry for several hours while calm was
restored.
	   Protesters shouted to police, ``You are disrespecting black
people.'' Police bundled Jamie Acourt, 22, the first of the five
suspects, out of the witness box after one man lunged toward him.
	   Acourt and four other whites, then teen-agers, have all at some
point been either acquitted on lack of evidence or had the charges
dropped against them in the murder of Lawrence.
	   The teen-ager was standing at a bus stop when he was set upon by
white youths, one shouting racial expletives, according to a
witness.
	   Earlier this month during the inquiry, a senior police officer
apologized to Lawrence's parents, admitting that errors and
failures in the police investigation were unjustifiable. Scotland
Yard Assistant Police Commissioner Ian Johnston, added, ``We have
let you down.''
	   Lawrence's mother, Doreen Lawrence, appealed for calm during
Monday's disturbance.
	   ``At no time within my life or my son's life have we ever
disrupted anything whatsoever,'' she said, taking the witness
microphone. ``The whole idea of having these boys here is to ask
them questions about what happened, about what went on the night of
my son's death.''
	   Earlier, Acourt had begun giving brief and noncommittal
responses to questions, and was reminded by the chairman that he
could be charged with perjury.
	   Under British law, the youths cannot be charged again with the
murder. They were ordered, however, by a judge to testify to the
inquiry.

World Cup: Maradona's goals stand the test of time With Sports-Soccer-Argentina-England; Sports-Soccer-Maradona-England 
</HEADLINE>
By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Few may remember the game, or even
the score, but nobody who watched that World Cup match 12 years ago
will ever forget two goals so special they had to be given names:
``Hand of God'' and ``Diego's Wonder.''
	   Diego Armando Maradona, one of soccer's greatest players ever,
tallied twice as Argentina beat England 2-1 on June 22, 1986,
before 114,000 spectators in Mexico City's Azteca Stadium.
	   Argentina then advanced to the semifinals, where it dismissed
Belgium 2-0, again on two goals by Maradona, before taking the
world title with a 3-2 win against West Germany.
	   England and Argentina meet again Tuesday in a World Cup
quarterfinals match, this time in Saint-Etienne. The winner
advances to meet the winner of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game.
Maradona was expected in Saint-Etienne a few hours before the
match.
	   Maradona, who retired last year at 37, scored his first goal
that day after 51 minutes on a controversial header that beat
goalkeeper Peter Shilton. The second came four minutes later on a
sensational run from midfield.
	   Gary Lineker scored the lone English goal in the 81st minute,
winding up as the tournament's scoring champion with six goals.
	   But what remains first and foremost from that tournament are
Maradona's goals, still sparking debate, still leaving fans shaking
their heads.
	   The first one was a classic burst of timing and cunning. With
the referee too far away to get a clear view, Maradona raised his
left hand as he leapt up and for an instant ball, fist, and head
made contact; Argentina led 1-0.
	   The roar of the crowd drowned Shilton's pleas and the tally
stood.
	   ``It was the hand of God,'' a smiling Maradona said later.
	   England's current head coach, Glenn Hoddle, was on the field
that day as a player.
	   ``I'm convinced the Argentines would not have won 2-1 without
that 'Hand of God,''' Hoddle said. ``It was a tight game until that
handball which turned the situation completely.''
	   Even now, several replays are needed to determine the exact
moment Maradona pulled his sleight of hand. The enormous crowd and
millions more following the match on television were still arguing
still when ``Diego's Wonder'' befell the hapless English four
minutes later.
	   It was as beautiful and electrifying a goal as has ever been
seen in World Cup play.
	   Taking the ball near midfield, the short and stocky Maradona
dribbled past English defenders left and right, heading straight
for Shilton's goal.
	   The 'keeper ventured out to meet the blur of blue and white and
black of the Argentine's uniform, but with a twist of his waist
Maradona left him sprawled on the grass, the goalmouth wide open
before him.

Serena loses to end chance of all-Williams match AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Williams quotes; rain delay; edits to trim
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual on Monday, hobbling with a leg injury and
trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat Ruano-Pascual and set up a fourth-round encounter
against 18-year-old sister Venus, who was playing Chanda Rubin on
Monday.
	   A Williams meeting would have been their third this year and
Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Gail and Carol
Sherriff of Australia played in 1966.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for
England for once.''
	   Serena, playing her first Wimbledon and third Grand Slam,
declared that she had been on course to win the title.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena said Venus, who is seeded No. 6, could be a champion this
year.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   Serena fell behind right away and never recovered against the
47th-ranked Spaniard. At 4-5 in the first set, Williams took a
thee-minute injury timeout while a trainer sprayed and strapped her
left calf.
	   Williams said she suffered the injury while slipping on the
slick grass during the middle of the set.
	   Williams broke in the next game for 5-5, but Ruano-Pascual won
the next two games at love to take the set and ran off the first
four games of the second.
	   Williams was clearly slowed by the injury, favoring her left leg
and failing to run after some shots.
	   After winning the fifth game of the second set, Williams walked
over to the chair umpire and announced she could not continue. She
packed her bag quickly and left the court as her mother Oracene,
sitting in a wheelchair with a broken ankle sustained two weeks
ago, watched solemnly.
	   ``Early in the match, (the injury) wasn't getting any worse and
I thought I can keep going,'' Williams said. ``But when I saw it
wasn't getting any better, I figured it was time to stop play.''
	   Serena Williams neglected to shake hands with her opponent,
describing it as oversight because she had never retired during a
match before. She paid little credit to Ruano-Pascual.
	   ``She had a pretty good today but if I was in better shape, it
wouldn't have been happening at all,'' Williams said.
	   Ruano-Pascual seemed stunned at her victory. As she sat in her
chair, she shrugged and flashed an embarrassed grin.
	   Williams also pulled out of the women's doubles, in which she
was paired with her sister, but said she may still play in the
mixed doubles.
	   ``I think (the injury) will clear up in a short time,'' she
said. ``It's not hurting as bad as it was on the court. It's
already feeling a little better.''
	   On another rainy day at Wimbledon, French Open champion and No.
5 seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario moved into the fourth round with a
7-5, 6-2 win over Sylvia Plischke.
	   In early men's play, Todd Martin completed a rain-delayed third
round match against Todd Woodbridge, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1)
6-4.
	   Martin is the only American man left in the tournament other
than defending champion Pete Sampras, who was resuming his
third-round match against Thomas Enqvist.
	   In the day's featured Centre Court match, No. 6 Patrick Rafter,
the reigning U.S. Open champion, was due to face No. 12 Tim Henman
of Britain for a place in the quarterfinals.
	   The second week started under cloudy skies, and play was
suspended by rain in early afternoon.
	   Four days of play were delayed by rain last week, leaving the
tournament 13 matches behind schedule, but officials kept with
tradition and permitted no play Sunday.

Four killed in rebel attack in Rwanda 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels shot to death four people in
an attack in central Rwanda, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Monday.
	   The victims of the Saturday attack at Mushubati, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) west of the capital, Kigali, were two local leaders and
two other adults, the agency said.
	   The attack came four days after the rebels killed 18 people and
wounded 40 traveling in a bus in western Rwanda.
	   The Tutsi-led government and military have been fighting an
insurgency by former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen, many of
whom were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000
minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   Rebels attacks have spread in recent months from the
northwestern corner of the country, a traditional Hutu stronghold,
to western and central Rwanda.

Precede: NEW YORK Airbus close to winning strategic British Airways jet deal over Boeing byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with industry source, Airbus comment, ADDS background,
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe's Airbus Industrie is close to breaking
Boeing's grip on sales to British Airways, potentially a major step
in an intense battle over the world's commercial jetliner market,
an industry source said Monday.
	   Several U.S., British and French newspapers reported in the past
two days that Airbus was about to clinch a deal to sell as many as
100 jets to British Airways for dlrs 3.8 billion.
	   Up to now, British Airways had never bought an Airbus, with more
than two-thirds of its 300-plane fleet made by the Seattle-based
Boeing.
	   An industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Airbus was close to reaching agreement for 60-70 firm orders plus
optional orders. The planes would partially replace British
Airways' fleet of aging 737s with the Airbus A320 family, he said.
	   ``We are in negotiations, but no agreement has yet been
finalized,'' said Alain Dupiech, a spokesman for Airbus Industrie,
a European consortium based in Toulouse, France.
	   British Airways has not yet formally agreed to buy the
short-haul planes, but the proposal is to be on the agenda of the
company's board meeting on Friday, reported London's The Observer
and The Wall Street Journal in New York.
	   British Airways spokeswoman Kate Gay dismissed the imminent sale
report as ``purely speculative. ... No decision has been made
yet,'' she said. ``It's very much a level playing field.'' She said
more information could be released after the meeting.
	   The airline has said that it was seeking flexible ways of
financing the new purchase, and Airbus was reportedly offering a
lease deal.
	   The jets are to be used by regional subsidiaries in Britain,
France and Germany.
	   It was not immediately clear how much the sale would change
Airbus' share of the commercial jetliner market, currently at about
45 percent according to airline analysts.
	   But Boeing, long the global leader, has been fighting back.
	   During President Bill Clinton's trip to Beijing, the U.S.
jetmaker on Monday signed a dlrs 1.2 billion sale of 27 aircraft to
the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
	   Last fall, China signed a letter of intent to buy dlrs 3 billion
of new planes.

Fourth person arrested in case of slain Russian journalist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fourth person has been arrested in connection
with the killing of a prominent journalist in the southern Russian
republic of Kalmykia, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper,
was found dead June 8 in the regional capital of Elista with
multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   She was a prominent critic of Kalmyk President Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, who is also president of the World Chess Federation,
FIDE, and who announced plans recently to run for president of
Russia in 2000.
	   Sergei Lapin, a 24-year-old inmate at a high security prison who
was on leave at the time of Yudina's killing, is the fourth person
detained in the case, ITAR-Tass said.
	   One of the others under arrest is a former aide to Ilyumzhinov.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday aboard a ship adrift for days off the island's coast. Two
passengers reportedly died of thirst and were thrown overboard.
	   The Syrian ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol
early Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were hospitalized for dehydration and exposure, a
hospital official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for days before it was spotted by a Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Sierra Leone,
Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Earlier, two other African passengers died of thirst and their
bodies were thrown overboard, Suheib Anwar Saleh, a 25-year-old
Iraqi passenger, told The Associated Press.
	   The ship, with a crew of six, was officially headed for Libya,
but Saleh said passengers were destined for Crete or Italy and paid
as much as dlrs 2,400 for the journey.
	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   The ship's Syrian captain, Mohammed Mustafa, was ordered
detained Monday for eight days pending the investigation.
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.

Four Cambodians charged with murder of Iraqi in visa scam changing victim's middle initial to J, and sums allegedly owed in 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Four Cambodian men have been
arrested and accused of the kidnap and murder of an Iraqi citizen
whose bound and bloated body was discovered a week ago on a rural
highway, police said Monday.
	   The victim, Falah J. Mohamad, 36, was accused by his assailants
of running a visa swindle and making off with thousands of dollars
collected from 17 Cambodian students seeking to study in the United
States.
	   At a police news conference, the arrested men said they had not
meant to kill the victim, but that he had died after being hit in
the head with a handgun when he struggled with them.
	   The suspects, all in their mid-20s, will be sent to the Phnom
Penh municipal court Tuesday to face a string of charges, said Mak
Chito, head of the police division in charge of foreigners.
	   The arrested men said they had first kidnapped a Thai middleman
to whom one of them had given dlrs 18,000, and detained him for
four days in early June. He was released when he signed an
agreement saying he still owed them dlrs 300,000 and that Mohamad
had the money. It was unclear what the sum dlrs 300,000 referred
to.
	   Mohamad's body was discovered by villagers 30 kilometers (20
miles) southwest of the capital. He had been handcuffed, his legs
were bound and his mouth was taped shut.
	   Mohamad had recently been in Thailand but was lured back by the
men with a party invitation, Mak Chito said. When he arrived at
Phnom Penh's airport, they allegedly kidnapped him and beat him to
death.
	   The suspects then wrote a ransom letter to Mohamad's wife in
Bangkok, telling her to deliver 25 million baht (dlrs 595,000), Mak
Chito said, but she instead alerted the Iraqi Embassy in Bangkok.
	   One of the suspects, 24-year-old Sok Sokretya, who has spent the
past 2 1/2 years studying in Los Angeles, said he paid dlrs 18,000
and got involved in trying to help other students get illegal visas
when he returned to Cambodia on holiday.
	   Mak Chito said it remains to be seen if the court will issue a
warrant for the arrest of the Thai middleman, identified by the
suspects as Charles Manjikol. He said the Cambodian Embassy in
Bangkok had already told Mohamad's wife she could come to Phnom
Penh to collect his body, which is being held at a hospital.

	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   The ship's Syrian captain, Mohammed Mustafa, was ordered
detained Monday for eight days pending the investigation.
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.

Inflation continues to rise fast in crisis-ridden Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Inflation is continuing to rise fast
in crisis-ridden Indonesia, according to official figures released
Monday.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics said the inflation rate
increased 4.64 percent in June and was 46.6 percent overall for the
first six months of 1998.
	   Soaring food prices were behind the big increase, the bureau
said.
	   Both it and the International Monetary Fund have predicted that
inflation will soar to at least 80 percent by the end of the year.
	   Indonesia's economy has been hit hard by Asia's financial
meltdown, which resulted in a dramatic drop in the value of its
currency, the rupiah.
	   Some fear rising prices, mass unemployment and growing poverty
could trigger civil unrest similar to riots that rocked the world's
fourth most populous nation in May.
	   About 1,200 people died in the violence, which helped force
former President Suharto to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Last week the IMF and Indonesia struck a deal to restart a dlrs
43 billion economic bailout.
	   In return for financial assistance, new President B.J. Habibie
has promised to fulfill tough reform promises.
	   Three earlier agreements with the IMF stalled amid accusations
that Suharto had failed to implement reforms that would have cut
across his wealthy family's vast business interests.
	   To soften the blow of the crisis for millions of poor, the new
IMF deal is laced with subsidies for basic commodities.
	   Bureau chairman Sugito said he hoped inflationary pressure would
ease with predicted better growing conditions for rice, Indonesia's
staple food.
	   For much of this year, rice harvests were devastated by a
grinding drought blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   He said a plan for the government to import rice and sell it at
subsidized rates could soften inflation.
	   The rise in inflation was mainly because of the surge in food
prices, Sugito said at a news conference.
	   ``Because of the decreasing purchasing power of the people, they
don't consume anything other than food now,'' he said.

Most sentences upheld in Nam Dinh textile mill corruption 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An appeals court has trimmed one sentence
but left the rest intact in one of Vietnam's biggest corruption
cases, court officials said Monday.
	   The case involved graft and embezzlement at the Nam Dinh Textile
Co. _ dubbed ``Corruption Corp.'' by local media _ and nearly dlrs
24 million in stolen funds, missing state revenue and bad debts.
	   Nuyen Duy Kiem, the company's former general director, saw his
sentence reduced from life in prison to 20 years after he paid dlrs
800,000 in compensation, said an official from the Nam Dinh
provincial court.
	   Two other life sentences were upheld by the appeals court of the
People's Supreme Court, along with sentences for 10 other
defendants. The appeal was heard last week.
	   The case reflects rising corruption since the government relaxed
controls and opened the economy in the mid-1980s.
	   Last May, a court in Ho Chi Minh City sentenced four people to
death for corruption in a commercial party organization. Three were
executed by firing squad earlier this year. One was pardoned.

Saddam appoints new social affairs minister 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has appointed a
new minister for labor and social affairs, Lt. Gen. Saadi Tu'ma,
who served as Iraq's defense minister during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Tu'ma will retain his military rank, Baghdad newspapers reported
Monday, quoting a republican decree signed by Saddam. Tu'ma
replaces Abdel Aziz Mohammed Saleh al-Sayegh, whom Saddam fired in
May.
	   Tu'ma is the latest in the series of veteran army officers
Saddam has given high posts.
	   He takes over a ministry harshly criticized by the state-run
press for conditions in Iraqi jails.
	   Al-Sayegh complained he could do little about them since the
prisons suffered overcrowding and the number of prisoners was five
times the capacity of the buildings.
	   Tu'ma led Iraqi divisions in the war with Iran. He later served
as defense minister in the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.

Israel sentences sentences Hamas cell leader 25 years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli military court on Monday sentenced
two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas to prison terms of
25 and 18 years for planting bombs and conspiring to kidnap the
mayors of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel radio said.
	   In January 1997, a Hamas cell headed by Mohammed Hamada of
Jerusalem planted four homemade bombs in trash cans, injuring 16
passers-by. The cell also tried, but failed to kidnap a hitchhiking
Israeli soldier.
	   Potential kidnap targets included Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert,
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo, justices of the Supreme Court as well as
former Cabinet ministers, the court said.
	   Hamada and cell member Samer Hamada, a distant relative, also
plotted to seize hostages in a crowded building, such as a school,
a movie theater or an apartment tower, in hopes of pressing free
Hamas activists held in Israeli prisons.
	   The defendants belong to Izzedine al Qassam, the military wing f
Hamas, the court said. Mohammed Hamada was sentenced to 25 years
and Samer Hamada was given an 18-year term.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide attacks in
Israel since 1994 in hopes of wrecking the Israel-Palestinian
peacemaking.

EU Commission told to negotiate new-style aid deal with 71 poor nations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU governments ordered the European
Commission Monday to negotiate new-style trade-and-aid deals with
71 poor nations by phasing in free trade accords with some over
five years starting in 2000.
	   The aim is a new treaty with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations, most of them ex-European colonies, focusing more on
combatting poverty and differentiating more among poor and less
poor recipients.
	   Negotiations for a new EU-ACP accord are to open Sept. 30 and
are expected to last for months.
	   Underlying the need for a different emphasis in aid for the poor
is a feeling that the EU-ACP accord _ in force since 1975 and
updated every five years _ has been missing the mark.
	   It has given developing nations dlrs 50 billion in aid, both
direct and in the form of guaranteed export prices for rubber,
minerals, farm produce and other products.
	   Yet, ACP's share of EU imports have dropped to just over 3
percent, from 7 percent, and poverty remains rampant, especially in
Africa, according to EU figures.
	   The EU wants ACP nations to welcome more foreign investments.
	   The better off ``will be asked to enter into a free trade area
with the EU given their level of economic development,'' the EU
foreign ministers said in a statement here.
	   The poorest _ in sub-Saharan Africa which take up almost 80
percent of EU aid _ will continue to enjoy easy access to the EU
markets, officials said. The others must move from old-style grants
and trade benefits to a `sustainable development' model by building
up their economies so they can better compete in a global economy.
	   Changing its traditional aid package for the ACP nations is
forced upon the EU by the World Trade Organization which argues the
trade privileges are no longer compatible with fair competition
rules.
	   The current five-year EU-ACP accord expires in 2000. It
dispenses some 15 billion European currency units (dlrs 17.1
billion) in benefits.
	   That will require developing nations to embrace market economies
and democratic reforms.
	   The foreign ministers agreed to admit Cuba, at its request, as
an ``observer'' to the EU-ACP negotiations. German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said that was ``no guarantee for later membership'' of
Cuba in the ACP group.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Search teams on Monday located another
survivor two days after an earthquake that has killed at least 129
people, raising hope that others would be found alive under the
debris.
	   Hatice Eker was trapped under the same building where rescuers

saying by her husband, Ziya Eker, who joined the rescue workers in
trying to extract her.
	   Eker, a 45-year-old retired teacher, was pinned down by the
debris with her 20-year-old daughter, whose fate remained unknown.
	   ``I am hopeful that she is alive too,'' Ziya Eker told The

Malaysian finance minister says interest rates too high 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
made an about-face Monday and said Malaysia's interest rates were
too high.
	   His remarks echo the thinking of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and newly appointed economic czar Daim Zainuddin, who have been
calling for an easier monetary policy to reduce the debt burden for
distressed companies.
	   ``The interest rates, although lower than in the rest of the
region, are already prohibitively high, thus raising the cost of
doing business in this country,'' Anwar said in a speech to
Malaysian business leaders. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
later addressed the same round table meeting.
	   Anwar noted that the banking system still suffers from
insufficient liquidity as a result of the outflow of short-term
capital over the last year.
	   ``Given the poor business climate, the private sector cannot be
relied upon to stimulate growth. For this reason, I have recently
announced a counter-cyclical package to pump prime the economy,''
Anwar said. ``Our basic philosophy that the private sector should
be the engine of growth remains unchanged. It will resume that task
when it regains its vigor after the economy recovers.''
	   The Malaysian economy shrank by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter, compared with 6.9 percent growth the previous quarter.
Private economists expect Malaysia will slide into full-blown
recession in the second quarter.
	   The counter-cyclical package he referred to was a 7 billion
ringgit (dlrs 1.75 billion) increase in government spending
designed to kick-start the economy. However, that contradicts a
wide-ranging austerity program he introduced in December.
	   Anwar also had argued previously that monetary policy needs to
remain relatively tight to curb inflation and protect the value of
the ringgit, which has lost around 38 percent of its value over the
past year.
	   However, Anwar has been facing mounting pressure to change tack,
and he seems to be yielding.
	   Daim's appointment as special minister for economic affairs last
week was interpreted by the financial markets as a bid to
neutralize Anwar's influence. It also raised concerns that Malaysia
was embarking on a much looser interest rate policy.
	   Mahathir, the country's dominant political voice, has explicitly
blamed interest rates of around 12-16 percent for Malaysia's
faltering economic performance.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Despondent as he awaited the
verdict in his war crimes trial, a Serb indicted for aiding a 1991
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his cell, a U.N. tribunal
said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic was found hanging on the hinge of
the door of his cell shortly after midnight, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said.
	   Dokmanovic's suicide means an immediate end to the case against
him. Just last Thursday, his trial on six counts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity had ended; a verdict was expected within
two weeks. Dokmanovic, who pleaded innocent, faced up to life
imprisonment if convicted.
	   ``You can't pass judgment on a dead person,'' said tribunal
spokesman Christian Chartier.
	   The suicide was the first among the more than two dozen suspects
in the custody of the tribunal, which has publicly indicted 60
people on suspicion of committing atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic, 48, had complained Sunday afternoon
that he was not feeling well. After being examined by a physician,
he was placed under supervision and checked by guards every 30
minutes. The doctor's orders included keeping the light on in his
cell throughout the night.
	   Dokmanovic, the former mayor of the eastern Croatia city of
Vukovar, was last seen alive during a check at 11:30 p.m. When a
guard next passed by his cell around midnight, the light was off
and the body was found dangling in the darkened cell.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic might have used an electric razor to
short-circuit the electricity, presumably so he could take his life
under cover of darkness.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication ``so he
could stand the trial.'' Fila said he asked for a higher dose last
Friday because his client was ``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal,'' Fila said.
``This is awful. I am very shaken up.''
	   Although tribunal officials were familiar with Dokmanovic's
medical records, his depression and his regular meetings with a
psychiatrist, ``he was not known to us as a suicide candidate,''
Chartier said.
	   However, Chartier disclosed on Monday that there had been a
``previous incident'' last year in which Dokmanovic was placed
under tighter supervision that included surveillance cameras in his
cell. He refused to elaborate.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic did not leave a suicide note in the
cell. It was not immediately known whether he had sent any letters
of explanation to family members.
	   Both the tribunal and local Dutch authorities have launched
investigations that could include an autopsy. Dokmanovic's body
will be returned to his family once the investigations are
complete, Chartier said.
	   There were no immediate plans to step up security at the
detention unit where 27 other war crimes suspects are in custody.
	   Asked whether the tribunal is too lax in its supervision of
detainees, Chartier maintained they are only suspects and therefore
not under the kind of surveillance used with convicted criminals.
	   ``They are presumed innocent, so that by any standard the regime
is looser,'' he said.
	   Prosecutors had accused Dokmanovic of playing a key role in the
November 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs near Vukovar.
	   The victims allegedly were rounded up from Vukovar's hospital
and taken by Serb forces to a nearby farm where they were severely
beaten, then executed and buried in a mass grave.
	   Though he was never accused of shooting anyone, prosecutors said
Dokmanovic participated in the beatings and argued that he was
responsible as a civic leader to stop the killings.
	   Dokmanovic was arrested last July on the pretense of being asked
to attend a meeting with U.N. officials. His secret indictment and
seizure triggered protests at home by angry supporters who said he
was a victim of subterfuge.

Danes hunger for tickets to next round: Danish polka vs. Brazilian samba 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ After watching their team pull off
the seemingly impossible feat of defeating Nigeria in the World
Cup, Danish soccer fans now face the really impossible: getting
tickets for the quarterfinals.
	   The Danish soccer association received more than 20,000 calls by
early afternoon Monday from people desperately seeking tickets for
the July 3 quarterfinal against Brazil. Denmark earned the berth by
trouncing Nigeria 4-1 on Sunday.
	   But the 1,237 tickets that had been allotted to Denmark had been
snapped up long ago by fans who believed their team would make it
that far.
	   For countless Danes, the ticket headache came on top of real
headaches incurred during a night of victory celebrations.
	   ``What a game. This is the best hangover I've ever had,'' said
Christian Hau, a tired-looking soccer fan who had partied with
30,000 others on Copenhagen's Town Hall square to celebrate the
win.
	   For those rare Danes who might have missed the game, the news
media on Monday were filled with recaps.
	   Danish national radio repeatedly broadcast the exultation that
leaped from commentators' throats when Denmark scored its first
goal just three minutes into the game.
	   Newspaper front pages were filled with photos of cheering
players and fans and headlines were giddy.
	   ``Samba ahead,'' the Berlingske Tidende daily splashed across
its front oage.
	   ``Everybody (now) can allow themselves to think that the Danish
polka can match the Brazilian samba,'' another daily, Politiken,
said.
	   As a consolation for those who can't get tickets, the game
against Brazil will be shown on large television screens on squares
and in cafes throughout the country.
	   The game against Nigeria reminded many of 1986 when Denmark's
only other trip to the World Cup ended in the second round. The

KEDO board seeks consensus on funds for North Korean energy project 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Delegates of the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization sought a consensus Monday on how to
share the cost of supplying two light-water nuclear reactors to
North Korea.
	   The four-day KEDO meeting, which opened Sunday, follows
inconclusive talks earlier this month in New York. The project is
expected to cost between dlrs 4 billion and dlrs 5 billion.
	   South Korea, the major contributor, was severely hit by the
financial crisis in Asia and wants to reduce its share of the cost.
Other contributors are Japan, the United States and the European
Union.
	   South Korean officials here thought it unlikely the group will
resolve the cost-sharing issue this week. KEDO has already decided
to readjust the budget from the original dlrs 5.15 billion to dlrs
4.6 billion.
	   KEDO was set up in 1994 after North Korea agreed to freeze and
eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel
oil shipments until they are completed.
	   Japan said earlier this month that it will provide dlrs 1
billion for the project. A Japanese diplomat here said Tokyo would
not seek to reduce its share despite the country's current
financial difficulties.
	   The EU wants to contribute 75 million European currency units
(dlrs 82.5 million) over five years, a spokesman for the EU's
executive Commission said.

	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Few may remember the game, or even
the score, but nobody who watched that World Cup match 12 years ago
will ever forget two goals so special they had to be given names:
``Hand of God'' and ``Diego's Wonder.''
	   Diego Armando Maradona, one of soccer's greatest players ever,
tallied twice as Argentina beat England 2-1 on June 22, 1986,
before 114,000 spectators in Mexico City's Azteca Stadium.
	   Argentina then advanced to the semifinals, where it dismissed
Belgium 2-0, again on two goals by Maradona, before taking the
world title with a 3-2 win against West Germany.
	   England and Argentina meet again Tuesday in a second-round World
Cup match, this time in Saint-Etienne. The winner advances to meet
the winner of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game. Maradona was
expected in Saint-Etienne a few hours before the match.

Military chief says some troops suspected of abducting activists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military commander, Gen.
Wiranto, said Monday that some his troops are suspected of
involvement in the abduction of pro-democracy activists.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Wiranto said, however, that any
soldiers involved had acted individually and not under official
orders.
	   He said a military fact-finding team had collected evidence
about the cases from Indonesia's National Commission on Human
Rights and the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation.
	   The team also had interviewed some activists who already had
been released.
	   ``The temporary conclusion that could be drawn is that it is
appropriate to suspect that these cases involve some military
personnel who have acted outside of procedures,'' Wiranto said.
	   He said the military was determined to solve ``the cases
thoroughly and transparently.''
	   Human rights lawyers say 14 people were believed still missing
out of 24 kidnapped since mid-May 1997.
	   Some of the 10 who were released have told the Legal Aid
Foundation that they were tortured by their unidentified captors.
	   Their hands and legs were cuffed and their heads were covered
while they were questioned about their political activities.
	   The military's pledge to work with human rights groups is part
of a new official campaign to clean up Indonesia's human rights
record following the May 21 resignation of former President
Suharto, who ruled for 32 years.
	   Meanwhile, Wiranto said the military no longer would align
itself with the ruling Golkar party, and hoped the party would be
independent and more democratic, based on the spirit of reform.
	   He said the military will cooperate with all socio-political
groups, including Golkar, ``at a similar grade.''
	   Wiranto acknowledged the military's major role in the founding
of Golkar as well as helping the group to grow and develop.
	   ``Whether such a relation will remain in this era of reforms?
The answer is `No,''' he said.
	   Golkar, a monolithic group set up to help keep Suharto in power,
has been widely blamed for the current crisis and political turmoil
that led to the fall of Suharto.
	   It will hold an extraordinary congress next month to decide its
future. Some major factions are splitting away to form new
political parties.
	   The Muslim-based United Development Party, one of only two
opposition parties permitted under Suharto, has denounced the
military for ``apparently remaining unduly close to the ruling
Golkar party.''

Europeans looking strong again as France, Denmark move into quarterfinal AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with U.S. coach resigning, new grafs 8-10
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ What are the chances of Brazil vs. Europe again in
the World Cup quarterfinal?
	   That was how World Cup '94 turned out when seven European
nations made it to the last eight only for the South American
soccer giant to win the title for a record fourth time.
	   It could easily happen again.
	   Host France edged Paraguay 1-0 and Denmark outplayed Nigeria 4-1
Sunday to reach the last eight of World Cup '98. With Italy already
there along with defending titlist Brazil, that makes it three out
of four from Europe.
	   Monday's games were an all-European encounter between
Netherlands and Yugoslavia while Germany was expected to beat
probably the weakest survivor, Mexico.
	   If the results go according to form, that would make it five
European teams out of six, with Argentina the only other nation
outside of Europe left in the competition.
	   Argentina faces England on Tuesday, the day Romania meets
Croatia.
	   Meanwhile, one of the teams already eliminated was making news
Monday morning. The United States announced the resignation of
coach Steve Sampson, whose team finished last among the 32 teams.
	   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' U.S. Soccer
Federation president Alan Rothenberg said in a statement. ``His
tireless work has helped advance our sport and on balance it was an
era of growth. I compliment him on his many achievements with our
team.''
	   Sampson led the U.S. team to a record of 26 wins, 14 draws and
22 losses, but his players openly criticized him after the poor
showing in France and several vowed never to play for him again.
	   While the Danes fired in two early goals against Nigeria on the
way to a comfortable win to reach the quarterfinal for the first
time, the French barely made it to the last eight.
	   After his forwards laid siege to the Paraguayan defense but were
unable to break through it or get past inspired goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert, defender Laurent Blanc found a way through with six
minutes of overtime left.
	   Striker David Trezeguet headed down a cross from Robert Pires
and the veteran Olympique Marseille defender drove the ball home
from close range to create World Cup history.
	   It was the first sudden death ``Golden Goal'' in the history of
the championship. Golden Goals were only introduced to the World
Cup this year.
	   ``This is the most incredible joy to score in this way,'' Blanc
said. ``We have criticized the Golden Goal in the past, yet here we
profited from it. What went through me when I scored was just
indescribable.''
	   A relieved host now goes on to face three-time titlist Italy at
Saint-Denis July 3 for a place in the semifinals, while Denmark
faces Brazil at Nantes the same day.
	   Peter Moller and Brian Laudrup put the Danes ahead inside the
first 12 minutes at the Stade de France, helped by poor defending
and goalkeeping by the Nigerians.
	   The Africans looked like a shadow of the team who triumphed at
the Olympics two years ago. Star players such as Nwankwo Kanu,
Finidi George and Jay-Jay Okocha were just not firing.
	   Ebbe Sand and Thomas Helveg added further goals in the second
half before Tijani Babangida replied for the dispirited Nigerians.
	   While the Nigerians go home earlier than expected, the Danes
will try to dethrone the Brazilians.
	   ``We have to try,'' their Swedish coach, Bo Johansson, said.
``Nigeria cannot try any longer. We will play against the best team
in the world. We know we're not the best team in the world.''
	   On this showing, neither is Nigeria.
	   ``That's soccer, isn't it?'' Finidi said. ``Denmark has a very
good attack. It created several chances and converted. We only had
a few chances. We lost it all in the first 15 minutes
	   ``It is really disappointing not to go through from the second
round,'' the Real Betis midfielder said. ``But that's life.''
	   With the Argentina-England game looming at Saint-Etienne on
Tuesday, organizers have doubled the size of the security force to
prevent major trouble for a matchup that has a spicy background on
and off the field.
	   Argentina and Britain went to war in 1982 for possession of the
Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Although some political
goodwill has been restored since, a confrontation on the soccer
field allows old wounds to be reopened.
	   Then there was Diego Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal at the 1986
World Cup, when the Argentine star got away with punching the ball
into the net and his team knocked England out in the quarterfinal.
English fans haven't forgiven Argentina for that.
	   English followers have already misbehaved at Marseille and Lens
and, because only 2,000 tickets are officially available for them,
many thousands more are expected to show up in Saint-Etienne hoping
to buy them on the black market.
	   The first of the extra 1,500 police were deployed as the English
fans began arriving Sunday. Local officials said bars would close
at 11 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday and police had orders to arrest
anyone for public drunkenness.

Danes hunger for tickets to next round: Danish polka vs. Brazilian samba 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ After watching their team pull off
the seemingly impossible feat of defeating Nigeria in the World
Cup, Danish soccer fans now face the really impossible: getting
tickets for the quarterfinals.
	   The Danish soccer association received more than 20,000 calls by
early afternoon Monday from people desperately seeking tickets for
the July 3 quarterfinal against Brazil. Denmark earned the berth by
trouncing Nigeria 4-1 on Sunday.
	   But the 1,237 tickets allotted to Denmark were snapped up long
ago by fans who believed their team would make it that far.
	   For countless Danes, the ticket headache came on top of real
headaches incurred during a night of victory celebrations.
	   ``What a game. This is the best hangover I've ever had,'' said
Christian Hau, a tired-looking soccer fan who had partied with
30,000 others on Copenhagen's Town Hall square to celebrate the
win.
	   For those rare Danes who might have missed the game, the news
media on Monday were filled with recaps.
	   Danish national radio repeatedly broadcast the exultation that
leaped from commentators' throats when Denmark scored its first
goal just three minutes into the game.
	   Newspaper front pages were filled with photos of cheering
players and fans and headlines were giddy.
	   ``Samba ahead,'' the Berlingske Tidende daily splashed across
its front page.
	   ``Everybody can allow themselves to think that the Danish polka
can match the Brazilian samba,'' another daily, Politiken, said.
	   As a consolation for those who can't get tickets, the game
against Brazil will be shown on large television screens on squares
and in cafes throughout the country.
	   The game against Nigeria reminded many of 1986, when Denmark's
only other trip to the World Cup ended in the second round. The
newspaper Ekstra Bladet said ``perhaps it was the best ever in
Danish soccer history.''
	   ``After the showing in Paris anything is possible,'' the
Berlingske Tidende said.

U.S. soccer coach resigns after disappointing World Cup additional quote of Sampson saying Friday he hadn't considered resigning AP Sports Writer

By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Steve Sampson, the target of bitter criticism from
U.S. players after they finished dead last at the World Cup, quit
today as the American national team coach.
	   The resignation was announced by U.S. Soccer Federation
president Alan Rothenberg, who met with Sampson in Paris. The
decision to leave was Sampson's and the departure was amicable, a
source familiar with the breakfast meeting said.
	   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' Rothenberg
said in a statement. ``His tireless work has helped advance our
sport and on balance it was an era of growth. I compliment him on
his many achievements with our team.''
	   Neither Sampson, who was returning to the United States with his
wife and son, nor Rothenberg were available for comment.
	   Sampson was hired as coach in August 1995 and led the U.S. team
to a record of 26 wins, 14 losses and 22 draws, including a 1-0
victory over world-champion Brazil in the Gold Cup in Los Angeles
last February.
	   The U.S. qualified for its third straight World Cup and players
and officials openly talked of at least duplicating the performance
of 1994, when the Americans reached the second round.
	   But the team never lived up to those expectations, and was
shrouded in controversy even before it arrived in France.
	   Sampson feuded with players and upset many by leaving longtime
captain and field leader John Harkes off the World Cup squad.
	   Once at the Cup, it quickly became obvious that this U.S. team
was not on the same level as the European and Latin American squads
it had boasted it would challenge.
	   It lost its opener to Germany 2-0 in a game it had
optimistically hoped to draw, then lost the one game it had to win
_ against Iran. The 2-1 defeat in Lyon a week ago Sunday sent shock
waves through the U.S. soccer community and left the team in a deep
funk.
	   Already eliminated from the any chance of advancing, the
Americans then lost their finale to Yugoslavia 1-0, finishing 0-3-0
with just one goal _ the worst performance of any of the
tournament's 32 teams.
	   Several players, including veterans Alexi Lalas and Tab Ramos,
said they would never play for the U.S. team again as long as
Sampson was coach. Other players criticized Sampson's tactics and
lineups.
	   Sampson said he resented the criticism and felt betrayed by
players he had tried to accommodate.
	   ``Maybe there's a sense of frustration that international
careers are coming to an end and they needed a scapegoat,'' Sampson
said. ``It's unfair it was pointed at me, the individual who stuck
with them for a long time.''
	   As late as Friday, Sampson said he wanted to stay on and that
leaving never crossed his mind. He said he intended to stay in
France and watch the rest of the tournament.
	   ``At no point did I consider resigning. I worked too hard for
this,'' he said. ``I'm not going to let one or two individuals
control my own life.''
	   Rothenberg said in his statement that a ``thorough process for
hiring a national team coach'' would be launched but gave no
timetable for naming a successor for Sampson.
	   ``We have a clean blackboard, so to speak,'' he said.
	   Rothenberg also said the federation was committed to Project
2010, aimed at a U.S. World Cup championship in the next 12 years.
	   He said the project was essential, ``further underscored by our
experience in France '98.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Giving the expensive drug AZT to pregnant women
who have the HIV virus could dramatically reduce the number of
infected babies born around the world, doctors reported Monday.
	   Still, large hurdles remain in the effort to prevent infants
from getting AIDS, including finding safe alternatives to
breast-feeding.
	   Each day, 1,600 babies are born with HIV, the virus which causes
AIDS. Doctors have known since 1994 that intensive treatment with
AZT during pregnancy can substantially cut the risk that infected
mothers will pass the AIDS virus to their babies during birth.
	   However, at a typical cost of dlrs 800, this treatment is too
expensive for most nations where AIDS poses the biggest risk to the
unborn.
	   But a recent study from Thailand shows that a much shorter
course of treatment just before birth can cut the risk for only
about dlrs 50. Bringing this kind of treatment to the developing
world is one of the chief topics at this week's 15th World AIDS
Conference, the largest scientific gathering in the nearly two
decades of the epidemic.

Rangers seek to trap six tigers killing cattle in Malaysia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Game rangers in northeastern
Malaysia were tracking six tigers that mauled 15 cattle in a
village and an oil palm estate, a news report said Monday.
	   The rangers were equipped with one tiger trap, and planned to
bring in another, Ahmad Shamsuddin Sha'ari, director of Trengganu
state's Wildlife and National Parks Department, was quoted as
saying by the national news agency Bernama.
	   Reinforcements from other states also would join the hunt,
Bernama said.
	   Ahmad Sha'ari said four game rangers were tracking the tigers,
with the help of some local people.
	   They have spotted tracks of two tigers believed to stand 1.3
meters (4 feet) tall and apparently between 4 and 5 years old, he
said.
	   A tiger was shot dead in the state of Perak last Friday after it
had killed two farmers two weeks ago.
	   An autopsy of the tiger, known as ``Father Stripes,'' indicated
it had been driven to killing humans and domestic animals after
being badly wounded by hunters.
	   There were four old gunshot wounds on its body. One of the shots
had shattered its right front leg.

EU Commission told to negotiate new aid deal with 71 poor nations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ EU governments ordered the European Commission
Monday to negotiate new trade-and-aid deals with 71 poor nations to
be phased in over five years starting in 2000.
	   The aim is a new treaty with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations, most of them ex-European colonies. The new deals would
focus more on combating poverty and differentiate more among
recipients.
	   Negotiations for a new EU-ACP accord are to open Sept. 30 and
are expected to last for months.
	   The accord has given developing nations dlrs 50 billion in aid,
both direct and in the form of guaranteed export prices for rubber,
minerals, farm produce and other products. Yet, ACP's share of EU
imports have dropped to just over 3 percent, from 7 percent, and
poverty remains rampant, especially in Africa, according to EU
figures.
	   The EU wants ACP nations to welcome more foreign investments.
	   The better off nations ``will be asked to enter into a free
trade area with the EU given their level of economic development,''
the EU foreign ministers said in a statement here.
	   The poorest _ in sub-Saharan Africa which takes up almost 80
percent of EU aid _ will continue to enjoy easy access to the EU
markets, officials said. The others must move from old-style grants
and trade benefits to a `sustainable development' model by building
up their economies.
	   The EU is required to make the changes to comply with the World
Trade Organization, which argues that the old trade privileges are
no longer compatible with fair competition rules.
	   The current five-year EU-ACP accord expires in 2000. It
dispenses some 15 billion European currency units (dlrs 17.1
billion) in benefits.
	   The foreign ministers agreed to admit Cuba, at its request, as
an ``observer'' to the EU-ACP negotiations. German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said that was ``no guarantee for later membership'' of
Cuba in the ACP group.

U.N. approves 31 Iraqi oil contracts under current oil phase 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has so far approved 31
oil contracts out of 38 submitted by Iraq under the current fourth
phase of the oil-for-food deal, the U.N. humanitarian spokesman in
Iraq said Monday.
	   Eric Falt said companies from 13 countries are involved in the
trade of crude with Iraq. At the forefront, he said, is Russia with
10 contracts.
	   Three contracts have been granted to French firms, three others
to British companies and two have gone to the United States, he
added.
	   The approved contracts allow Iraq sales of up to 221.6 million
barrels, Eric added. The volume, which Eric said could be boosted
further with the signing of more contracts, is the largest in any
of the six-month phases since the oil program went into effect in
December 1996.
	   Under the current stage, which started on June 4, Iraq is
allowed to increase exports up to dlrs 5.2 billion from dlrs 2
billion in each of the past three phases.
	   The oil program skirts U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for
invading Kuwait in 1990, permitting the government to import badly
needed food and medical supplies to alleviate hardships under the
embargo.
	   During the first three legs, Iraq exported some 431 million
barrels of oil, Eric said.
	   According to U.N. figures obtained by The Associated Press,
Russia, Iraq's main supporter at the U.N. Security Council, was the
largest purchaser of the crude, lifting up to 40 per cent of all
Iraq's exports.
	   The United States, Iraq's main critic at the council, came
second, buying about 20 per cent of Iraq's exports during the same
period.
	   Western oil experts in Baghdad said Russia's share in the fourth
phase has slid to a little more than 20 per cent of the volume so
far contracted for exports by Iraq.
	   Iraqi oil officials have said that Russia, along with France,
another principal backer of Baghdad at the council, will be given
preferential treatment in contracts for both the import of goods
and export of crude under the U.N.-approved oil deal.
	   France, U.N. figures reveal, tops the list of about 51 countries
trading with Iraq under the oil program.

Days ahead of verdict, Serb defendant hangs himself in cell

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Despondent as he awaited the
verdict in his war crimes trial, a Serb indicted for aiding a 1991
massacre of 200 people hanged himself in his cell, a U.N. tribunal
said Monday.
	   The body of Slavko Dokmanovic was found hanging on the hinge of
the door of his cell shortly after midnight, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said.
	   Dokmanovic's suicide means an immediate end to the case against
him. Just last Thursday, his trial on six counts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity had ended; a verdict was expected within
two weeks. Dokmanovic, who pleaded innocent, faced up to life
imprisonment if convicted.
	   ``You can't pass judgment on a dead person,'' said tribunal
spokesman Christian Chartier.
	   The suicide was the first among the more than two dozen suspects
in the custody of the tribunal, which has publicly indicted 60
people on suspicion of committing atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic, 48, had complained Sunday afternoon
that he was not feeling well. After being examined by a physician,
he was placed under supervision and checked by guards every 30
minutes. The doctor's orders included keeping the light on in his
cell throughout the night.
	   Dokmanovic, the former mayor of the eastern Croatia city of
Vukovar, was last seen alive during a check at 11:30 p.m. When a
guard next passed by his cell around midnight, the light was off
and the body was found dangling in the darkened cell.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic might have used an electric razor to
short-circuit the electricity, presumably so he could take his life
under cover of darkness.
	   Toma Fila, Dokmanovic's Belgrade-based lawyer, told The
Associated Press that Dokmanovic had been taking medication ``so he
could stand the trial.'' Fila said he asked for a higher dose last
Friday because his client was ``obviously distraught.''
	   ``He was psychologically extremely disturbed. He believed in his
innocence and I think he was close to an acquittal,'' Fila said.
``This is awful. I am very shaken up.''
	   Although tribunal officials were familiar with Dokmanovic's
medical records, his depression and his regular meetings with a
psychiatrist, ``he was not known to us as a suicide candidate,''
Chartier said.
	   However, Chartier disclosed on Monday that there had been a
``previous incident'' last year in which Dokmanovic was placed
under tighter supervision that included surveillance cameras in his
cell. He refused to elaborate.
	   Chartier said Dokmanovic did not leave a suicide note in the
cell. It was not immediately known whether he had sent any letters
of explanation to family members.
	   Both the tribunal and local Dutch authorities have launched
investigations that could include an autopsy. Dokmanovic's body
will be returned to his family once the investigations are
complete, Chartier said.
	   There were no immediate plans to step up security at the
detention unit where 27 other war crimes suspects are in custody.
	   Prosecutors had accused Dokmanovic of playing a key role in the
November 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs near Vukovar.
	   The victims allegedly were rounded up from Vukovar's hospital
and taken by Serb forces to a nearby farm where they were severely
beaten, then executed and buried in a mass grave.
	   Though he was never accused of shooting anyone, prosecutors said
Dokmanovic participated in the beatings and argued that he was
responsible as a civic leader to stop the killings.
	   Dokmanovic was arrested last July on the pretense of being asked
to attend a meeting with U.N. officials. His secret indictment and
seizure triggered protests at home by angry supporters who said he
was a victim of subterfuge.

Netanyahu says he didn't consult with U.S. over Jerusalem vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
he hoped the United States would ``Do the right thing,'' if the
United Nations votes to condemn Israel's expansion plans for
Jerusalem.
	   The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet Tuesday to
consider Arab demands that Israel reverse its decision to extend
Jerusalem municipal services to Jewish settlements built on West
Bank land captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The United States, a permanent member of the Security Council
and Israel's closest ally at the U.N., tried last week to delay the
session, saying such action would hinder American efforts to
restart stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   The United States and Israel traditionally resist U.N.
involvement in the Israeli-Arab conflict because of hostility to
the Jewish state by the Arab states.
	   Netanyahu said he had not asked the United States to veto any
resolution condemning Israel, but suggested Israel was hoping it
would do so.
	   ``I did not ask the U.S. to impose a veto. I expect that the
U.S. will do the right thing. It certainly knows what the right
thing is,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   The Security Council meeting was called by the Arab League after
Netanyahu's Cabinet approved the expansion plan earlier this month.
The plan calls for the extension of some municipal services to West
Bank settlements, and for the extension of Jerusalem's boundaries
to include several towns inside Israel.
	   Palestinian leaders charged that both provisions were a
violation of the Israel-Palestinian accords, which call for the
status of Jerusalem to be determined in negotiations on a final
peace agreement. The United States criticized the Cabinet's move as
unhelpful at a time when peace talks have been stalled for more
than a year.
	   The Security Council meeting will likely take up a draft
resolution, informally circulated by Arab ambassadors to the United
Nations, which condemns the expansion plan and demands it be
rescinded.

Despite Asian financial crisis, region's cities still most costly Precede SINGAPORE. WITH Switzerland-Expensive Cities-List 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Despite Asia's financial crisis, the region still
has seven of the world's 10 most expensive cities for foreign
workers, according to a study released Monday.
	   Hong Kong replaced long-time leader Tokyo, which slipped to
second place, at the top of the global rankings of 172 countries
worldwide.
	   Another Japanese city, Osaka, and Chinese metropolises Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Dalian also featured in the top ten of the
rankings compiled by the Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group.
	   But the dramatic effect of the economic crisis means that of
Southeast Asian cities only Singapore, in 13th place, remains more
costly than New York, in 21st place, the report said.
	   Seoul in South Korea fell to 48th position from 7th place
previously. Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Jakarta, which last
year were comparable to New York, all now rank among the world's
least expensive cities.
	   The study, conducted in the cities in March, measures the
relative cost of goods and services. New York City is used as the
benchmark with 100 index points.
	   The study said Chinese cities are tending to become more pricey
despite inflation rates approaching zero percent, and Japanese
cities were getting cheaper because of the falling value of the
yen.
	   Moscow, which dropped to 4th place in the rankings from 3rd
place last year, remains Europe's most expensive city. Another
Russian city, St. Petersburg, went up to 8th from 10th place and
London jumped to 10th position from 14th last year.
	   The report said London's ascendancy was due to the strong
British pound. Geneva and Zurich in Switzerland were placed 17th
and 18th respectively, up from their joint 21st place last year.
	   Their rise was due to the slightly weaker Swiss franc and an
inflation rate among the lowest in the world, said the study.
	   Four of the world's 10 least expensive cities are in Africa:
Johannesburg in South Africa, Kinshasa in Congo, Blantyre in Malawi
and Harare in Zimbabwe, which ranked bottom.

Board seeks consensus on funds for North Korean energy project 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Delegates of the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization sought a consensus Monday on how to
share the cost of supplying two light-water nuclear reactors to
North Korea.
	   The four-day KEDO meeting, which opened Sunday, follows
inconclusive talks earlier this month in New York. The project is
expected to cost between dlrs 4 billion and dlrs 5 billion.
	   South Korea, the major contributor, was severely hit by the
financial crisis in Asia and wants to reduce its share of the cost.
Other contributors are Japan, the United States and the European
Union.
	   South Korean officials here thought it unlikely the group will
resolve the cost-sharing issue this week. KEDO has already decided
to readjust the budget from the original dlrs 5.15 billion to dlrs
4.6 billion.
	   KEDO was set up in 1994 after North Korea agreed to freeze and
eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel
oil shipments until they are completed.
	   Japan said earlier this month that it will provide dlrs 1
billion for the project. A Japanese diplomat here said Tokyo would
not seek to reduce its share despite the country's current
financial difficulties.
	   The EU wants to contribute 75 million European currency units
(dlrs 82.5 million) over five years, a spokesman for the EU's
executive Commission said.

Massive abstention in abortion referendum prompts question: What now? 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS
By BARRY HATTON

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The buck stops somewhere, but Portuguese
politicians weren't exactly sure where on Monday.
	   Unable to reach consensus in Parliament on whether to relax
abortion restrictions in this predominantly Roman Catholic country,
the legislative body held a referendum to let the people decide.
	   But so few people showed up to vote on Sunday that the
referendum was voided. The record abstention rate of almost 70
percent dumped the responsibility back in the lap of the lawmakers
and further clouded the abortion debate.
	   Of those who did vote, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
	   The daily newspaper Diario de Noticias devoted its front page to
a question mark and below it the question, ``What now, lawmakers?''
	   The apparent lack of public interest in the abortion ballot also
cast doubt over similar polls planned for October on the European
Union's Amsterdam Treaty and the creation of administrative
regions.
	   President Jorge Sampaio, who had appealed for a high turnout,
said he believed referendums were still worthwhile.
	   ``This first referendum did not motivate the electorate,''
Sampaio said in a statement Monday. ``We have to reflect on this
calmly and seriously.''
	   The National Electoral Commission said 68.1 percent of the
country's 8.4 million voters did not participate in Sunday's ballot
that had been preceded by two weeks of intense campaigning.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, dating from 1984, termination of
pregnancy is permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or
in cases of rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   In a landmark decision, lawmakers in February narrowly approved
a bill allowing abortion on demand through the 10th week. Opponents
successfully pushed for the referendum to overturn or ratify that
legislation.
	   Now, lawmakers must decide whether to enact February's law,
without the endorsement of a referendum, or scrap the legislation
as if it was never approved.
	   Abortion rights activists and pro-life campaigners disputed
whether the abstention rate meant that voters were happy with the
1984 law or with February's proposed changes.
	   But the two leading daily papers agreed.
	   ``With this referendum, the (proposed) law which engendered it
has died,'' said Publico in an editorial.
	   ``Should the law be enacted? The answer appears obvious: No it
shouldn't,'' said Diario de Noticias.

Opposition groups ask Congress Party to topple Vajpayee government 
</HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A key Indian opposition group encouraged
the Congress party Monday to topple the three-month-old Hindu
nationalist-led government.
	   Until now a bitter rival of the Congress Party, the Marxist
Communist Party of India said it was prepared to support Congress,
at least on an issue-by-issue basis, if it decides to form a new
government.
	   ``If the president asks us in this regard, we shall inform him
that we will not vote against Congress party in Parliament during
the confidence vote,'' Jyoti Basu, a top Communist leader and the
highest elected official in West Bengal state, was quoted as
telling Press Trust of India news agency.
	   Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi has indicated she would
not try to pull down Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's shaky
government with a no-confidence vote, but said her party would be
ready to step in if it fell ``due to its inner contradictions.''
	   No party won the majority of seats needed to govern alone in
elections in February and March.
	   Anti-BJP parties are trying to come together less than six
months after Congress pulled down the centrist United Front
government. That led to early elections won by the BJP and its
partners.
	   Congress is the main opposition party and the second largest
party in Parliament after Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party.
Congress has sharp differences with other opponents of the BJP,
raising questions about whether it would be able to form a
government any more stable than the BJP's fractious multiparty
coalition.
	   But with the Communists and two former prime ministers, Chandra
Shekhar and H.D, Deve Gowda, pledging support to a Congress-led
government, political uncertainty is gradually building around the
20-party governing coalition.
	   Three top alliance leaders kept away from an important meeting
Vajpayee led over the weekend to take stock of their first 100 days
of his government.
	   The BJP and its allies control 249 of 545 seats in Parliament,
the Congress Party and its partners 191 and the United Front 75.
The rest are controlled by independents.

Talks fail to make progress, Guinea-Bissau rebels say Mansoa, standoff outside town. Edits to conform. No pickup.

By IAN STEWART

<TEXT>
	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Sporadic early morning fighting
resumed in Guinea-Bissau's abandoned capital after overnight talks
between the government and rebels failed to resolve the tiny West
African country's bitter 22-day conflict.
	   Rebel radio reported ``no breakthroughs'' in meetings between
renegade leader Ansumane Mane and a government delegation aboard a
Portuguese frigate docked outside the capital of Bissau on Sunday.
	   However the two sides agreed to meet again on Tuesday, the
renegade station said. A lull descended on some parts of the city,
that has been battered by artillery and rocket fire since an army
uprising began on June 7.
	   Sunday's discussions followed an earlier meeting involving the
Portuguese and Angolan Foreign Ministers and Guinea-Bissau's
President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   An exchange of gunshots could be heard Monday morning in some
neighborhoods of the capital, whose 300,000 people have mostly
fled. There were also reports of gun battles in the town of Buba,
southeast of Bissau.
	   In the central town of Mansoa, where the fighting spread over
the weekend, there was silence on Monday morning. Foliage lining a
road leading further into the interior towards Bafata were believed
to conceal rebel fighters in new positions.
	   Renegade and loyalist checkpoints have sprung up almost
overnight throughout the interior, where some territory has quickly
changed hands.
	   Roads linking rural rebel-held areas with the capital have
largely been cut off. Fighters from the warring sides were locked
in a tense standoff as loyalist troops held a major road junction
about one kilometer (2/3 mile) from Bafata, controlled by renegade
troops.
	   Anticipating an escalation of the fighting, busloads of people
were fleeing Mansoa, which has been stripped of most food and
medicine supplies while serving as a makeshift base for thousands
of refugees who fled the capital shortly after Mane mounted the
uprising.
	   ``We decided we better leave now. We left Bissau yesterday when
there was a lot of shooting and so much noise,'' said Karim Njie,
who walked some 50 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital to
Mansoa, where he boarded a bus headed further east.
	   ``We are really tired. Only the people are paying for what the
soldiers are doing,'' said another fleeing civilian, Mario Mbana.
	   Prior to Sunday's talks, government representatives had been
hopeful of finding a solution. Earlier mediation efforts involving
church leaders and a Gambian envoy had failed to bring the sides
together.
	   The rebels insist Vieira's government is rife with corruption.
	   ``What we're doing here is looking for democracy, real
democracy, not the kind of democracy that is of one man,'' said
rebel Col. Viricino Ceabra on Sunday.
	   Vieiria, the elected president, has called Mane an outlaw.
	   France's President Jacques Chirac said in Maputo, Mozambique,
that there was no reason for French military intervention. France,
a former colonial power in Africa, has troops based in several
Francophone countries. Guinea-Bissau was a Portuguese colony until
independence in October 1974.
	   ``We will only consider a diplomatic mission if we are asked to
do so,'' Chirac said, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Despite Asia's financial crisis, the region still
has seven of the world's 10 most expensive cities for foreign
workers, according to a study released Monday.
	   Hong Kong replaced long-time leader Tokyo, which slipped to
second place, at the top of the global rankings of 172 countries
worldwide.
	   Another Japanese city, Osaka, and Chinese metropolises Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Dalian also featured in the top ten of the
rankings compiled by the Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group.
	   But the dramatic effect of the economic crisis means that of
Southeast Asian cities only Singapore, in 13th place, remains more
costly than New York, in 21st place, the report said.
	   Seoul fell to 48th position from 7th place previously. Bangkok,
Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Jakarta, which last year were comparable
to New York, all now rank among the world's least expensive cities.
	   The study, conducted in the cities in March, measures the
relative cost of goods and services. New York City is used as the
benchmark with 100 index points.
	   The study said Chinese cities are tending to become more pricey
despite inflation rates approaching zero percent, and Japanese
cities were getting cheaper because of the falling value of the
yen.
	   Moscow, which dropped to 4th place in the rankings from 3rd
place last year, remains Europe's most expensive city. Another
Russian city, St. Petersburg, went up to 8th from 10th place and
London jumped to 10th position from 14th last year.
	   The report said London's ascendancy was due to the strong
British pound. Geneva and Zurich in Switzerland were placed 17th
and 18th respectively, up from their joint 21st place last year.
	   Their rise was due to the slightly weaker Swiss franc and an
inflation rate among the lowest in the world, said the study.
	   Four of the world's 10 least expensive cities are in Africa:
Johannesburg in South Africa, Kinshasa in Congo, Blantyre in Malawi
and Harare in Zimbabwe, which ranked bottom.

Hero of anti-Communist uprising admits Securitate collaboration President orders intelligence officials to check whether ministers worked for Securitate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The cleric whose opposition to Nicolae
Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolution against the communist
dictator acknowledged on Monday that he collaborated with
Ceausescu's feared secret police.
	   Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian bishop of the Reformed
Church, said in a statement that he was forced to inform for the
Securitate secret police after years of harassment. He called
himself ``a victim of the Securitate.''
	   Although about a fourth of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, Toekes' revelation was
surprising, considering the key role he played in bringing down
Ceausescu and his communist regime.
	   On Monday President Emil Constantinescu met with the Supreme
Defense Council and ordered intelligence officials to investigate
whether leading dignitaries _ including the prime, foreign and
defense ministers _ were also collaborators, his office said.
	   The order was part of a legal ``moral purification'' of Romanian
society, his office said a statement.

German court hands down new life sentence for RAF terrorist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A former Red Army Faction terrorist
who had part of her conviction overturned in March was resentenced
Monday to the same term: life in prison without parole.
	   Birgit Hogefeld, 41, was convicted in November 1996 of
participating in a 1993 prison bombing in Darmstadt, as well as
murder in connection with the 1994 bombing of a U.S. Air Force base
and of attempted murder in a failed attack on federal Finance
Ministry state secretary Hans Tietmeyer in 1988.
	   In March, Germany's highest court overturned her conviction in
the prison bombing for lack of evidence. The decision did not
change her life sentence, but opened the possibility for Hogefeld
to be eligible for parole after 15 years.
	   She asked the judges to take into consideration her courtroom
plea to the RAF to disband, which the group officially did this
year.
	   The court in Frankfurt, however, declined to make her eligible
for parole, citing the severity of her guilt.
	   The Red Army Faction grew out of the 1960s leftist student
movement and staged numerous attacks on NATO and U.S. military
targets as well as German business leaders over more than two
decades.

U.N. approves 31 Iraqi oil contracts under current oil phase 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has so far approved 31
oil contracts out of 38 submitted by Iraq under the current fourth
phase of the oil-for-food deal, the U.N. humanitarian spokesman in
Iraq said Monday.
	   Eric Falt said companies from 13 countries are involved in the
trade of crude with Iraq. At the forefront, he said, is Russia with
10 contracts.
	   Three contracts have been granted to French firms, three others
to British companies and two have gone to the United States, he
added.
	   The approved contracts allow Iraq to sell of up to 221.6 million
barrels, Eric added. The volume, which Eric said could be boosted
further with the signing of more contracts, is the largest in any
of the six-month phases since the oil program went into effect in
December 1996.
	   Under the current stage, which started on June 4, Iraq is
allowed to increase exports up to dlrs 5.2 billion from dlrs 2
billion in each of the past three phases.
	   The oil program skirts U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for
invading Kuwait in 1990, permitting the government to import badly
needed food and medical supplies to alleviate hardships under the
embargo.
	   During the first three legs, Iraq exported some 431 million
barrels of oil, Eric said.
	   According to U.N. figures obtained by The Associated Press,
Russia, Iraq's main supporter at the U.N. Security Council, was the
largest purchaser of the crude, taking up to 40 per cent of all
Iraq's exports.
	   The United States, Iraq's main critic at the council, came
second, buying about 20 per cent of Iraq's exports during the same
period.
	   Western oil experts in Baghdad said Russia's share in the fourth
phase has slid to a little more than 20 per cent of the volume so
far contracted for exports by Iraq.
	   Iraqi oil officials have said that Russia, along with France,
another principal backer of Baghdad at the council, will be given
preferential treatment in contracts for both the import of goods
and export of crude under the U.N.-approved oil deal.
	   France, U.N. figures reveal, tops the list of about 51 countries
trading with Iraq under the oil program.

Winless Japanese team returns from World Cup to cheers, splash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's soccer team returned Monday from its
winless World Cup debut, cheered for its efforts but hit by a
splash of water from one disgruntled fan.
	   More than 1,000 supporters turned out at Tokyo's international
airport to applaud the team.
	   But a 30-year-old man, who explained later he had expected more
from striker Shoji Jo, tossed water from a bottle on Jo's left arm
in the airport lobby, police said.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police took no action against the man since neither Jo nor the
Japan Football Association complained.
	   The official quoted Jo as saying he believed the man was a
supporter, and he asked only that police warn him not repeat such
actions.
	   Defender Masashi Nakayama returned on crutches because of a
broken right foot suffered in the last game against Jamaica, in
which he scored Japan's only goal in the three games in played.
	   ``I tried to score by striking the ball somewhere on my body,
even if it wasn't a beautiful shot,'' he said.
	   ``We will go from the agony of defeat to the next step'' in
2002, when Japan and South Korea will be co-hosts for the World
Cup, team captain Masami Ihara said at a news conference in a hotel
near the airport.
	   Manager Takeshi Okada, who has said he will resign, stayed in
France to watch matches in the second round, which will last until
July 13.
	   Akane Kaneko, a spokeswoman of the Football Association, said
its board of directors will meet July 19 and 20 to decide whether
to accept Okada's resignation. The association wants him to stay on
for 2002.
	   Ms. Kaneko said the association has not received any official
resignation from him. His contract as manager expires July 31.
	   In the first round's Group H, Japan lost to Argentina 1-0,
Croatia 1-0 and Jamaica 2-1.
	   Video Research, a ratings monitor, said Japan's match with
Croatia drew a rating of 60.9 percent, the highest television
rating in the Tokyo area for a sporting event in more than 30
years.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ England manager Glenn Hoddle is
convinced his players can rise to the occasion and overcome
two-time champion Argentina Tuesday night for a place in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   French security officials consider the match a high-risk affair
as thousands of ticketless English fans _ including some of the
hooligans who wreaked havoc two weeks ago in Marseille _ converge
on this industrial city in south-central France.
	   The Argentinians were the only nation among the 16 survivors of
the qualifying round to win all three first round matches without
conceding a single goal.

Eds: UPDATES with confirmation from Serbs of fighting at Belacevac
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Explosions rocked a Kosovo
rebel-held area just outside Pristina on Monday as Serb forces
launched a new offensive against militant ethnic Albanians seeking
independence.
	   The operation was directed against a coal mine at Belacevac
village, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the capital of
Serbia's Kosovo province, and several nearby villages controlled by
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   It marked a new front in the months-long struggle between Serb
police and other armed units and militant ethnic Albanians led by
the KLA seeking independence for the Serbian province
	   At a police check point only about 200 meters (yards) away from
the mine, explosions could be heard at eight-second intervals.
Police were seen surrounding a KLA entrenchment just outside the
village. Smoked billowed overhead.
	   Sources close to the ethnic Albanian leadership said that armed
Serb civilians were backing up regular Serbian forces targeting the
coal mine and other rebel positions in nearby villages. Tanks had
been drawn up at Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac,
they said.
	   The Serbs' Media Center, close to the Yugoslav government said
police encircled groups of armed Albanians who had seized control
of the Belacevac mine administrative building. Another group of
Albanians were firing at police from inside the mine building.

France sets calendar to phase out louder jets at Paris airport 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Appeasing residents upset over the building of two
more runways, the French government on Monday set a calendar to
phase out noisier jetliners at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport by
2002.
	   Beginning this year, airlines at the airport north of the
capital must reduce noise from its so-called ``Chapter 2'' jets by
15 percent from last year, followed by 20 percent each year through
2001, Transport Ministry Jean-Claude Gayssot announced.
	   France has already agreed to comply with a call by the
Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to
eliminate the so-called Chapter 2 jets by April 2002.
	   The regulation affects about 12 percent of the jet traffic that
emitted 37 percent of the jet noise at Charles de Gaulle and was
responsible for 85 percent of residents' noise complaints, the
ministry said in a statement.
	   ``It's an important improvement for the environment,'' said
Jacques Reder, spokesman for the airport authority Aeroports de
Paris.
	   The government promised the move last September when it
announced construction of two more runways at Charles de Gaulle
despite local protests.
	   Costing a total of 1.5 billion francs (dlrs 250 million), the
first runway will be put in service next spring and the second two
years later.
	   Chapter 2 jets include older models of Boeing 747s, 737, 727s
and Russian Ilyushins and Tupolevs, among others. Some airlines
have fitted those planes with newer engines to comply with the
tougher noise regulation.
	   All Airbus jets, like the newer Boeings, are among the quieter
Chapter 3 jets.
	   The noisy supersonic Concordes, which Air France and British
Airways each fly in and out of Charles de Gaulle twice a day, are
``in a category apart,'' Reder said.

Netanyahu says he didn't consult with U.S. over Jerusalem vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
he hoped the United States would ``do the right thing,'' if the
United Nations votes to condemn Israel's expansion plans for
Jerusalem.
	   The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet Tuesday to
consider Arab demands that Israel reverse its decision to extend
Jerusalem municipal services to Jewish settlements built on West
Bank land captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The United States, a permanent member of the Security Council
and Israel's closest ally at the United Nations, tried last week to
delay the session, saying such action would hinder American efforts
to restart stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   The United States and Israel traditionally resist U.N.
involvement in the Israeli-Arab conflict because of hostility to
the Jewish state among Arab states.
	   Netanyahu said he had not asked the United States to veto any
resolution condemning Israel, but suggested Israel was hoping it
would do so.
	   ``I did not ask the U.S. to impose a veto. I expect that the
U.S. will do the right thing. It certainly knows what the right
thing is,'' Netanyahu told reporters.

Polish court supports cross in government building 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A court on Monday upheld a city's right to
hang a cross in its municipal building, ruling in the first legal
challenge in predominately Catholic Poland to the placement of a
cross in a public area.
	   Lukasz Musolf, an atheist, had claimed the cross in the Lodz
municipal building discriminated against him. He cited Poland's new
constitution, in effect since October, which guarantees religious
neutrality of state.
	   The provincial court in Lodz, a central city, ruled that the
cross did not threaten religious neutrality or violate Musolf's
rights, court official Beata Przybyla said.
	   The lawyer representing the city, Malgorzata Malanowska, had
argued that the constitution allows for manifesting religion and
does not specify where religious symbols can be placed.
	   Musolf, 28, has said he would appeal a ruling against him and,
if necessary, take the case to the European Commission of Human
Rights.
	   In Poland, some 95 percent of the population of 39 million is
Roman Catholic.

Political prisoner says new Indonesian government as violent as last 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia-East Timor
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former political prisoner and advocate of
independence for East Timor accused Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie on Monday of continuing repressive policies of his
predecessor and using violence to suppress peaceful protests.
	   Students and activists have been stepping up demonstrations
against Indonesian control of East Timor following last month's
transfer of power to Habibie from Suharto, a former general who
ruled Indonesia for 32 years.
	   Habibie is not as closely linked to the military as his
predecessor and activists had hoped for freer political expression
under his leadership.
	   But East Timorese activist Fernando de Araujo said Monday,
``There hasn't been any real change for Indonesia or for East Timor
since the political change.''
	   Araujo is one of the founding members of the National Resistance
of Students of East Timor, which opposes integration with
Indonesia.
	   ``The violence that took place for 32 years under Suharto still
hasn't changed at all,'' said Araujo at a Tokyo news conference
sponsored by Amnesty International.
	   Earlier Monday, security officers shot one protester to death
and wounded four others after thousands marched through East
Timor's capital demanding a referendum on Indonesian control over
the former Portuguese colony.
	   It was the second time in three days that military personnel had
killed a pro-independence protester in the troubled territory.
	   ``Violence against the people is continuing and I don't know
when it will end,'' said Araujo, who was released in March from six
years in prison.
	   Araujo had been arrested in November 1991 for organizing a
demonstration in Jakarta to protest the military's killing of at
least 50 demonstrators a week earlier.
	   Indonesia invaded the half-island territory of East Timor in
1975, but the United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule.

Japan's NTT, IDC to tie up in international phone services, sales 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's International Digital Communication Inc.
and a unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone announced a business
alliance in telecommunications services Monday.
	   The agreement will let NTT Worldwide Telecommunications Corp.
provide international telecommunications services using the lines
of IDC, an international long-distance provider, by the end of
August.
	   Under the tie-up, NTT Worldwide will resell volume-discount
domestic telephone service offered by NTT and volume-discount
international service offered by IDC, the two companies said.
	   Also under the agreement, in November, IDC will become a sales
agent for NTT Worldwide Telecommunications' domestic and
international call discount resale services.
	   Both NTT Worldwide and IDC said they didn't have concrete
estimates concerning how the tie-up will affect their revenues and
profits.
	   The agreement involves no capital tie-up, said Masanobu Suzuki,
executive vice president of NTT.
	   NTT is Japan's largest telephone company.

Russia's markets fall again, parliament works on austerity plan saying no devaluation in grafs 11-12. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new 9th graf market close, ruble close and bank
By NICK WADHAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds tumbled again
Monday while parliament worked on a dozen economic measures aimed
at digging Russia out of its financial crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin urged the Communist-dominated parliament
to swiftly approve the government's austerity plan. But the
Communists in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
generally want more government spending, not less, and may be
reluctant to support Yeltsin's proposals.
	   ``Let the Duma hurry up,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by
Interfax news agency. ``I have done my part of the job _ I've
signed the decrees.''
	   At the same time, however, Yeltsin denied that Russia is in the
midst of an economic crisis. ``We have no crisis,'' he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I do not describe the
program as an anti-crisis program.''
	   The austerity plan, outlined by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
earlier this month, focuses on Russia's complicated and outdated
tax system. The new plan has won praise from the International
Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan to Russia.
	   But to become effective, the plan needs to be passed by the
State Duma, which has threatened to sink any bills that reduce
salaries or freeze pension payments. Parliament's budget committee
was examining the measures on Monday.
	   Failure to implement the plan immediately ``would pose a threat
to state security and integrity,'' Kiriyenko said after meeting
Monday with Yeltsin.
	   The Russian Trading System's stock index plunged 6.1 percent at
the close, and benchmark 1-year government bond issues offered
yields as high as 90 percent, up from 75 percent Friday, as
investors continued to flee the market amid fears of a ruble
devaluation.
	   The shaky ruble is perhaps the most urgent problem of the many
economic woes facing Russia at present.
	   As the ruble fell slightly against the U.S. dollar, the head of
the Central Bank reiterated Monday that the government had no plans
to devalue the currency. The ruble closed at 6.22, compared to 6.21
on Friday.
	   ``The government and the central bank have enough instruments
and means to avoid it (devaluation),'' bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   However, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the government
could not rule out a ruble devaluation if tax collection does not
rise dramatically. ``The situation is critical,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   Until now, low inflation and the ruble's stability have been
among President Boris Yeltsin's most important successes, and the
economic crisis has been confined so far to the financial markets.
	   But a ruble devaluation would increase consumer prices and
inflict further pain on ordinary Russians. The Kremlin fears such a
develop could lead to social unrest.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a business magnate and executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, said Monday that the
government has two to three weeks to lay out ``clear trends in the
country's economy, otherwise the situation may be further
aggravated,'' Interfax news agency reported.

Polish youths get up to 10 years for beating a teen-ager to death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Regional Court in Warsaw sentenced 17
young men to prison terms of up to 10 years Monday for fatally
beating a teen-ager with a baseball bat last year.
	   Four of the sentenced, aged from 18 to 23, got 10-year prison
terms. One got a five-year term and the remaining 12 were sentenced
to four years in prison. They all come from a eastern Warsaw suburb
of Rembertow.
	   Only two admitted to participating in the clash in August with
five teen-agers from another part of Warsaw who had tried to keep
them from dating girls in their neighborhood.
	   One of the victims, 19-year-old Tomasz Ostrowski, died of wounds
a few days later.
	   The rise in the use of violence by young people has caused great
concern in Poland in recent years, resulting in calls for faster
trials, tougher sentences and reinstatement of the death penalty,
which was suspended in 1990.
	   A trial involving the killing of another teen-ager, allegedly by
his peers, is underway in a Warsaw court.

EU says Kosovo militants must be part of a peace deal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with statement, comments; new details throughout
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union, falling in line with a new
U.S. policy, said Monday Kosovo militants must be part of a peace
deal in the Serb province even though they reject a negotiated
settlement with Belgrade.
	   And as Serb forces opened a new offensive against militant
ethnic Albanians, European Union foreign ministers tightened
sanctions against Belgrade by banning Yugoslav airlines from EU
airports.
	   The foreign ministers issued a statement urging ``all those in a
leadership role in the Kosovar Albanian community'' to commit to
dialogue to resolve Kosovo's problems.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the meeting's chairman,
said it was an appeal to ``all shades of Kosovo opinion,''
including representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``It is
important that whoever we deal with (can) negotiate effectively.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the international
community had to cast the net wider if it wants to prevent more war
in Kosovo.
	   ``We have to talk to everybody who has the possibility to end
the violence,'' he told reporters.
	   The EU reiterated Kosovo cannot become independent, but the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province must get back the autonomy
it had until 1989.
	   The KLA says it controls up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It rejects
the pacifist approach of Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian
leader. On Monday, Serb forces clashed anew with KLA units.
	   The EU has been betting on Rugova to get peace talks going
again. But on Monday it fell in line with a new U.S. stance that
became clear last Friday when U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with
people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The EU statement warned of military action unless Serbian
strongman Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his security forces from
Kosovo.
	   In a related measures, the foreign ministers:
	   _ formalized a decision, announced at an EU summit this month,
to ban all commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines to EU airports.
The EU has already banned new investments, frozen Serbian country's
assets abroad, prohibited arms exports to Belgrade and restricted
travel visas for Yugoslav officials to punish Serbian strongman
Slobodan Milosevic for his crackdown in Kosovo.
	   _ stepped up diplomatic personnel at EU embassies in Belgrade to
be used as Kosovo monitors. The Yugoslav government has refused to
raise the six-strong EU monitoring force and Monday's decision was
meant to increase pressure on Belgrade
	   Cook called Rugova ``the elected and legitimate head of the
Kosovo Albanians ... the man with whom we have been dealing.''
	   He sounded more conciliatory toward the KLA, even though it
tried to organize a boycott of elections two months ago that made
Rugova the leader of Kosovo Albanians and pursues independence
through armed resistance.
	   Cook said Milosevic's hard-line stance on Kosovo had only led to
more popular support for the KLA ``and made it much more difficult
to obtain a political settlement.''

Turkey's Islamic political leader goes on trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan,
who headed a pro-Islamic government until forced out by the
military, went on trial Monday charged with insulting the country's
highest court which shut down his party.
	   Erbakan was indicted for a speech he made two days after the
Constitutional Court's January verdict to disband his Welfare
Party. Erbakan had called the verdict ``legal murder.''
	   ``The verdict does not have the slightest bit of value in the
face of history,'' the indictment quoted him as saying.
	   The indictment said his words went beyond criticism and were
insulting.
	   Erbakan could face up to 1 /2 years in prison if convicted. He
has already been banned from active politics for five years.
	   The former premier, who is abroad, was represented by his five
lawyers. The trial was adjourned until Sept. 14.
	   The staunchly secular military pressured Erbakan to resign a
year ago, alarmed by his attempts to raise the profile of Islam.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The cleric whose opposition to Nicolae
Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolution against the communist
dictator acknowledged on Monday that he collaborated with
Ceausescu's feared secret police.
	   Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian bishop of the Reformed
Church, said in a statement that he was forced to inform for the
Securitate secret police after years of harassment. He called
himself ``a victim of the Securitate.''
	   Although about a fourth of the adult population was believed to
have collaborated with the Securitate, Toekes' revelation was
surprising, considering the key role he played in bringing down
Ceausescu and his communist regime.
	   On Monday President Emil Constantinescu met with the Supreme
Defense Council and ordered intelligence officials to investigate
whether leading dignitaries _ including the prime, foreign and
defense ministers _ were also collaborators, his office said.
	   The order was part of a legal ``moral purification'' of Romanian
society, his office said a statement.

GE's engines for Australian and New Zealand frigates faulty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's and New Zealand's navies
will get new General Electric engines for their new frigates
because of a manufacturing fault in the original GE turbines.
	   A spokeswoman for the Australian Defense Force said Monday
Australia's frigates had the same problem as that which became
apparent on the first of New Zealand's two ANZAC frigates, the Te
Kaha, during tests at the Williamstown shipyard in Melbourne.
	   She said the first of Australia's frigates, HMAS Anzac, will
have its gas turbine replaced next month during a maintenance
period.
	   Other ships will be fixed on site during construction, she said.
All will be repaired under warranty.
	   The frigates are powered by the American-designed General
Electric LM 2500 gas turbine, which is assembled in New Zealand by
the company Air New Zealand.
	   Identical engines power many U.S. navy vessels and are regarded
as powerful and reliable.
	   But at least two U.S. Navy ships have been affected by the
problem found during the Te Kaha inspection.
	   The problem appears to be that turbine blades are a fraction too
big and cause excessive wear.
	   A spokesman for the ANZAC frigate prime contractor Tenix of
Melbourne said the problem was not crippling and the vessels could
still travel under their own power.
	   But they were advised to travel at less than top speed as a
precaution.
	   All engines in other ships are being checked to see if they have
the same problem.
	   The General Electric engine was the first version of a new run
of 11 engines.

Rescue workers reach another quake survivor in Turkey 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: EDITS in 12th graf to note another survivor found, TRIMS

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Search teams located another survivor
Monday two days after an earthquake that killed at least 129
people, raising hope that others would be found alive under the
debris.
	   Hatice Eker was trapped under the same building where rescuers
pulled out an 11-year-old boy alive Sunday.
	   ```I am fine but I feel pain in my feet,''' Eker was quoted as
saying by her husband, Ziya Eker, who joined the rescue workers in
trying to extract her.
	   Eker, a 45-year-old retired teacher, was pinned down by the
debris with her 20-year-old daughter, whose fate remained unknown.
	   ``I am hopeful that she is alive too,'' Ziya Eker told The
Associated Press.
	   Rescuers found 17 more bodies Monday in the rubble of this
devastated southern town.
	   Relatives of those still missing pleaded with rescue teams to
keep up the search.
	   ``I want my nephew's body,'' shouted Ismail Karayaka, as he was
pushed back by soldiers surrounding the rescue sites.
	   Ceyhan and the nearby city of Adana, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to
the west, were the hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake Saturday.
	   Up to 1,500 people were injured, with 300 people currently being
treated in hospitals, according to the crisis center in Adana.
	   ``I was riding my bicycle when the quake hit. I fell on the
ground and bricks began to fall over me,'' said Sevilay Zenger, an
11-year-old girl, lying in a stretcher in one of the tents in the
garden of Balcali hospital in Adana.
	   ``If God wants, she will get well,'' said Hayriye Yildiz, as she
looked at her unconscious 7-year-old daughter, Ayse, who is
suffering from internal bleeding.
	   Most residents slept outdoors as up to 70 aftershocks hit the
region since Saturday.
	   Nevin Ozsener said sleeping outside didn't bother her. She was
far more concerned about finding the money to rebuild her home.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she may be lucky enough to
benefit from the 250 billion lira (dlrs 1 million) that the
country's second richest business magnate Sakip Sabanci donated to
the disaster-stricken region. Sabanci comes from Adana.
	   Rescue teams pulled out one survivor, an 11-year-old boy, in
Ceyhan Sunday, 24 hours after being trapped under a collapsed
building. Among those found dead Monday were his parents,
grandparents and two brothers.
	   The dead include 62 people in Ceyhan, and 44 in Adana, with the
remaining victims living in nearby villages.
	   Most victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums,
generally crowded with Kurds who have fled the war in southeast
Turkey between the army and the autonomy-seeking guerrillas.
	   Ceyhan authorities said they would launch an investigation into
contractors who built buildings that collapsed.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Explosions rocked a rebel-held area
just outside Pristina on Monday as Serb forces launched a new
offensive against militant ethnic Albanians seeking independence
for Kosovo.
	   The operation was directed against a coal mine at Belacevac
village, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the capital of Kosovo
province, and several nearby villages controlled by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   It marked a new front in the months-long struggle for the
Serbian province between Serb security forces and militant ethnic
Albanians led by the KLA.
	   At a police check point only about 200 meters (yards) away from
the mine, explosions could be heard at eight-second intervals.
Police were seen surrounding a KLA entrenchment just outside the
village. Smoked billowed overhead.
	   Sources close to the ethnic Albanian leadership said that armed
Serb civilians were backing regular Serbian forces. Tanks had been
drawn up at Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac, they
said.
	   The Serbs' Media Center, close to the Yugoslav government said
police encircled groups of armed Albanians who had seized control
of the Belacevac mine administrative building. Another group of
Albanians were firing at police from inside the mine building.

EU Commission told to negotiate new-style aid deal with 71 poor nations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Robin Cook statement in 9th graf
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU governments ordered the European
Commission Monday to negotiate new-style trade-and-aid deals with
71 poor nations by phasing in free trade accords with some over
five years starting in 2000.
	   The aim is a new treaty with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations, most of them ex-European colonies, focusing more on
combating poverty and differentiating more among poor and less poor
recipients.
	   Negotiations for a new EU-ACP accord are to open Sept. 30 and
are expected to last for months.
	   Underlying the need for a different emphasis in aid for the poor
is a feeling the EU-ACP accord _ in force since 1975 and updated
every five years _ has been missing the mark.
	   It has given developing nations dlrs 50 billion in aid, _ both
direct and in the form of guaranteed export prices for rubber,
minerals, farm produce and other products.
	   Yet, ACP's share of EU imports have dropped to just over 3
percent, from 7 percent, and poverty remains rampant, especially in
Africa, according to EU figures.
	   The EU wants ACP nations to welcome more foreign investments.
The better off ``will be asked to enter into a free trade area with
the EU given their level of economic development,'' the EU foreign
ministers said in a statement here.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the chairman of the
foreign ministers meeting, said 48 ACP nations ``will be able to
export essentially all of their products to the European Union by
2005.''
	   The poorest _ in sub-Saharan Africa which take up almost 80
percent of EU aid _ will continue to enjoy easy EU market access.
Cook said countries unready for free trade deals will ``get
treatment equivalent to their current (trade) positions.''
	   The others must move from old-style grants and trade benefits to
a `sustainable development' model by building up their economies so
they can better compete in a global economy.
	   Changing its traditional aid package for the ACP nations is
forced upon the EU by the World Trade Organization which argues the
trade privileges are no longer compatible with fair competition
rules.
	   The current five-year EU-ACP accord expires in 2000. It
dispenses some 15 billion European currency units (dlrs 17.1
billion) in benefits.
	   That will require developing nations to embrace market economies
and democratic reforms.
	   The foreign ministers agreed to admit Cuba, at its request, as
an ``observer'' to the EU-ACP negotiations. German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said that was ``no guarantee for later membership'' of
Cuba in the ACP group.

Havel holds consultations on new government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After one week of inconclusive
talks led by Social Democrats, Czech President Vaclav Havel met
Monday with leaders of two small parties that could play key role
in forming the next government.
	   Havel held political consultations with Josef Lux, leader of the
Christian Democrats and Jan Ruml who leads the Freedom Union.
	   Both men said no further progress had been made in the hour-long
individual discussions Monday, but their parties could still
determine the make-up of the future government.
	   Last Monday Havel asked Milos Zeman to try and form the next
government. Zeman chairs the Social Democratic party which won the
elections, but lacks the solid majority needed to form a coalition
or a cabinet and so far has made little progress.
	   ``We'll go for a minority government with a tacit support from
others,'' Zeman told journalists Friday after informing Havel about
his plans.
	   But both Lux and Ruml have refused to support such a government.
	   Should Zeman fail in his talks, Havel is expected to invite
ex-premier Vaclav Klaus to take a shot at forming a viable
coalition.
	   Klaus's center-right Civic Democratic Party, runner-up in the
parliamentary elections June 19-20, has repeatedly ruled out a
``grand coalition'' with Zeman. Leaving the Freedom Union and
Christian Democrats.
	   The two small parties say they could join with the Civic
Democratic Party in a three-party, center-right majority coalition,
but reject Klaus as its leader, citing his allegedly authoritarian
rule in the past.
	   Havel is known for his rivalry towards Klaus who dominated Czech
politics for the last six years.
	   In his radio address on Saturday, Havel voiced his doubts about
the center-right coalition and outlined his idea of a new
government.
	   ``Such a government should have young blood, new energy, setting
into motion everything the old (Klaus') government was blocking and
postponing for years,'' Havel said without elaborating.
	   In a TV interview days before the elections, Havel praised
Stanislav Gross of the Social Democrats, Cyril Svoboda of the
Christian Democrats and Vladimir Mlynar of the Freedom Union _ all
three upcoming young leaders.
	   In the meantime, the country is run by a caretaker cabinet led
by former central bank governor Josef Tosovsky with majority of its
ministers members of the Freedom Union and Christian Democrats.

Chechnya wants to join United Nations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Chechnya saying it will apply to join U.N.
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya has decided to apply for membership in
the United Nations and is holding talks with 10 countries about
establishing diplomatic relations, Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov said Monday.
	   ``A package of documents has been prepared confirming the legal
status of Chechnya as an independent country,'' Udugov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chechnya maintains it is an independent country following its
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country recognizes it as such and
Moscow says the region remains part of Russia.
	   Udugov said the documents to be submitted to the United Nations
include Chechnya's constitution and the peace treaty it signed with
Moscow.
	   ``The treaty has been examined by noted international experts
who agreed that by signing the treaty Russia recognized Chechnya as
an independent country,'' Udugov said.
	   Udugov also said Chechnya was seeking to establish diplomatic
relations with 10 countries which he did not identify. He said last
month his government had sent letters to Germany and Turkey, which
had diplomatic relations in 1918 with the Gorskaya Republic, which
covers roughly the same territory as present-day Chechnya.
	   Also Monday, Chechnya gave the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe 15 days to get permission from Chechnya's
leaders to work in the breakaway republic, even though it already
has approval from Moscow.
	   Udugov said that by accepting the current status of the Grozny
office of the OSCE, Chechnya would be acknowledging Russian rule,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Udugov also lashed out at the 54-nation OSCE, saying its Grozny
mission wasn't helping in Chechnya anyway.
	   ``The OSCE is not solving any problems in Chechnya at present
and is ignoring Russia's failure to respect its commitments before
Chechnya,'' Udugov said.
	   The OSCE has monitored elections in Chechnya and is trying to
supervise the creation of peaceful leadership in the still violent
region. It is one of the few remaining international groups that
has not abandoned operations in Chechnya because of fear of violent
attacks from rebels.

New Zealand makes fresh spending cuts as Asian crisis bites deeper 
</HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The government announced new
spending cuts Monday as the Asian crisis bit deeper into New
Zealand's economy and advisers told the Cabinet it was probably in
recession.
	   The government immediately trimmed another U.S. dlrs 150 million
(300 million NZ dollars) from spending after it was told its budget
surplus is possibly under threat.
	   It was the second time in as many months that U.S. dlrs 150
million (300 million NZ) has been cut over the next two years as
the government deals with continuing fallout from the Asian
economic crisis.
	   Announcing the measures, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said her
government would also consider measures specifically designed to
help exporters. Export support subsidies were abandoned more than a
decade ago.
	   The decisions were a ``balanced and modest response'' to the
slowdown, and took into account that economic growth was projected
to pick up in the second half of the current year, she said.
	   The government was seeking to ensure its budget surplus was not
threatened by the downturn.
	   She said the economy was probably already in recession because
of ``strong likelihood'' of ``slightly negative'' growth in the
June quarter.
	   The economy shrank in the March quarter, and a recession is
official when there are two consecutive quarters of contraction.
	   Monday's spending cuts mean the government will now use only
U.S. dlrs 2.2 billion (4.4 billion NZ) of the U.S. dlrs 2.5 billion
(5 billion NZ) extra social spending over three years it announced
late last year.
	   Decisions on where spending can be chopped will be made ``as
soon as possible,'' probably within a fortnight, she said.
	   Shipley also projected a potentially ``significantly lower''
operating surplus for 1998-99 compared with budget projections.
	   The economy is due to pick up in the second half of the year,
but less strongly than assumed in the budget, as it will be growing
from a much lower base.
	   Opposition Labor party leader Helen Clark claimed it would make
more sense for the government ``to run a small deficit in the short
term than to make panic moves on public spending.''
	   Labor would halt the tax cuts and not cut spending.
	   The decision to make further cuts follows Treasury advice to the
Cabinet that economic growth is significantly down from forecasts,
and that the government's fiscal surplus would be well below the
U.S. dlrs 750,000 (1.3 million NZ) forecast in the budget.

Two players suspended on drugs charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian test fullback Robbie O'Davis
and Newcastle teammate Wayne Richards received maximum 22-match
bans Monday after returning positive drug tests.
	   O'Davis tested positive to steroid androstenedione which was
present in a dietary supplement he was using. Richards tested
positive to steroid stanozolol, the drug made famous by disgraced
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson at the Seoul Olympics.
	   O'Davis emerged from his six-hour hearing with tears in his eyes
and read a brief statement.
	   ``I want to make it clear that I never considered myself a drug
cheat and that I did not knowingly take a prohibited product,''
O'Davis said. ``My message to everyone is: if in doubt, check it
out.''
	   The Australian game has been rocked by three high-profile
positive tests this month. Former Super League test player Rodney
Howe, of the Melbourne club, has admitted using a steroid to fight
a knee injury and is also expected to receive a 22-match ban when
he faces the judiciary later this week.

English-language schools lose 800 jobs in Asian crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ English-language schools have been
hard hit by the Asian currency downturn, with more than 800 local
jobs lost as overseas student numbers fall by almost half, one
institute said Monday.
	   The Bond University English Language Institute had written to
newly independent member of Parliament John Bradford pleading for
help.
	   The institute said in the letter that student numbers were down
to 112, a fall of 46 percent.
	   ``We have had to lay off seven teachers and two administrative
staff,'' it said.
	   ``In addition, a survey by our industry association has shown
that job losses are now over 800.
	   ``There were 686 teachers and 141 fewer administrative staff
employed on 15 May, 1998, than on 16 May, 1996. ... That means a
total of 827 Australian jobs lost.''
	   Student visas issued for English-language schools in the first
four months of the year were down 48.2 percent from the same period
last year, he said.
	   The letter urged the government to ease visa restrictions to
help the overseas student market.
	   ``We have been disappointed with the government response so
far,'' it said.
	   But Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock warned that many
students were already using student visas for other reasons.
	   ``People will use the opportunity to enroll as a student to
achieve another purpose,'' Ruddock said.
	   ``We do have a significant overstay rate, for students from
China, and in addition we have numbers of other students who apply
to stay in Australia on other grounds.'
	   He said it was estimated that 22 percent of students from China
in 1995-96 had applied to stay because they had entered into a
relationship with an Australian.

Violent fans under control? If so, critics say it's about time

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the night authorities feared English and German
hooligans would clash and lay waste to Lens, the World Cup ``war
room'' was abuzz with grim French officials directing thousands of
riot troops.
	   Next door, amid a maze of TV monitors and computers, police from
31 other competing nations directed their own spotters to isolate
potential troublemakers on the beer-splashed streets of France.
	   The image was of a finely tuned security machine, and critics
say it was about time for a World Cup that began June 10. Even
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement admitted police
were at first surprised by hooligan chaos that shook several French
cities.
	   ``I knock on wood, but if all goes well, we'll have handled 2
million fans tonight,'' said Rene-Georges Querry, head of World Cup
security, on that night last Friday. ``It's the longest day.''
	   Apart from beer can barrages and answering police charges, the
northern industrial city of Lens survived the England-Colombia
match unscathed. Prince Charles and Prince Harry were among the
41,000 spectators who watched England's 2-0 victory.
	   Still, this World Cup hasn't gotten off so lightly on other
occasions. In the two worst incidents, English fans battled local
French-North Africans for three days in Marseille, and German
neo-Nazis clashed with police in Lens.
	   So far, the Interior Ministry has tallied at least 3,200
injuries, most of them slight, in various incidents since the games
began. About 400 were hospitalized, including a policeman in a coma
who was beaten by the German neo-Nazis in Lens.
	   Police arrested more than 700 people, expelled more than a
dozen, and turned away more than 500 at the border, the ministry
said. They also barred about 1,200 Iranians from around Europe from
entering to attend the U.S.-Iran match in Lyon.
	   In Lens last Friday, Querry attributed the relative calm to
2,000 police on patrol, an alcohol ban, no outdoor viewing screens
for ticketless fans, and strict border checks that turned away
hundreds of suspected hooligans. Germans hooligans did not appear,
as feared.
	   ``We won a battle,'' he said the next day, ``but we won't claim
victory until July 13.'' That is the day after the Cup final in
Saint-Denis, a Paris suburb.
	   What set off English fans in Marseille and the Germans in Lens
over the past two weeks could happen again. Officials worry about
such high-risk matches as England vs. Argentina in Saint-Etienne on
Tuesday.
	   Patrick Mignon, a French sociologist, said hooligan violence is
driven by misguided nationalism, far-right tendencies and an
identity crisis among workers in a post-industrial world.
	   Other World Cups have also been violent, he noted, including
riots in Spain in 1982 and again in Italy in 1990.
	   In another precautionary step before the World Cup, police
carried out Europe-wide roundups against Muslim militant groups
accused of setting terrorist bombs in France in the past.
	   With people like Stephen Davies, drinking beer after beer with
his barrel-chested, tattooed buddies in a bar before an England
match in Toulouse, officials have work cut out. The 28-year-old
English painter-decorator and father of two won't be pushed around.
	   ``Every time there's a problem, the English get blamed, because
the English stand up for themselves,'' he said.
	   Before and during England's June 15 match with Tunisia in
Marseille, English fans fought local North African youths. Outdoor
screens for ticketless fans turned out to be a flash point after
riots in the Old Port entertainment district for two straight
nights.
	   Jean Provens, a French police union leader, said the violence,
though partly caused by drunken or malicious visitors, also
reflects rising crime in poor neighborhoods.
	   Working-class, heavily immigrant suburbs are often ignored by
understaffed police precinct, he said. Unemployed youths from North
African families turn to crime, and they fought or preyed on World
Cup fans.
	   ``There's been a rise of deliquency and crime; it's been
shooting up for decades,'' said Provens. ``Police are totally
overburdened.''
	   Most of the damage in Marseille came from local youths, not from
the English fans, officials said.
	   Marseille newspapers criticized police for not intervening
earlier to stop the rampage.
	   Querry argued the strategy was to encircle the violence, arrest

incident. He was caught alone on a sidestreet and hit in the head

English and the Germans has been excellent.''

National Criminal Intelligence Service, Football Unit.

8,500 in 1989 to 4,000 last season, thanks to the use of
hooligan-spotters, TV surveillance and all-seat stadiums. ``We have
a grip on it,'' he said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ On the night authorities feared English and German
hooligans would clash and lay waste to Lens, the World Cup ``war
room'' was abuzz with grim French officials directing thousands of
riot troops.
	   Next door, amid a maze of TV monitors and computers, police from
the 31 other competing World Cup nations directed their own
spotters to isolate potential troublemakers on the beer-splashed
streets of France.
	   The image was of a finely tuned security machine, and critics
say it was about time for a World Cup that began June 10. Even
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement admitted police
were at first surprised by hooligan chaos that shook several French
cities.
	   ``I knock on wood, but if all goes well, we'll have handled 2
million fans tonight,'' said Rene-Georges Querry, head of World Cup
security, on that night last Friday. ``It's the longest day.''
	   Apart from beer can barrages and answering police charges, the
northern industrial city of Lens survived the England-Colombia
match unscathed. Prince Charles and Prince Harry were among the
41,000 spectators who watched England's 2-0 victory.
	   Still, this World Cup hasn't gotten off so lightly on other
occasions. In the two worst incidents, English fans battled local
French-North Africans for three days in Marseille, and German
neo-Nazis clashed with police in Lens.
	   So far, the Interior Ministry has tallied at least 3,200
injuries, most of them slight, in various incidents since the games
began. About 400 were hospitalized, including a policeman in a coma
who was beaten by the German neo-Nazis in Lens.
	   Police arrested more than 700 people, expelled more than a
dozen, and turned away more than 500 at the border, the ministry
said. They also barred about 1,200 Iranians from around Europe from
entering to attend the U.S.-Iran match in Lyon.
	   In Lens last Friday, Querry attributed the relative calm to
2,000 police on patrol, an alcohol ban, no outdoor viewing screens
for ticketless fans, and strict border checks that turned away
hundreds of suspected hooligans. Germans hooligans did not appear,
as feared.
	   ``We won a battle,'' he said the next day, ``but we won't claim
victory until July 13.'' That is the day after the Cup final in
Saint-Denis, a Paris suburb.
	   What set off English fans in Marseille and the Germans in Lens
over the past two weeks could happen again. Officials worry about
such high-risk matches as England vs. Argentina in Saint-Etienne on
Tuesday.
	   Patrick Mignon, a French sociologist, said hooligan violence is
driven by misguided nationalism, far-right tendencies and an
identity crisis among workers in a post-industrial world.
	   Other World Cups have also been violent, he noted, including
riots in Spain in 1982 and again in Italy in 1990.
	   In another precautionary step before the World Cup, police
carried out Europe-wide roundups against Muslim militant groups
accused of setting terrorist bombs in France in the past.
	   With people like Stephen Davies, drinking beer after beer with
his barrel-chested, tattooed buddies in a bar before an England
match in Toulouse, officials have work cut out. The 28-year-old
English painter-decorator and father of two won't be pushed around.
	   ``Every time there's a problem, the English get blamed, because
the English stand up for themselves,'' he said.
	   Before and during England's June 15 match with Tunisia in
Marseille, English fans fought local North African youths. Outdoor
screens for ticketless fans turned out to be a flash point after
riots in the Old Port entertainment district for two straight
nights.
	   Jean Provens, a French police union leader, said the violence,
though partly caused by drunken or malicious visitors, also
reflects rising crime in poor neighborhoods.
	   Working-class, heavily immigrant suburbs are often ignored by
understaffed police precinct, he said. Unemployed youths from North
African families turn to crime, and they fought or preyed on World
Cup fans.
	   ``There's been a rise of deliquency and crime; it's been
shooting up for decades,'' said Provens. ``Police are totally
overburdened.''
	   Most of the damage in Marseille came from local youths, not from
the English fans, officials said.
	   Marseille newspapers criticized police for not intervening
earlier to stop the rampage.
	   Querry argued the strategy was to encircle the violence, arrest
offenders individually and ``avoid a frontal assault that would
have resulted in more injuries, even death.''
	   But that tactic had to to be changed when the violence
threatened to get out of control. Now, police are under orders to
intervene massively at the first sign of trouble.
	   While the Germans used cell phones and coordinated their
assaults, officials say the attack on the policeman was a random
incident. He was caught alone on a sidestreet and hit in the head
with an iron bar. More than a week later, the 44-year-old officer

France to press for southern Africa debt relief, says Chirac Angola

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac said
former colonial powers, Western creditor nations and financial
institutions must consider alleviating debt burdens that are
stunting development in countries like Mozambique.
	   Impoverished by 16 years of civil war, Mozambique owes more than
dlrs 6 billion in foreign debt. As much as 50 percent of the
nation's annual revenue is in loans and aid.
	   Chirac, continuing his thrust to promote French interests in
southern Africa, vowed France will press for foreign debt relief
and back economic reconstruction for Mozambique.
	   ``It is a question of principle'' for former colonial powers,
Western creditor nations and financial institutions to address the
problem, Chirac told reporters. He said France favors debt relief
in southern Africa to give momentum to democratic and economic
reforms.
	   Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said he welcomed Chirac's
initiatives.
	   Chirac is on a four-nation tour of southern Africa to widen
French policy on the continent after focusing for decades mainly on
French-speaking former colonies. It was the first-ever trip to
Mozambique by a French president.
	   Chirac met privately with former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama,
now head of the political opposition. No details were released of
the talks.
	   Dhlakama signed a peace accord with the government in 1992 to
end a civil war waged by his Mozambique National Resistance _ known
by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO.
	   French officials said Chirac was impressed by internal stability
in Mozambique that has led to record economic growth of 12 percent
in gross domestic product in the past year. The country's first
democratic elections were held in 1996.
	   Chissano said he asked Chirac for France to help train and
rebuild Mozambique's armed forces so they are on par with
neighboring armies that were able to engage in regional and African
peace keeping.
	   Earlier Monday, Chirac laid a wreath at a shrine honoring
Mozambicans who died in the bush war that led to independence from
Portugal in 1974.
	   About 50 top French business executives traveling with him met
with Mozambican officials and business leaders at a
French-sponsored economic forum. French officials were to sign four
cooperation agreements in health, education, energy and transport.
	   Chirac arrived Sunday from South Africa, the key stop on a trip
that included Namibia. On Monday afternoon, he left for Angola,
another former Portuguese colony.
	   There, Chirac will assess the ailing preace process there that
has limited French economic cooperation in Angola mainly to
offshore oil production, officials said.

EU says Kosovo militants must be part of a peace deal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with statement, comments; new details throughout
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union, falling in line with a new
U.S. policy, said Monday Kosovo militants must be part of a peace
deal in the Serb province even though they reject a negotiated
settlement with Belgrade.
	   And as Serb forces opened a new offensive against militant
ethnic Albanians, European Union foreign ministers tightened
sanctions against Belgrade by banning Yugoslav airlines from EU
airports.
	   The foreign ministers issued a statement urging ``all those in a
leadership role in the Kosovar Albanian community'' to commit to
dialogue to resolve Kosovo's problems.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the meeting's chairman,
said it was an appeal to ``all shades of Kosovo opinion,''
including representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``It is
important that whoever we deal with (can) negotiate effectively.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the international
community had to cast the net wider if it wants to prevent more war
in Kosovo.
	   ``We have to talk to everybody who has the possibility to end
the violence,'' he told reporters.
	   The EU reiterated Kosovo cannot become independent, but the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province must get back the autonomy
it had until 1989.
	   The KLA says it controls up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It rejects
the pacifist approach of Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian
leader. On Monday, Serb forces clashed anew with KLA units.
	   The EU has been betting on Rugova to get peace talks going
again. But on Monday it fell in line with a new U.S. stance that
became clear last Friday when U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with
people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The EU statement warned of military action unless Serbian
strongman Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his security forces from
Kosovo.
	   In related measures, the foreign ministers:
	   _ formalized a decision, announced at an EU summit this month,
to ban all commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines to EU airports.
The EU has already banned new investments, frozen Serbian assets
abroad, prohibited arms exports to Belgrade and restricted travel
visas for Yugoslav officials to punish Serbian strongman Slobodan
Milosevic for his crackdown in Kosovo.
	   _ stepped up diplomatic personnel at EU embassies in Belgrade to
be used as Kosovo monitors. The Yugoslav government has refused to
raise the six-strong EU monitoring force and Monday's decision was
meant to increase pressure on Belgrade.

EU Commission told to negotiate new aid deal with 71 poor nations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES 7th graf with comment by Cook, INSERTS new 8th graf to
conform, picks up 8th graf pvs
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ EU governments ordered the European Commission
Monday to negotiate new trade-and-aid deals with 71 poor nations to
be phased in over five years starting in 2000.
	   The aim is a new treaty with 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations, most of them ex-European colonies. The new deals would
focus more on combating poverty and differentiate more among
recipients.
	   Negotiations for a new EU-ACP accord are to open Sept. 30 and
are expected to last for months.
	   The accord has given developing nations dlrs 50 billion in aid,
both direct and in the form of guaranteed export prices for rubber,
minerals, farm produce and other products. Yet, ACP's share of EU
imports have dropped to just over 3 percent, from 7 percent, and
poverty remains rampant, especially in Africa, according to EU
figures.
	   The EU wants ACP nations to welcome more foreign investments.
	   The better off nations ``will be asked to enter into a free
trade area with the EU given their level of economic development,''
the EU foreign ministers said in a statement here.
	   The poorest _ in sub-Saharan Africa which takes up almost 80
percent of EU aid _ will continue to enjoy easy access to the EU
markets, officials said. Cook said countries unready for free trade
deals will ``get treatment equivalent to their current (trade)
positions.''
	   The others must move from old-style grants and trade benefits to
a `sustainable development' model by building up their economies.
	   The EU is, 8th graf pvs

Social Democrats fend off labor union complaints at party convention 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The leftist Social Democrats, who hope to unseat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl this fall by moving toward the political
center, found themselves defending their strategy Monday against
criticism from a traditional ally: organized labor.
	   The dispute at a party convention in Berlin arose over the SPD's
choice of Jost Stollmann, a computer entrepreneur with no party
affiliation, as economic minister in the case of a victory in
national elections Sept. 27.
	   Chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who leads Kohl in
opinion polls, has sought to forge a business-friendly image for
his party.
	   But labor leaders complained over the weekend that Stollmann is
not committed enough to Schroeder's key idea of having the
government, business and labor sit together to discuss ways of
combating unemployment.
	   SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine defended Stollmann, saying the party
wants to benefit from the knowledge of outsiders. ``For that goal,
there are no ifs or buts,'' Lafontaine said Monday in response to
criticism from Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy head of the DGB labor
umbrella organization.
	   Walter Riester, deputy head of the IG Metall metalworkers union
and the man named as Schroeder's potential labor minister, also
backed Stollmann on Monday.
	   Stollmann himself was not at the one-day convention, and has not
responded to the criticism.

Meeting called in Oslo to build trust in divided Cyprus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke is to
meet businessmen from both sides of divided Cyprus in Oslo this
week in hopes of easing tensions and building trust between the
island's Greek and Turkish populations.
	   ``It is not a political meeting,'' said Jan Egeland, a former
Norwegian deputy foreign minister who has worked with Holbrooke on
seeking an end to the nearly 24-year the Cyprus conflict. ``But we
want to give the two peoples an exposure to the benefits of
cooperation.''
	   Egeland said the closed meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday follows
up a similar session in Brussels in November.
	   Tensions over Cyprus have increased in recent weeks as both
Greece and Turkey briefly sent warplanes to the island as shows of
strength.
	   Cyprus was divided after Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974. Greek and Turkish Cypriots
now live separated by a U.N.-patrolled line running across the
island. Repeated international efforts, now led by Holbrooke, have
failed to reunite the island.
	   Egeland, a key player in secret talks that led to 1993 peace
accord between Israeli and the Palestine Liberation Organizations,
has been cooperating with Holbrooke on the Cyprus conflict since
last year.
	   Egeland and Holbrooke _ who has been nominated to be the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations _ hope building personal contact
between business leaders from Cyrpus, Greece and Turkey may
encourage an end to a politcal deadlock.
	   ``This will be a meeting to explore the possibility of finding
sources of cooperation on the divided island,'' Egeland said by
telephone.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The official World Cup web site _ www.france98.com
_ had a record 68 million hits on Friday, said Phillipe Verveer,
the French organizing committee's director of information
technology.
	   That beat the previous record of for an internet site, also held
by the World Cup, of 56 million hits on June 15th.
	   Friday was the final day of first-round matches:
Romania-Tunisia, Jamaica-Japan, Argentina-Croatia, and
Colombia-England.
	   The site offers real time match results, other World Cup news,
statistics and team information. Since it went on line in February,
the site has registered more than 1 billion visitors.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup doesn't just attract the greatest
soccer players and the most ardent fans, it also draws crack teams
of pickpockets.
	   For this World Cup, notorious pickpockets have gathered form all
parts of the world, French daily Liberation reported Monday.
	   There's the infamous Adriano S., an Italian considered the last
of the great pickpockets, according to French authorities. Adriano
S. has a reputation for working trade fairs, conventions and
several World Cups.
	   For the first round matches of World Cup, he had rooms reserved
in cities where the Japanese, Korean, and Saudi Arabian teams
played, the daily said. Fans of those teams where the easiest to
rob, according to Parisian pickpockets.
	   Another name from the swindler hall-of-fame is Rachid from
Morocco.
	   He is based in Switzerland and likes to operate in the business
district of Geneva. According to the newspaper, he goes to the
Cannes film festival every year to find rich targets.
	   Argentine and Peruvian gangs also have set up shop in Paris.
They work in groups in hotel lobbies and airports with a pretty
girl distracting victims long enough for an accomplice to pilfer
their belongings, the daily said.
	   The most vexing problem for French authorities is the mobility
of the pickpockets, who travel to all the World Cup venues,
Liberation said. Police in venues such as Nantes, with a population
of 250,000, and Lens, with a population of about 35,000, are just
not accustomed to having pickpockets operating in their
jurisdiction.

	   PORT STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) _ When England meets
Argentina in the second round of the World Cup Tuesday night, this
small community will be watching with special interest.
	   The two nations fought a war over the Falklands in 1982, with
England retaining control of the tiny islands off the Argentine
coast.
	   The Upland Goose Hotel in Port Stanley will show the match live
and management expects the bulk of the 200-plus crowd to be
cheering for England.
	   ``We have been screening some of the World cup matches but this
one is creating the most interest,'' the hotel's manager told Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency. The manager was not

	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian forward Alessandro Del Piero said
Monday that France deserved to advance to the World Cup
quarterfinals, but acknowleged Paraguay came close to a major
upset.
	   The French advanced on an extra-time ``Golden Goal'' in Sunday's
second-round match and will play Italy in St. Denis on Friday.
	   ``Paraguay could have been an easier opponent for us, and at one
moment I thought it could have upset France. The Frenchmen
struggled but deserved qualification as they attacked throughout,''
Del Piero said.
	   Captain Paolo Maldini also praised Paraguay.
	   ``They showed a strong midfield and defense, and carried some
dangerous counterattacks,'' he said.

	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Azzurri captain Paolo Maldini will play in
an Italian record 19th World Cup match when he takes the field for
the kickoff against France in Friday's quarterfinal match at St.
Denis.
	   Maldini, 30, son of Italian national team coach Cesare Maldini,
will break the mark he shares with former stars Antonio Cabrini and
Gaetano Scirea.
	   The Italian defender is playing in his third World Cup.
	   Inter Milan veteran sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi, 34, will earn his

World Cup: Injury-depleted forward line remains France's main problem 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The French were licking their
wounds Monday after a bruising battle against Paraguay and could
only hope their injury list would shrink by the time they face
Italy in the quarterfinals.
	   Forward Thierry Henry, who has scored three goals, strained his
left ankle during the 1-0 overtime win against Paraguay Sunday. It
was unclear whether he will recover in time for Friday's match at
the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   ``We're certainly worried and we'll have to look at it again in
48 hours,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet Monday. ``It gets to
you, especially now that the stakes are getting progressively
higher.''
	   Twenty-year-old Henry, France's World Cup revelation so far, had
to celebrate France's Golden Goal win with a huge ice pack strapped
to his ankle.
	   Midfielder Emmanuel Petit had to be pulled out of the game
because the pain in his hamstring got progressively worse. Doctors
will work on the strain in an attempt to get him ready too.
	   Meanwhile, the torn hamstring of Christophe Dugarry, who scored
France's World Cup opening goal, is healing very slowly, making it
ever more likely he will be out for the rest of the tournament even
if France makes it to the finals.
	   The only positive news is that star playmaker Zinedine Zidane
will be coming back after a two-match suspension for kicking a
fallen opponent.
	   ``We expect a lot from him and he can make the difference,''
said French captain Didier Deschamps, who plays with Zidane
together on Italian champion Juventus Turin. About half of France's
top lineup plays in Italy.
	   After celebrating Laurent Blanc's decider in the 114th minute
against Paraguay, the French were trying to catch their breath
Monday. ``We sorely feel the fatigue,'' said the matchwinner.
	   ``I'm tired after a normal match. Now we have spent so much more
energy,'' said Deschamps.
	   ``We were hoping for an easy match against Paraguay and instead
we had to go through all this suffering,'' the team captain said.
``All this speaks in Italy's favor.''
	   Paraguay's staunch defense had the French team running ragged
for 114 minutes before finally caving in to the relentless
pressure.
	   ``Now we have five days to recuperate,'' Deschamps noted
	   ``We have to forget everything and get to the next match,'' said
Blanc.

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff's close-range header
that clanged off the underside of the crossbar was the best scoring
chance as Germany and Mexico played to a 0-0 first half in their
World Cup second round match Monday.
	   Bierhoff was less than five meters from the goal when he jumped
to play Thomas Haessler's left-wing cross in the 40th minute, but
the ball caromed off the bar and no German player was able to
convert the rebound.
	   Mexico's best threat came three minutes later when Luis
Hernandez fed Francisco Palencia on a counterattack, but German
goalkeeper Andreas Koepke emerged from the goal to stop the Mexican
striker's attempt.
	   The match was played in torrid conditions at the Stade de la
Mosson, with temperature at kickoff reaching 33 Celsius (91F).

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ As onlookers cheered, search teams on
Monday dug out another survivor two days after an earthquake that
has killed at least 129 people.
	   Hatice Eker was extracted from under the same building where
rescuers pulled out an 11-year-old boy alive on Sunday.
	   The red-haired woman, covered in dust, grasped the hand of a
rescue worker to express her gratitude, before being put in an
ambulance.
	   ``I am so happy. I hope more people will come out alive,'' said
Mrs. Eker's husband, Ziya Eker. The fate of their 20-year-old
daughter still trapped in the debris remained unknown.
	   Rescuers found 17 more bodies Monday in the rubble of this
devastated southern town.
	   Relatives of those still missing pleaded with rescue teams to
keep up the search.
	   ``I want my nephew's body,'' shouted Ismail Karayaka, as he was
pushed back by soldiers surrounding the rescue sites.
	   Ceyhan and the nearby city of Adana, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to
the west, were the hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake Saturday.
	   Up to 1,500 people were injured, with 300 people currently being
treated in hospitals, according to the crisis center in Adana.
	   ``I was riding my bicycle when the quake hit. I fell on the
ground and bricks began to fall over me,'' said Sevilay Zenger, an
11-year-old girl, lying in a stretcher in one of the tents in the
garden of Balcali hospital in Adana.
	   ``If God wants, she will get well,'' said Hayriye Yildiz, as she
looked at her unconscious 7-year-old daughter, Ayse, who is
suffering from internal bleeding.
	   Most residents slept outdoors as up to 70 aftershocks hit the
region since Saturday.
	   Nevin Ozsener said sleeping outside didn't bother her. She was
far more concerned about finding the money to rebuild her home.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she may be lucky enough to
benefit from the 250 billion lira (dlrs 1 million) that the
country's second richest business magnate, Sakip Sabanci, donated
to the disaster-stricken region. Sabanci comes from Adana.
	   Rescue teams pulled out an 11-year-old boy in Ceyhan Sunday, 24
hours after being trapped under a collapsed building. Among those
found dead Monday were his parents, grandparents and two brothers.
	   The dead include 63 people in Ceyhan, and 44 in Adana, with the
remaining victims living in nearby villages.
	   Most victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums,
generally crowded with Kurds who have fled the war in southeast
Turkey between the army and the autonomy-seeking guerrillas.
	   Ceyhan authorities said they would launch an investigation into
contractors who built buildings that collapsed.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

Pakistan's prime minister arrives in Kuwait 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan arrived
here Monday on a brief visit aimed at explaining his country's
reasons for conducting nuclear tests last month.
	   It was not clear if Sharif would request any aid to offset
sanctions imposed on Pakistan by the United States and other
countries because of the tests.
	   Sharif visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates earlier
this month and discussed the consequences of the nuclear
experiments that Islamabad says were in retaliation for tests India
had carried out.
	   In Saudi Arabia, Sharif reportedly sought the kingdom's help in
getting the United States to lift the sanctions which were also
imposed on India.
	   Pakistan is looking at alternative sources of external aid as
the world's leading industrial nations recently slammed the doors
on loans to both Islamabad and New Delhi.
	   Sharif is scheduled to meet with the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah and Foreign
Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah. He leaves Tuesday.

Commission bars Protestants from marching through Catholic area

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Confronting a dilemma, a
commission on Monday ordered an annual Protestant march to avoid a
hostile Catholic neighborhood, a sectarian showdown that has
triggered violence across Northern Ireland for the past two
summers.
	   The Parades Commission's long-postponed verdict came just four
days after the election of a new 108-seat Assembly for Northern
Ireland _ bedrock of April's peace agreement _ and six days before
the Orange Order march in Portadown, a staunchly Protestant town
southwest of Belfast.
	   Anticipating confrontations with Protestant hard-liners in the
coming week, the British government has already deployed more than
1,000 extra soldiers from bases in England, boosting the overall
garrison above 19,000. The Orange Order has some 80,000 members and
many more supporters in Northern Ireland's majority community.
	   The commission chairman, Alistair Graham, said allowing some
2,000 Portadown Orangemen to march along the Garvaghy Road on
Sunday _ part of the parade route since 1807 _ would threaten ``to
wreck all the gains of the last three months.''
	   On Monday afternoon, violence erupted at a Catholic public
housing project, Kilwilkie, when youths, some masked, hurled
gasoline bombs and bricks at police who reported seizing a 4-pound
Semtex bomb and ammunition hidden in a coal bunker behind a house.
	   Kilwilkie, in Lurgan, County Armagh, is only 5 miles from the
Garvaghy Road, but there was no apparent link between the trouble
and the decision on the Protestant parade.
	   ``We see the need to break the cycle in 1998,'' said Graham, the
commission chairman and a former labor union negotiator from
England who leads the panel of three Catholic and three Protestant
professionals.

Pakistan waited six days to prepare nuclear tests

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan waited six days after India
conducted its five underground nuclear tests last month before
beginning preparations for its own tests, the state-run news agency
reported Monday.
	   Pakistan conducted six tests -- five on May 28 and a sixth on
May 30.
	   The first five devices were exploded some 2,800 feet (9,240
meters) below the ground in a concrete sealed tunnel, the
Associated Press of Pakistan said following a tour of the site by
local journalists.
	   A nearby mountain shed its centuries old carbon coating and
turned from black to white.
	   The tunnel still is sealed, according to Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed,
chairman of Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission. He said it will
take another six to eight months to collect data from the tests,
the APP reported.
	   The sixth device, identified only as a ``miniaturized device,''
was exploded in a 120 meter (36-foot) shaft in the nearby Kharan
desert on May 30.
	   The yield was about 60 percent of the first tests, according to
The Associated Press of Pakistan.
	   The tests by the uneasy South Asian neighbors has raised the
specter of a possible nuclear war in the region. In the last two
days representatives of both the United States and the United
Nations have been in the region urging restraint and seeking ways
to reduce tensions.
	   Both India and Pakistan were hit with immediate economic
sanctions.
	   ``The tests have imbued the Pakistani nation with the will and
courage to stand on its own feet and (they have been) an
inspiration for self-reliance,'' the APP quoted Information
Minister Mushahid Hussein as saying.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin has rescheduled
for September a visit to Kazakstan that he postponed to deal with

	   Yeltsin had been scheduled to visit the former Soviet republic

Northern Irish beef back on Europe's menu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain celebrated Monday its first
legal beef exports since the European Union imposed a ban at the
height of the ``mad cow'' scare more than two years ago.
	   Northern Irish livestock producers hosted a lunch just a couple
of blocks from EU headquarters in Brussels at which British and
European Union officials tucked in to Northern Irish beef certified
free of mad cow disease.
	   ``This is a very, very good news day for Northern Ireland,''
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam told the lunch
guests.
	   She said the resumption of beef exports would boost economic
stability in the province. ``We have turned the corner. The real
work can now start to restore the export market success.''
	   The EU relaxed the ban on June 1 to allow beef exports from
Northern Ireland because of a special computer tracking system
there which allows herds to be certified free of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The ban still stands for beef
from mainland Britain.
	   The beef served as a starter in raw slices with Parmesan cheese
and carved into ``filet de boeuf'' for the main course was part of
a one-ton shipment from a herd in Limavady, Northern Ireland.
	   Under the new EU rules, Northern Irish beef can be exported if
it comes from animals between 6 and 30 months old in herds
certified free of BSE for at least eight years.
	   However, industry representatives cautioned they could takes
months or even years to recapture last export markets.
	   ``Commercially, it's going to be very tough,'' said David
Rutledge, chief executive of the Northern Irish Livestock and Meat
Commission which hosted the lunch.
	   Exports of beef from Northern Ireland in 1995 amounted to 65,500
tons and were worth about 180 million pounds (dlrs 298 million) to
farmers.
	   The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between BSE and an equally fatal human condition.
	   The British government is hoping the other 14 EU nations will
vote soon on a proposal from the EU's executive Commission to relax
the ban on beef from mainland Britain.

World Cup: Paraguay learned the hard way a good defense is not enough 
</HEADLINE>
By JAIRO ANCHIQUE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Paraguay learned the hard way that a superb
goalkeeper and a topnotch defense will carry a World Cup team only
so far.
	   After allowing just one goal in its three first round matches,
Paraguay gave up Laurent Blanc's goal after 113 minutes of steady
French pressure and was eliminated Sunday in the tournament's
second round.
	   Blanc's goal, the first ``golden goal'' in World Cup history,
meant the game, and Paraguay's hopes, had come to an abrupt end.
	   Goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert and defenders Francisco Arce,
Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala and Pedro Sarabia played almost
flawless soccer, shutting out Bulgaria and Spain.
	   Chilavert, heart and soul of the team, earned high praise,
especially against the Spanish.
	   But the Paraguayans seem to have been too caught up with
thoughts of qualifying to notice they also had failed to score.
	   The first crack appeared against an already-qualified Nigeria,
after Paraguay had finally broken through for its first goal. The
South American side scored twice more and earned its second round
berth with a 3-1 win.
	   Against France, Chilavert and Co. snuffed out one French attack
after another.
	   Paraguay's defenders double- or triple-teamed the French well
before they reached the area, with Chilavert doing his job
splendidly whenever a rival managed to filter through.
	   Unable to advance on the ground, the French tried the aerial
attack, but time and again Ayala and Gamarra cleared with headers
of their own.
	   ``We did everything we could out there. The defense did an
outstanding job,'' said midfielder Miguel Benitez.
	   In the meantime, with head coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani hoping
for a penalty shoot-out, Paraguay's attack all but disappeared.
	   ``I think we had a better chance to win with penalty shots. We
still have to improve the attack.''
	   Then came the end after almost two hours of running, of holding
back the relentless French.
	   ``We had nothing left, we were about to (drop) on the field,''
said an exhausted Gamarra.

EU-Russia commission on nuclear technology transfer proposed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's atomic energy minister has proposed
creating a joint Russia-European Union commission to consider
transferring nuclear technology for civilian uses, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   Minister Yevgeny Adamov said during a meeting with a European
Parliament delegation that Russia wants to join France and Germany
in developing a new type of pressurized water nuclear reactor, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He also said that European countries could join a Russia-led
project to invent a reactor that would virtually eliminate the
possibility of nuclear catastrophe.
	   The European Parliament will further discuss the issue when
Adamov visits the body later this year.

U.S. official, AIDS experts lament continuing barriers to prevention With AIDS Conference 
</HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said Monday
that the United States must be more straightforward about AIDS with
its young people.
	   ``In a country where sex is happening everywhere _ movies, TV,
everywhere you can imagine _ when it comes to addressing it,
frankly we have some way to go,'' Satcher told a session on youth
prevention programs at the 12th World AIDS Congress.
	   Satcher, the U.S. government's top doctor, joined experts from
other countries calling for more efforts around the world to
prevent the AIDS virus from spreading.
	   Feliciano Reyna of RedMet SIDA, a group of AIDS organizations in
Caracas, called Venezuela ``a country where silence rules,''
blaming the government and the Roman Catholic Church for not
talking about the virus.
	   Christo Greyling of South Africa stressed the need to overcome
``all kinds of communication barriers'' in increasing AIDS
awareness by tailoring programs to individual cultures.
	   French researcher Latefa Imane said efforts to educate France's
North African community have been stalled partly by fear of fueling
racism against the minority.
	   Satcher said the United States needs to deal with the virus in a
realistic way, not just stressing the need for abstinence.
	   He urged the televising of condom commercials and deplored the
ban on federal funding of needle exchanges for drug users.
	   In April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
pushed through legislation that would permanently ban such funding.
	   Satcher said an estimated 40,000-80,000 people, mostly
adolescents, become infected with AIDS each year in the United
States.
	   One in four sexually active U.S. adolescents contract a sexually
transmitted disease of some variety each year, according to
researcher Stephen W. Banspach of the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.
	   Banspach said a Texas-California study showed safe-sex education
increased the use of condoms among high school students without
encouraging sexual activity.
	   The three-year study, conducted in 20 high schools in Texas and
California, monitored students who had gone through the program to
increase their awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and
others who had not.
	   By the end, students on the program used condoms and safer sex
methods significantly more than the control group, Banspach said.

Serena loses to end chance of all-Williams match Venus to No. 7 seed; edits to conform AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with Sampras, Venus Williams, other results; fixes
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all. Venus did her part by
getting to the fourth round Monday, but Serena quit with an injury.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, hobbling with a leg injury and trailing
7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat the 75th-ranked Spaniard and set up a fourth-round
encounter against 18-year-old sister Venus, who beat Chanda Rubin
6-3, 6-4.
	   A Williams meeting would have been their third this year and
Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Gail and Carol
Sherriff of Australia played in 1966.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for
England for once.''
	   Serena, playing her first Wimbledon and third Grand Slam,
declared that she had been on course to win the title.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena said Venus, who is seeded No. 7, could be a champion this
year.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   As the tournament began its second week with a fifth day of rain
delays, Pete Sampras moved into the fourth round with a
straight-set win over Thomas Enqvist.
	   In a match originally scheduled for last Friday, suspended by
rain Saturday and delayed for nearly three hours Monday, the
defending champion served 29 aces to beat the 17th-ranked Swede
6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3).
	   ``I've never had a match last three days,'' Sampras said. ``It's
an emotional roller coaster. ... It's part of Wimbledon, part of
the aura about this place. You're going to have a lot of rain
delays.''
	   Sampras saved eight break points, including three set points at
5-6 in the third set. He broke Enqvist twice during the match.
	   ```I feel like my tennis is pretty good right now,'' said
Sampras, chasing his fifth title in six years. ``I'm serving well
and that's the key on grass. This year has been up and down, but
I'm finding consistency here and hopefully I can maintain that.''
	   Sampras next faces French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean, who
downed 16th seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain, 6-0, 7-6 (10-8) 6-2.
Grosjean, 20, a former world junior champion, is playing Wimbledon
for the first time. Mantilla was the 10th of the men's 16 seeds to
go out.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, powered into
the round of 16 with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) win over Nicolas
Kiefer.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist and No. 14 seed, beat
Daniel Vacek in another third-round match, 6-7 (8-6), 7-6 (7-4)
6-3, 6-4.
	   Todd Martin, the only American man left in the draw other than
Sampras, completed a rain-delayed third round match against Todd
Woodbridge, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1) 6-4.
	   In the day's featured Centre Court match, No. 6 Patrick Rafter,
the reigning U.S. Open champion, was due to face No. 12 Tim Henman
of Britain for a place in the quarterfinals.
	   In women's play, No. 3 Jana Novotna was a 6-3, 6-1 winner over
Corine Morariu, while French Open champion and No. 5 seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario got to the fourth round with a 7-5, 6-2 win over
Sylvia Plischke.
	   Serena Williams fell behind right away and never recovered
against Ruano-Pascual. At 4-5 in the first set, Williams took a
thee-minute injury timeout while a trainer sprayed and strapped her
left calf.
	   Williams said she suffered the injury while slipping on the
slick grass during the middle of the set.
	   Williams broke in the next game for 5-5, but Ruano-Pascual won
the next two games at love to take the set and ran off the first
four games of the second.
	   Williams was clearly slowed by the injury, favoring her left leg
and failing to run after some shots.
	   After winning the fifth game of the second set, Williams walked
over to the chair umpire and announced she could not continue. She
packed her bag quickly and left the court as her mother Oracene,
sitting in a wheelchair with a broken ankle sustained two weeks
ago, watched solemnly.
	   ``Early in the match, (the injury) wasn't getting any worse and
I thought I can keep going,'' Williams said. ``But when I saw it
wasn't getting any better, I figured it was time to stop play.''
	   Serena Williams neglected to shake hands with her opponent,
describing it as oversight because she had never retired during a
match before. She paid little credit to Ruano-Pascual.
	   ``She had a pretty good today but if I was in better shape, it
wouldn't have been happening at all,'' Williams said.
	   Ruano-Pascual seemed stunned at her victory. As she sat in her
chair, she shrugged and flashed an embarrassed grin.
	   Williams also pulled out of the women's doubles, in which she

Northern Irish beef back on Europe's menu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain celebrated Monday its first
legal beef exports since the European Union imposed a ban at the
height of the ``mad cow'' scare more than two years ago.
	   Northern Irish livestock producers hosted a lunch just a couple
of blocks from EU headquarters in Brussels at which British and
European Union officials enjoyed Northern Irish beef certified free
of mad cow disease.
	   ``This is a very, very good news day for Northern Ireland,''
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam told the lunch
guests.
	   She said the resumption of beef exports would boost economic
stability in the province. ``We have turned the corner. The real
work can now start to restore the export market success.''
	   The EU relaxed the ban on June 1 to allow beef exports from
Northern Ireland because of a special computer tracking system
there which allows herds to be certified free of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The ban still stands for beef
from mainland Britain.
	   Industry representatives cautioned it could take months or even
years to recapture lost export markets.
	   Exports of beef from Northern Ireland in 1995 amounted to 65,500
tons and were worth about 180 million pounds (dlrs 298 million) to
farmers.
	   The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports on March 27,
1996, after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between BSE and an equally fatal human condition.

Nazi-hunters criticize trial delays in Lithuania 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania plans to open the trial of
alleged Nazi war criminal Aleksandras Lileikis in September, but
that's too long to wait, a leading Nazi-hunting group has
complained.
	   Lileikis is 91 years old and in poor health; many have
speculated that Lithuania has dragged out the pre-trial proceedings
in hopes that he would die before a trial could open.
	   ``One can understand why such a trial, which will expose the
important role played by Lithuanians in the mass murder of
Lithuanian Jewry, might prove difficult to your country,'' Efraim
Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a letter President
Valdas Adamkus and reported by Baltic News Service.
	   ``Yet the repeated and unjustified delays in starting the trial
are making a mockery of the initial and praiseworthy decision to
bring Lileikis to justice,'' he said, according to BNS.
	   Lileikis is charged with genocide. He was head of the security
police in the capital of Vilnius during the Nazi occupation of
Lithuania. An estimated 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish
community of 200,000 people died during those years.
	   Lileikis moved the United States in 1955, but was stripped of
his citizenship in 1996 for lying about his wartime activities when
applying for naturalization.
	   His trial date was announced on Friday.

Tom Cookson dies 10 days after death of novelist wife 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE, England (AP) _ Tom Cookson, husband of
novelist Catherine Cookson, has died just 10 days after the death
of his wife whom he encouraged to write, comforted in grief at
childlessness and, finally, nursed. He was 86.
	   A family statement said Cookson died Sunday, one week after
being hospitalized. Cause of death was not announced.
	   Dame Catherine died June 11 at their home in this north England
city, near where she was raised in poverty. She was 91.
	   Cookson, an Oxford-educated teacher of mathematics, met his wife
when he rented a room in a boarding house she ran in the south
England town of Hastings. They married in June 1940.
	   Their four children were all stillborn. This sorrow partly
prompted Dame Catherine toward writing the novels, many based on
working class poverty in 19th century England, that made her one of
Britain's most popular authors.
	   Cookson, a devoted husband, encouraged her writing. In her final
years, he helped nurse her through several heart attacks and other
illnesses.
	   ``He had what I needed,'' she once said of him. ``Kindliness, a
loving nature, a high sense of moral values and above all ... a
mind.''
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Prime minister tells Romania not to expect NATO membership in 1999 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's prime minister said his
country stands little chance of entering NATO and should develop an
alternative strategy, a government spokesman confirmed Monday.
	   ``In realistic terms, there is no chance for Romania to be
accepted in the alliance's expansion in April 1999,'' Romanian
Prime Minister Radu Vasile told a Peasant Party meeting Saturday,
Gabriel Piscociu said.
	   ``As a result Romania should have a non-NATO strategy, not
because we are giving up our goal, but we should accept reality,''
he said in a speech quoted by Rompres state news agency. He gave no
details on an alternative strategy.
	   For the past several years, membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization has been Romania's top foreign policy goal.
	   But last year NATO told Romania it needed to develop its economy
and democracy before it would be in the running. Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, however, were invited to join the military
alliance.
	   Last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Bucharest and
encouraged Romanians not to give up hope that they will someday be
included in NATO's eastward expansion.
	   But badly needed military reforms nearly ground to a halt during
months of political bickering, which culminated in the resignation
of former Premier Victor Ciorbea in March.
	   Vasile said Romanians needed to have a realistic attitude and
not count on joining NATO before 2002 or 2003, since they are an
impoverished country still struggling to throw off of communism.
	   Defense Minister, Victor Babiuc praised Vasile for his lucidity
and realistic declaration, but said the country should wait until
the next round of invitations before forming another defense
strategy.
	   ``Romania cannot have a non-NATO strategy until Washington
1999,'' he said.

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon after two militiamen killed five guerrillas, CHANGES overline

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon Monday in apparent retaliation for a
roadside bomb that killed two Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   Two fighter jets fired two missiles at a Hezbollah guerrilla
position in mountains on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
zone, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid in the area between Toumat Niha, where Israeli-backed
militiamen have outposts, and guerrilla-held Mashghara in the
mountains just north of the town of Jezzine.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (about 13 miles) north of Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone.
	   Earlier, a roadside bomb exploded near the South Lebanon Army
militia's outpost at Toumat Niha, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah, which is fighting Israel's occupation with Iranian
support, said its guerrillas detonated the bomb by an armored
patrol of the Israeli-backed militia. The group said a vehicle was
destroyed and members of its crew were killed or wounded.
	   Last Thursday, Hezbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four in a similar bombing in the occupied zone.
	   Eight Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen of the SLA, which is
armed, trained and paid by Israel, have been killed this year.
	   The zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory _ was established by Israel in 1985. It is patrolled by
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.
	   Also Monday, U.N. peacekeepers recovered the charred bodies of
five guerrillas _ three Palestinians and two Lebanese Hezbollah
fighters _ who were killed in fighting with Israeli troops in south
Lebanon in the past seven months, U.N. officials said.
	   The bodies of three Palestinian guerrillas belonging to the
militant Islamic Jihad in Palestine had been left in a no-man's
land in Wadi Slouki on the edge of the occupied zone since last
November. The bodies of the two Hezbollah guerrillas had been left
in the same area since February.
	   Seventy U.N. troops participated in the 10-hour search, said the
U.N. officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. U.N.
officials had received assurances from Israeli forces that they
could conduct the search without being fired on.
	   A Hezbollah statement said efforts were underway to recover more
bodies. It gave no numbers.
	   The recovery of the bodies followed last week's exchange of
prisoners and body parts between Lebanon and Israel.
	   In the swap, which was concluded on Friday, Lebanon returned the
remains of an Israeli commando killed in a botched raid last year.
Israel, in return, handed over the bodies of 40 guerrillas and
released 60 prisoners.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief and Security Council
members mourned the death of the U.N. Angolan envoy on Monday,
urging the government and rebels to intensify efforts to complete
the peace process Alioune Blondin Beye helped foster.
	   ``I am sure that all African leaders, as well as the
international community, will join me in this appeal so that Maitre
Beye will not have perished in vain,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said.
	   A charter plane carrying Beye and seven other people crashed
Friday night east of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Five of the seven were
members of the U.N. observer mission for Angola; the other two were
pilots, U.N. officials said.
	   The crash came just days before the Security Council's July 1
deadline for the former rebel movement UNITA to hand over their
strongholds to government control. Failure to do so would results
in sanctions that would freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and
ban its diamond exports, from which the movement earns hundreds of
millions of dollars each year.
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said Monday after
the council met on Angola that Beye's death was a terrible loss for
the peace process.
	   ``I just hope it's not going to bring an outbreak of
hostilities,'' Richardson said. ``I think we have to redirect our
efforts to get both sides talking again.''
	   The United Nations has long complained that UNITA has stalled in
fulfilling terms of the agreement, signed four years ago in Lusaka,
Zambia, to end the two-decade civil war.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.
	   Despite the frustration in carrying out the Lusaka accords, the
United Nations should not give up hope on Angola, said Kenya's
ambassador, Njuguna Moses Mahugu.
	   ``What we can do for Maitre is now to fulfill what he lived for
the last five years _ that is, bring peace in Angola,'' he said.
``I hope the parties in Angola can pay tribute to this great
African by keeping to their words, their promises, to Maitre and
the international community.''
	   Annan, speaking in Vienna, called the Mali-born Beye ``a
dedicated and dynamic peacemaker, and a great son of Africa whom
the Angolans dubbed `the Messiah of Peace.'''
	   Beye had been travelling in the region seeking support for the
peace process from African leaders, Annan said.
	   There was no word Monday on a possible successor.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.

Israel to work on cooperation with Kazakstan, minister says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Israel wants to increase its dlrs 1
billion annual agricultural exports to Kazakstan, an Israeli
Cabinet minister said Monday.
	   However, Kazak companies know little about borrowing, business
plans, and mortgaging, and that is slowing expansion, said visiting
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
	   Kazak Deputy Prime Minister Zhanibek Karibzhanov said his
country was interested in Israeli investment in agricultural
industries, including food processing.
	   Many food manufacturers in the Central Asian country are near
bankruptcy because of financial problems and could be ``given away
to foreign investors for free,'' given a good business plan and
some capital investment, he said.
	   Sharansky, a former dissident who spent years in Soviet jails
before being allowed to move to Israel, also reiterated his
concerns about the alleged transfer of nuclear technology from
Russia to Iran.
	   Washington and Israel are concerned about a nuclear power plant
Russia is building in Iran, saying it could help Iran advance its
suspected nuclear weapons program. Russia and Iran say the plant
will be used only for civilian purposes.
	   Israel and the United States also say Iran tried to develop a
long-range missile with the help of Russian companies and
scientists. Russia acknowledges overtures were made, but said all
were repelled.
	   Sharansky also expressed worry about the rise of fundamentalism
in Central Asia.
	   ``It's a common enemy for very different countries,'' he said.

Higher court upholds death sentences against two Iranians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The country's highest court on Monday upheld death
sentences against two Iranian men convicted of drug smuggling, the
first ever capital punishment rulings handed for drug-related
charges.
	   The Kuwait News Agency quoted the minister of justice, Ahmed
Al-Kulaib, as saying the decision, by the Court of Cassation, was
``final.''
	   The names of the two Iranians have not been released. They were
arrested in October 1996 on a boat with 58 kilograms (128 pounds)
of hashish, 849 grams (30 ounces) of opium, and about one kilogram
(2 pounds) of heroin.
	   All death penalties, which are carried out by hanging, have to
be approved by the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
	   This small oil-rich state is trying to curb rising drug abuse.
Parliament amended the law three years ago to introduce capital
punishment for drug trafficking.

AIDS experts lament continuing barriers to prevention With AIDS Conference 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Experts attending the 12th World AIDS Congress on
Monday discussed the unique problems their nations face in
distributing information about the disease to young people and
agreed that education is the key to prevention.
	   U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said the United States must
be more straightforward about AIDS with its young people.
	   ``In a country where sex is happening everywhere _ movies, TV,
everywhere you can imagine _ when it comes to addressing it,
frankly we have some way to go,'' Satcher told a session on youth
prevention programs.
	   Satcher, the U.S. government's top doctor, joined the other
experts in calling for more efforts around the world to prevent the
AIDS virus from spreading.
	   Feliciano Reyna of RedMet SIDA, a group of AIDS organizations in
Caracas, called Venezuela ``a country where silence rules,''
blaming the government and the Roman Catholic Church for not
talking about the virus.
	   Christo Greyling of South Africa stressed the need to overcome
``all kinds of communication barriers'' in increasing AIDS
awareness by tailoring programs to individual cultures.
	   French researcher Latefa Imane said efforts to educate France's
North African community have been stalled partly by fear of fueling
racism against the minority.
	   Satcher said the United States needs to deal with the virus in a
realistic way, not just stressing the need for abstinence. He said
an estimated 40,000-80,000 people, mostly adolescents, become
infected with AIDS each year in the United States.
	   One in four sexually active U.S. adolescents contract a sexually
transmitted disease of some variety each year, according to
researcher Stephen W. Banspach of the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.
	   Banspach said a Texas-California study showed safe-sex education
increased the use of condoms among high school students without
encouraging sexual activity.
	   The three-year study, conducted in 20 high schools in Texas and
California, monitored students who had gone through the program to
increase their awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and
others who had not.
	   By the end, students on the program used condoms and safer sex
methods significantly more than the control group, Banspach said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin has rescheduled
for September a visit to Kazakstan that he postponed to deal with
Russia's economic crisis, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Yeltsin had been scheduled to visit the former Soviet republic
in Central Asia this week. Instead, he will go Sept. 8-11, the
Interfax news agency said, citing a foreign affairs spokesman in
Kazakstan.
	   Leaders from China, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan had also
been invited to attend the talks between Yeltsin and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev on security and trust-building
measures in Central Asia.
	   Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will now represent Russia in
those talks, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   ------
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Lesotho's three main opposition parties
on Monday challenged the country's Independent Electoral Commission
by claiming there were ``ghost voters'' in the May general
elections.
	   The leaders of the Basotholand Congress Party, the Basotho
National Party
	   and the Marematlou Freedom Party told a news conference in
Maseru that the phantom voters were people who did not cast their
ballots through the voters'
	   lists.
	   The parties said they plan to audit the election process and
results.
	   The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won 78 of 79 National
Assembly seats contested last month. The opposition Basutho
National Party won one seat.
	   ------
	   TSHOLOTSHO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Elephants from a game reserve have
plundered granaries and drunk stock ponds dry, says a local
official.
	   District Administrator Jack Nhliziyo said the problem is so
serious that people are watering their livestock from boreholes,
exerting pressure on the pumps which may break down, leaving people
and animals with no water.
	   He was quoted in the Bulawayo Chronicle.
	   Zimbabwe last year reversed a 1989 ban on exports of ivory and
elephant products imposed by the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species. But in deference to animal welfare groups,
the government shelved plans to cull 10,000 of its estimated 80,000
elephant population.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police Monday reported eight dead and at
least 77 injured in an overnight bush crash in Harare's
southwestern townships.
	   A fully-laden bus belonging to the state-owned Zimbabwe United
Passenger Company went off a curve, hit a lamppost and overturned
three times.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Transport and Energy Minister Enos
Chikowore said ``shocking'' corruption was occurring at the
state-owned National Oil Company of Zimbabwe.
	   Since food riots in January which claimed eight lives, President
Robert Mugabe's government has deferred a decision on increasing
the price of fuel in line with the 60 percent slump in the value of
the Zimbabwe dollar since November.
	   ``All I can say is that we are unravelling serious
maladministration and irregularities which should not have
existed,'' said Chikowore, who claimed there had been a ``free for
all'' allowing even junior managers rake-offs on oil deals.
	   ``The findings are shocking,'' he said. ``Of all the five
para-statals under my control, none beats the corruption at
Noczim.''
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Briton hoping to be the first man to run
the length of the African continent said Monday he was negotiating
with Egypt and Ethiopia to let him pass through the remaining
borders.
	   Nicholas Bourne, 28, from London, said he needed authorization
from the military authorities to cross from Ethiopia to Sudan and
Egypt, where he is hoping to end the trip that started Jan. 21 in
Cape Town.
	   He said the ``Run For Africa'' was expected to raise from
sponsors about dlrs 1.6 million for projects to help children and
wildlife in Africa. The funds will be divided equally between the
British-based Save the Children charity and the Born Free
Foundation.
	   He said he was running an average 70 kilometers (40 miles) a
day.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Cape Argus editor Moegsien
Williams said on Monday he was appalled by the alleged assault of
one of the newspaper's business reporters by policemen, Network
Radio News reported.
	   Thabo Mabaso was allegedly beaten by 10 policemen at a police
station at the weekend. Mabaso, who was due to be released from
hospital later Monday, said he would never see out of his left eye
again.
	   Mabaso said an argument started at the police station after he
complained
	   that police were not attending to him when he reported a minor
accident.
	   He said he was taken to the back of the police station where he
was beaten and kicked in the face.
	   He said he pleaded with police after the assault on Saturday to
take him to hospital, but they kept him in a cell and would not
allow him to make a phone call.
	   The case was being investigated.

Nazi-hunters criticize trial delays in Lithuania 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuanian officials plan to open the
trial of alleged Nazi war criminal Aleksandras Lileikis in
September, but that's too long to wait, a leading Nazi-hunting
group has complained.
	   Lileikis is 91 years old and in poor health; many have
speculated that Lithuania has dragged out the pre-trial proceedings
in hopes that he would die before a trial could open.
	   ``One can understand why such a trial, which will expose the
important role played by Lithuanians in the mass murder of
Lithuanian Jewry, might prove difficult to your country,'' Efraim
Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a letter President
Valdas Adamkus and reported by Baltic News Service.
	   ``Yet the repeated and unjustified delays in starting the trial
are making a mockery of the initial and praiseworthy decision to
bring Lileikis to justice,'' he said, according to BNS.
	   Lileikis is charged with genocide. He was head of the security
police in the capital of Vilnius during the Nazi occupation of
Lithuania. An estimated 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish
community of 200,000 people died during those years.
	   Lileikis moved to the United States in 1955, but was stripped of
his citizenship in 1996 for lying about his wartime activities when
applying for naturalization.
	   His trial date was announced on Friday.

Portuguese lawmakers drop proposal to ease abortion restrictions abortion restrictions but going ahead with future referendums; CHANGES overline to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with lawmakers withdrawing proposed law to ease
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ There won't be any relaxation of
abortion restrictions in Portugal soon.
	   Governing Socialist party lawmakers said Monday they would
withdraw legislation that failed to win a clear endorsement in
Sunday's national referendum, voided by a low turnout.
	   The referendum had been intended to settle the contentious issue
of whether to introduce abortion on demand in this predominantly
Roman Catholic country where the current law dating from 1984
allows abortion only for strict medical reasons or in cases of
rape.
	   Sunday's abstention rate was nearly 70 percent. The referendum
required at least half of the 8.4 million registered voters to
participate for the result to be legally binding.
	   ``The conditions are not in place for the legislative process to
continue,'' Socialist parliamentary leader Francisco Assis said.
	   The yes-or-no ballot asked voters whether they agreed with a
bill to allow abortion on demand through the 10th week of
pregnancy.
	   The bill was passed by Parliament in February by 116 votes to
107, but opponents successfully pushed for the national ballot to
endorse or overturn the bill.
	   Socialist lawmakers who sponsored the bill said after a
four-hour meeting that they would not press for Parliament to enact
it.
	   The referendum result baffled lawmakers and further clouded the
issue which has dogged Parliament for the past 14 years.
	   Of those who did vote, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
	   Abortion rights activists and pro-life campaigners disputed
whether the abstention rate meant that voters were happy with the
current law or with February's proposed changes.
	   ``The referendum demonstrated that this is a deeply divisive
issue both in society and in parliament,'' Assis said.
	   However, Assis insisted that referendums planned for October on
the European Union's Amsterdam Treaty and the creation of
administrative regions would go ahead.
	   The apparent lack of public interest had cast doubt on the plans
to hold two more referendums this year.
	   President Jorge Sampaio, who had appealed for a high turnout in
the abortion ballot, said he believed referendums were still
worthwhile.
	   ``This first referendum did not motivate the electorate,''
Sampaio said in a statement Monday. ``We have to reflect, calmly
and seriously, on this fact''.

Report: South Pacific nuclear tests not threatening to human health 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French nuclear tests in the South Pacific have left
``extremely modest radiation levels,'' that do not pose a threat to
human health, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said
Monday.
	   A 2,000-page IAEA study compiled by 55 scientists from 18
countries was requested by the French government after testing
stopped in French Polynesia in 1996.
	   The study, released Monday, said radioactive material in the
earth and sea around Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls was ``at
generally very low concentrations,'' and ``of no radiological
significance.''
	   The report will be presented to a June 30-July 3 congress in
Vienna of government officials and scientists.
	   IAEA spokesman David Kyd said there would be no danger posed to
human life even if there was a ``catastrophic scenario'' such as a
landslide under lagoons where explosions were carried out.
	   France exploded at least 123 nuclear bombs in the volcanic rock
underneath Mururoa Atoll between 1975 and 1996 and eight under
nearby Fangataufa Atoll.
	   The report added that there would be ``no change'' in cancer
incidence rates in the region attributable to radiation exposure
caused by radioactive material at and around the sites.
	   In 1996, France announced it would stop nuclear tests, sign the
nuclear test ban treaty, and return the islands to the civil
authorities of French Polynesia in pristine condition by 1998.

World Cup: Blatter rules out use of videotape replays to aid referees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA on Monday reaffirmed its opposition to the use
of videotape replays to decide controversial calls in games, a
reaction to to a lawsuit filed by an association of former African
players demanding that two World Cup matches be replayed because of
disputed referees' decisions.
	   The Association of Former African Footballers in France filed
its suit in a Paris court Friday, asking the court to review calls
in games between Cameroon and Chile, and Brazil and Norway.
	   Cameroon and Chile drew 1-1 after a goal by Cameroon was
disallowed and Norway beat Brazil 2-1 on an 89th-minute penalty.
	   If the goal had been allowed to stand, Cameroon would have
reached the second round. Conversely, if the penalty had not been
called against Brazil, the game would have ended in a draw, a
result that would have sent Morocco into the round-of-16.
	   The association demanded that if errors were proven, the games
should be replayed.
	   The court that heard the petition said that the association had
no standing to sue and immediately threw out the case.
	   Appearing on France 2 television on Monday, FIFA president Sepp
Blatter said that videotape replays had no place in the officiating
of matches, adding that referees were not to blame for the
elimination of African countries.
	   ``We can't attribute that to refereeing,'' Blatter said. ``It is
necessary to find fault within your own camp. It's much too easy to
give a red card to the referee when things don't go the way you
want.''
	   ``We are not going to make video superior to the referee. If we
remove human error from football we also remove the emotion, the
passion,'' Blatter said.
	   However, Blatter said that he supported the introduction of
professional referees, adding that resistance to the idea comes
from referees themselves.
	   Referees have been an unwanted focus at the tournament for FIFA.
	   Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner disallowed a goal that would
have have given Cameroon a 2-1 lead over Chile, calling Patrick
Mboma for pushing a defender. Replays showed contact, but no clear
foul.
	   The 1-1 draw that followed meant that Chile advanced and
Cameroon was out.
	   That sparked attacks in the Cameroon capital of Yaounde by black
fans on white-owned businesses and harsh words from the government.
	   The same day, Esse Baharmast of the United States whistled
Brazlian defender Junior Baiano for a foul on Norwegian forward
Tore Andre Flo.
	   Initial replays failed to show a clear foul, though photos taken
from the Norwegian television network NRK showed Baiano clearly
grabbing the jersey of Flo in the penalty area.
	   Kejtil Rekdal converted the penalty for the Norwegian victory,
pushing Norway past Morocco, which at the same time was beating
Scotland 3-0.
	   Anger in Africa has been growing ever since.
	   Last week the African Football Confederation said its teams had
been singled out for ``special treatment'' and expressed ``profound
indignation and many regrets'' that the rules were not evenly
applied.
	   ``Faced with this situation, all of African soccer suffers from
a profound unease. A feeling that her representatives are
undesirables on the grandest stage of soccer on the planet,'' CAF
general secretary Mustapha Fahmy said.

Serena loses to end chance of all-Williams match AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with Venus Williams quotes
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all. Venus did her part by
getting to the fourth round Monday, but Serena quit with an injury.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, hobbling with a leg injury and trailing
7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat the 75th-ranked Spaniard and set up a fourth-round
encounter against 18-year-old sister Venus, who beat Chanda Rubin
6-3, 6-4.
	   A Williams meeting would have been their third this year and
Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Gail and Carol
Sherriff of Australia played in 1966.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for
England for once.''
	   Serena, playing her first Wimbledon and third Grand Slam,
declared that she had been on course to win the title.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena said Venus, who is seeded No. 7, could be a champion this
year.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   Venus learned about her sister's exit during a rain break in her
own match against Rubin.
	   ``I can't change what happened, so I have to go on and just make
sure I do what Serena didn't do today,'' she said.
	   Venus said she likes her own title chances now that Serena,
``the toughest player out there,'' is out of her path.
	   ``I'm definitely at the point where I can do this,'' said Venus,
a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year. ``Last year,
I was not. This year, things are different.''

EU urges peace as memorial to U.N. Angola envoy With Ivory Coast-Plane 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it hoped the death
of the U.N. envoy in Angola in a plane crash would spur the Angolan
government and the rebel UNITA movement into ``an early
completioni'' of a 1994 peace accord reached in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye, who came from Mali, and seven others were
killed Friday night when their small charter plane crashed shortly
before it was due to land in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   In statement, the EU said it was shocked and saddened at Beye's
death.
	   ``A fitting memorial to Maitre Beye would be a genuine and
lasting peace in Angola,'' added the statement issued by Britain,
which currently holds the presidency of the EU.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's prime minister says his
country stands little chance of entering NATO in 1999 and should
develop an alternative strategy.
	   For the past several years, membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization has been Romania's top foreign policy goal.
	   ``In realistic terms, there is no chance for Romania to be
accepted in the alliance's expansion in April 1999,'' Romanian
Prime Minister Radu Vasile told a Peasant Party meeting Saturday in
a speech quoted by Rompres state news agency.
	   ``As a result Romania should have a non-NATO strategy, not
because we are giving up our goal, but we should accept reality,''
he said. Vasile gave no details on an alternative strategy.
	   Last year NATO told Romania it needed to develop its economy and
democracy before it would be in the running. Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, however, were invited to join the military
alliance.
	   Last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Bucharest and
encouraged Romanians not to give up hope that they will someday be
included in NATO's eastward expansion.
	   Vasile said Romanians needed to have a realistic attitude and
not count on joining NATO before 2002 or 2003, since they are an
impoverished country still struggling to throw off of communism.
	   Defense Minister, Victor Babiuc praised Vasile for his lucidity
and realistic declaration, but said the country should wait until
the next round of invitations before forming another defense
strategy.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian markets plummeted Monday amid fears of a
ruble devaluation, despite repeated assurances from the government
that it would protect the currency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin insisted there was no economic crisis,
but urged the Communist-dominated parliament to swiftly approve the
government's austerity plan to nurse the ailing economy back to
health.
	   ``We have no crisis,'' Yeltsin said before meeting with Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to discuss economic strategies. ``I call
this program stabilizing rather than anti-crisis.''
	   While parliament considered the austerity plan, markets and
government bonds took another dive.
	   The Russian Trading System's stock index plunged 6.1 percent at
the close. Benchmark one-year government bond offered yields as
high as 90 percent _ up from 75 percent Friday _ as nervous
investors withdrew from the market amid fears of devaluation.
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin sought to reassure
investors that there was no threat to the Russian currency.
	   ``There will be no devaluation of the ruble,'' he said,
reiterating the Kremlin stance. ``The government and central bank
have enough instruments and strength to avoid devaluation.''
	   A devalued ruble would mean higher consumer prices, which could
lead to social unrest.
	   Kiriyenko said he and Yeltsin discussed ``comprehensive measures
that the government should take to speed up the implementation of
the stabilization program,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The austerity plan focuses on Russia's complicated and outdated
tax system. The new plan has won praise from the International
Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan to Russia.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Monday's parliament
session was ``constructive'' with a series of key bills proposed by
the government getting preliminary approval.
	   He said that the government and the State Duma, parliament's
lower house, had tentatively agreed to meet to debate the
government's package July 15-17, even though the legislature will
officially be in summer recess, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Failure to quickly implement the plan ``would pose a threat to
state security and integrity,'' Kiriyenko said after his meeting
with Yeltsin.
	   Despite Dubinin's assurances, stability of the ruble is one of
the most pressing economic problems facing Russia.
	   Zadornov said the government could not completely rule out a
ruble devaluation if tax collection does not rise dramatically over
the next three months. ``The situation is critical,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   ``Either we collect taxes through changes in the laws, or we
will be faced with completely difference scenarios,'' he said.

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon after two militiamen killed five guerrillas, CHANGES overline

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon Monday in apparent retaliation for a
roadside bomb that killed two Israeli-backed militiamen.
	   Two fighter jets fired two missiles at a Hezbollah guerrilla
position in mountains on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
zone, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid in the area between Toumat Niha, where Israeli-backed
militiamen have outposts, and guerrilla-held Mashghara in the
mountains just north of the town of Jezzine.
	   Jezzine is 20 kilometers (about 13 miles) north of Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone.
	   Earlier, a roadside bomb exploded near the South Lebanon Army
militia's outpost at Toumat Niha, said the officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Hezbollah, which is fighting Israel's occupation with Iranian
support, said its guerrillas detonated the bomb near an armored
patrol of the Israeli-backed militia. The group said a vehicle was
destroyed and members of its crew were killed or wounded.
	   Last Thursday, Hezbollah killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four in a similar bombing in the occupied zone.
	   Eight Israeli soldiers and 12 militiamen of the SLA, which is
armed, trained and paid by Israel, have been killed this year.
	   The zone in its present form _ about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory _ was established by Israel in 1985. It is patrolled by
1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member SLA.
	   Also Monday, U.N. peacekeepers recovered the charred bodies of
five guerrillas _ three Palestinians and two Lebanese Hezbollah
fighters _ who were killed in fighting with Israeli troops in south
Lebanon in the past seven months, U.N. officials said.
	   The bodies of three Palestinian guerrillas belonging to the
militant Islamic Jihad in Palestine had been left in a no-man's
land in Wadi Slouki on the edge of the occupied zone since last
November. The bodies of the two Hezbollah guerrillas had been left
in the same area since February.
	   Seventy U.N. troops participated in the 10-hour search, said the
U.N. officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. U.N.
officials had received assurances from Israeli forces that they
could conduct the search without being fired on.
	   A Hezbollah statement said efforts were underway to recover more
bodies. It gave no numbers.
	   The recovery of the bodies followed last week's exchange of
prisoners and body parts between Lebanon and Israel.
	   In the swap, which was concluded on Friday, Lebanon returned the
remains of an Israeli commando killed in a botched raid last year.
Israel, in return, handed over the bodies of 40 guerrillas and
released 60 prisoners.

Outgoing army commander: Israel's military doctrine is outdated 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS that Vilnai is former deputy chief of staff
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's military doctrine of deterrence is
outdated and might prove inadequate to prevent an attack on the
Jewish state, a former deputy commander of the armed forces warned
Monday.
	   Israel is considered to have the strongest army in the Middle
East, backed by what is widely believed to be a nuclear weapons
arsenal.
	   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, a former deputy armed forces chief of
staff, said Monday that Israel's policy of deterrence is not
sufficient in the age of non-conventional weapons.
	   ``We boast that we are the kind of power that others would not
dare provoke because everyone knows we would respond to an attack
in such a way that it would not be worthwhile for them (Israel's
enemies),'' Vilnai said.
	   ``Today one can say with full confidence, and I am not revealing
any secret, that our doctrine and security position have not been
updated and could probably not respond to the threats developing
against Israel,'' Vilnai said.
	   Vilnai, the leading contender for chief of staff, was passed
over for the position last month when the post went to Shaul Mofaz,
a long-time friend of the defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai.

World Cup: Germany beats Mexico to move into quarterfinals 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff put home a 12-meter
header in the 86th minute as Germany rallied from 1-0 down in the
last 15 minutes to beat Mexico 2-1 Monday and advance to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   Bierhoff outleaped defender Raul Lara for Ulf Kirsten's
right-wing cross to score his third goal of the tournament. Germany
will play either Croatia or Romania on Saturday in Lyon.
	   Mexico had been on pace to pull the biggest upset of the France
98 until Juergen Klinsmann, who had been threatening to score all
game, capitalized on a careless miscue by Lara to tie the game in
the 75th minute.
	   When midfielder Dietmar Hamann's long cross bounded between
Lara's feet, Klinsmann hustled to beat goalkeeper Jorge Campos to
the ball with a sliding shot. The German captain also has three
goals in the tournament.
	   Mexico took its lead less than two minutes after halftime on
Luis Hernandez' fourth Cup goal. ``El Matador'' took Cuauhtemoc
Blanco's pass in the box and moved deftly to the right to avoid
midfielder Michael Tarnat and defender Christian Worns before
beating goalkeeper Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   Mexico, which had never won a World Cup game in Europe before a
3-1 first-round victory over South Korea in its France 98 opener,
easily could have made it 2-0 in the 62nd minute.
	   Substitute Jesus Arellano made a marvelous 50-meter run only to
have his shot saved off the post by a diving Koepke. Hernandez, six
meters from the goal without a defender anywhere close, had all day
to put in the rebound, but instead poked it straight back to the
keeper.
	   Had Germany lost, it would have been its earliest World Cup exit
since 1978, when the second round was used a group format instead
of single elimination.
	   The match was played in torrid conditions at the Stade de la
Mosson, with temperature at kickoff reaching 33 Celsius (91F).

World Cup head apologizes for `hooligan' announcement AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup's chief organizer apologized Monday
for a stadium public-address announcement that called neo-Nazi
Italian fans hooligans.
	   Michel Platini, former star of the French team and president of
the France '98 organizing committee (CFO), said that while a small
group of fans in the Italian section at Saturday's match against
Norway in Marseille rudely shouted fascist slogans, it was wrong to
label the crowd as street thugs.
	   ``The word `hooligan' in the announcement was certainly not the
right one to use,'' Platini said. ``I know all about true Italian
supporters, and I was always pleased with their behavior in
stadiums throughout my career. I do understand that the majority of
them were shocked by the announcement, and we apologize for that.''
	   The announcement, directed at a small group of neo-Nazis, said
in Italian: ``Attention Italian fans. Don't behave like hooligans.
In you do, you will be treated like hooligans.''
	   That angered the head of the Italian soccer federation, Luciano
Nizzola, who was upset that fans from Italy, even though they might
be fascist sympathizers, were grouped in the same category with the
street thugs from England and Germany, where soccer hooliganism has
its roots.
	   Marseille was the scene of three days of violence by English
hooligans the first week of the tournament.
	   An organizing committee spokesman said Sunday that a small group
of fans from Verona, an area of Italy with a sizable neo-fascist
community, were stopped as they tried to take a flag with the
swastika of Nazi Germany into the stadium.
	   When they got to their seats, CFO spokesman Bruno Travade said,
the fans began ``acting in an aggressive manner toward the people
near them.''
	   ``It was very insulting,'' Travade said. ``They were making
politically insulting statements. These were neo-fascists, making
Nazi salutes.''
	   After ushers were unable to subdue the ruckus, Travade said,
eight French police were called to the area, along with an Italian
police representative, who identified the fans as fascist
sympathizers from Verona.
	   Platini noted that the disruption, involving about 20 fans,
stopped as soon as the announcement was made. He said he was sure
that the Italian fans would ``show their exemplary behavior'' at
Italy's quarterfinal against France in Saint-Denis Friday.

Turkey's Islamic political leader goes on trial 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: CORRECTS typo in 5th graf, Erbakan could xxx
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan,
who headed a pro-Islamic government until forced out by the
military, went on trial Monday charged with insulting the country's
highest court which shut down his party.
	   Erbakan was indicted for a speech he made two days after the
Constitutional Court's January verdict to disband his Welfare
Party. Erbakan had called the verdict ``legal murder.''
	   ``The verdict does not have the slightest bit of value in the
face of history,'' the indictment quoted him as saying.
	   The indictment said his words went beyond criticism and were
insulting.
	   Erbakan could face up to 1 1/2 years in prison if convicted. He
has already been banned from active politics for five years.
	   The former premier, who is abroad, was represented by his five
lawyers. The trial was adjourned until Sept. 14.
	   The staunchly secular military pressured Erbakan to resign a
year ago, alarmed by his attempts to raise the profile of Islam.

Arab League chief: No need for a second Madrid conference 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ There is no need for another
international conference on the Middle East, an idea touted by
Israel's prime minister to save the peace process, the Arab
League's chief said Monday.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has proposed holding a
European-sponsored conference to discuss Mideast regional issues
like trade, water and environment, but not Israel's conflict with
the Palestinians. He suggested Madrid as a possible site. The
historic 1991 Middle East peace conference was held in the Spanish
capital.
	   The Madrid conference called for ``some principles and important
resolutions that we have to keep and implement,'' said Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, Secretary-General of the Arab League.
	   The land-for-peace principle laid down in the conference ``will
remain valid,'' so no other conferences are needed, Abdel-Meguid
told reporters.
	   Jordan's deputy prime minister, Jawad Anani, also urged
Netanyahu to implement the existing agreements with the
Palestinians instead of calling for an international conference.
	   ``If Netanyahu wants peace, there are solutions and what he
needs is to accept them,'' Anani said in Amman, Jordan.
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks broke down 16 months ago over Israeli
construction of a Jewish housing unit in east Jerusalem, where
Palestinians regard as their future state.
	   Abdel-Meguid arrived in Syria Sunday on a two-day visit to
participate in an Arab tourism conference.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ There won't be any relaxation of
abortion restrictions in Portugal anytime soon.
	   Governing Socialist party lawmakers said Monday they would
withdraw legislation that failed to win a clear endorsement in
Sunday's national referendum, voided by a low turnout.
	   The referendum had been intended to settle the contentious issue
of whether to introduce abortion on demand in this predominantly
Roman Catholic country where the current law dating from 1984
allows abortion only for strict medical reasons or in cases of
rape.
	   Sunday's abstention rate was nearly 70 percent. The referendum
required at least half of the 8.4 million registered voters to
participate for the result to be legally binding.
	   ``The conditions are not in place for the legislative process to
continue,'' Socialist parliamentary leader Francisco Assis said.
	   The yes-or-no ballot asked voters whether they agreed with a
bill to allow abortion on demand through the 10th week of
pregnancy.
	   The bill was passed by Parliament in February by 116 votes to
107, but opponents successfully pushed for the national ballot to
endorse or overturn the bill.
	   Socialist lawmakers who sponsored the bill said after a
four-hour meeting that they would not press for Parliament to enact
it.
	   The referendum result baffled lawmakers and further clouded the
issue which has dogged Parliament for the past 14 years.
	   Of those who did vote, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
	   Abortion rights activists and pro-life campaigners disputed
whether the abstention rate meant that voters were happy with the
current law or with February's proposed changes.
	   ``The referendum demonstrated that this is a deeply divisive
issue both in society and in parliament,'' Assis said.
	   However, Assis insisted that referendums planned for October on
the European Union's Amsterdam Treaty and the creation of
administrative regions would go ahead.
	   President Jorge Sampaio, who had appealed for a high turnout in
the abortion ballot, said he believed referendums are still
worthwhile.
	   ``This first referendum did not motivate the electorate,''
Sampaio said in a statement Monday. ``We have to reflect, calmly
and seriously, on this fact.''

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A former Red Army Faction terrorist
who had part of her conviction overturned in March was resentenced
Monday to the same term: life in prison without parole.
	   Birgit Hogefeld, 41, was convicted in November 1996 of
participating in a 1993 prison bombing in Darmstadt, as well as
murder in connection with the 1985 bombing of a U.S. Air Force base
and of attempted murder in a failed attack on federal Finance
Ministry state secretary Hans Tietmeyer in 1988.
	   In March, Germany's highest court overturned her conviction in
the prison bombing for lack of evidence. The decision did not
change her life sentence, but opened the possibility for Hogefeld
to be eligible for parole after 15 years.
	   She asked the judges to take into consideration her courtroom
plea to the RAF to disband, which the group officially did this
year.
	   The court in Frankfurt, however, declined to make her eligible
for parole, citing the severity of her guilt.
	   The Red Army Faction grew out of the 1960s leftist student
movement and staged numerous attacks on NATO and U.S. military
targets as well as German business leaders over more than two
decades.

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE, England (AP) _ Tom Cookson, husband of
novelist Catherine Cookson, has died just 17 days after the death
of his wife whom he encouraged to write, comforted in grief at
childlessness and, finally, nursed. He was 86.
	   A family statement said Cookson died Sunday, one week after
being hospitalized. Cause of death was not announced.
	   Dame Catherine died June 11 at their home in this north England
city, near where she was raised in poverty. She was 91.
	   Cookson, an Oxford-educated teacher of mathematics, met his wife
when he rented a room in a boarding house she ran in the south
England town of Hastings. They married in June 1940.
	   Their four children were all stillborn. This sorrow partly
prompted Dame Catherine toward writing the novels, many based on
working class poverty in 19th century England, that made her one of
Britain's most popular authors.
	   Cookson, a devoted husband, encouraged her writing. In her final
years, he helped nurse her through several heart attacks and other
illnesses.
	   ``He had what I needed,'' she once said of him. ``Kindliness, a
loving nature, a high sense of moral values and above all ... a
mind.''
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

World Cup: Denmark spoils Brazil-Nigeria rematch 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Brazil was anxious for another shot at
Nigeria, until Denmark spoiled the party.
	   When the Danes upset the Super Eagles 4-1 on Sunday, they
deprived Brazil of a chance to avenge its 3-2 loss to Nigeria in
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
	   Before a beer-and-barbecue lunch on Monday, the Brazilians
exuded confidence at the prospect of facing Denmark in the
quarterfinals _ and perplexity at the Nigerian collapse.
	   ``Denmark plays and let's play,'' coach Mario Zagallo. ``They're
not as rigid as Scotland or Norway. They position themselves well,
but they can be dribbled with no problem.''
	   The Danish victory was easier because Nigeria inexplicably
rolled over, he said.
	   ``Denmark played simple, serious, efficient soccer,'' said
Zagallo. ``But obviously they won't get the same softness against
us as they did against Nigeria.''
	   Brazilians groped for an explanation for Nigeria's listless
play, noting like its strong showing in the first round, when the
team qualified in first place in its group.
	   ``For me, Nigeria must have had some internal problem before the
game,'' Zagallo said. ``Players who didn't want to take the field,
problems with substitutions _ we sensed that each one wanted to put
on his own private show. All that made it easier.''
	   Team coordinator Zico said Denmark seemed surprised at Nigeria's
lack of resistance.
	   ``Remember that Denmark wasn't so good in the first phase,''
Zico said. ``Something happened to Nigeria. We're not used to
seeing Nigeria like that, so apathetic, accepting the loss.''
	   Brazilians are glad to face Denmark, he said, not least because
they won't have to deal with the specter of the Olympic defeat to
Nigeria and the pressure for revenge.
	   ``It's one less problem,'' said Zico. ``The memory of the
Olympics, as if winning would bring back the gold medal, could have
worked against Brazil.''
	   Still, many players were spoiling for a chance.
	   The loss in the semifinals was humiliating for Brazil, which
boasted Ronaldo, Bebeto and other top players. Nigeria went on to
win the gold, while Brazilians were so embarrassed to take bronze
that they skipped the medals ceremony and went home.
	   On Sunday, after Brazil had dispatched Chile to qualify for the
quarterfinals, Bebeto was asked whom he preferred to face in the
next round.
	   ``I hope it's Nigeria,'' Bebeto said. ``We want to show them
who's the four-time World Cup champion.''
	   When the teams next meet, it may be five.

Annan calls for Angola peace to continue; council meeting on Angola council expected to extend mandate of observers.

By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief and Security Council
members mourned the death of the U.N. Angolan envoy on Monday,
urging the government and rebels to intensify efforts to complete
the peace process that Alioune Blondin Beye helped foster.
	   ``I am sure that all African leaders, as well as the
international community, will join me in this appeal so that Maitre
Beye will not have perished in vain,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said.
	   A charter plane carrying Beye, 59, two pilots and five other
members of the U.N. observer mission for Angola crashed Friday
night east of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Beye was traveling in the
region seeking support for the peace process from African leaders,
Annan said.
	   Annan, speaking in Vienna, called the Mali-born Beye ``a
dedicated and dynamic peacemaker, and a great son of Africa whom
the Angolans dubbed `the Messiah of Peace.'''
	   The crash came just days before the Security Council's July 1
deadline for the former rebel movement UNITA to hand over their
strongholds to government control. Failure to do so would results
in sanctions that would freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and
ban diamond exports, which give the movement hundreds of millions
of dollars each year.
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said Monday after
the council met on Angola that Beye's death was a terrible loss for
the peace process.
	   ``I just hope it's not going to bring an outbreak of
hostilities,'' Richardson said. ``I think we have to redirect our
efforts to get both sides talking again.''
	   The United Nations has long complained that UNITA has stalled in
fulfilling terms of the agreement, signed four years ago in Lusaka,
Zambia, to end the two-decade civil war.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.
	   Despite the frustration in carrying out the Lusaka accords, the
United Nations should not give up hope on Angola, said Kenya's
ambassador, Njuguna Moses Mahugu.
	   ``What we can do for Maitre is now to fulfill what he lived for
the last five years _ that is, bring peace in Angola,'' he said.
``I hope the parties in Angola can pay tribute to this great
African by keeping to their words, their promises, to Maitre and
the international community.''
	   The Security Council was expected to meet later in the day to
approve an extension of the U.N. observer mandate until Aug. 15.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the joint commission. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Angola since April.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government after Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.

World Cup: Germany beats Mexico to move into quarterfinals

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff put home a 12-meter
header in the 86th minute as Germany rallied from 1-0 down in the
last 15 minutes to beat Mexico 2-1 Monday and advance to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   Bierhoff outleaped defender Raul Lara for Ulf Kirsten's
right-wing cross to score his third goal of the tournament. Germany
will play either Croatia or Romania on Saturday in Lyon.
	   Mexico had been on pace to pull the biggest upset of the France
98 until Juergen Klinsmann, who had been threatening to score all
game, capitalized on a careless miscue by Lara to tie the game in
the 75th minute.
	   When midfielder Dietmar Hamann's long cross bounded between
Lara's feet, Klinsmann hustled to beat goalkeeper Jorge Campos to
the ball with a sliding shot. The German captain also has three
goals in the tournament.
	   It's the second straight game that Bierhoff and Klinsmann have
accounted for Germany's goals. Bierhoff also got the winner in a
2-0 victory over Iran.
	   ``Maybe it's an instinct that I have,'' Bierhoff said. ``But one
should also pay tribute to Klinsmann.''
	   Mexico took its lead less than two minutes after halftime on
Luis Hernandez' fourth Cup goal. ``El Matador'' took Cuauhtemoc
Blanco's pass in the box and moved deftly to the right to avoid
midfielder Michael Tarnat and defender Christian Worns before
beating goalkeeper Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   The Mexicans easily could have made it 2-0 in the 62nd minute.
Substitute Jesus Arellano made a marvelous 50-meter run only to
have his shot saved off the post by a diving Koepke. Hernandez, six
meters from the goal without a defender anywhere close, had all day
to put in the rebound, but instead poked it straight back to the
keeper.
	   Mexico had never won a World Cup game in Europe before a 3-1
first-round victory over South Korea in its France 98 opener. After
struggling through qualifying and enduring a huge swell of
criticism at home, the team not only made the second round but gave
the reigning European champions a scare.
	   ``I think this a message to the Mexican people,'' Hernandez
said. ``You should trust us. For those who do not trust us, please
understand. We have done the utmost. We are extremely proud of what
we have done today against the German team.''
	   Had Germany lost, it would have been its earliest World Cup exit
since 1978, when the second round was used a group format instead
of single elimination.
	   The match was played in torrid conditions at the Stade de la
Mosson, with temperature at kickoff reaching 33 Celsius (91F).

Everton advertising `position vacant' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League soccer team Everton on Monday
resorted to advertising for a new manager through the Daily Mail
newspaper.
	   Howard Kendall left Goodison Park last week ``by mutual
agreement'' after weeks of uncertainty over his tenure as manager
but the Liverpool-based club has been unable to attract a
replacement.
	   Everton chairman Peter Johnson is reported to have approached
Brian Kidd and Kevin Keegan to fill the high-profile job but
without success.
	   Everton's advertisement seeks applicants for a manager with ``a
proven track record at the highest level.''
	   Everton is one of several major British teams yet to secure a
manager for the upcoming season.

Prodi first European leader to Iran in six years 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy, which traditionally has kept up good
relations with the Islamic world, is taking a major step toward
bolster ties with Iran with an official visit by Premier Romano
Prodi.
	   Prodi's three-day trip starting Tuesday is the first to Iran by
a Western leader since former Greek Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis made an official visit six years ago.
	   Prodi's trip was prepared during a stop in Tehran in March by
his foreign minister and comes at a time when Iran appears poised
to open up to the West.
	   Italian officials said the visit was exclusively a political
trip, intended to examine the changes taking place under President
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate seeking to reform society while
keeping conservatives at bay.
	   Italian news media quote Prodi's aides as saying Italy has kept
its allies informed of the trip and will brief them on the results.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was the first Western Cabinet
official to travel to Iran since the European Union lifted a ban in
March on high-level visits.
	   The EU ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed last year after a
German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Relations were
already strained by Iran's 1989 death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie.
	   Until recently, U.S. policy has depicted Iran as a rogue state
that must be isolated.
	   But the Clinton administration has been opening cautiously to
Khatami.
	   Prodi will meet with Khatami and other top government leaders.
	   Although Prodi will be accompanied by his foreign trade
minister, Levi denied that Italian officials are making the visit
to drum up business.
	   Still, Italy makes no secret it would like to increase exports
to a country and ease a trade deficit dating to 1993. Iran is
Italy's second largest oil supplier.

	   MANSOA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Gunfire rattled through
Guinea-Bissau's abandoned capital on Monday, while warring army
factions held their ground in a tense standoff along a key road
leading from the city to the nearby town of Mansoa.
	   Under a searing mid-day sun, rebel troops stood their ground at
several roadside checkpoints near the central town of Mansoa. Just
a kilometer away, loyalist forces halted the flow of traffic at
gunpoint.
	   The uneasy proximity of the feuding army forces threatens to set
the stage for renewed fighting outside of the capital, where most
of Guinea-Bissau's 22-day-old conflict has centered.
	   Awaiting further news on developments from peace talks Sunday,
troops from both sides of the country's conflict had checked their
fire at standoffs outside of Bissau.
	   Rebel radio, however, reported ``no breakthroughs'' in meetings
between renegade leader Ansumane Mane and a government delegation
aboard a Portuguese frigate docked near the capital of Bissau on
Sunday.
	   The government have insisted to mediators that there will be no
peace accord unless the rebels lay down their arms, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   Refugees piled into buses heading to towns further east in
anticipation of renewed fighting.
	   Mane staged a coup attempt to oust President Joao Bernardo
Vieira earlier this month after he was sacked as army chief of
staff and accused of smuggling guns to separatist rebels in
neighboring Senegal.
	   The unsuccessful coup has degenerated into near civil war with
the army split between loyalties. Senegalese and Republic of Guinea
troops have intervened on Vieira's behalf.
	   The two sides agreed to meet again on Tuesday, the renegade
station said. A lull descended on some parts of Bissau, which has
been battered by daily artillery and rocket fire since an army
uprising began on June 7.
	   Sunday's discussions followed an earlier meeting involving the
Portuguese and Angolan foreign ministers and Guinea-Bissau
President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Guinea-Bissau was a Portuguese
colony until independence in October 1974.
	   An exchange of gunshots could be heard Monday morning in
neighborhoods of the capital, most of whose 300,000 people have
fled. There were also reports of fighting in the town of Buba,
southeast of Bissau.
	   A five-member United Nations team arrived in the central town of
Bafata on Monday to assess the need for humanitarian assistance.
	   The World Food Program is warning that food supplies in the
central towns of Mansoa and Bafata were running dangerously low.
	   In Bafata, whose population has soared from 160,000 to almost
300,000 in recent weeks, WFP said rice stocks would only last a few
more days.
	   In the central town of Mansoa, also bloated with refugees from
Bissau, fighting that erupted over the weekend dissipated.
	   Roads linking rural rebel-held areas with the capital have
largely been cut off. Fighters from the warring sides were locked
in a tense standoff as loyalist troops held a major road junction
about one kilometer (2/3 mile) from Bafata, controlled by renegade
troops.
	   ``We decided we better leave now. We left Bissau yesterday when
there was a lot of shooting and so much noise,'' said Karim Njie,
who walked some 50 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital to
Mansoa, where he boarded a bus headed further east.
	   ``We are really tired. Only the people are paying for what the
soldiers are doing,'' said another fleeing civilian, Mario Mbana.
	   Prior to Sunday's talks, government representatives had been
hopeful of finding a solution. Earlier mediation efforts involving
church leaders and a Gambian envoy had failed to bring the sides
together.
	   The rebels insist Vieira's government is rife with corruption.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sebastien Perez left French club Bastia on Monday
to join Blackburn Rovers in a 3-million-pound (dlrs 4.9 million)
transfer deal.
	   The 24-year-old defender rejected an approach from rival English
Premier League team Manchester United and interest from AC Milan
and Marseille to sign with Blackburn.
	   The five-year deal took Blackburn's off-season spending beyond
10 million pounds (dlrs 16.4 million).
	   Perez said he agreed to terms with Blackburn because he had
given manager Roy Hodgson his word that if he left France it would
be to play for Rovers.

EU urges peace as memorial to U.N. Angola envoy With Ivory Coast-Plane 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it hoped the death
of the U.N. envoy in Angola in a plane crash would spur the Angolan
government and the rebel UNITA movement into ``an early
completioni'' of a 1994 peace accord reached in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye, who came from Mali, and seven others were
killed Friday night when their small charter plane crashed shortly
before it was due to land in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   In statement, the EU said it was shocked and saddened at Beye's
death.
	   ``A fitting memorial to Maitre Beye would be a genuine and
lasting peace in Angola,'' added the statement issued by Britain,
which currently holds the presidency of the EU.

Third settler youth charged in death of Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A third Jewish settler youth was charged Monday
in connection with the clubbing death of a Palestinian farmer
killed as he walked home from his fields two weeks ago near his
West Bank village.
	   Sunday, the state charged two other Jewish minors with
manslaughter, accusing them of plotting the attack. The two were
passengers in a van which drove up next to Abdel Abu Turki on June
15th while he and a cousin were headed home. One of the two accused
leaned out of the car and wacked Abu Turki across the back of his
head with a wooden board, killing him.
	   The justice ministry said Monday that the third arrested, the
driver of the van had been charged as an accomplice to the crime.
Four other boys in the van at the time have not been charged.
	   According to the charge sheet filed in a Jerusalem district
court Monday, the driver, who was speeding at the time of the
attack, observed the other two preparing to lean out and club Abu
Turki, but continued at the same speed and drove close to the
pedestrian.
	   The state claimed in a court document Sunday that the two boys
charged with manslaughter acted as a result of their ``hatred
towards Arabs.''
	   The boys resided at a home for troubled youth on a Jewish
settlement near Abu Turki's village.

World Cup: English fan looks tough, but he's no hooligan AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Martin Mitchell might look like a
hooligan to the unpracticed eye, bellowing cheers and belting down
beers. But he's not. For work, he puts on a Coldsteam Guards
uniform and bearskin helmet to watch over Buckingham Palace.
	   Mitchell typifies the curse suffered by normal Englishmen, whose
good name is smudged by a minority in their midst. In fact, they
invented modern soccer and may well be the world's most fervent
fans. Noisy celebrations and booze are just part of the fun.
	   One of football's loudest cheers follows a four-beat drum roll
and is simple enough: ``ENG-LAND.'' Fans blast out their signature
song, ``Rule Britannia.'' If the game is good, they conga dance in
the aisles behind their red-on-white cross of St. George flag.
	   But everywhere they go at the World Cup, Mitchell laments,
``English fan'' is synonymous with football thug.
	   It was bad enough when England played Colombia on Friday and
riot troops shut down the laidback little football-loving town of
Lens. When England meets Argentina on Tuesday in Saint-Etienne, a
big football-loving city, it might well be a state of siege.
	   This time, the opponent is Argentina. The two nations have a
30-year grudge that started with a vicious World Cup match in 1966
and, after a war over the Falklands Islands, carried on to a bitter
game in 1986. England contends Argentina cheated to win the cup.
	   Even the most optimistic Englishmen expect some trouble in
Saint-Etienne, and they know they'll have to pay the price.
	   ``It's a shame, isn't it?'' said Mitchell's friend Peter Ord,
who also protects the queen, glancing at police in Lens with
shinguards, helmets and shields. Dogs sat among them, awaiting a
taste of leg of Englishman. ``Most people just want to see the
match.''
	   Authorities in Lens had taken down the huge video screen for
fear of a rumble during the game, as happened in Marseille. With
bars closed, there was neither beer nor TV. A few English fans hung
around to taunt police, but many more took another tack.
	   ``We found a pub over in the next town and had a fine time,''
Mitchell said. The locals warmed up when they realized no one had
trouble in mind. ``The proprietor even gave us a few free beers.''
	   England has played three games, with run-ins in three cities.
Marseille was worse because local French-Tunisians taunted them to
fury, and police did not expect thugs to stand and fight back. In
Lens and Toulouse, it was mostly bottle throwing.
	   No one really knows what to expect from Saint-Etienne, before or
after the match. Police worry not only about the English but also
the Argentines.
	   The tense atmosphere has put English fans on the defensive.
	   Even in normal times, the French and English _ the froggies and
les rosbifs __ are not necessarily the best of friends. Fans win
little sympathy with one favorite chant: ``If it weren't for
England, you'd all be krauts.''
	   After the first wave of violence, French magazines published
long articles blaming the English with little attention to the
contributing roles attributed by French authorities to local thugs
and police. Embarrassed English mea culpas are quoted as proof.
	   Hooligans are no longer simply jobless layabouts, some French
commentators note, but they might be shopkeepers and accountants.
That is, anyone.
	   At the Hotel de la Gare in Lens, a matronly bartender scowled as
one young man tried to order a soft drink in halting but
understandable French. ``Ah, what does he want, this one?'' she
muttered to a regular customer.
	   In Marseille, gangs of toughs insulted and chased anyone they
come across who seemed English, including Americans and Canadians
who looked nothing like hooligans.
	   Blanket generalities don't apply to the French anymore than they
do the English.
	   ``It is terrible how people treat the English,'' said Delphine
Roussel, of Lille, near Lens. ``Most of them are really nice. ``We
invited four of them home, fed them, gave them some Julienas wine
and put them on the ferry. They were very, very grateful.''
	   But the tense atmosphere has English fans on thd.
	   He was a 30-year-old London soap opera producer named Omar
Madha.
	   ``We played badly,'' he said, explaining exactly why he thought
so. France was hard on him, he said, but he put most of the blame
on hooligans who gave England a bad name. Still, he added, it was
worth it to watch the national team.
	   ``It is an obsession with us,'' he said. ``We love football. It
takes such skill, teamwork, timing. The pitch (field) is so big,
and there is one little ball. That's what the game is all about.
It's not those idiots.''

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ The earth shook, the building swayed and
the ceiling came crashing down on seven members of the Guvercin
family. Eleven-year-old Sercan Guvercin was the only one left
alive.
	   ``May God be thanked,'' the boy said Monday, unaware that his
parents, two brothers and grandparents were among the 129 people
killed in the earthquake Saturday in southern Turkey.
	   To spare him the shock, the boy's relatives have only told him
his family members were being treated somewhere else.
	   Sercan spent more than 24 hours under the rubble.
	   ``I heard the rescue workers, but I had no hope left,'' he said
lying on a stretcher in the garden of Ceyhan's hospital.
	   He was reading a book when the earth trembled.
	   ``It started to rock slowly at the beginning,'' Sercan told The
Associated Press. ``I ran to the corridor and the ceiling collapsed
seconds after a great tremor,'' he said, speaking in a whisper.
	   He and his family were visiting his grandparents, and were
preparing to return to their home in Iskendurun, some 90 kilometers
east of Ceyhan, where his father was an accountant.
	   A dark-featured, baby-faced youngster, Sercan suffered a broken
right leg and badly bruised chest. It is not clear who will raise
him now.
	   Another survivor, Hatice Eker, a 45-year-old retired teacher,
was dug out Monday from under the same building.
	   ``I am so happy. I hope more people will come out alive,'' said
Ziya Eker. The fate of their 20-year-old daughter still trapped in
the debris remained unknown.
	   At least five multi-story apartment buildings collapsed here,
leaving scores trapped underneath. After two days of searching, few
were thought to be still be alive. Seventeen more bodies were found
Monday.
	   Ceyhan, along with nearby Adana, where the hardest-hit cities by
the 6.3 magnitude quake.
	   Up to 1,500 people were injured, with 300 people hospitalized
Monday, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, residents prepared to spend their third night
outdoors as up to 70 aftershocks hit the region since Saturday.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

Yeltsin fires his Constitutional Court representative 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin fired his representative to the
Constitutional Court on Monday, apparently because of his remarks
that many members of parliament will support calls for the
president's impeachment.
	   Yeltsin removed Sergei Shakhrai from his post as presidential
liaison to the court and appointed Mikhail Mityukov to replace him,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Shakhrai told the Interfax news agency no explanation was given
for his dismissal, but that he was not surprised.
	   He said the most likely reason for letting him go was a speech
he gave over the weekend saying that demands for a debate on the
impeachment of Yeltsin will get the support of at least 300 of the
450 legislators in the State Duma.
	   ``I simply summed up facts and called things by their proper
names,'' he told Interfax. ``A timely warning should be accepted
with gratitude, not anger.''
	   Shakhrai, a member of parliament, has been a long-time member of
Yeltsin's inner circle, serving as a deputy prime minister,
campaign aide, legal adviser and representative to the court before
his dismissal.
	   Communists and their allies in the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, have accused Yeltsin of several transgressions,
including instigating the collapse of the Soviet Union, launching
the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's economy.
	   Several attempts since 1994 to impeach Yeltsin have collapsed
and the latest initiative is also unlikely to succeed. Even if an
impeachment motion were to be approved by the Duma, it would still
need confirmation from both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts,
as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices finished slightly higher at the
London Stock Exchange on Monday, after giving up most of their
early gains.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
rose 7.1 points, or 0.12 percent, to close at 5,884.5.
	   The so-called ``footsie'' had been as high as 5,923.9, but later
retreated amid lingering concerns about the high value of the
British pound and the possibility of higher interest rates.
	   Provisional volume came to 816.0 million shares, compared with

World Cup: English fan looks tough, but he's no hooligan AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING WITH BC- DESIGNATOR
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Martin Mitchell might look like a
hooligan to the unpracticed eye, bellowing cheers and belting down
beers. But he's not. For work, he puts on a Coldsteam Guards
uniform and bearskin helmet to watch over Buckingham Palace.
	   Mitchell typifies the curse suffered by normal Englishmen, whose
good name is smudged by a minority in their midst. In fact, they
invented modern soccer and may well be the world's most fervent
fans. Noisy celebrations and booze are just part of the fun.
	   One of football's loudest cheers follows a four-beat drum roll
and is simple enough: ``ENG-LAND.'' Fans blast out their signature
song, ``Rule Britannia.'' If the game is good, they conga dance in
the aisles behind their red-on-white cross of St. George flag.
	   But everywhere they go at the World Cup, Mitchell laments,
``English fan'' is synonymous with football thug.
	   It was bad enough when England played Colombia on Friday and
riot troops shut down the laidback little football-loving town of
Lens. When England meets Argentina on Tuesday in Saint-Etienne, a
big football-loving city, it might well be a state of siege.
	   This time, the opponent is Argentina. The two nations have a
30-year grudge that started with a vicious World Cup match in 1966
and, after a war over the Falklands Islands, carried on to a bitter
game in 1986. England contends Argentina cheated to win the cup.
	   Even the most optimistic Englishmen expect some trouble in
Saint-Etienne, and they know they'll have to pay the price.
	   ``It's a shame, isn't it?'' said Mitchell's friend Peter Ord,
who also protects the queen, glancing at police in Lens with
shinguards, helmets and shields. Dogs sat among them, awaiting a
taste of leg of Englishman. ``Most people just want to see the
match.''
	   Authorities in Lens had taken down the huge video screen for
fear of a rumble during the game, as happened in Marseille. With
bars closed, there was neither beer nor TV. A few English fans hung
around to taunt police, but many more took another tack.
	   ``We found a pub over in the next town and had a fine time,''
Mitchell said. The locals warmed up when they realized no one had
trouble in mind. ``The proprietor even gave us a few free beers.''
	   England has played three games, with run-ins in three cities.
Marseille was worse because local French-Tunisians taunted them to
fury, and police did not expect thugs to stand and fight back. In
Lens and Toulouse, it was mostly bottle throwing.
	   No one really knows what to expect from Saint-Etienne, before or
after the match. Police worry not only about the English but also
the Argentines.
	   The tense atmosphere has put English fans on the defensive.
	   Even in normal times, the French and English _ the froggies and
les rosbifs __ are not necessarily the best of friends. Fans win
little sympathy with one favorite chant: ``If it weren't for
England, you'd all be krauts.''
	   After the first wave of violence, French magazines published
long articles blaming the English with little attention to the
contributing roles attributed by French authorities to local thugs
and police. Embarrassed English mea culpas are quoted as proof.
	   Hooligans are no longer simply jobless layabouts, some French
commentators note, but they might be shopkeepers and accountants.
That is, anyone.
	   At the Hotel de la Gare in Lens, a matronly bartender scowled as
one young man tried to order a soft drink in halting but
understandable French. ``Ah, what does he want, this one?'' she
muttered to a regular customer.
	   In Marseille, gangs of toughs insulted and chased anyone they
come across who seemed English, including Americans and Canadians
who looked nothing like hooligans.
	   Blanket generalities don't apply to the French anymore than they
do the English.
	   ``It is terrible how people treat the English,'' said Delphine
Roussel, of Lille, near Lens. ``Most of them are really nice. ``We
invited four of them home, fed them, gave them some Julienas wine
and put them on the ferry. They were very, very grateful.''
	   But the tense atmosphere has English fans on the defensive.
	   After Romania beat England in Toulouse, a young man stood alone
near the stadium, looking like a tough Comanche brave in
red-and-white warpaint. He glowered at an approaching reporter.
When the conversation stuck to football, he relaxed.
	   He was a 30-year-old London soap opera producer named Omar
Madha.
	   ``We played badly,'' he said, explaining exactly why he thought
so. France was hard on him, he said, but he put most of the blame
on hooligans who gave England a bad name. Still, he added, it was
worth it to watch the national team.
	   ``It is an obsession with us,'' he said. ``We love football. It
takes such skill, teamwork, timing. The pitch (field) is so big,
and there is one little ball. That's what the game is all about.
It's not those idiots.''

Britain to fund survey of Gulf War Syndrome work 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Defense Ministry said Monday it will fund a
75,000-pound (dlrs 124,500) survey of literature relating to Gulf
War Syndrome, accepting a recommendation by Britain's Medical
Research Council.
	   The work will be done by the University of Cardiff, Wales, and
results published at regular intervals.
	   ``I believe that the review will very usefully inform the public
debate on this difficult and complex issue,'' said Armed Forces
Minister John Reid.
	   Like the Pentagon, the British government does not accept there
is conclusive proof of a link between illness suffered by veterans
and service in the Gulf War.

Twenty Islamic militants dead in Algerian army sweep 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Twenty Islamic militants have been
killed in an army sweep in eastern Algeria, and about 100 others
have been surrounded at a forest hideout, newspaper reports said
Monday.
	   The Arabic daily El Khabar reported that 20 militants were
killed by troops on Saturday in the town of Sidi Ali Bounab, about
60 kilometers (37.5 miles) east of Algiers. Hospital officials, who
requested anonymity, also confirmed the deaths.
	   In western Algeria, about 100 militants were under heavy
artillery attack in the Stamboul forests, about 400 kilometers west
of Algiers, the reports also said.
	   Militants based there are suspected of launching several recent
attacks in the area, including the slaughter of 17 people who had
their throats slit in a nearby village last Thursday.
	   The newspaper Quotidien d'Oran said Monday that several bunkers
had been destroyed in the siege which has lasted for two days, and
that security forces had seized medicine and food supplies.
	   There were no immediate reports of any deaths.
	   In other violence, four people died late Saturday when a
homemade bomb exploded under a freight car near Tebessa, close to
the border with Tunisia, hospital sources said.
	   The freight car was carrying a group of farmers. There was no
claim of responsibilty.
	   Algeria has been rocked by riots after Thursday's slaying of
popular singer Lounes Matoub. At least one person was killed in
clashes with police during four days of violence.
	   In all, an estimated 75,000 people have died in Algeria during a
six-year Muslim militant insurgency.
	   The violence began after the government scrapped second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

Milan menswear ranges from garbage to glitz AP Fashion Writer 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
By DANIELA PETROFF
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The Italian Spring-Summer 1999 menswear
collections opened over the weekend and immediately turned
``Viagra'' into a fashion logo.
	   Dolce and Gabbana, the mischevious young duo who never miss a
new trend, stitched the potent word in sequins on a paint-spattered
T-shirt during their Sunday preview collection of next summer's
styles.
	   The humorous use of the impotency pill was a rare gag in the
collection, which was based more on workmanship than innovative
styles.
	   The basic silhouette was inspired by the uniform of the Milan
garbage collectors _ short shirt jacket and wide pants with deep
back pockets, in heavy duty cotton.
	   If the look came from the work force, the workmanship was
gleaned from a much loftier source: the anatomy studies of Leonardo
da Vinci.
	   ``We tried to understand how we could work fabrics around the
natural movement of the body,'' Stefano Gabbana said before the
show, held in the downtown Milan home the two designers share.
	   Thus seams and tucks appeared in new places, such as the middle
of a jacket or the bend of a knee. The result was very relaxed even
in the all-business gray suits.
	   Donatella Versace inherited her slain brother Gianni's
entertainment crowd fans, and she knows they like to shine.
	   She stitched grunge slits on trousers in sparkling sequins, and
decorated her slim suits with embroidered reptiles. For extra spice
she sent Naomi Campbell in a daring black sheath down the runway
with the male models during Sunday night's presentation.
	   Trousers on the whole were slim and low-waisted, but the jackets
ranged from the out-grown look _ short and tight _ to an elongated
morning coat shape. The spring-summer palette was mainly purple,
from pale lavender to deep taupe.
	   Far from both the irony of the Dolce and Gabbanas, or
Donatella's quest for luxury, Jil Sander Monday presented a male so
minimalist that it would take more than a dose of Viagra to restore
his male identity.
	   Dressed in small, smooth pullovers under ultra-classic suits, or
conservative slacks paired with a pristine short sleeved white
shirt buttoned at the neck, the young models were so clean cut it
looked like they don't need to shave.
	   Both in color scheme and style the collection was reminiscent of
Sander's androgynous womens wear.
	   Romeo Gigli also drew inspiration from his women's wear for
Monday's preview, presented in Milan's naval museum.
	   Walking onto the runway from below deck of a recreated
ocean-liner, the Gigli models sported shiny silk suits in his
favorite women's palette -- turquoise, caramel, rust and deep
emerald.
	   The style tends to be tight fitting, except in the trouser which
is flared at the bottom.
	   For the next four days, the top Italian designers including
Armani, Ferre, Fendi, Gucci and Prada, as well as Americans Donna
Karan and Calvin Klein, will reveal fashion plans for next summer.

Monday aboard a ship adrift for days off the island's coast. Two
passengers reportedly died of thirst and were thrown overboard.
	   The Syrian ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol
early Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were hospitalized for dehydration and exposure, a
hospital official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The ``Rita Allah'' left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for days before it was spotted by a Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Sierra Leone,
Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Earlier, two other African passengers died of thirst and their
bodies were thrown overboard, Suheib Anwar Saleh, a 25-year-old
Iraqi passenger, told The Associated Press.
	   A police statement later identified one of the dead passengers
as 23-year-old Okin Nbasong from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   The wooden ship, with a crew of six, was officially headed for
Libya, but Saleh said passengers were destined for Crete or Italy
and paid as much as dlrs 2,400 for the journey.
	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   The ship's Syrian captain, Mohammed Mustafa, was ordered
detained Monday for eight days by a Limassol court on suspicion of
causing death through negligence and illegally transporting
passengers in exchange for money on an unsafe vessel. He has not
yet been charged.
	   The ship was docked under police guard in Limassol while five
members of the crew remained on board.
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the government
planned to treat the incident as a humanitarian issue and that all
help will be offered to the passengers.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all. Venus did her part by
getting to the fourth round Monday, but Serena quit with an injury.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, hobbling with a leg injury and trailing
7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat the 75th-ranked Spaniard and set up a fourth-round
encounter against 18-year-old sister Venus, who beat Chanda Rubin
6-3, 6-4.
	   A Williams meeting would have been their third this year and
Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Gail and Carol
Sherriff of Australia played in 1966.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for
England for once.''
	   Serena, playing her first Wimbledon and third Grand Slam,
declared that she had been on course to win the title.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena said Venus, who is seeded No. 7, could be a champion this
year.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   Venus learned about her sister's exit during a rain break in her
own match against Rubin.
	   ``I can't change what happened, so I have to go on and just make
sure I do what Serena didn't do today,'' she said.
	   Venus said she likes her own title chances now that Serena,
``the toughest player out there,'' is out of her path.
	   ``I'm definitely at the point where I can do this,'' said Venus,
a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year. ``Last year,
I was not. This year, things are different.''
	   As the tournament began its second week with a fifth day of rain
delays, Pete Sampras moved into the fourth round with a
straight-set win over Thomas Enqvist.
	   In a match originally scheduled for last Friday, suspended by
rain Saturday and delayed for nearly three hours Monday, the
defending champion served 29 aces to beat the 17th-ranked Swede
6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3).
	   ``I've never had a match last three days,'' Sampras said. ``It's
an emotional roller coaster. ... It's part of Wimbledon, part of
the aura about this place. You're going to have a lot of rain
delays.''
	   Sampras saved eight break points, including three set points at
5-6 in the third set. He broke Enqvist twice during the match.
	   ```I feel like my tennis is pretty good right now,'' said
Sampras, chasing his fifth title in six years. ``I'm serving well
and that's the key on grass. This year has been up and down, but
I'm finding consistency here and hopefully I can maintain that.''
	   Sampras next faces French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean, who
downed 16th seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain, 6-0, 7-6 (10-8) 6-2.
Grosjean, 20, a former world junior champion, is playing Wimbledon
for the first time. Mantilla was the 10th of the men's 16 seeds to
go out.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, powered into
the round of 16 with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) win over Nicolas
Kiefer.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist and No. 14 seed, served 44
aces _ two short of his tournament record _ to beat Daniel Vacek in
another third-round match, 6-7 (8-6), 7-6 (7-4) 6-3, 6-4.
	   Todd Martin, the only American man left in the draw other than
Sampras, completed a rain-delayed third round match against Todd
Woodbridge, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1) 6-4.
	   In the day's featured Centre Court match, No. 6 Patrick Rafter,
the reigning U.S. Open champion, was due to face No. 12 Tim Henman
of Britain for a place in the quarterfinals.
	   In women's matches, No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat was the first player
to reach the quarterfinals. She downed Samantha Smith _ the first
British woman to get to the fourth round since 1985 _ 6-3, 6-1.
	   Natasha Zvereva, who ousted Steffi Graf last Friday, advanced to
the round of 16 in straight sets over Miriam Oremans.
	   In women's third-round play, No. 3 Jana Novotna was a 6-3, 6-1
winner over Corine Morariu, while French Open champion and No. 5
seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had a 7-5, 6-2 win over Sylvia
Plischke.
	   Serena Williams fell behind right away and never recovered
against Ruano-Pascual. At 4-5 in the first set, Williams took a
thee-minute injury timeout while a trainer sprayed and strapped her
left calf.
	   Williams said she suffered the injury while slipping on the
slick grass during the middle of the set.
	   Williams broke in the next game for 5-5, but Ruano-Pascual won
the next two games at love to take the set and ran off the first
four games of the second.
	   Williams was clearly slowed by the injury, favoring her left leg
and failing to run after some shots.
	   After winning the fifth game of the second set, Williams walked
over to the chair umpire and announced she could not continue. She
packed her bag quickly and left the court as her mother Oracene,
sitting in a wheelchair with a broken ankle sustained two weeks
ago, watched solemnly.
	   ``Early in the match, (the injury) wasn't getting any worse and
I thought I can keep going,'' Williams said. ``But when I saw it
wasn't getting any better, I figured it was time to stop play.''
	   Serena Williams neglected to shake hands with her opponent,
describing it as oversight because she had never retired during a
match before. She paid little credit to Ruano-Pascual.
	   ``She had a pretty good today but if I was in better shape, it
wouldn't have been happening at all,'' Williams said.
	   Ruano-Pascual seemed stunned at her victory. As she sat in her
chair, she shrugged and flashed an embarrassed grin.
	   Williams also pulled out of the women's doubles, in which she
was paired with her sister, but said she may still play in the
mixed doubles.

France's Sebastien Grosjean reaches final 16 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ France's Sebastien Grosjean is
probably the least-known name in the final round of 16 at
Wimbledon.
	   But he may not be around much longer.
	   Next up is Pete Sampras for the 20-year-old qualifier from
Marseille following Monday's win over 16th-seeded Felix Mantilla of
Spain.
	   ``It's been a big surprise,'' said Grosjean. ``I played (the
qualifiers) and that was very tough _ and to play well in the main
draw after, so I'm very happy to be in the last 16.''
	   Grosjean had to wait for three hours to claim the biggest
victory of his career as rain halted play after he had won the
first two sets and was leading 5-1, 30-0 in the third.
	   When play resumed, he took five minutes to claim the match 6-0,
7-6 (8-6), 6-2.
	   ``It was frustrating to stop when I was so close to winning,
because he was tanking (throwing) the match,'' Grosjean admitted.
``It was difficult to prepare to win two points and when we came
back he played well, and it was very tough to serve for the
match.''
	   Finishing 1996 as the No. 1 junior in the world in both singles
and doubles, Grosjean jumped more than 250 places in the rankings
last year.
	   This year, he outlasted Hicham Arazi of Morocco to reach the
semifinals in an ATP tournament in Casablanca and took Todd
Woodbridge to a third-set tiebreaker at pre-Wimbledon Queen's
warmup.
	   Grosjean also made his mark before moving to the ATP Tour.
	   He helped France to victory in the Sunshine Cup, acknowledged as
the junior world championship. And he was the first French player
to become European champion in the 18-and-under age group.
	   ``It's great to play the number one, on Centre Court I hope,''
said the 117th ranked Grosjean. ``When you play qualifiers you
don't think about the main draw. You just try to win three matches,
and then see.''
	   Last year, Grosjean earned $76,000. Reaching the last 16 has
guaranteed him at least $50,000.
	   ``I've been watching only points, not my money,'' he said.

Spinal fluid may help reveal Alzheimer's, study suggests

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Spinal cord fluid might someday help doctors
diagnose Alzheimer's disease, a preliminary study suggests.
	   An experimental test distinguished 15 samples from patients with
Alzheimer's or a related condition from 19 non-Alzheimer's samples,
researchers from Heinrich Heine University in Duesseldorf, Germany,
reported in the July issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
	   But the scientists and other Alzheimer's experts warned that it
is too soon to tell how useful the test might be for doctors, who
can now diagnose the disease with 80 percent to 90 percent
accuracy.
	   Currently there is no single diagnostic test for Alzheimer's;
doctors largely rely on symptoms, psychological testing, and
medical testing to rule out other diseases. The diagnosis is
generally confirmed only after death by examining brain tissue.
	   The brains of Alzheimer patients show extensive deposits of a
substance called amyloid beta-protein. The new test is designed to
detect that substance in the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal
cord.
	   Researchers have to study the test's accuracy in many more
people and see if it is fooled by other diseases, experts said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Crops for the 1998 harvest have been planted on
90.9 million hectares (225 million acres) of land, 5.4 million
hectares (13.3 million acres) less than last year, the Interfax
news agency said Monday.
	   The area sown with grain has fallen by 3 million hectares (7.4

Blood cell implants let spine-injured rats recover some leg movement AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Hold for release at 2100 GMT. `Michal' in 3rd graf is cq.
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rats with severed spinal cords regained some leg
movement after they were treated with their own white blood cells,
suggesting a potential new approach for human patients.
	   The injury paralyzed the hind legs, so that the rats initially
dragged them. After treatment, many animals could make their hind
legs crawl slowly on the knees, although the legs usually couldn't
support the rats' weight.
	   The degree of recovery is about equal to what has been achieved
before with other techniques, said researcher Michal Schwartz of
the Weitzmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The more
interesting thing, she said, is that planting white cells in an
injured spine helped it regenerate, much as the cells help heal
damage elsewhere in the body.
	   She stressed that the technique has been tried only in rats, and
the recovery is only partial. There is ``a long way to go to see
whether it works in humans,'' she said.
	   She and colleagues reported the findings in the July issue of
the journal Nature Medicine.
	   The approach is promising, said Naomi Kleitman of the University
of Miami School of Medicine and the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis.
	   The work is part of a flurry of recent research that shows some
recovery with just a small amount of spinal cord regeneration,
Kleitman said. Scientists now have to figure out how that happens
and whether it can be improved enough to help patients get around,
she said.
	   If so, people would probably be treated with a combination of
techniques, she said. Other approaches include building anatomical
bridges across injury sites, providing substances to promote
regrowth and blocking substances that inhibit regeneration.
	   Nerve cells through most of the body regenerate if damaged.
Nobody knows why spinal nerve cells normally don't. Schwartz
believes they don't get enough help from immune-system cells called
macrophages, which rush to sites of injury elsewhere in the body,
clean up dead cells and debris, and produce substances needed for
healing.
	   So she and colleagues took macrophages from the rats' blood and
stimulated their healing behavior by exposing them to segments of
rat leg nerves in the laboratory. Then the researchers severed the
animals' spinal cords and planted hundreds of thousands of the
stimulated macrophages at the injury site and just next to it.
	   The first hints of an effect showed up about two months after
the injury, Schwartz said, and 15 of the 22 treated rats had
partial recovery. Experiments showed that nerve fibers had grown
across the injury site, although it's not known just how much
regrowth occurred, she said.
	   Paul Reier, a professor of neuroscience and neurosurgery at the
University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville, called
the work ``a significant piece of the puzzle'' of how to treat
spinal injury.
	   He noted that the animals were treated immediately after their
spinal cords were cut, so it remains to be seen whether the
macrophage treatment could help people who have been paralyzed for
a long time.
	   In addition, most human spinal injuries result from crushing
rather than complete severing of the spinal cord, so scientists
will have to see if the macrophage treatment would help that
situation too, he said.

Ex-premier says government needs experienced officials 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said
Monday the government needs officials with enough experience to
implement a program to end the country's economic crisis.
	   ``It is obvious that the laws submitted by the government to the
State Duma were prepared in haste and the government should make
amendments to them,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The government needs experienced officials who ``would be able
not only to draw up necessary anti-crisis measures, but to also put
them into practice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin fired the 60-year-old Chernomyrdin and
his Cabinet in March, complaining they weren't moving fast enough
on economic reforms. He replaced them with younger politicians,
headed by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko who is only 35.
	   Kiriyenko earlier this month submitted a government austerity
program that focused mainly on Russia's complicated and outdated
tax system.
	   Chernomyrdin, a potential presidential candidate in 2000, said
last week the dismissal of his government was a key cause of
Russia's present economic distress.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paolo Tramezzani became the fourth current
Tottenham Hotspur player to have joined from an Italian club when
he signed a 1.35 million pound (dlrs 2.2 million) deal Monday.
	   Tottenham completed the signing of Tramezzani from Piacenza, the
Italian becoming Christian Gross' first summer signing.
	   Spurs had been searching for a left sided defender since its
attempt to lure Andy Hinchcliffe from Everton failed.
	   The former Inter Milan defender has a year to run on his
contract with Piacenza.
	   Tramezzani is one of nine foreign imports on the books at White
Hart Lane, although German international Jurgen Klinsmann's
contract ends Tuesday and he is not expected to re-sign with the
North London club.

Italian police report arrests in dlrs 90 million bank fraud 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COMO, Italy (AP) _ The bank was based in Croatia, the checks
looked official and the reference inquiries came out fine.
	   But it all added up to a dlrs 90 million fraud that stung
business figures from the United States, Mexico, Britain, Hungary
and Switzerland, Italian police said Monday.
	   Details were sketchy as early reports of a widespread police
operation filtered out. The ANSA and AGI news agencies said 18
people were arrested, mostly in this northern Italian city, and 52
others were charged.
	   The case focused on an imaginary bank in Pula, Croatia, which
was nothing more than an office with one employee, a computer and
fax, the reports said.
	   The suspects used checks issued in the ``bank's'' name to
acquire goods and cash, ANSA said. When other banks asked for
validation of the checks, the Pula office supplied it.
	   Police seized the stamps used to make the checks, AGI said.
	   The case originated with a drug probe in Como, near the Swiss
border, in March 1997. Police uncovered trafficking in illegal
immigrants, and then were led to the fraud case.
	   The fraud suspects are believed to have links to the organized
crime group in Calabria, ANSA said.

FDA approves first device to doublecheck mammograms AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on
Monday approved the first computerized system that doublechecks a
woman's mammogram _ providing a backstop in case the radiologist
missed a suspicious spot.
	   The ImageChecker promises to reduce the number of women whose
breast cancer is missed on a mammogram, the FDA said. But the
agency cautioned that the device also could increase false alarms
over benign lumps, something its manufacturer is still studying.
	   It was not immediately clear how soon the ImageChecker will be
available to mammography centers, or how much it will add to the
cost of a mammogram. Manufacturer R2 Technology of Los Altos,
California, did not immediately return phone calls.
	   Mammograms, a type of breast X-ray, are the gold standard in
detecting breast cancer, and often detect microscopic tumors. The
earlier cancer is detected, the better the chance of survival.
	   But mammograms aren't foolproof. Of every 80 breast cancers
diagnosed through a mammogram, another 20 are missed, the FDA
estimated Monday. Half those misses are probably inevitable,
because the cells simply don't look suspicious to health care
workers. But the other half might be preventable _ they contain
abnormalities that radiologists missed.
	   With the ImageChecker, once radiologists finish reading the
mammograms, the X-rays are converted into a digital computer signal
that lets specialized software recheck the images for the most
common signs of cancer. Video monitors will display the images with
the suspicious areas highlighted for radiologists to check again.

Appeals court lowers fine for news anchor who beat photographer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An appeals court on Monday ordered French news
anchor Patrick Poivre d'Arvor to pay 10,000 francs (dlrs 1,670) for
attacking a paparazzo who tried to snap him on a Greek island.
	   Poivre d'Arvor had initially been ordered to pay 50,000 francs
(dlrs 8,300) in October 1997 for attacking the photographer, Franck
Skorupan, on the Greek island of Skyros in 1996. But the appeals
court lowered the fine.
	   The TF1 news anchor's brother, Olivier, was also given a 10,000
franc fine on appeal after originally being ordered to pay 25,000
francs (dlrs 4,160).
	   Skorupan accused the d'Arvor brothers of dragging him off a
beach to the house where they were spending their vacations. He
said they beat and interrogated him and seized his identity papers
and equipment.
	   In October, Skorupan was ordered to pay 10,000 francs for
invasion of privacy.
	   Poivre d'Arvor is no stranger to controversy.
	   In 1996 he was suspended by TF1 for ten weeks after being found
guilty of receiving gifts from a businessman convicted of
influence-peddling.

Doctors hope AZT treatment will cut newborn AIDS among world's poor With AIDS-Drugs AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to RAISE number of babies affected
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Health experts are taking the first tentative
steps in a worldwide effort to prevent one of the most poignant
tragedies of the AIDS epidemic: the birth each day of 1,600 babies
infected with HIV.
	   HIV-infected women have about a 1-in-3 chance of passing the
virus on to their babies during or after birth, and the risk is
especially high if they breast-feed.
	   For the past four years, AZT therapy has been standard in
wealthy parts of the world for pregnant women who are infected with
HIV. The treatment dramatically lowers the risk, but the cost _
about dlrs 600 to dlrs 800 a year _ is simply too high for most of
the world.
	   Final results were released Monday of a landmark study in
Thailand showing that a much lower dose of AZT that costs about
dlrs 50 a year can cut the risk in half.
	   And while this is not as effective as the usual dose, it could
have a substantial impact in the poor parts of the world where the
risk is highest.
	   ``The challenge is how to translate this into action in the
developing world. Even simple regimens are not so simple,'' said
study director Dr. Nathan Shaffer of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, speaking Monday at the 12th World AIDS
conference.
	   Since the study's preliminary results were released last winter,
international agencies have been trying to figure out how to bring
AZT to regions where health care is virtually nonexistent. The
challenge was a leading topic at the World AIDS Conference.
	   Dr. Lynne M. Mofenson of the U.S. National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development cautioned that much more is involved
than simply handing out pills to pregnant women.
	   Women must first know they are infected before they can take
AZT, and in most places routine testing for HIV is not available,
she said. Furthermore, the treatment needs to be part of prenatal
care _ something one-third of women around the world do not get.
	   Certainly one of the most difficult issues is breast-feeding,
for years promoted by international health organizations over
infant formula.
	   Even if babies escape HIV during childbirth, it can still be
transmitted during breast-feeding. A study to be presented
Wednesday shows that three years of breast-feeding carries a 9
percent risk of catching the virus, Mofenson said.
	   One attempt to deal with these issues is a pilot program
announced Monday by the United Nations AIDS program to eventually
make voluntary HIV testing, AZT treatment and milk formula
available to about 30,000 women in poor countries in Asia, Africa
and South America.
	   The project will be conducted in Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Ivory Coast, Honduras, Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe and perhaps other countries. The United
Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, and the World Health
Organization also will be involved.
	   Mercy Makhlamena of Durban, South Africa, who lost a child to
AIDS, predicted that poor women would be willing to take medicine
that can lower the risk of passing on HIV.
	   ``Women will move mountains to have a healthy child,'' she said.
``They will be motivated to enroll if they are told this could save
their babies' lives.''

World Cup: Germany beats Mexico to move into quarterfinals 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ For once, all Mexico had to do was
hold its lead. It proved more difficult than coming back.
	   Germany, another master of dangerous living, rallied with goals
from its prolific forward duo of Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver
Bierhoff and squeezed into the quarterfinals of the World Cup with
a 2-1 victory Monday.
	   Mexico, which had come back in all three of its first-round
games to reach the round of 16, couldn't hold a 1-0 advantage under
relentless German pressure and went out against the three-time
World Cup champions.
	   ``I wouldn't want to go through such a game every day,'' said
German coach Berti Vogts. ``My team went through 90 minutes of
torture. We won with our fighting spirit. They found the strength
to win a game that was nearly lost.''
	   Bierhoff put home a 12-meter header in the 86th minute to clinch
Germany's victory. He outleaped defender Raul Lara for substitute
Ulf Kirsten's right-wing cross to score his third goal of the
tournament.
	   Germany will play either Croatia or Romania on Saturday in Lyon.
	   ``My compliments to Mexico, but if you look over 90 minutes, I
think we deserved to win,'' said Bierhoff, who also hit the
underside of the bar in the first half. ``Mexico was dangerous in
the front but we had more chances.''
	   ``If you don't use your chances it becomes difficult,'' said
Bierhoff, who topped the Italian league this season with 27 goals
and now has 20 goals for Germany in 30 games.
	   On another hot World Cup day _ temperatures at kickoff was 33
Celsius (91F) at the Stade de la Mosson _ Mexico had been on pace
to pull the biggest upset of France 98 until Klinsmann capitalized
on a careless miscue by Lara to tie the game in the 75th minute.
	   When midfielder Dietmar Hamann's long cross bounded between
Lara's feet, Klinsmann hustled to beat goalkeeper Jorge Campos to
the ball with a sliding shot. The German captain also has three
goals in the tournament.
	   ``The way we fought in this hot weather makes us incredibly
optimistic for the next games,'' said Klinsmann, who pulled even
with Rudi Voeller on Germany's all-time scoring list with 49 goals.
They share second place behind Gerd Mueller's 68.
	   ``We have tremendous fighting spirit,'' the German captain said.
	   Mexico had never won a World Cup game in Europe before a 3-1
first-round victory over South Korea in its France 98 opener. After
struggling through qualifying and enduring a huge swell of
criticism at home, the team not only made the second round but gave
the reigning European champions a scare.
	   ``I think this a message to the Mexican people,'' said Luis
Hernandez, whose 47th-minute goal was his fourth of the Cup. ``You
should trust us. For those who do not trust us, please understand.
We have done the utmost. We are extremely proud of what we have
done today against the German team.''
	   Hernandez scored when he took Cuauhtemoc Blanco's pass in the
box and moved deftly to the right to avoid midfielder Michael
Tarnat and defender Christian Woerns before beating goalkeeper
Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   The Mexicans easily could have made it 2-0 in the 62nd minute.
Substitute Jesus Arellano made a marvelous 50-meter run only to
have his shot saved off the post by a diving Koepke. Hernandez, six
meters from the goal without a defender anywhere close, had all day
to put in the rebound, but instead poked it straight back to the
keeper.
	   Germany was handicapped shortly before kickoff when veteran
defender Juergen Kohler had to drop out with an injured calf.
	   ``We had a lot of problems at the start and we were clearly
missing Kohler,'' Vogts said.
	   Had Germany lost, it would have been its earliest World Cup exit
since 1978, when the second round used a group format instead of
single elimination. The Germans have made the final eight of every
World Cup they have entered except 1938.
	   ``The bad thing is that we lost, but the good thing is that we
can be very proud of this performance,'' said Mexican coach Manuel
Lapuente.

Chechnya wants to join United Nations expelling OSCE mission from Chechnya 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 11-12 with spokesman saying no intention of
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya has decided to apply for membership in
the United Nations and is holding talks with 10 countries about
establishing diplomatic relations, Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov said Monday.
	   ``A package of documents has been prepared confirming the legal
status of Chechnya as an independent country,'' Udugov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chechnya maintains it is an independent country following its
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country recognizes it as such and
Moscow says the region remains part of Russia.
	   Udugov said the documents to be submitted to the United Nations
include Chechnya's constitution and the peace treaty it signed with
Moscow.
	   ``The treaty has been examined by noted international experts
who agreed that by signing the treaty Russia recognized Chechnya as
an independent country,'' Udugov said.
	   Udugov also said Chechnya was seeking to establish diplomatic
relations with 10 countries which he did not identify. He said last
month his government had sent letters to Germany and Turkey, which
had diplomatic relations in 1918 with the Gorskaya Republic, which
covers roughly the same territory as present-day Chechnya.
	   Also Monday, Chechnya gave the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe 15 days to get permission from Chechnya's
leaders to work in the breakaway republic, even though it already
has approval from Moscow.
	   Udugov said that by accepting the current status of the Grozny
office of the OSCE, Chechnya would be acknowledging Russian rule,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Udugov also lashed out at the 54-nation OSCE, saying its Grozny
mission wasn't helping in Chechnya anyway.
	   ``The OSCE is not solving any problems in Chechnya at present
and is ignoring Russia's failure to respect its commitments before
Chechnya,'' Udugov said.
	   A spokesman for Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov later said
there were no plans to expel the OSCE mission, but that the mission
should coordinate its presence with the Chechen government.
	   ``The Chechen president clearly realizes that the language of
ultimatums is unacceptable in such matters, especially when an
international organization uniting about 50 countries is
concerned,'' spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told the Interfax news
agency.
	   The OSCE has monitored elections in Chechnya and is trying to
supervise the creation of peaceful leadership in the still violent
region. It is one of the few remaining international groups that
has not abandoned operations in Chechnya because of fear of violent
attacks from rebels.

Taliban orders aid groups to move into war-damaged dormitories 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army on Monday
ordered international aid organizations to move into abandoned
dormitories once used by the war-damaged technical institute, the
government-run radio announced.
	   In a Radio Shariat broadcast, non-government aid organizations
were given one month to relocate to the dormitories ``so the
Taliban could provide better security.''
	   There was no immediate reaction from the aid groups, but some
workers, who didn't want to be identified, said some groups may
consider leaving the capital.
	   Although heavily damaged during the relentless factional
fighting that raged in Kabul after the communists were thrown out
in 1992, the dormitories have been repaired. However, much of the
area around the dormitories still lies in ruins, destroyed by
relentless rocket assaults.
	   It wasn't clear what security concerns prompted the Taliban to
order the aid groups out of their homes in several neighborhoods of
Kabul and into the dormitories.
	   It also wasn't known whether the order applied to the
International Red Cross and the United Nations, two organizations
that employ dozens of people.
	   The Taliban religious army swept into Kabul in September 1996
and imposed a harsh version of Islamic law. They threw out the
girls from school and women from the work force. They forced men to
grow beards and punished anyone who shaved.
	   In recent weeks the Taliban launched a fresh clamp down closing
more than 100 privately run schools, that had been covertly
educating girls.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot officials rescued 115 people
Monday from a ship adrift for days off the island's coast. Two
passengers reportedly died of thirst and were thrown overboard.
	   The Syrian ship was towed into the southern port of Limassol
early Monday, a police spokesman said. Ten people, including two
children, were hospitalized for dehydration and exposure, a
hospital official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Rita Allah left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on
June 18 and was believed to have been drifting in the eastern
Mediterranean for days before it was spotted by a Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the police spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The passengers came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Sierra Leone,
Lebanon, Sudan, Rwanda and Congo, the spokesman said.
	   ``There was no food or water on the ship and the passengers were
suffering,'' he said. ``We are now looking after them.''
	   Earlier, two other African passengers died of thirst and their
bodies were thrown overboard, Suheib Anwar Saleh, a 25-year-old
Iraqi passenger, told The Associated Press.
	   A police statement later identified one of the dead passengers
as 23-year-old Okin Nbasong from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   The wooden ship, with a crew of six, was officially headed for
Libya, but Saleh said passengers were destined for Crete or Italy
and paid as much as dlrs 2,400 for the journey.
	   ``It was such a small boat and it developed mechanical problems
twice,'' he said by phone from a hotel in Limassol where the crew
and passengers were being held. ``We were awake day and night.''
	   The ship's Syrian captain, Mohammed Mustafa, was ordered
detained Monday for eight days by a Limassol court on suspicion of
causing death through negligence and illegally transporting
passengers in exchange for money on an unsafe vessel. He has not
yet been charged.
	   The ship was docked under police guard in Limassol while five
members of the crew remained on board.
	   Cyprus in recent years has been targeted as a transit point for
illegal immigrants from poor Middle Eastern countries seeking a
better life in Europe. Most immigrants, some put ashore in remote
coastal areas, come from nearby Arab states, but there have been
signs that immigrants of other nationalities were involved.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the government
planned to treat the incident as a humanitarian issue and that
assistance will be offered to the passengers.

Europe scores two more, CONCACAF loses another pair UPDATED with Netherlands-Yugoslavia

Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Germany-Mexico; CHANGES byline; WILL be

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ CONCACAF lost two more and Europe gained two more.
	   Germany rallied with a pair of goals in the final 15 minutes to
eliminate CONCACAF's lone remaining hope _ Mexico _ on Monday,
while the North-Central American region also said goodbye to U.S.
coach Steve Sampson.
	   Germany led the way for two more European teams into the
quarterfinals, beating Mexico 2-1 on Oliver Bierhoff's 86th-minute
header. With the winner of Netherlands-Yugoslavia set to join the
final eight Monday night, Europe had five of the six
quarterfinalists decided by the end of the day and was assured of
at least one more between Romania and Croatia on Tuesday.
	   Argentina will face England in Tuesday's other second-round
matchup.
	   For much of the second half, Mexico appeared on track for the
biggest upset in the single-elimination phase of a World Cup since
Cameroon stunned Colombia in 1990.
	   ``My compliments to Mexico, but if you look over 90 minutes, I
think we deserved to win,'' Bierhoff said. ``Mexico was dangerous
in the front but we had more chances.''
	   ``If you don't use your chances it becomes difficult,'' said
Bierhoff, whose 27 goals with Udinese topped the Italian league
this season.
	   Luis Hernandez scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the
47th minute, settling Cuauhtemoc Blanco's pass and avoiding Germans
Michael Tarnat and defender Christian Worns before beating
goalkeeper Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   Derided by its home media in the run-up to the World Cup as ``El
Tritanic'' _ a mocking reference to the team's unofficial nickname
of ``El Tricolor'' _ Mexico's legion appeared on the verge of
shaming its critics and matching its all-time World Cup high.
	   The quarterfinal berth would equal its performances in 1970 and
1986, but would be the first time it had advanced that far when the
World Cup was not played on its home soil.
	   ``I think this a message to the Mexican people,'' Hernandez
said. ``You should trust us. For those who do not trust us, please
understand. We have done the utmost. We are extremely proud of what
we have done today against the German team.''
	   But Germany, which has made the final eight in every World Cup
they've entered except 1938, prevailed as expected.
	   ``I wouldn't want to go through such a game every day,'' said
German coach Berti Vogts. ``My team went through 90 minutes of
torture. We won with our fighting spirit. They found the strength
to win a game that was nearly lost.''
	   Mexican defender Raul Lara opened the door for Germany, failing
to clear a cross to his feet and allowing Juergen Klinsmann to tie
the match in the 75th. Lara then held the door open, too, allowing
Bierhoff to get to Ulf Kirsten's cross first and beat Mexican
keeper Jorge Campos with a header.
	   ``Maybe it's an instinct that I have,'' said Bierhoff, who with
Klinsmann scored his third goal of the tournament. ``But one should
also pay tribute to Klinsmann.''
	   U.S. federation president Alan Rothenberg paid tribute to
Sampson, who resigned Monday, saying his ``tireless work has helped
advance our sport and on balance it was an era of growth.''
	   Sampson left as the most successful coach in U.S. national team
history and the only one with a winning record (26-22-14). Since
taking over the team in the spring of 1995, Sampson led the United
States to a fourth-place finish in the 1995 Copa America and
first-ever victories over South American powers Argentina and
Brazil.
	   But a last-placed finish in France 98 following three straight
losses with only one goal scored drew a deluge of criticism from
his players and the media.
	   He was the fifth coach at the World Cup to be either fired or
resign following a disappointing finish, joining Saudi Arabia's
Carlos Alberto Parreira, Japan's Takeshi Okada, South Korea's Cha
Bum-kun and Tunisia's Henry Kasperczak.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac arrived
here Monday for meetings with officials to assess the ailing peace
process and look at ways of expanding French investment in this
former Portuguese colony.
	   Chirac, on a 24-hour visit, was invited to a banquet Monday
evening with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   He will hold private talks Tuesday with dos Santos and address
the National Assembly, Angola's parliament, while some 50 top
French businessmen traveling with him meet local officials and
business leaders.
	   Angola's two-decade civil war, which ended with the signing of a
1994 peace pact between the government and UNITA rebels, destroyed
infrastructure and productive capacity.
	   Lingering mistrust between the former foes has stymied
implementation of the accord, which is running more than a year
behind schedule and has placed a brake on foreign investment.
	   In London Monday, the European Union said it hoped the death of
the U.N. envoy in Angola in a plane crash would spur ``an early
completion'' of the peace accord reached in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye, who came from Mali, and seven others were
killed Friday night when their small charter plane crashed shortly
before it was due to land in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   ``A fitting memorial to Maitre Beye would be a genuine and
lasting peace in Angola,'' the EU said in a statement issued by
Britain, which currently holds the presidency of the organization.
	   The United Nations has blamed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ for
dragging its feet on the peace deal.
	   Chirac was not scheduled to meet with UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   This huge southwest African country has vast untapped natural
resources, including oil, diamonds and other minerals, as well as
agriculture and forestry.
	   However, until the U.N.-brokered peace is cemented, the economy
is unlikely to take off.
	   French economic cooperation in Angola is restricted mainly to
offshore oil production, with Total and Elf investing dlrs 3
billion in the petroleum sector over the past 15 years, according
to the French embassy in Luanda.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria, producing more than 700,000 barrels per day.
	   Angola was Chirac's last stop on a six-day tour of four southern
African nations in a bid to foster closer political and economic
ties in nations where the French presence is weak.
	   Earlier Monday he was in Maputo where he said former colonial
powers, Western creditor nations and financial institutions must
consider alleviating debt burdens that are stunting development in
countries like Mozambique.
	   Chirac said France favors debt relief in southern Africa to give
momentum to democratic and economic reforms.
	   Angola's foreign debt is estimated at more than dlrs 10 billion.
Repayments have been made difficult by the falling world price of
oil, the country's main source of revenue.

Journalists denounce presidential slap, withhold escalation

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese journalists on Monday denounced
President Elias Hrawi's slap of a magazine publisher but withheld a
call for a strike.
	   A joint statement by the boards of the Press and Reporters'
Syndicates urged the president to make a ``brave gesture'' _ a
suggestion of an apology _ in order to restore the shaken
relationship between the president and the press.
	   The president, who is known for his offhand public comments,
reportedly slapped Hassan Sabra, publisher of the weekly Ash-Shiraa
magazine, during an argument Saturday. Hrawi was reported to have
been angered by articles the publisher wrote criticizing the
administration.
	   Sabra, who is also secretary of the Press Syndicate, attended
Monday's emergency meeting that was called to discuss the incident.
	   ``We denounce the incident and consider it to be a threat to the
foundations of democracy in Lebanon and to the relationship between
state institutions and the Lebanese press,'' a statement by the
syndicates said.
	   The incident sparked criticism in the local press that prides
itself to be the freest in the Middle East.
	   The conservative Al-Anwar newspaper described it as a ``setback
for state institutions and a slap to the freedom of the press.''
	   The leftist daily As-Safir called it a ``unique situation'' and
warned of a confrontation between the state and the press.
	   Sabra, however, sought to downplay the incident, saying he did
not believe it had any political connotations.
	   ``It was a moment of anger. I don't expect a personal apology
from the president,'' he told The Associated Press Monday.
	   Sabra, who at first considered filing a lawsuit against Hrawi,
said he now thought escalation would serve no purpose.
	   The press statement said the journalists opted against calling
for a strike or a boycott of the president in deference to him and
the office he holds.
	   ``We have decided to respond to the slap with our weapon _ the
word,'' it added.

Shanghai: Former `Paris of the East' enjoys a renaissance 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
With BC-Clinton-China 
By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ If staid Beijing is the Washington of
China, then Shanghai is its New York City _ commercial, stylish,
cosmopolitan and smug.
	   Shanghai's history as a base for European, U.S. and Japanese
colonialism in China shows in a legacy of Art Deco architecture,
tree-lined streets and European-style parks that give it the look
and feel of a Western city.
	   It boasts China's biggest stock exchange, its tallest office
building and the tallest structure in Asia _ the Eastern Pearl TV
Tower. Its annual income of dlrs 3,000 per person is three times
the national average. After dark, streets of restaurants and
boutiques ablaze with neon look like Hong Kong in the 1960s.
	   Once the business capital of the Far East, with more cars and
telephones than any other Asian city, Shanghai has retained much of
its rapport with Western capitalism and culture and its willingness
to embrace change.
	   Neglected for decades by communist leaders as a suspect
capitalist enclave, this sprawling metropolis of 15 million people
is enjoying a renaissance as an engine of economic reform. Policies
on private business and how to sell off state-owned housing were
fine-tuned in Shanghai before spreading nationwide.
	   Nearly every block seems to have an office or apartment building
going up. A major museum opened two years ago and
multibillion-dollar subway and expressway systems are under
construction. A sleek new music hall is scheduled to open this
year. A Japanese developer plans to build the world's tallest
skyscraper in Pudong, a new financial district created across the
Huangpu River from the picturesque old Shanghai waterfront.
	   All of that building has come at a price: noise, dust and a
property market so glutted that landlords have been forced to slash
commercial rents by 50 percent. Traffic can be so bad that at
midday in the business district, pedestrians move faster than cars.
	   Nostalgia for Shanghai's golden era of the 1920s is booming.
Nightclubs put on shows with dancers in sequins and feathers. The
most sought-after homes in town are renovated villas in the old
French Quarter that rent for up to dlrs 10,000 a month.
	   Much of the money pouring in comes from investors in Hong Kong
or abroad who started out in Shanghai and fled the 1949 revolution.
Some Shanghainese say Hong Kong wouldn't be what it is today if
this city's capitalists hadn't been driven there by the communists.
	   Nearly every Shanghainese seems to have a friend or relative
abroad. Many speak at least some English, Japanese or other foreign
language. Some cab drivers greet foreign passengers by saying, in
English, ``Hello. Where to?''
	   Such an international outlook can make Shanghai feel like a
foreign country to Chinese from other regions, who regard
Shanghainese as snobbish and obsessed with money.
	   Yet in a twist on its former pariah status, Shanghai has served
as a training ground for the latest generation of Chinese leaders.
Both President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the
country's top economic official, are former mayors of the city.
	   So many Shanghai officials have risen to posts in Beijing that a
local joke says ministers from elsewhere can't follow Cabinet
meetings because they are conducted in Shanghainese dialect, rather
than the national language of Mandarin.

World Cup: Winless Japanese team returns to cheers, splash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese national team returned Monday from its
winless World Cup debut, cheered for its efforts but hit with a
splash of water from one disgruntled fan.
	   More than 1,000 supporters turned out at Tokyo's international
airport to applaud the team.
	   But a 30-year-old man, who explained later he had expected more
from striker Shoji Jo, tossed water from a bottle on Jo's left arm
in the airport lobby, police said.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police took no action against the man since neither Jo nor the
Japan Football Association complained.
	   The official quoted Jo as saying he believed the man was a
supporter, and he asked only that police warn him not to repeat
such actions.
	   Defender Masashi Nakayama returned on crutches because of a
broken right foot suffered in the last game against Jamaica, in
which he scored Japan's only goal in the three games in played.
	   ``I tried to score by striking the ball somewhere on my body,
even if it wasn't a beautiful shot,'' he said.
	   ``We will go from the agony of defeat to the next step'' in
2002, when Japan and South Korea will be co-hosts for the World
Cup, team captain Masami Ihara said at a news conference in a hotel
near the airport.
	   Manager Takeshi Okada, who has said he will resign, stayed in
France to watch matches in the later rounds.
	   JFA spokeswoman Akane Kaneko said the federation's board of
directors will meet July 19-20 to decide whether to accept Okada's
resignation. The JFA has said it wants him to stay on for 2002.
	   Ms. Kaneko said the association has not received any official
resignation from Okada. His contract expires July 31.
	   In the first round, Japan lost to Argentina 1-0, Croatia 1-0 and
Jamaica 2-1.
	   Video Research, a ratings monitor, said Japan's match with
Croatia drew a rating of 60.9 percent, the highest television
rating in the Tokyo area for a sporting event in more than 30
years.

Right-wing government to create three new states 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's right-wing government Monday
decided to split three big states into six to help speed their
economic development and defuse political campaigns for their
reorganization.
	   Two new states will be carved out of the most populous and
impoverished northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. A
poor tribal region of central Madhya Pradesh state will also be
turned into a separate state, Internal Security Minster Lal Krishna
Advani said in New Delhi after a federal Cabinet meeting.
	   India at present comprises 26 states.
	   The federal government will continue to govern parts of New
Delhi where most of the government offices are located and where
ministers and lawmakers live, Press Trust of India news agency
quoted Advani as saying. The local state government will control
police and operate utilities in the rest of the city.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party had promised creation of new states
in its election manifesto earlier this year. The federal Cabinet
set up a committee to decide the geographical boundaries of the new
states.

Third settler youth charged in death of Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A third young Jewish settler was charged Monday
in connection with the clubbing death of a Palestinian farmer
killed as he walked home from his fields near a West Bank village.
	   Sunday, the state charged two other Jewish minors with
manslaughter, accusing them of plotting the attack two weeks ago .
The two were passengers in a van which drove up next to Abdel Abu
Turki on June 15 while he and a cousin were headed home. One of the
two accused leaned out of the car and wacked Abu Turki across the
back of his head with a wooden board, killing him.
	   The justice ministry said Monday that the third youth arrested,
the driver of the van, had been charged as an accomplice to the
crime. Four other boys in the van at the time have not been
charged.
	   According to the charge sheet filed in a Jerusalem district
court Monday, the driver, who was speeding at the time of the
attack, observed the other two preparing to lean out and club Abu
Turki, but continued at the same speed and drove close to the
pedestrian.
	   The state claimed in a court document Sunday that the two boys
charged with manslaughter acted as a result of their ``hatred
towards Arabs.''
	   The boys resided at a home for troubled youth on a Jewish
settlement near Abu Turki's village.

Poland wants to speed up some of EU membership negotiations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland wants to speed the start of
European Union membership negotiations in eight areas including
foreign policy, security and education, the chief Polish negotiator
said Monday.
	   Poland is currently in the first phase of EU membership talks,
focusing on whether the country's laws and regulations meet EU
requirements. That phase is expected to last until early 1999.
	   Chief negotiator Jan Kulakowski said Poland does not want to
wait until then to start on the second, more detailed, phase of
talks in eight areas: foreign policy, security, scientific
research, industrial policy, telecommunications, culture and media,
small business and education.
	   ``We expect no difficulty in these areas,'' Kulakowski said.
	   Kulakowski and Ryszard Czarnecki, head of the European
Integration Committee, start Tuesday on a trip to EU member
countries to seek support for speeding up talks in those areas.
	   Other issues, including agriculture, heavy industry and free
trade, are expected to raise problems and are to be tackled
starting next year, according to schedule.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac arrived
here Monday for meetings with officials to assess the ailing peace
process and look at ways of expanding French investment in this
former Portuguese colony.
	   Chirac, on a 24-hour visit, was invited to a banquet Monday
evening with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   He will hold private talks Tuesday with dos Santos and address
the National Assembly, Angola's parliament, while some 50 top
French businessmen traveling with him meet local officials and
business leaders.
	   Angola's two-decade civil war, which ended with the signing of a
1994 peace pact between the government and UNITA rebels, destroyed
infrastructure and productive capacity.
	   Lingering mistrust between the former foes has stymied
implementation of the accord, which is running more than a year
behind schedule and has placed a brake on foreign investment.
	   In London Monday, the European Union said it hoped the death of
the U.N. envoy in Angola in a plane crash would spur ``an early
completion'' of the peace accord reached in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye, who came from Mali, and seven others were
killed Friday night when their small charter plane crashed shortly
before it was due to land in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   ``A fitting memorial to Maitre Beye would be a genuine and
lasting peace in Angola,'' the EU said in a statement issued by
Britain, which currently holds the presidency of the organization.
	   The United Nations has blamed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ for
dragging its feet on the peace deal.
	   Chirac was not scheduled to meet with UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   This huge southwest African country has vast untapped natural
resources, including oil, diamonds and other minerals, as well as
agriculture and forestry.
	   However, until the U.N.-brokered peace is cemented, the economy
is unlikely to take off.
	   French economic cooperation in Angola is restricted mainly to
offshore oil production, with Total and Elf investing dlrs 3
billion in the petroleum sector over the past 15 years, according
to the French embassy in Luanda.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria, producing more than 700,000 barrels per day.
	   Angola was Chirac's last stop on a six-day tour of four southern
African nations in a bid to foster closer political and economic
ties in nations where the French presence is weak.
	   Earlier Monday he was in Maputo where he said former colonial
powers, Western creditor nations and financial institutions must
consider alleviating debt burdens that are stunting development in
countries like Mozambique.
	   Chirac said France favors debt relief in southern Africa to give
momentum to democratic and economic reforms.
	   Angola's foreign debt is estimated at more than dlrs 10 billion.
Repayments have been made difficult by the falling world price of
oil, the country's main source of revenue.

Prodi first European leader to Iran in six years `bolstering' in lead; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RESTORES first name of Levi in graf 11, fixes typo in
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy, which traditionally has kept up good
relations with the Islamic world, is taking a major step toward
bolstering ties with Iran with an official visit by Premier Romano
Prodi.
	   Prodi's three-day trip starting Tuesday is the first to Iran by
a Western leader since former Greek Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis made an official visit six years ago.
	   Prodi's trip was prepared during a stop in Tehran in March by
his foreign minister and comes at a time when Iran appears poised
to open up to the West.
	   Italian officials said the visit was exclusively a political
trip, intended to examine the changes taking place under President
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate seeking to reform society while
keeping conservatives at bay.
	   Italian news media quote Prodi's aides as saying Italy has kept
its allies informed of the trip and will brief them on the results.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was the first Western Cabinet
official to travel to Iran since the European Union lifted a ban in
March on high-level visits.
	   The EU ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed last year after a
German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Relations were
already strained by Iran's 1989 death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie.
	   Until recently, U.S. policy has depicted Iran as a rogue state
that must be isolated.
	   But the Clinton administration has been opening cautiously to
Khatami.
	   Prodi will meet with Khatami and other top government leaders.
	   Although Prodi will be accompanied by his foreign trade
minister, Prodi spokesman Riccardo Franco Levi denied that Italian
officials are making the visit to drum up business.
	   Still, Italy makes no secret it would like to increase exports
to a country and ease a trade deficit dating to 1993. Iran is
Italy's second largest oil supplier.

Vowing `No surrender,' Protestant Orangemen set to defy march ban 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout for AMs
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Pursuing its principle of ``No
surrender,'' Northern Ireland's Orange Order vowed defiance after
being banned Monday from parading through the Catholic section of
Portadown, birthplace of the stubborn Protestant brotherhood.
	   The Orangemen will face a certain blockade of British soldiers,
riot police and armored cars if they try to march Sunday from the
Drumcree Anglican church towards the Catholic residences of
Garvaghy Road, epicenter of a sectarian showdown that has caused
hundreds of casualties and millions in damage for the past two
summers.
	   But the 80,000-member organization, opposed to sharing power
with Catholics in the new Assembly that convenes Wednesday in
Belfast, is planning to mount civil disobedience across Northern
Ireland in hopes of exhausting the forces of law and order.
	   The confrontation will provide a dangerous rallying point for
those many Protestants who oppose the compromises that the wider
Northern Ireland peace process is forcing upon them.
	   Alistair Graham, chairman of the Parades Commission that ordered
the approximately 2,000 marchers not to go near the 3,000 Catholics
who live along Garvaghy Road, conceded that the decision was
certain to arouse Protestant anger.
	   ``Portadown is the birthplace of Orangeism, and the Portadown
District is its first born,'' Graham said. ``The town, and the
parade to and from Drumcree church, symbolize the natural ground on
which they make their stand.''
	   But Graham said the Catholic protesters, led by former IRA
prisoner Breandan MacCionnaith, considered each year's marches to
be ``triumphalist displays of Protestant supremacy'' and their
views had to be respected too.
	   David Trimble, a champion of the Portadown Orangemen who expects
to be elected leader of Northern Ireland's new compromise
government Wednesday, warned that blocking the parade would inflict
a ``potentially fatal impact on our hopes for peace.''	   He demanded an immediate meeting with Ronnie Flanagan, commander
of Northern Ireland's 13,000-strong and more than 90 percent
Protestant police force.
	   Every first Sunday of July since 1807, the Portadown Orangemen
have paraded from town to the rural church, then back home via
Garvaghy Road. The road, once lined by apple orchards, has been
flankced by predominantly Catholic public-housing projects since
the 1960s.
	   After the Irish Republican Army called a cease-fire in 1994, its
allied Sinn Fein party organized protests against Orange marches
that pass through or near working-class Catholic areas. Garvaghy
Road has proved to be the most explosive, partly because the rural
setting allows Protestants from all over Northern Ireland to swamp
the Drumcree church in support of local Orangemen.
	   Orangemen say their protests won't turn violent _ as they said
in 1996 when a failed police effort to block the same march plunged
Northern Ireland into a week of chaos. Orangemen blocked Northern
Ireland's major highways, the airport and the ferry terminal.
	   ``There is a determined effort to get rid of the Orange
institution. The Orange institution is fighting for its survival at
the moment,'' said David McNarry, one prominent member on the
order's moderate wing.
	   Joel Patton, leader of a confrontational pressure group within
the order called Spirit of Drumcree, said the police and British
army would be to blame for any trouble.
	   ``Our protests should be forceful, they should be determined but
not violent,'' said Patton.
	   In Portadown's neighboring town of Lurgan, residents in the
Catholic Kilwilkie district attacked police as they searched homes
for weaponry.
	   Police said they found four pounds (2 kgs) of Semtex, the IRA's
favored plastic explosive, and other weaponry in one residence _
then had about a half-dozen gasoline bombs thrown at them. No
serious injuries were reported.

Leaders of U.N. and Commonwealth visit Nigeria Edits to conform. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to add Annan's arrival. Details, quotes, background.
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The United Nations and Commonwealth
stepped up efforts to bridge the international diplomatic gulf with
Nigeria with visits Monday to the sprawling West African country by
the leaders of the two organizations.
	   Nigerian-born Emeka Anyaoku, the Secretary General of the
Commonwealth, was in his home country for talks with the country's
new military leader Monday morning and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan arrived in the capital of Abuja later in the day on a flight
from Vienna.
	   Both leaders were expected to meet military leader Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar on Tuesday morning, government spokesman David
Attah said.
	   During his two-day visit, Annan planned to meet a wide range of
pro-democracy leaders, government officials and opposition
activists, said Ahmad Fawzi, a member of Annan's delegation.
	   On Wednesday he was to attend a ``mini heads-of-state summit''
organized by the Nigerian government, said Ahmad Fawzi, a member of
Annan's U.N. delegation. It was unclear which foreign leaders had
been invited or what was on the agenda.
	   Annan, who was also to be the guest of honor at a state banquet
thrown by Abubakar on Tuesday, said he was encouraged by ``rapid
steps'' taken by the Nigerian general to ``affirm a transition to
democratic and civilian rule,'' Fawzi said.
	   ``He hopes that all Nigerians will work together in a spirit of
cooperation to ensure democracy. It will require compromise
flexibility and wisdom, and he trusts these qualities will not be
lacking,'' the U.N. official said.
	   Anyaoku was also upbeat about the prospects for returning
Nigeria to the international fold after years of being a pariah
under the rule of the late Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha, who took power following a coup in 1993, died of heart
failure on June 8 and was succeeded by Abubakar.
	   ``My being here is the beginning of the process of
re-integrating Nigeria into the international community,'' Anyaoku
told reporters after arriving late Sunday. ``The whole Commonwealth
and the international community has welcomed the steps so far taken
by the new leader and our hope is that this is just the
beginning.''
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation club of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks after leading playwright
and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in November 1995.
	   British Foreign Office junior minister Tony Lloyd visited the
former British colony last Friday on behalf of the European Union
and praised Abubakar's action in releasing political prisoners and
moving towards restoring democracy.
	   Annan said he has been ``much encouraged'' by his recent
intensive discussions with Abubakar, as well as the general's early
actions in power, and decided the time is right for such a trip.
	   The new military leader has raised expectations for democratic
reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners. However the
country's most prominent detainee, presumed 1993 elections winner
Moshood Abiola, remains behind bars.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all. Venus did her part by
getting to the fourth round Monday, but Serena quit with an injury.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, hobbling with a strained left calf and
trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat the 75th-ranked Spaniard and set up a fourth-round
encounter against 18-year-old sister Venus, who beat Chanda Rubin
6-3, 6-4.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras advanced to the
fourth round in straight sets over Thomas Enqvist, while Britain's
Tim Henman ousted Patrick Rafter in four sets to become the first
man to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Women's No. 2 Lindsay Davenport crushed Magui Serna 6-1, 6-0 to
make the quarters, joining Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva.
	   A Williams meeting would have been their third this year and
Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Gail and Carol
Sherriff of Australia played in 1966.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for
England for once.''
	   Serena, playing her first Wimbledon and third Grand Slam,
declared that she had been on course to win the title.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena said Venus, who is seeded No. 7, could be a champion this
year.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   Venus learned about her sister's exit during a rain break in her
own match against Rubin.
	   ``I can't change what happened, so I have to go on and just make
sure I do what Serena didn't do today,'' she said.
	   Venus said she likes her own title chances now that Serena,
``the toughest player out there,'' is out of her path.
	   ``I'm definitely at the point where I can do this,'' said Venus,
a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year. ``Last year,
I was not. This year, things are different.''
	   In a match originally scheduled for last Friday, suspended by
rain Saturday and delayed for nearly three hours Monday, Sampras
served 29 aces to beat the 17th-ranked Enqvist 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(7-3).
	   ``I've never had a match last three days,'' Sampras said. ``It's
an emotional roller coaster. ... It's part of Wimbledon, part of
the aura about this place. You're going to have a lot of rain
delays.''
	   Sampras saved eight break points, including three set points at
5-6 in the third set. He broke Enqvist twice during the match.
	   ```I feel like my tennis is pretty good right now,'' said
Sampras, chasing his fifth title in six years. ``I'm serving well
and that's the key on grass. This year has been up and down, but
I'm finding consistency here and hopefully I can maintain that.''
	   Sampras next faces French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean, who
downed 16th seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain, 6-0, 7-6 (10-8) 6-2.
Grosjean, 20, a former world junior champion, is playing Wimbledon
for the first time. Mantilla was the 10th of the men's 16 seeds to
go out.
	   No. 12 Henman, seeking to become the first British man to win
Wimbledon in 36 years, made the quarters for the third year in a
row by outplaying Rafter _ the U.S. Open champion and No. 6 seed _
6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-3, 6-2.
	   Rafter was treated for a lower back injury at the start of the
fourth set. A trainer massaged and stretched Rafter as he lay on a
towel.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, powered into
the round of 16 with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) win over Nicolas
Kiefer.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist and No. 14 seed, served 44
aces _ two short of his tournament record _ to beat Daniel Vacek in
another third-round match, 6-7 (8-6), 7-6 (7-4) 6-3, 6-4.
	   Todd Martin, the only American man left in the draw other than
Sampras, completed a rain-delayed third round match against Todd
Woodbridge, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1) 6-4.
	   In women's matches, No. 16 Tauziat was the first player to reach
the quarterfinals. She downed Samantha Smith _ the first British
woman to get to the fourth round since 1985 _ 6-3, 6-1.
	   Zvereva, who ousted Steffi Graf last Friday, advanced to the
round of 16 in straight sets over Miriam Oremans.
	   In women's third-round play, No. 3 Jana Novotna was a 6-3, 6-1
winner over Corine Morariu, while French Open champion and No. 5
seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had a 7-5, 6-2 win over Sylvia
Plischke.
	   Serena Williams fell behind right away and never recovered
against Ruano-Pascual. At 4-5 in the first set, Williams took a
thee-minute injury timeout while a trainer sprayed and strapped her
left calf.
	   Williams said she suffered the injury while slipping on the
slick grass during the middle of the set.
	   Williams broke in the next game for 5-5, but Ruano-Pascual won
the next two games at love to take the set and ran off the first
four games of the second.
	   Williams was clearly slowed by the injury, favoring her left leg
and failing to run after some shots.
	   After winning the fifth game of the second set, Williams walked
over to the chair umpire and announced she could not continue. She
packed her bag quickly and left the court as her mother Oracene,
sitting in a wheelchair with a broken ankle sustained two weeks
ago, watched solemnly.
	   ``Early in the match, (the injury) wasn't getting any worse and
I thought I can keep going,'' Williams said. ``But when I saw it
wasn't getting any better, I figured it was time to stop play.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese journalists on Monday denounced
President Elias Hrawi for slapping a magazine publisher but
withheld a call for a strike.
	   A joint statement by the boards of the Press and Reporters'
Syndicates urged the president to make a ``brave gesture'' _ a
suggestion of an apology _ in order to restore the shaken
relationship between the president and the press.
	   The president, who is known for his offhand public comments,
reportedly slapped Hassan Sabra, publisher of the weekly Ash-Shiraa
magazine, during an argument Saturday. Hrawi was reported to have
been angered by articles the publisher wrote criticizing the
administration.
	   Sabra, who is also secretary of the Press Syndicate, attended
Monday's emergency meeting that was called to discuss the incident.
	   ``We denounce the incident and consider it to be a threat to the
foundations of democracy in Lebanon and to the relationship between
state institutions and the Lebanese press,'' a statement by the
syndicates said.
	   The incident sparked criticism in the local press that prides
itself to be the freest in the Middle East. Sabra, however, sought
to downplay the incident, saying he did not believe it had any
political connotations.
	   ``It was a moment of anger. I don't expect a personal apology
from the president,'' he told The Associated Press Monday.
	   Sabra, who at first considered filing a lawsuit against Hrawi,
said he now thought escalation would serve no purpose.

Jackson still interested in building an amusement park in Poland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Though the King of Pop has chosen Rio as
the venue for a major theme park, he hasn't given up on building
one in Poland's capital.
	   Michael Jackson has extended for a year his letter of intent to
build a dlrs 500 million amusement park in Warsaw, a representative
said Monday. Jackson so far has been unable to get permission for
his favored site, at a military airport.
	   ``Michael is not backing out from plans to build a theme park in
Poland,'' said Marek Kwiatkowski, an art historian who represents
Jackson's interests in Poland.
	   City officials in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, announced last week
that Jackson would build an dlrs 800 million theme park there,
although a site has not yet been chosen.
	   Warsaw Mayor Marcin Swiecicki, who supports Jackson's plans for
a park in Poland, has been unable to obtain consent from all of the
parties who have a say in how the military airport is used.
	   Local organizers are in the meantime trying to come up with a
different site, said Kwiatkowski, who recently met with Jackson.

CHINA NOTEBOOK: Chelsea on rickshaw ride in Beijing adventure AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ On the crowded streets of this sweltering
capital, Chelsea Clinton rode in a rickshaw on a sightseeing
adventure Monday away from Mom and Dad.
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton was spending time with her own mother, an
unofficial member of the Clinton delegation. And President Bill
Clinton was being challenged by university students about his
criticism of China's human rights and arms sales to Taiwan.
	   Chelsea is no stranger to unusual modes of travel. She's ridden
atop camels and elephants with Mom on foreign trips and behind the
armored walls of presidential limousines with Dad. Her rickshaw
outing was revealed by press secretary Mike McCurry, who declined
to provide any details.
	   Certainly, though, the Chinese government _ and Secret Service
agents _ made sure that Chelsea didn't suffer through the massive
traffic jam that ensnarled much of downtown Beijing as authorities
shut down streets in preparation for the Clintons' departure for a
flight to Shanghai.
	   All together again before their flight, the Clintons played
cards and board games with friends and aides and got a little rest
at their government guest house, McCurry related.
	   ___
	   Clinton, his Cabinet summit travelers and staff stayed at a
Chinese government guest complex, Diaoyutai, during their three
nights in Beijing.
	   It is a walled, secured area of gardens, with ponds and
waterfalls, not far from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City at
the heart of the traffic jammed city, a sort of oasis, kept by the
communist government.
	   And probably wired for sound. At least that was the assumption
of the Americans who stayed there; in staff quarters, there were
reminders that the walls might have ears.
	   McCurry said the traveling party was briefed in advance, as is
standard on foreign trips, about ``the security environment we're
going into.''
	   So no state secrets out loud.
	   ``We have ways in which we can do the orderly business of the
United States government in a secure manner,'' the press secretary
said.
	   In Shanghai, the president and his party were at the Portmand
Ritz Carleton Hotel. And, presumably, no less cautious about
security when talking U.S. government business.

No. 2 guerrilla group resumes peace dialogue with government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The country's second-largest rebel force
has resumed contacts with a government-sanctioned peace commission
and plans to discuss next month a possible end to the guerrilla
conflict, a commission member said Monday.
	   Representatives of the rebel National Liberation Army signed a
brief four-point agreement Sunday in the Germany city of Mainz with
members of the National Peace Committee, which was created by
Colombia's Congress in December.
	   ``All I can say is that we are seriously making an effort here
to achieve results,'' Sabas Pretelt, a committee member and
president of the FENALCO business association, said in a radio
interview from Germany.
	   The leftist rebel group, known by its Spanish initials ELN, said
it would meet in July at an unspecified date and place with members
of the committee, comprised of various sectors of Colombian society
and the Roman Catholic Church.
	   The German and Spanish governments have both sought to
facilitate efforts to end Colombia's more than three-decade-old
civil war, but Pretelt refused to characterize Germany's
involvement in the weekend meeting.
	   He said President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office Aug.
7, was informed of the agreement. Pastrana is seeking a meeting
with leaders of Colombia's oldest and largest rebel force, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, before his inauguration.
	   The ELN signed a secret agreement in February with delegates of
outgoing President Ernesto Samper to begin a peace dialogue. But
that Spanish-brokered initiative collapsed a month later after word
of it leaked to the news media.

Precede JERUSALEM Netanyahu rejects call by Israeli president for early elections CHANGES Byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with new quotes, details;
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scathing attack of the Israeli
prime minister's performance, President Ezer Weizman said Benjamin
Netanyahu has failed in everything from the Mideast peace process
to the country's economy.
	   Weizman called for new elections and said that the Israeli
public has not been giving the ``true picture,'' of a peace process
which is going nowhere.
	   Several government officials reacted to the remarks by calling
for Weizman's resignation.
	   Israel's presidency is a largely ceremonial position, but the
popular Weizman has used it as a platform for increasingly harsh
criticism of Netanyahu's handling of the peace talks, which have
been stalled for the past 15 months over the scope of a West Bank
troop withdrawal.
	   ``We're isolated, the economy is not what we hoped for, not what
it was a few years ago, we have fallen out of favor in the
international community, relations with the PLO hardly exists. It's
time to go to the people,'' a visibly angry Weizman said.
	   Monday, Weizman delivered his toughest remarks yet in
back-to-back interviews with Israel's top two TV news programs.
Political analysts said the move could trigger centrist parties to
bolt Netanyahu's fragile coalition and lead to Netanyahu's
downfall.
	   Netanyahu however dismissed early elections and insisted the
Palestinians _ not Israel _ were to blame for the failure to reach
agreement on a withdrawal.
	   ``I am working night and day on one thing, to reach an
agreement, and no pressure, no thing, and no man will keep me from
this aim,'' he told reporters. ``Peace is very, very close _ if the
Palestinians do their part.''
	   But the 73-year-old president seemed to suggest the problem laid
with the younger Israeli leader.
	   ``It's not possible that everyone is wrong and we are only right
and justified here, it's just not possible,'' Weizman said. Weizman
also lashed out at Netanyahu for suggesting, and then apparently
backing away from holding a national referendum to gauge public
opinion on a troop withdrawal. He said he was disappointed in
Netanyahu, who had not kept his word.
	   The referendum proposal, followed by a suggestion of an
international conference to address regional Mideast issues, drew
scorn from Israeli opposition politicians and Arab leaders.
	   Hemi Shalev, a political commentator for the Maariv daily said
Weizman's statements would harm Netanyahu whom he described as
appearing ``more and more compulsively incompetent.''
	   ``Weizman is popular in most sectors, more popular than Bibi,''
Shalev said referring to the premier by his nickname. ``This could
seriously influence the public, and then directly influence the
political parties to vote a certain way,'' against the premier he
said.
	   Netanyahu, while refusing to go into specifics, said Monday that
Israel has made compromises in the past eight weeks, and that only
a ``small gap'' remains on the scope of the withdrawal.
	   ``The true picture is not being presented here, the peace
process is not advancing ... it's stuck.'' Weizman told Israel's
Channel 2 news. Weizman has also complained that Netanyahu misled
him by suggesting several weeks ago that a withdrawal was imminent.
	   But ministers accused Weizman, known for his straight and brusk
comments, of going too far with his call for an early election.
	   ``Weizman has caused damage that is practically irreversible,''
said Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi. ``If the president wants to
get involved in politics, he's welcome to resign and run in
elections,'' Hanegbi said.
	   But Weizman defended himself, saying it was Netanyahu who pushed
the presidency into politics when he sent Weizman on trips over the
past two years to Egypt, Jordan, and the United States to help
patch relations tattered after Netanyahu was elected in May 1996.
	   Political scientist and author Shmuel Sandler said no president
in Israel's 50 year history had ever come out against a prime
minister as Weizman did Monday. ``But then, we've never had a
president like Ezer Weizman,'' he said.

Twenty Islamic militants dead in Algerian army sweep four sted one

Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9-10 with new clashes, CORRECTS death toll to
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Twenty Islamic militants have been
killed in an army sweep in eastern Algeria, and about 100 others
have been surrounded at a forest hideout, newspaper reports said
Monday.
	   The Arabic daily El Khabar reported that 20 militants were
killed by troops on Saturday in the town of Sidi Ali Bounab, about
60 kilometers (37.5 miles) east of Algiers. Hospital officials, who
requested anonymity, also confirmed the deaths.
	   In western Algeria, about 100 militants were under heavy
artillery attack in the Stamboul forests, about 400 kilometers west
of Algiers, the reports also said.
	   Militants based there are suspected of launching several recent
attacks in the area, including the slaughter of 17 people who had
their throats slit in a nearby village last Thursday.
	   The newspaper Quotidien d'Oran said Monday that several bunkers
had been destroyed in the siege which has lasted for two days, and
that security forces had seized medicine and food supplies.
	   There were no immediate reports of any deaths.
	   In other violence, four people died late Saturday when a
homemade bomb exploded under a freight car near Tebessa, close to
the border with Tunisia, hospital sources said.
	   The freight car was carrying a group of farmers. There was no
claim of responsibilty.
	   Algeria was rocked by riots after the slaying Thursday of singer
Lounes Matoub. Four people have been killed in four days of clashes
with police since the killing.
	   New clashes were reported Monday, involving youths participating
in a protest march by several thousand people in Kabylie, eastern
Algiera, witnesses said.
	   In all, an estimated 75,000 people have died in Algeria during a
six-year Muslim militant insurgency.
	   The violence began after the government scrapped second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

John McEnroe entertains on Centre Court during rain delay AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ John McEnroe, keep your day job.
	   After doing an interview to entertain the Centre Court during a
rain delay Monday, McEnroe broke into a brief, impromptu rendition
of the Star Spangled Banner.
	   ``O-o say can you see,'' he sang out, his voice tailing off like
a weak serve in a tough wind.
	   A three-time Wimbledon singles champion who also fancies himself
as a singer, McEnroe picked Pete Sampras to win his fifth title.
	   ``He's one of the greatest players in his sport,'' McEnroe said.
``He's had incredible results here the last five years _ only one
loss. That's almost Borg like. For Pete, Wimbledon is where he's
most comfortable.''
	   McEnroe said he didn't want his children growing up to be tennis
players.
	   ``If they're sick and crazy enough to decide they want to be
tennis players, that's their decision,'' McEnroe said.
	   Asked about his job with the American TV network NBC, McEnroe
said:
	   ``I look at it like the cake has already been baked and we as
commentators can add a little bit of icing to it, a little bit of
flavor to the match. Plus it beats the hell out of working for a
living.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ANOTHER FALKLANDS? &LR;  It's not war, but close to it.
	   England's World Cup match Tuesday in France against Argentina is
the most important here in a decade. The English are looking for
revenge for the 1986 World Cup when Argentina won 2-1 in the
quarterfinals, thanks in part to Diego Maradona's famous ``Hand of
God'' goal.
	   The half-dozen Argentine players at Wimbledon are eating in
Tuesday at a rented house in Wimbledon _ sheltered away from the
English hordes.
	   ``There is a big atmosphere,'' said Paola Suarez, who won her
first-round doubles match Monday teamed with Spain's Virginia Ruano
Pascual.
	   ``Virginia is from Spain but she even noticed it, how much the
local players _ really all the players here _ are talking about the
World Cup.''
	   ``I can't imagine I will be watching anything but football on
Tuesday,'' said Roberto Nappo of the BBC's Latin American service.
``The tennis might be my second priority.''
	   ___
	   TOO MANY CHIEFS: &LR;  The Guardian, under the headline ``A game in
search of a Savior,'' ran off a list of things wrong with the men's
game: too much power tennis, boring players and too many chiefs in
form of the WTA (women's tour), ATP (men's tour) and ITF (world
governing body).
	   ``Tennis has a big problem and is slowly going downhill,'' said
1996 French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov. ``We definitely need
to make some changes.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   QUOTE ACE: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic, who served a record 46 aces last
year at Wimbledon and lost, served 44 on Monday and won in four
sets over Daniel Vacek to reach the fourth round. The quotable
Croatian also double faulted 15 times.
	   ``My matches are like horror thrillers and you cannot expect
anything,'' said Ivanisevic, twice a Wimbledon runner-up. ``It's
like a movie. I make the movie, but I don't know the end. That's
it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DON'T PLAY AGAIN SAM: &LR;  Prior to her fourth-round match Monday,
Britain's Samantha ``Sam'' Smith was the toast of the country, the
first British woman to reach the fourth round since 1985.
	   She spent much of Sunday doing interviews, her photo was on the
front page of many newspapers Monday and a BBC TV crew followed her
as she walked to Wimbledon for her fourth-round match Monday
against Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Reality set in quickly as Tauziat, the No. 16 seed from France,
beat Smith 6-3, 6-1 in front of a partisan home crowd.
	   ``They were really willing me on the whole time, but she really
didn't give me a chance to get into the match,'' Smith said.
	   However, British hopes stayed alive as No. 12 Tim Henman won his
match against U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter to reach the
quarterfinals for the third straight year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Despite rain five of the first seven days,
chief referee Alan Mills says this year is better than last.
	   ``This year's Wimbledon is by no means as bad as last year,
which was my worst,'' Mills said. ``In any case, I'm too tired at
night to have nightmares. I drink coffee all day and sleep all
night.''
	   Robert Philip, writing in The Daily Telegraph, welcomed the
sulking, surly personality of world No. 2 Marcelo Rios, ousted in
the first round.
	   ``He is part Jimmy Connors, who was abandoned by wolves at birth
and raised by his parents, and part John McEnroe. Remember him?
When Mad Mac drove through a safari park, the animals rolled up
their windows.''

Turkish Cypriot center-right wins landslide victory in local vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Turkish Cypriot center-right
governing party won a landslide victory in local elections of the
self-declared republic in the northern third of this Mediterranean
island.
	   The National United Front won 18 mayoral posts out of 28,
including those in Nicosia, Kyrenia and Morphou, in a vote that was
seen as a test for general elections in November.
	   Runners up were the leftist Turkish Republican's Party, with
four mayoral posts including the city of Famagusta, and the
center-right Democratic Party with three seats. Other small parties
won the remaining mayoralties.
	   The percentages of votes gathered by each party were not
announced.
	   Cyprus has been divided between Turkish and Greek Cypriot
communities since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the island
after an aborted coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   United Nations-sponsored talks to reunify island remain
deadlocked.

Mexico's Bufete wins dlrs 520 million in Pemex offshore project 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican construction and engineering concern
Grupo Bufete Industrial SA has won a dlrs 520 million project for
the construction of three offshore platforms in the Gulf state of
Campeche.
	   In a press release late Sunday, Bufete said the state monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos, also known as Pemex, awarded the project to
Bufete in association with Corporacion Mexicana de Mantenimiento
Integral SA, or COMMISA.
	   Jaime Hernandez Balboa, Bufete's vice president for energy
business development, said this is the largest offshore project
awarded to Bufete by Pemex's exploration and production unit.
	   Hernandez Balboa said Pemex's oilfield development budget for
1998 is about dlrs 5 billion, or 70 percent of total planned
investment for the petroleum sector.
	   The project is expected to be completed in the year 2001, and is
the largest construction, procurement and engineering offshore
project for the expansion of the Cantarell complex, located in the
Campeche Bay area. The area is Pemex's largest production zone.
	   Pemex plans to set up seven new offshore platforms in the
Cantarell complex, Hernandez Balboa said.
	   Bufete's project includes the engineering, design,
manufacturing, testing and setup of three offshore platforms, one
for production and two for gas compression.
	   COMMISSA is a joint venture between Grupo ``R,'' a conglomerate
of local construction concerns, and Brown -and- Root Energy
Services, a unit of U.S.-based Halliburton Co.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Sabotage by telephone workers
protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company has caused
more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, the company's president said
Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, said Carmen Ana Culpeper.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. Labor leaders say the sale
will produce severe job losses.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.

Precede BEIJING Clinton turns to China's economic future _ and talk radio AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-China-Shanghai Renaissance
Eds: Clinton addresses community leaders at 0140GMT Tuesday
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton, turning his
attention to China's economic future, pursued his dialogue with the
Chinese people in a quintessential American form of communication:
a radio talk show.
	   The president's message was that the dynamic forces of change
propelling the booming economy in Shanghai, China's high-rise
financial capital, can spread prosperity throughout China.
	   ``This new century can be the dawn of a new China,'' Clinton
said in an address to university students in Beijing before flying
to Shanghai on Monday. He urged political reforms in this communist
country and then was challenged _ pointedly but politely _ by
students about America's own human rights record, arm sales to
Taiwan and U.S. perceptions of China.
	   Clinton denied the widespread suspicion here that the United
States is trying to contain China. ``I'm not hiding another design
behind a smile,'' he said.
	   State-run television sent out Clinton's speech live after trying
_ but failing _ to get an advance look at his address. The American
side did suggest beforehand that Clinton would not bring up again
the sensitive subject of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, as he
did in a televised news conference Saturday with President Jiang
Zemin.
	   Shanghai's dazzling lights and bustling downtown were a dramatic
change from the bureaucratic capital of Beijing. Clinton and his
family got a brief look at the city's harbor from their limousine
and rode past thousands of people gawking on the streets.
	   The third stop on a five-city tour, Shanghai boasts one of the
world's most technologically advanced stock exchanges, opened last
summer, and is the headquarters in China for scores of
multinational banks from around the world. It was the birthplace of
China's drive to convert massive state-owned industries to
competitive market-based firms.
	   Twenty percent of China's economic activity is generated in the
Shanghai region.
	   ``In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China,'' presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   Clinton on Tuesday meets with leaders from business, law, the
arts, media and the religious community _ agents of change who are
helping transform life in China and opening this country to the
world.
	   And later Clinton was sitting down at the microphones of
Shanghai People's Radio to field call-in questions on a program
called ``Citizens and Society.''
	   It was unlikely to be anything like the pounding Clinton gets
regularly on U.S. talk radio shows. Most of the calls on shows in
China are devoted to everyday problems _ coping with children,
rising joblessness, China's slowing economy and housing reforms.
Just the kind of subjects Clinton loves to talk about.
	   In Beijing, Clinton offered university students advice about how
China should move into the new millennium. He urged more openness,
religious tolerance, democracy and free expression, as well as a
battle against environmental pollution.

Serena setback squelches sister showdown AP Sports Writer

Eds: Updates 6th graf with Seles victory
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ There won't be a Wimbledon showdown
between the Williams sisters after all. Venus did her part by
getting to the fourth round Monday, but Serena quit with an injury.
	   Serena retired from her third-round match with unheralded
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, hobbling with a strained left calf and
trailing 7-5, 4-1.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted but I have to think about
the future,'' she said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   Serena, 16, had easily won her first two matches and was heavily
favored to beat the 75th-ranked Spaniard and set up a fourth-round
encounter against 18-year-old sister Venus, who beat Chanda Rubin
6-3, 6-4.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras advanced to the
fourth round in straight sets over Thomas Enqvist, while Britain's
Tim Henman ousted Patrick Rafter in four sets to become the first
man to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Women's No. 2 Lindsay Davenport crushed Magui Serna 6-1, 6-0 to
make the quarters, while No. 6 Monica Seles reached the final eight
by downing No. 14 Sandrine Testud, 6-3, 6-2. Also reaching the
women's quarters were Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva.

Puerto Rico strike damages surpass dlrs 1.5 million

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Sabotage by telephone workers
protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company has caused
more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, the company's president said
Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, said Carmen Ana Culpeper.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. Labor leaders say the sale
will produce severe job losses.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.

Genetics may help explain why Jews drink less, researcher says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli researcher said Monday genetics may
help explain why alcohol consumption among Jews is relatively low.
	   A study of 100 Jewish men in Jerusalem, selected at random,
showed that 35 percent had a mutation of the ADH gene that breaks
down alcohol in the body, compared to 5 percent to 10 percent among
Caucasians in the United States.
	   This mutation has been found to be associated with unpleasant
experiences, such as an accelerated heart rate and flushed face,
among some groups, including Japanese men.
	   In the Jerusalem study, those with the gene mutation drank less
and less frequently than the others in the study group, said Dr.
Yehuda Newmark, a member of the team at the Hebrew
University-Hadassah School of Public Health that conducted the
research.
	   Dr. David Goldman at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, in Rockville, Maryland
said Newmark's study compliments another one done by the University
of San Diego which found that Jews are more alcohol sensitive than
others.
	   The study highlights ``the genetic distinctiveness of Jews in
relation to how they metabolize and respond to alcohol,'' Goldman
said.
	   Environmental factors which keep alcohol consumption in Israel
relatively low, compared to other countries, have been analyzed for
years, said Newmark. ``This offers fairly strong preliminary proof
that there are genetic influences involved,'' he said.
	   Newmark said that in a parallel study, researchers at Indiana
University in Indianapolis looked at Jewish and non-Jewish
students.
	   The study found that 35 percent of the Jewish students had an
ADH mutation, and that those with the mutation drank less than
those without it.

Two killed in renewed clashes between tribesmen, troops 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Government troops and tribesmen protesting
price hikes clashed Monday, hours after the two sides agreed on a
four-day ceasefire, security officials and tribesmen said.
	   Tribesmen said two soldiers were killed and five others were
wounded in the riots in Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of the capital San`a, and in al-Jawf, which is just outside it.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the casualty figures.
	   Tribesmen and police have been battling sporadically since June
19 when the government raised prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas by 40 percent to meet demands by the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Some 52 people have been killed and 214 wounded in the clashes,
according to the Yemen Times daily.
	   Two legislators and leaders of the al-Jidaan, Ebeida and Dhaham
tribes signed an agreement early Monday to end the fighting in
order ``to give dialogue a chance,'' said the officials who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear what sparked Monday's clashes.
	   Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani has said his government
will not reverse its decision on price rises and blamed the
protests, which have been banned, on saboteurs and opposition
parties.
	   The price hikes are among IMF requirements to remove subsidies
on petroleum products and other commodities by the end of 1998 in
Yemen. In its drive for financial reforms, the government has
already cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.

Opposition party claims three mayoralties in Baja California 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with vote totals from today; Minor editing

By MICHELLE KOIDIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's conservative opposition party
held onto two key cities and grabbed at least one more in Baja
California, one of the first states to break the long-governing
party's hold on statewide office, according to vote tallies by
Monday.
	   The PAN, as the conservative party is known, was expected to
hang onto the mayoralties in Tijuana _ the largest Mexican city
along the U.S. border _ and Mexicali, the state capital. With 90
percent of the votes counted in Mexicali, the PAN candidate had
80,823 votes, or 44 percent, over the governing PRI party's
candidate, who had 74,108 votes, or 40 percent.
	   Official results were not expected until Wednesday, but with 90
percent of the votes tallied, the National Action Party's
candidate, Francisco Vega de la Madrid, had 104,059 votes, or 45
percent, compared with 89,042 votes, or 39 percent, for Amador
Rodriguez Lozano of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party. Three other candidates each drew less than 10 percent of the
vote.
	   The PAN has held both the Tijuana mayoral post and the Baja
California governship since 1989, when the peninsula became one of
the first Mexican states to vote an opposition-party governor into
power.
	   Mayors in Mexico serve three-year terms, and they cannot succeed
themselves.
	   It will be the first elective post for Vega, 43, a businessman
and former state finance director.
	   Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, the mother of a 5-year-old girl,
said she voted for the PAN because she has seen improvements in
streets and schools.
	   ``We see that (the PAN) has done many things for Tijuana,'' said
Gonzalez, who works in one of the many assembly-for-export plants,
or maquiladoras, near the U.S. border.
	   It was a close race in the port city of Ensenada, which had ten
years of PAN mayors until the PRI wrestled it back in 1995. The PAN
was leading there early Monday with 26,829 votes, or 39 percent, to
the PRI's 25,254 votes, or 37 percent.
	   The PAN incumbent apparently won Rosarito Beach, running 44
percent to 39 percent for the PRI _ with 69 percent counted.
	   With 93 percent of the votes counted in the border city of
Tecate, the PRI claimed 45 percent; the left-center Democratic
Revolution Party had 24 percent; PAN, 22 percent.
	   Besides the mayoral posts, voters cast ballots for all 25 seats
in the state congress.
	   Turnout among the state's 1.23 million registered voters was
light, as residents apparently stayed home to watch World Cup. The
estimated 45 percent in Tijuana was unusually low.
	   Election officials reported few problems.

English fan jailed for World Cup violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BETHUNE, France (AP) _ An English soccer fan was jailed for four
months on Monday for throwing beer cans at police after England's
World Cup match against Tunisia.
	   Anthony Winston, a 19-year-old from London, was picked up by
British police in Lens, northern France, which was the venue for
England's match last Friday against Colombia.
	   Winston admitted to a court in Bethene, northern France, that he
threw the cans. But he said he was aiming at Tunisian fans who he
said had provoked the English contingent, police said.
	   Several hundred Englishmen fought running street battles on June
15 in Marseille, southeastern France, with French-Tunisian youths
and police, leaving scores injured.
	   Security has been beefed up considerably at England matches.
Authorities fear England's match against Argentina on Tuesday in
Saint-Etienne could also be a flashpoint for hooligans from both
countries.

Bird, five others elected to basketball hall AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Bird, Hannum and Conradt
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Larry Bird, whose talent and tenacity led the
Boston Celtics to three championships and the NBA into a new era of
prominence, was elected to the Hall of Fame Monday with five
others.
	   Also chosen were another basketball wizard, Marques Haynes of
the Harlem Globetrotters, former coach Alex Hannum, early NBA big
man Arnie Risen, current Texas women's coach Jody Conradt, and
ex-Yugoslavian coach Aleksandar Nikolic.
	   On June 22, Lenny Wilkens joined John Wooden as the only
two-time inductees. Already in as a player, Wilkens was honored as
a coach.
	   Bird's candidacy in his first year of eligibility _ having been
retired five years _ probably didn't require much discussion from
the 24-member selection committee.
	   Bird thanked his high school, college and NBA teammates and
coaches.
	   ``I hope they all share in this because, like other awards I
have received, this is as much a team accomplishment as an
individual accomplishment,'' he said in a statement. ``I'm very
honored to be part of the Hall of Fame,'' which is located in
Springfield, Massachusetts.
	   Bird was rookie of the year in 1980, MVP in 1984, 1985 and 1986
and Finals MVP in 1984 and 1986. With him, the Celtics won titles
in 1981, 1984 and 1986 and the league soared to unprecedented
popularity. He was designated one of the NBA's 50 best players ever
and often is mentioned among the top five. And he was chosen coach
of the year with the Indiana Pacers last season, his first as an
NBA coach.
	   He went to Indiana State after playing high school ball in tiny
West Baden, Indiana.
	   Bird joined Boston in 1979-80 and transformed a franchise that
had missed the previous two playoffs. The Celtics went from 29 to
61 wins in his rookie season and won the championship the next year
with coach Bill Fitch. The other two titles came under K.C. Jones.
	   Back problems forced him to retire after the 1991-92 season, his
13th.
	   He and Magic Johnson could have been inducted together at
ceremonies set for Oct. 2 had Johnson not ended his retirement on
Jan. 29, 1996, when he returned to the Los Angeles Lakers for 32
regular-season and four playoff games. Johnson had sat out 4 1/2
seasons, just short of the five-year eligibility requirement. Now
he must wait until 2002.
	   Haynes, nominated for the first time, graduated from Langston
University in 1947 after leading it to a 112-3 record over four
seasons. In more than 12,000 games over more than 40 years with the
Harlem Globetrotters and Harlem Magicians, his ballhandling and
showmanship dazzled audiences in 97 countries.
	   Hannum spent 16 seasons as a coach with seven NBA and ABA teams,
winning three championships.
	   Hannum, retired and living in San Diego, reacted to his election
with ``utter and complete shock.''
	   ``I think it's a tremendous honor and it's something you can
only dream about,'' he said.
	   He led the Philadelphia 76ers to a 68-13 record in 1966-67, when
they won the NBA title, a team Hannum still considers the best of
all time. They were 62-20 in 1967-68. The next season, he took the
Oakland Oaks to the ABA title, becoming the first coach to win
championships in both leagues.
	   Conradt, the winningest women's coach of all time, has spent the
last 22 seasons as coach of Texas. Her 709 wins make her one of 14
college coaches of men's or women's teams with at least 700, and
she took Texas to 14 of the last 16 NCAA tournaments.
	   Nikolic began coaching the Yugoslavian national team in 1953 and
led it to two silver medals and a bronze in European Championships
in the 1960s. He later became an outstanding coach in Italy.
	   Nominee Ubiratan Pereira Maciel of Brazil was not selected in
the international category.

ADH mutation, and that those with the mutation drank less than
those without it.

Sorenstam in high gear in drive for Open AP Golf Writer

By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam went into last year's U.S. Open
trying to make history and came away with a crushing
disappointment. This week, she returns playing perhaps the best
golf of her life and more determined than ever.
	   That could mean bad news for the rest of the field at the
Blackwolf Run Resort in Kohler, Wis., when the Open starts
Thursday.
	   ``Last year all the talk was `Three-peat, Three-peat,'''
Sorenstam said about her bid to become the first woman to win the
U.S. Open three consecutive times only to miss the cut.
	   ``I wanted so badly to do something for women's golf,'' she said
Sunday after she closed with four consecutive birdies to win the
ShopRite LPGA Classic by four strokes over Juli Inkster at the
Seaview Marriott Resort.
	   ``I put too much pressure on myself,'' she said.
	   Sorenstam went into the 1997 U.S. Open at Pumpkin Ridge having
won the championship the previous two years and having finished in
the top three in nine of her first 13 events last year.
	   If not victory, then surely Sorenstam would contend for the
title until deep into the back nine Sunday. But a 77 in the first
round ended her hopes and a 73 the next day meant the two-time
defending champion failed to qualify for the weekend by three
strokes.
	   ``When I got there it was so overwhelming,'' Sorenstam said.
``That's why no one has done it before.''
	   But Sorenstam has added two important dimensions to her game
this year, and that's why she should be considered the favorite to
win her third U.S. Open in four years.
	   Her short game is vastly improved, especially her putting. And
she is much more comfortable with the limelight.
	   The shy 27-year-old Swede returned to the Open with her feet
very much on the ground.
	   ``This year I have a totally different attitude,'' she said. ``I
want to play it one shot at a time. And hopefully I will get a
chance to three-peat again.''
	   Sorenstam has simply been the most successful golfer in the
world _ male or female _ the last three years. Since getting her
breakthrough victory in the 1995 U.S. Open she has won 14 of 60
LPGA events.
	   That's a victory in 23 percent of her tournaments compared to
the seven victories in 36 tournaments _ 19 percent _ for Tiger
Woods since his first victory.
	   Sorenstam comes into the Open this week off victories in her
last two starts and 10 top-10 finishes in 11 tournaments, including
seven times in the top four.
	   She leads the LPGA with a 69.74 scoring average and has hit a
remarkable 76 percent of her greens in regulation, a full
percentage point better than runner-up Karrie Webb.
	   When push came to shove Sunday at the ShopRite, Sorenstam pulled
away from everyone. Protecting a one-stroke lead, Sorenstam
responded like a champion when Inkster gave her breathing room with
a three-putt bogey on No. 14.
	   Seeing her opportunity, Sorenstam made birdies on the final four
holes.
	   ``Right now I am very high,'' she said after her rounds of 66,
65 and 65 broke the tournament record by five strokes and the
54-hole record on the Bay Course by 11 strokes. ``I feel like I can
play any golf course any time.''
	   And it could be that the next place Sorenstam will prove that
will be at Blackwolf Run this week in the U.S. Open.

Blachhawks hire Graham as coach AP Sports Writer

By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Dirk Graham was hired Monday as coach of the
Chicago Blackhawks, inheriting a team that missed the playoffs last
season for the first time in three decades.
	   Graham, a scout with the Blackhawks last season, replaces Craig
Hartsburg, who was fired two months ago. Graham was an assistant
under Hartsburg in 1995-96 after eight seasons as a player in
Chicago, more than six as team captain.
	   ``Do we have enough talent to win the Stanley Cup next year? I
don't know,'' Graham said at a news conference Monday. ``Do we have
enough talent to make the playoffs? Definitely.''
	   Graham, 38, said the coaching staff can't do everything to get
the team back to the playoffs.
	   ``I believe in this team. I certainly wouldn't be standing here
taking this job if I didn't think we had the hockey players to
succeed.''
	   General manager Bob Murray said he had met with Graham the night
Hartsburg was fired two months ago but they both decided then to
explore other possibilities.
	   ``I just kept coming back to him. I played with the guy. I knew
what kind of leadership he had. I know what instantaneous respect
he commands when he walks in the locker room,'' Murray said.
	   Chicago also announced that Denis Savard, a former Blackhawks
star, and Lorne Molleken, a minor league coach in the Edmonton
Oilers' organization, will be assistants under Graham.
	   Graham, a forward who won the 1991 Frank Selke for his defensive
skills, holds the team record for most shorthanded goals in a
season, 10 in 1988-89.
	   In 546 games for Chicago from 1988 to 1995, he had 152 goals,
190 assists and 685 penalty minutes.
	   He was a member of the 1992 team that won 11 consecutive playoff
games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.

NOW pushing campaign to deny re-licensing of Mike Tyson 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The U.S. National Organization for Women is
pressuring the Nevada Athletic Commission to reject any effort by
Mike Tyson to regain his boxing license.
	   NOW's Southern Nevada chapter on Monday announced a nationwide
campaign to block Tyson from getting his license back.
	   Tyson was banned from boxing by the commission last July 11. He
will be eligible to apply to the commission at the end of one year,
although he has not indicated if or when he might do so.
	   In a letter to NOW chapters in all 50 states, Southern Nevada
NOW President Anne Golonka noted Tyson has been convicted of rape.
He was banned for biting the ears of Evander Holyfield in a bout at
the MGM Grand a year ago.
	   In her letter, Golonka urged other NOW members to contact the
commission and express outrage at the prospect of Tyson's return to
the ring.

UN holds special session on children in armed conflict 
</HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that children are being used as
soldiers in war zones around the world, the Security Council on
Monday condemned the arming of children and on Monday demanded an
immediate end to the practice.
	   The council pledged in a draft presidential statement to pay
particular attention to the plight of child soldiers whenever the
United Nations is involved.
	   The council's special meeting, and a two-day symposium in London
last week, were set to launch a campaign by U.N. agencies and other
groups to encourage the implementation of international conventions
to protect children and civilians and prevent children under 18
from being armed.
	   ``I have a deep fear, a nightmare scenario, that we maybe
exposed to so much that we are in danger of accepting as normal
what in fact represents a radical departure from any acceptable
norms,'' said the U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, Olara
Otunnu.
	   In wars over the last decade, 2 million children have been
killed, 1 million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured and 10
million left with ``serious psychological trauma,'' said Otunnu, a
former Ugandan ambassador to the United Nations and now a citizen
of the Ivory Coast.
	   Estimating that a quarter of a million children, most of them in
Africa, are currently under arms, Otunnu urged the council to send
a clear message that the use and abuse of children in war is
``simply unacceptable.''
	   He called for more efforts to disarm child soldiers, treat their
physical and psychological wounds, return displaced kids and clear
their homelands of land mines, which kill or maim an estimated 800
children each month.
	   In a draft presidential statement, the 15-member council
condemned the targeting of children ``including their humiliation,
brutalization, sexual abuse, abduction and forced displacement and
use in hostilities in violation of international law.''
	   It urged all nations to comply with the Geneva Convention on the
protocols of armed conflict and the U.N. Convention on the Rights
of the Child. It ``stresses the obligation of all states to
prosecute those responsible for grave breaches of international
humanitarian law.''
	   Costa Rica's U.N. ambassador, Fernando Berrocal Soto, called the
negotiations under way for the creation of an international
tribunal for war crimes as a step in the right direction for
prosecuting such breaches.
	   He also suggested the creation of a universal monitoring system
``to detect possible situations of armed conflict which might
affect children.''
	   The issue of child victims deserves a prominent place on the
agendas of the entire international community, said Britain's U.N.
ambassador, John Weston.
	   ``The causalities of modern armed conflicts are overwhelmingly
civilians rather than soldiers,'' Weston said on behalf of the
European Union. ``Among the civilians, women and children are
particularly vulnerable and consequently they are now the principal
victims of war.''

Precede PRISTINA Serbs battle to retake coal mine held by Kosovo rebels Belacevac; four Serbs kidnapped; United Nations meeting postponed; trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. RECASTS. UPDATES with intensified fighting, details from
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of villagers fled into
the woods as Serbian security forces battled Monday to regain
control of a mining village captured by ethnic Albanian militants
fighting for independence for the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   More than 8,000 people fled their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade, as government forces steadily shelled
the area from three sides. Villagers said they expected the Serbs
to take the town during the night.
	   Police and heavily armed government forces launched an attack
early Monday and by evening had advanced within 200 meters (yards)
of Belacevac village limits, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of
the capital Pristina.
	   The Serbs are trying to retake a coal mine in Belacevac that
fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last week.
Late Monday, the mine remained under KLA control.
	   Serb police set up in the hills around Belacevac village sniped
at men running water and biscuits to KLA fighters camped in the
woods surrounding the villages.
	   According to the Serbs' Media Center, armed Albanians seized
control of the mine's administrative buildings and fired at police,
the Serbs' Media Center reported. Police were fighting back with
tear gas, the center said.
	   Albanian sources claimed the area was completely sealed off and
that government forces also attacked civilians in surrounding
villages, killing an eight-year-old child and trapping an unknown
number of villagers in their homes. Others fled along an maze of
trails to the forests surrounding the village, where they were
preparing to camp for the night.
	   The strategic Belacevac open-pit mine supplies coal to the
nearby Obilic power plant, which in turns provides electricity for
most of the province.
	   Earlier Monday, Albanian sources said that armed Serb civilians
were backing up regular Serbian forces targeting the coal mine and
other rebel positions in nearby villages. Tanks had been drawn up
at Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac, they said.
	   Another 8-year-old child was reported wounded Monday by gunfire
in Lismir, a village near Obilic.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of the
southern province in Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left
of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly supported by the ethnic
Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo and connects the main Kosovo cities of
Pristina and Pec.
	   The Serbs' Media Center said Albanian militants armed with
kalashnikovs reportedly abducted four more Serbs from a coach bus
traveling on a road southwest of Pristina. So far more than 40
Serbs have been kidnapped by the KLA.
	   At Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main hot-spot _ tensions remained
bubbling, with fighters from the Kosovo Liberation army deeply
entrenched and bracing for a new attack after black-painted
Yugoslav helicopters strafed them on the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and other support by the ring of
armed Albanian fighters around them. A child and an adult _ both
apparently ethnic Albanians _ were reported killed in the region
Sunday.
	   The third Serb offensive and boiling tensions came as
international diplomats urged the two sides to seek a diplomatic
solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leaders in
attempts to find a peaceful way to end the conflict and another
U.S. diplomat met with people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The European Union followed suit Monday, agreeing that the
Kosovo militants must be included in negotiations for peace in the
region.
	   Meeting in Luxembourg, the E.U. foreign ministers issued a
statement urging ``all those in a leadership role in the Kosovar
Albanian community'' to commit to dialogue to resolve Kosovo's
problems.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Vienna Monday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the
Security Council must approve any military action.
	   The council was to take up the Kosovo issue later in the week in
New York. The United States maintains that Security Council
approval is not needed for NATO action aimed at halting the Kosovo
conflict, but council member Russia disagrees.

Precede JERUSALEM Netanyahu rejects call by Israeli president for early elections Byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with new quotes, details; CHANGES
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scathing attack on the Israeli
prime minister's performance, President Ezer Weizman said Monday
that Benjamin Netanyahu has failed the Mideast peace process.
	   Weizman called for new elections and said the Israeli public has
not been given the ``true picture,'' of a peace process which is
going nowhere.
	   Several government officials reacted to the remarks by calling
for Weizman's resignation. Netanyahu ruled out early elections.
	   Israel's presidency is a largely ceremonial position, but
Weizman has used it as a platform for increasingly harsh criticism
of Netanyahu's handling of the peace talks, which have been stalled
for 15 months over a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   ``We're isolated, the economy is not what we hoped for, not what
it was a few years ago, we have fallen out of favor in the
international community, relations with the PLO hardly exists. It's
time to go to the people,'' a visibly angry Weizman said.
	   The president delivered his tough remarks in back-to-back
interviews with Israel's top two TV news programs. Political
analysts said the move could prompt centrist parties to bolt
Netanyahu's coalition and lead to Netanyahu's downfall.
	   Netanyahu, who was elected in 1996, dismissed the idea of early
elections and insisted the Palestinians _ not Israel _ were to
blame for the failure to reach agreement on a troop withdrawal.
	   ``I am working night and day on one thing, to reach an
agreement, and no pressure, no thing, and no man will keep me from
this aim,'' he said. ``Peace is very, very close _ if the
Palestinians do their part.''
	   But the 73-year-old president seemed to suggest that Netanyahu,
48, was the problem.
	   ``It's not possible that everyone is wrong and we are only right
and justified here, it's just not possible,'' Weizman said. He also
lashed out at Netanyahu for suggesting, and then apparently backing
away from, a referendum on a troop withdrawal.
	   Hemi Shalev, a political commentator for the Maariv daily, said
Netanyahu appears ``more and more compulsively incompetent.''
	   ``Weizman is popular in most sectors, more popular than Bibi,''
Shalev said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.
	   Netanyahu, while refusing to go into specifics, said Israel has
made compromises in the past eight weeks, and that only a ``small
gap'' remains on the scope of the troop withdrawal.
	   But Weizman told Israel's Channel 2 news: ``The true picture is
not being presented here, the peace process is not advancing ...
it's stuck.''
	   Some government ministers said Weizman _ who was re-elected to a
second five-year term in 1998 _ went too far by calling for an
early election.
	   ``Weizman has caused damage that is practically irreversible,''
said Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi. ``If the president wants to
get involved in politics, he's welcome to resign and run in
elections.''
	   Weizman countered that it was Netanyahu who pushed the
presidency into politics _ sending him to Egypt, Jordan, and the
United States over the past two years to help patch up relations.
	   Political scientist Shmuel Sandler said no Israeli president had
ever come out against a prime minister as Weizman did Monday. ``But
then, we've never had a president like Ezer Weizman,'' Sandler
said.

Vatican envoy says Catholic church taken root in Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Roman Catholic church has taken root in
Russia, the Vatican's foreign minister said Monday at the end of a
three-day visit to Moscow.
	   Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran noted there are 93 Catholic parishes
in the European part of Russia supervised by 114 clerics, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Tauran was quoted as saying that a new law on religion does not
interfere with the church's activities in Russia.
	   The law enshrines the Russian Orthodox Church as the country's
preeminent religion and limits the practice of most others,
including many Protestant and Catholic faiths.
	   Russia objects to efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and
others to seek converts in Russia. The two churches have been
divided since a schism in 1054 separated Christians into the
Catholic and Orthodox churches.
	   The new law imposes arduous registration requirements. But
Tauran said the Catholic church has been able to register in the
European part of Russia and is about to begin the process in the
Asian part of the country.
	   Tauran said he also discussed raising the status of the
Vatican's mission in Russia during his meeting with Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Diplomatic relations between Russia and the Vatican were
re-established in 1990 and have been maintained since then at the
level of official missions. The Vatican wants to raise its
mission's status to the level of an embassy.

NBA locks out players AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With negotiations on a new labor agreement at a
standstill, the NBA announced Monday that players will be locked
out Tuesday night when the clock strikes midnight.
	   The move, announced from the league office, came as no surprise.
Players had been told all season to expect a work stoppage, and
talks between the league and the union broke off more than a week
ago.
	   The lockout will in effect shut down the league. Teams will be
barred from talking to their players. Trades and free agent
signings will be prohibited and summer leagues will be canceled.
	   ``The expired collective bargaining agreement between the NBA
and its players did not work,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said in a statement after meeting by conference call with the
league's Board of Governors.
	   ``We have made a series of proposals to the players under which
salaries would continue to increase _ but at a slower rate than
under the expired deal,'' Granik said. ``Regrettably, the players
have rejected all of these proposals. The NBA will not operate
until we reach a new agreement that is fair to both parties.''
	   This will be third lockout in the history of the NBA, the only
major American professional sports league never to have lost a game
to a work stoppage.
	   A lockout in the summer of 1995 lasted three months, and a
lockout in 1996 lasted only a couple of hours.
	   By all indications, this one could drag on into the fall or
winter.
	   The sides, despite meeting almost weekly since late April, made
only minimal progress on a new labor agreement to replace the one
expiring at midnight June 30.
	   The old agreement was to run for six years, but the owners had
the right to reopen it if the amount of designated revenue being
paid toward player salaries exceeded a certain level _ 51.8 percent
of basketball-related income.
	   The owners say they are now devoting 57 percent of those
revenues to player salaries, a total of about dlrs 950 million.
They have promised to resist signing a new agreement that does not
include a ceiling on salaries _ a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   Players, meanwhile, have resisted giving up the gains they
achieved in past negotiations. They want to keep the current
``soft'' salary cap, especially the rule known as the Larry Bird
exception, which lets teams exceed the salary cap to retain their
own free agents.
	   Such an exception allows the Chicago Bulls to pay Michael Jordan
more than dlrs 33 million last season despite the salary cap being
set at dlrs 26.9 million.

Eds: UPDATES to add Annan meeting Anyaoku, details of schedule.
CORRECTS second reference of U.N. diplomat in 7th graf. Edits to
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Leaders of the United Nations and
Commonwealth stepped up efforts to bridge the international
diplomatic gulf with Nigeria with visits Monday to the sprawling
West African country.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who hails from Ghana, met
with Nigerian-born Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku
shortly after the U.N. leader flew into the capital of Abuja Monday
afternoon on a flight from Vienna.
	   Anyaoku arrived in his home country for talks with the country's
new military leader on Sunday.
	   The two leaders are the highest-profile international diplomats
to visit Nigeria since the late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha
provoked widespread outrage by executing leading playwright and
activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995.
	   Both the U.N. and Commonwealth leaders were expected to meet
military leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar on Tuesday morning,
government spokesman David Attah said.
	   During his two-day visit, Annan planned to meet a wide range of
pro-democracy leaders, government officials and opposition
activists, said Ahmad Fawzi, a member of Annan's delegation.
	   On Wednesday he was to attend a ``mini heads-of-state summit''
organized by the Nigerian government, said Fawzi. It was unclear
which foreign leaders had been invited or what was on the agenda.
	   Annan, who was also to be the guest of honor at a state banquet
thrown by Abubakar on Tuesday, said he was encouraged by ``rapid
steps'' taken by the Nigerian general to ``affirm a transition to
democratic and civilian rule,'' Fawzi said.
	   ``He hopes that all Nigerians will work together in a spirit of
cooperation to ensure democracy. It will require compromise
flexibility and wisdom, and he trusts these qualities will not be
lacking,'' the U.N. official said.
	   Anyaoku was also upbeat about the prospects for returning
Nigeria to the international fold after years of being a pariah
under the rule of the late Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha, who took power following a coup in 1993, died of heart
failure on June 8 and was succeeded by Abubakar.
	   ``My being here is the beginning of the process of
re-integrating Nigeria into the international community,'' Anyaoku
told reporters shortly after arriving. ``The whole Commonwealth and
the international community has welcomed the steps so far taken by
the new leader and our hope is that this is just the beginning.''
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation club of Britain and its former
colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks in November 1995.
	   British Foreign Office junior minister Tony Lloyd visited the
former British colony last Friday on behalf of the European Union
and praised Abubakar's action in releasing political prisoners and
moving towards restoring democracy.
	   Annan said he has been ``much encouraged'' by his recent
intensive discussions with Abubakar, as well as the general's early
actions in power, and decided the time is right for such a trip.
	   He met Monday evening in an informal dinner with Nigerian
foreign minister Tom Ikimi.
	   The country's new military leader has raised expectations for
democratic reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners.
However the country's most prominent detainee, presumed 1993
elections winner Moshood Abiola, remains behind bars.

Eds: UPDATES with no violence reported in Montpellier after Germany
<TEXT>
	   BETHUNE, France (AP) _ An English soccer fan was jailed for four
months on Monday for throwing beer cans at police after England's
World Cup match against Tunisia.
	   Anthony Winston, a 19-year-old from London, was picked up by
British police in Lens, northern France, which was the venue for
England's match lasy Friday against Colombia.
	   Winston admitted to a court in Bethune, northern France, that he
threw the cans. But he said he was aiming at Tunisian fans who he
said had provoked the English contingent, police said.
	   Several hundred Englishmen fought running street battles on June
15 in Marseille, southeastern France, with French-Tunisian youths
and police, leaving scores injured.
	   Security has been beefed up considerably at England matches.
Authorities fear England's match against Argentina on Tuesday in
Saint-Etienne could also be a flashpoint for hooligans from both
countries.
	   There are also security worries over matches involving Germany,
as a result of rioting after Germany's match in Lens against
Yugoslavia, which left a policeman in a coma.
	   But officials said no problems were reported Thursday after
Germany's match against Mexico.
	   Many German fans chatted with police, who numbered almost 2,000,
before and after the match. Some German fans wore T-shirts with
slogans in different languages apologizing for the recent violence.
	   As a precaution, Montpellier's bars were ordered to close Monday
and supermarkets were not allowed to sell alcohol. At one downtown
supermarket, shelves stocking alcohol were covered in plastic
sheets.

Nepalese lawmaker gunned down in Katmandu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Unidentified assailants gunned down a
Nepalese lawmaker and his driver near his home late Monday in
Katmandu.
	   Mirza Dilshad Beg, a member of the National Democratic Party,
had just gotten out of his car and was walking toward his residence
and when gunmen opened fire, said police official Madhav Thapa.
	   At least two gunmen shot Beg at least six times in the back,
Madhav said. His body was found about 40 feet (13 meters) from the
car. The car's engine was still running and its headlights on.
Police said the motive was unclear.
	   Beg served in Nepal's House of Representatives since 1994 and
twice held Cabinet posts.
	   Nepal has been politically unstable, with five prime ministers
since the 1994 vote left no party with the majority needed to
govern alone. But the uncertainty has rarely erupted into violence
in a country where criminal violence is also uncommon.
	   Surya Bahadur Thapa of the National Democratic Party was toppled
from the prime minister's post in April and replaced by a minority
government led by the Nepali Congress Party.

World Cup: Bergkamp breaks through Yugoslav defense for 1-0 Dutch lead. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp broke through a
defensively-determined Yugoslavia with a 38th-minute strike Monday
night, giving Netherlands a 1-0 lead in their battle for a place in
the final eight at the World Cup.
	   The goal was Bergkamp's 35th for the Oranje, tying him with Faas
Wilkes of the 1940s and '50s for the all-time Dutch lead.
	   Bergkamp ran onto a long ball out of the back from Dutch captain
and defender Frank de Boer, settling it as Yugoslav defender Zoran
Mirkovic fell, and blasted a shot from 15 meters that keeper Ivica
Kralj managed to get his hands to, but couldn't stop from squirting
through and dribbling inside the left post.
	   The goal was a reward for a consistent offensive effort, one
that Yugoslavia loaded up its defense in order to prevent.
	   Looking to slow Marc Overmars, the Yugoslavs packed their right
side with Zoran Mirkovic and Zeljko Petrovic to double mark the
Dutch forward, and used only Predrag Mijatovic as a lone striker.
	   The Netherlands managed to create a few chances, but with
Yugoslavia rarely going forward, the Oranje found little room to
operate. The Yugoslavs, however, looked only dangerous once, that
on a free kick from Sinisa Mihajlovic in the 40th minute that
goalkeeper Edwin van der Saar covered easily.
	   The Dutch went forward quickly, with Bergkamp and Ronald de Boer
exchanging crosses in the fourth minute, the last of which flew
high of Phillip Cocu in the middle of the penalty area.
	   Bergkamp had a blast from just outside the penalty area in the
23rd minute that Kralj had to palm away and Clarence Seedorf
finished a three-man combination from 15 meters that Kralj again
had to knock wide.
	   Cocu put a header over the bar only 30 seconds before Bergkamp's
goal, which ended Dutch frustration at the defensive tactics of
Yugoslavia.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar; Michael Reiziger, Jaap Stam,
Frank de Boer, Arthur Numan; Ronald de Boer, Clarence Seedorf,
Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars; Phillip Cocu, Dennis Bergkamp.

Precede PRISTINA Serbs battle to retake coal mine held by Kosovo rebels Belacevac; four Serbs kidnapped; United Nations meeting postponed. Trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with intensified fighting, details from
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of villagers fled as
Serbian security forces battled Monday to regain control of a
mining village captured by ethnic Albanian militants fighting for
independence in the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   More than 8,000 people fled from Belacevac and the neighboring
village of Hade, as government forces steadily shelled the area
from three sides. Villagers said they expected the Serbs to take
the town during the night.
	   The strategic Belacevac open-pit mine supplies coal to the
nearby Obilic power plant, which in turns provides electricity for
most of the province.
	   Police and heavily armed government forces launched an attack
early Monday, and by evening, had advanced within 200 meters
(yards) of Belacevac village limits, some 10 kilometers (6 miles)
west of the capital Pristina.
	   Albanian sources claimed the area was completely sealed off and
that government forces also attacked civilians in surrounding
villages, killing an 8-year-old child and trapping an unknown
number of villagers. Others fled along a maze of trails to the
surrounding forests.
	   Earlier Monday, Albanian sources said armed Serb civilians were
backing up regular Serbian forces targeting the coal mine and other
rebel positions in nearby villages. Tanks were drawn up at Slatina
military airport, just east of Belacevac, they said.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army claims to control 30 percent to 40
percent of the southern province in Serbia, the dominant republic
in what is left of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly supported by
the ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo and connects the main Kosovo cities of
Pristina and Pec.
	   The Serbs' Media Center said Albanian militants armed with
kalashnikovs reportedly abducted four more Serbs from a coach bus
traveling on a road southwest of Pristina. So far, more than 40
Serbs have been kidnapped by the KLA.
	   At Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main hot-spot _ deeply entrenched KLA
fighters braced for a new attack after black-painted Yugoslav
helicopters strafed them over the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and other support by the ring of
armed Albanian fighters around them. A child and an adult _ both
apparently ethnic Albanians _ were reported killed in the region
Sunday.
	   The third Serb offensive came as international diplomats urged
the two sides to seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leaders in
attempts to find a peaceful solution and another U.S. diplomat met
with people claiming to represent the KLA.
	   The European Union followed suit Monday, agreeing that Kosovo
militants must be included in peace negotiations.
	   In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers issued a statement urging
``all those in a leadership role in the Kosovar Albanian
community'' to commit to dialogue to resolve Kosovo's problems.
	   Speaking at a news conference Monday in Vienna, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia,'' but reiterated that the Security
Council must approve any military action.
	   The council was to take up the Kosovo issue later in the week in
New York. The United States maintains that Security Council
approval is unnecessary for NATO action aimed at halting the Kosovo
conflict, but council member Russia disagrees.

Grains, soybeans plunge on beneficial weather

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices posted heavy
losses Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions recent
beneficial weather has put corn and soybean crops on track for a
bumper fall harvest.
	   Investors removed nearly all the weather premium that had been
built into the market last week on fears hot, dry weather would
persist in major Midwest growing regions through July.
	   Prices fell the daily limit in the corn, soybean and wheat
trading pits as market participants digested reports of widespread,
heavy weekend rainfall and nearly universal forecasts for mild
temperatures for the remainder of the week.
	   Corn futures led the losses on expectations that weather
conditions in the key growing states of Illinois, Iowa and Indiana
will be ideal going into the crucial July pollination period. Corn
crops need mild temperatures and ample soil moisture for the
kernels to begin filling out.
	   The U.S. Agriculture Department is predicting farmers will
harvest the second-largest corn crop on record, and some analysts
say the final tally could rise above 10 billion bushels because of
the good Midwestern weather.
	   With forecasts calling for mild weather to continue into
mid-July, investors said soybeans also should begin their flowering
period with good prospects. The USDA is predicting a record soybean
crop.
	   Wheat futures fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans and on
heavy weekend harvesting of the winter wheat crop that accounts for
much of the national total. With yields coming in above average in
most growing areas, there is concern there will be a larger than
expected harvest at a time when world demand has been extremely
weak.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 12 cents to dlrs 2.97 1-2 a
bushel; December corn fell the limit 12 cents to dlrs 2.52 1-2 a
bushel; December oats fell 8 3-4 cents to dlrs 1.35 1-2 a bushel;
November soybeans fell 30 cents to dlrs 6.10 1-4 a bushel.

World Bank opens conference in El Salvador 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The World Bank will examine the
solidity of Latin American financial systems and the need for
economic reforms during a two-day conference which opened Monday in
El Salvador.
	   Asia's financial crisis demonstrates the need for reforms, World
Bank Vice President Joseph Stigliz said at the meeting's start.
	   El Salvador's president, Armando Caderon Sol, said countries
must strengthen their mechanisms to keep financial systems free of
fraud and drug-related crimes such as money-laundering.
	   Faith in the region's financial systems depends on transparency
and internationally accepted accounting methods, said Shahid Burki,
the World Bank's vice president for Latin America and the
Caribbean.
	   The conference is being attended by 450 bankers, business
executives, central bank governors and economists. It is the fourth
annual conference on the subject, following meetings in Uruguay,
Colombia and Brazil.

Turkey's Islamic political leader goes on trial opening of trial of pro-Islamic businessman 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with top general's remarks on Islamic threat, ADDS
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan,
who headed a pro-Islamic government until forced out by the
military, went on trial Monday charged with insulting the country's
highest court which shut down his party about six months ago.
	   Erbakan, who is abroad, was represented by his five lawyers. The
trial was adjourned until Sept. 14. In another trial that opened
Monday, Erol Yarar, the head of the pro-Islamic industrialists'
association, MUSIAD, was tried on charges of inciting religious
hatred.
	   Also Monday, Turkey's outspoken Deputy Chief of General Staff
Gen. Cevik Bir declared that radical Islam was still the country's
No. 1 threat.
	   The secular military pressured Erbakan into stepping down from
office a year ago.
	   Erbakan's party was shut down for supporting a religious-based
regime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   Erbakan was indicted for a speech he made two days after the
court verdict in January that also banned him from active politics
for five years. He called the verdict ``legal murder.''
	   The indictment said his words went beyond criticism and were
insulting.
	   Erbakan could face up to 1 1/2 years in prison if convicted.
	   Bir was quoted as saying at a ceremony for the opening of a
military education center that ``Islamic fundamentalism has three
dimensions: support from Islamic capital, Islamic education and
infiltration within the (official administrative) staff.''
	   Charges against Yarar stem from a speech he made last year
criticizing the government's secular policies and calling on
members of MUSIAD to ``break the heads'' of the secular-minded.
	   The indictment said his words threatened public order. It also
demanded the closure of MUSIAD. Yarar could go to prison for three
years if convicted.
	   His next trial date was set for July 20.

Two killed in renewed clashes between tribesmen, troops 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Government troops and tribesmen protesting
price hikes clashed Monday, hours after the two sides agreed on a
four-day ceasefire, security officials and tribesmen said.
	   Tribesmen said two soldiers were killed and five others were
wounded in the riots in Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of the capital San`a, and in al-Jawf, which is just outside it.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the casualty figures.
It was unclear what sparked the clashes.
	   Tribesmen and police have been battling sporadically since June
19 when the government raised prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas by 40 percent to meet demands by the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Some 52 people have been killed and 214 wounded, according to
the Yemen Times daily.
	   Earlier Monday, two legislators and leaders of the al-Jidaan,
Ebeida and Dhaham tribes signed an agreement to end the fighting in
order ``to give dialogue a chance,'' said the officials who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani has said his government
will not reverse its decision on price rises and blamed the
protests, which have been banned, on saboteurs and opposition
parties.
	   The price hikes are among IMF requirements to remove subsidies
on petroleum products and other commodities by the end of 1998 in
Yemen. In its drive for financial reforms, the government has
already cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.

Sampras wins longest match, Serena Williams injured and out AP Tennis Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras shaved four times before
he ended the longest, soggiest match of his career at Wimbledon: a
three-set miniseries that dragged mercilessly from Friday's
scheduled start to Monday's final point.
	   The All England Club took on a frenetic atmosphere between early
and late showers as officials crammed up to six matches on each
court to catch up on lost time. Players slid, slipped, and lay
sprawled on the sidelines with injuries.
	   Serena Williams defaulted with a calf strain, U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter hurt his back and lost, and Australian Open champ
Petr Korda strained an Achilles tendon yet won.
	   ``It was a long, long weekend,'' said Sampras, who served aces
on his first six tosses when his match finally began Saturday after
Friday's washed-out start. Two downpours then intruded, and a third
at 5-5 in the second set pushed the conclusion to Monday after
Sunday's traditional day off to think about the whole mess. Another
2{-hour rain delay then hit at 4-4 in the third set.
	   ``It's an emotional roller coaster,'' Sampras said. ``Really,
you get up for playing, and you come off, and you have a 20-minute
delay. You come back, play a game. You have yesterday off, which
was kind of bizarre. So you get the highs and lows.''
	   Sampras, the defending champion who is going for his fifth
Wimbledon title, had fewer highs and lows than two-time finalist
Goran Ivanisevic, who let his scruffy beard grow longer through the
weekend as he served 44 aces and 15 double-faults in a 6-7 (6), 7-6
(4), 6-3, 6-4 victory over Daniel Vacek. That match also began
Saturday and was suspended in the third set.
	   Ivanisevic fell in the second round last year and lost in the
first round of four of his past five Grand Slam tournaments. But he
believes he's figured out what he was doing wrong _ ``I tried to be
cool ... It's better to explode straightaway and be OK,'' _ and now
he thinks he may be on the verge of a breakthrough victory in a
major.
	   ``It was not easy for me, all this talking, `He's gone, and he's
never going to be back again,''' Ivanisevic said. ``But every time
when I am on that court, I know I can beat anybody. My matches are
like horror thrillers. You cannot expect anything. I made the
movie, but I don't know the end. It's interesting to watch.''
	   Ivanisevic plays in the round of 16 against unseeded Todd
Martin, the only American man left in the draw besides Sampras.
Martin completed a rain-delayed match against Todd Woodbridge,
winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (1), 6-4.
	   There were curious sights in all corners of Wimbledon.
	   No. 12 Tim Henman, seeking to become the first British man since
1936 to win Wimbledon, made the quarters for the third year in a
row by outplaying the No. 6 Rafter, 6-3, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-2.
	   Rafter was treated for a lower back injury early in the fourth
set. A trainer massaged and stretched Rafter as he lay on a towel,
but the Australian was never able to regain control of the match.
	   Henman next faces the No. 3 Korda, who strained his Achilles
near the end of his victory over John van Lottum 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4).
Korda said the injury was painful but wouldn't stop him from
playing Wednesday.
	   ``If it's going to be nice weather, why not?'' he said.
	   Serena Williams, playing her first Wimbledon but fearlessly
predicting she might win the title, got the day off to an
unfortunate start when she defaulted with a strained left calf
while trailing 7-5, 4-1 in a third-rounder against No. 75 Virginia
Ruano-Pascual.
	   That knocked out 16-year-old Serena's anticipated match against
her 18-year-old sister Venus, the No. 7 seed, who did her part by
beating Chanda Rubin 6-3, 6-4.
	   ``I could have carried on if I wanted, but I have to think about
the future,'' Serena said. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
	   A Williams sisters meeting would have been their third this year
and Wimbledon's first match between sisters since Australians Gail
and Carol Sherriff played in 1966.
	   ``It was going to give something exciting for England for
once,'' Serena said, implying accurately that there hasn't been
much exciting about this tournament so far.
	   ``I had all the expectations for this Wimbledon,'' she said. ``I
expected to go all the way. I guess I just won't be able to this
year. ... In the future, I definitely see myself as one of the
champions.''
	   Serena's confidence about her prospects extended to her sister.
	   ``She might go a long way now that I'm out of the draw,'' she
said. ``I'll give her a couple of tips.''
	   Venus said she likes her own title chances now that Serena,
``the toughest player out there,'' is out of her way.
	   ``I'm definitely at the point where I can do this,'' said Venus,
a first-round loser in her Wimbledon debut last year. ``Last year,
I was not. This year, things are different.''
	   Monica Seles, who reached the French final earlier this month,
advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-2 romp over Sandrine
Testud. Seles next meets Natasha Zvereva, who followed up her
victory over Steffi Graf with a straight-sets win over Miriam
Oremans.
	   Also reaching the women's quarters against each other were No. 2
Lindsay Davenport and No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat. Davenport crushed
Magui Serna 6-1, 6-0, and Tauziat beat Britain's Samantha Smith
6-3, 6-1.
	   Women's third-round winners included No. 3 Jana Novotna and No.
5 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.

Trinidad killer given last-minute reprieve from hanging 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY FRASER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A judge on Monday gave a
last-minute reprieve for a convicted murderer sentenced to hang _
and in the process frustrated Trinidad's latest attempt to resume
executions of criminals.
	   High Court Justice Peter Jamadar issued a stay of execution for
Darrin James until the court can hear defense arguments that James'
stay on death row exceeded constitutional standards.
	   James, 29, was convicted of murdering a taxi driver in 1993. He
had been set to hang on Tuesday. A hearing on his defense motion
was set for Thursday.
	   James' attorneys argue that James was kept on death row for four
months longer than the two-year time period set out by the highest
court of the land, the British Privy Council, before his domestic
appeals were heard.
	   With drug-related crime on the rise, and public opinion favoring
the death penalty, Trinidad and Tobago's government is eager to
execute five men on death row.
	   It has been frustrated by the Privy Council, the final court of
appeal for some former British colonies, which ruled in 1993 that
it was inhumane to execute prisoners who had been on death row for
more than five years.
	   Trinidad's death row prisoners are approaching the five-year
deadline. Appeals can drag on for as long as a decade.
	   On Wednesday, Trinidad said it would defy an international court
order and proceed with the hangings. The Inter-American Human
Rights Court, based in Costa Rica, had ordered the executions
delayed until defense appeals can be heard at an August hearing.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of villagers fled into
the woods as Serbian security forces battled Monday to regain
control of a mining village captured by ethnic Albanian militants
fighting for independence for the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   More than 8,000 people fled their homes in Belacevac and the
neighboring village of Hade, as government forces steadily shelled
the area from three sides. Villagers said they expected the Serbs
to take the town during the night.
	   Police and heavily armed government forces launched an attack
early Monday and by evening had advanced within 200 meters (yards)
of Belacevac village limits, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of
the capital Pristina.
	   The Serbs are trying to retake a coal mine in Belacevac that
fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last week.
Late Monday, the mine remained under KLA control.
	   Villagers reported four ethnic Albanian civilians were killed in
the fighting in Hade. Muja, an ethnic Albanian commander, said he
had only found one dead civilian in Belacevac, but could not get in
the village to count.
	   Fighters and police reported casualities on both sides. The
reports could not be confirmed.
	   Serb police set up in the hills around Belacevac village sniped
at men running water and biscuits to KLA fighters camped in the
woods surrounding the villages.
	   According to the Serbs' Media Center, armed Albanians seized
control of the mine's administrative buildings and fired at police,
the Serbs' Media Center reported. Police were fighting back with
tear gas, the center said.
	   Albanian sources claimed the area was completely sealed off and
that government forces also attacked civilians in surrounding
villages, killing an eight-year-old child and trapping an unknown
number of villagers in their homes. Others fled along an maze of
trails to the forests surrounding the village, where they were
preparing to camp for the night.
	   An Associated Press reporter and two cameramen trying to reach
Belacevac were held at gunpoint by angry Albanian farmers for 20
minutes before.

Sampras wins longest match with 29 aces, Serena Williams injured and out AP Tennis Writer

Eds: AMS; subs 5th graf to include ace count and service speed
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras shaved four times before
he ended the longest, soggiest match of his career at Wimbledon: a
three-set miniseries that dragged mercilessly from Friday's
scheduled start to Monday's final point.
	   The All England Club took on a frenetic atmosphere between early
and late showers as officials crammed up to six matches on each
court to catch up on lost time. Players slid, slipped, and lay
sprawled on the sidelines with injuries.
	   Serena Williams defaulted with a calf strain, U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter hurt his back and lost, and Australian Open champ
Petr Korda strained an Achilles tendon yet won.
	   ``It was a long, long weekend,'' said Sampras, who served aces
on his first six tosses when his match finally began Saturday after
Friday's washed-out start. Two downpours then intruded, and a third
at 5-5 in the second set pushed the conclusion to Monday after
Sunday's traditional day off to think about the whole mess. Another
2{-hour rain delay then hit at 4-4 in the third set.
	   ``It's an emotional roller coaster,'' said Sampras, who finished
with 29 aces at up to 133 mph. ``Really, you get up for playing,
and you come off, and you have a 20-minute delay. You come back,
play a game. You have yesterday off, which was kind of bizarre. So
you get the highs and lows.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A twin engine plane crashed Monday,
killing all six people aboard and injuring one person on the
ground, police said.
	   The plane, headed for Mato Grosso state in western Brazil,
crashed shortly after taking off from the airport at Rio Claro,
some 105 miles (170 kms) northwest of Sao Paulo, said police
officer Jose Horto.
	   The pilot and five passengers, including two children, were
killed when the plane crashed into a field. The aircraft also hit a
passing bicyclist who was hospitalized in serious condition, Horto
said.

No sibling showdown: Serena calls it quits AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Serena Williams left the court
quickly, calling it quits without even stopping to shake her
opponent's hand.
	   Manners and motivation can be problematic for any 16-year-old,
and they came into question Monday when Williams blamed a minor leg
injury for her hasty exit at Wimbledon.
	   With just a trace of a limp, she retired trailing Virginia
Ruano-Pascual 7-5, 4-1. The defeat prevented a fourth-round
showdown Tuesday between Williams and her older sister, Venus.
	   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other,''
Serena said. ``It was going to give something exciting for England
for once.''
	   The sisters sounded as brash as ever Monday, but only Venus
backed up the talk. She swaggered into the fourth round, beating
Chanda Rubin 6-3, 6-4, then dodged the question of whether she was
relieved or disappointed not to play Serena next.
	   ``I can't change what happened,'' Venus said. ``I had to go on
and just make sure I did what Serena didn't do.''
	   With the women's spotlight again on the siblings, fellow
Americans Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport quietly advanced to
the quarterfinals. Seles beat Sandrine Testud, 6-3, 6-2, and
Davenport eliminated Magui Serna 6-1, 6-0.
	   In the other half of the draw, two-time Wimbledon runnerup Jana
Novotna and French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won
third-round matches. Novotna beat Corine Morariu 6-3, 6-1, and
Sanchez Vicario swept Sylvia Plischke 7-5, 6-2.
	   Top-ranked Martina Hingis plays Tamarine Tanasugarn in the
fourth round Tuesday.
	   The first indication of Williams' injury came after she fell
behind 4-5 against Ruano-Pascual, a Spaniard ranked 47th. During a
changeover Williams called for a trainer, who wrapped her left
calf.
	   After Williams broke serve, Ruano-Pascual won the next two games
at love to take the set, then took a 4-0 lead in the second set.
Williams favored her leg on some points but ran well on others.
	   She won the next game to make it 4-1, then told the chair umpire
she couldn't continue. She quickly packed her bag and left the
court, neglecting to acknowledge Ruano-Pascual.
	   The Williams sisters have feuded in the past year with
Sanchez-Vicario and Irina Spirlea, and the snub by Serena left
Ruano-Pascual miffed.
	   ``Everyone says she's going to be the new No. 1 in the world,
but I think she has to change her attitude,'' the Spaniard said.
``A player shouldn't go off the court in the position she was in
without shaking hands.''
	   ``I forgot,'' said Williams, claiming she committed the
oversight because she had never quit a match before.
	   When Ruano-Pascual realized the match was over, she smiled, gave
an embarrassed shrug, then reluctantly waved to the crowd. She said
she was surprised that Williams quit.
	   ``She seemed to have a problem with her calf, but she was
running,'' Ruano-Pascual said in broken English. ``I beat her. She
can play OK, no problem, but she lose.''
	   Venus, naturally, defended Serena.
	   ``She didn't lose,'' Venus said. ``She retired.''
	   Serena said her injury, diagnosed as a strained calf, occurred
when she slipped on the grass in the first set.
	   ``It was just a little one of those slipping blues at Wimbledon.
I could have carried on if I wanted to, but I have to think about
the future. I don't want to hurt myself over something silly and be
out for maybe two months.''
	   Williams spoke of tightness in the calf but little pain. She
invited further skepticism about the injury's severity by saying
she still hopes to play mixed doubles this week, although she and
her sister withdrew from women's doubles.
	   With Serena eliminated from singles, Venus becomes the favorite
_ at least in the Williams household.
	   ``I had expected to go all the way,'' Serena said.
	   ``I'm definitely at the point where I can do this,'' Venus said.
	   Possible remaining foes for Venus include Novotna in the
quarterfinals, Hingis in the semifinals and Seles or Davenport in
the final. But Venus figures her path to the title became easier
Monday.
	   ``Serena,'' she said, ``is definitely the toughest player out
there.''
	   Ruano-Pascual would disagree.

Canada military report finds no evidence of Gulf War Syndrome 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ There is no so-called Gulf War Syndrome plaguing
Canadian soldiers, according to a military report released Monday.
	   Instead, illnesses suffered by Gulf veterans _ from chronic
fatigue to ill-defined muscle and joint pains _ can be linked to
the psychological stresses of that conflict, said Col. Scott
Cameron, a military doctor.
	   The study was conducted through thousands of questionnaires sent
to Gulf veterans. It found no links to chemical weapons, vaccines
or drugs intended to protect against nerve gas.
	   The report did find that veterans complained of a variety of
symptoms _ post-traumatic stress, fatigue, memory loss, an
inability to concentrate, depression, aches and pains _ at a much
higher rate than did soldiers who didn't serve in the Gulf.

NBA to impose lockout AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with background
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With negotiations on a new labor agreement at a
standstill, the National Basketball Association announced on Monday
that a lockout will be imposed Tuesday night when the clock strikes
midnight.
	   The move came as no surprise. Players had been told all season
to expect a work stoppage, and talks between the league and the
union broke off more than a week ago.
	   The lockout will, in essence, shut down the league. Teams will
be barred from talking to their players, trades and free agent
signings will be prohibited and summer leagues will be canceled.
	   ``The expired collective bargaining agreement between the NBA
and its players did not work,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said in a statement after conferring by conference call with the
league's Board of Governors.
	   ``We have made a series of proposals to the players under which
salaries would continue to increase _ but at a slower rate than
under the expired deal,'' Granik said. ``Regrettably, the players
have rejected all of these proposals. The NBA will not operate
until we reach a new agreement that is fair to both parties.''
	   The union did not immediately comment on Monday's announcement.
	   This will be third lockout in the history of the NBA, the only
major American professional sports league never to have lost a game
to a work stoppage.
	   A lockout in the summer of 1995 lasted three months, and a
lockout in 1996 lasted only a couple of hours.
	   By all indications, this one could drag on into the fall or
winter.
	   The sides, despite meeting almost weekly since late April, made
only minimal progress on a new labor agreement to replace the one
expiring at midnight EDT June 30.
	   The old agreement was to run for six years, but the owners had
the right to reopen it if the amount of designated revenue being
paid toward player salaries exceeded a certain level _ 51.8 percent
of basketball-related income.
	   The owners say they are now devoting 57 percent of those
revenues to player salaries, a total of about dlrs 950 million.
They have promised to resist signing a new agreement that does not
include a ceiling on salaries _ a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   Players, meanwhile, have resisted giving up the gains they
achieved in past negotiations. They want to keep the current
``soft'' salary cap, especially the rule known as the Larry Bird
exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain
their own free agents.
	   Such an exception allows the Chicago Bulls to pay Michael Jordan
more than dlrs 33 million last season despite the salary cap being
set at dlrs 26.9 million.
	   A handful of players who were to be paid part of their salaries
this summer will not receive those paychecks until the lockout
ends.
	   Also, teams will not be permitted to conduct practices, summer
camps, workouts, coaching sessions or team meetings. Some
previously scheduled charity games will be allowed to proceed.
	   The impending lockout already caused 12 NBA players to be
removed from this summer's team at the world championships in
Greece. The players had refused to commit to playing in the event
of a lockout, and USA Basketball, the governing body for the
national team, responded by kicking them off the team.
	   The 12 NBA players will be replaced by a team of Americans
currently playing overseas, minor leaguers and possibly some
collegians.

Four separatists sentenced to 32 years each for ETA's longest kidnapping 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Four members of a Basque separatist group
ETA were sentenced Monday to 32 years each in prison for their role
in the keeping a prison official hostage for 18 months, news
reports said.
	   Spain's National Court convicted Jesus Maria Uribechevarria
Bolinaga, Javier Ugarte Villar, Jose Luis Erostegui Bidaguren and
Jose Miguel Gaztelu on charges of kidnapping and conspiring to
murder Jose Antonio Ortega Lara, the state news agency EFE
reported.
	   However, under Spanish law, each member can only serve up to 30
years in prison.
	   The ETA members abducted Ortega Lara in January 1996 and kept
him in a 3-meter by 2.5-meter (9-foot by 7-foot) windowless room
for 532 days. They were arrested last July, hours before police
rescued their captive from a hideout in the northern town of
Mondragon.
	   The four, who were tried earlier this month, admitted they
kidnapped Ortega Lara to pressure the government to move 450 jailed
comrades to facilities in the northern Basque region.
	   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people since it began fighting for an independent
Basque state in northern Spain in 1968.
	   The group is blamed for five killings so far this year,
including Thursday's slaying of a Basque politician in Renteria and
the April shooting of a retired Civil Guard officer.

World Cup: Davids' injury-time goal give Dutch 2-1 victory 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Edgar Davids blasted a 25-meter strike
in the second minute of second-half injury time to send the
Netherlands back to the World Cup quarterfinals for the second
straight time with a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia Monday night.
	   Davids' strike, his first for the Oranje, appeared to deflect
off the leg of Slobodan Komljenovic, and goalkeeper Ivica Kralj
barely got a hand to it before it sailed into the net.
	   The victory put the Dutch in a round-of-eight meeting Saturday
in Marseille with the winner of Tuesay's Argentina-England matchup.
	   The goal was a reward for the Netherlands' dominating play
throughout the first half and much of the second, as Yugoslavia,
despite scoring an early second-half goal and nearly going head
shortly thereafter, seemed content to send the game to extra time
and penalty kicks.
	   Dennis Bergkamp broke through the defensively determined
Yugoslavs in the 38th minute, giving him 35 in a Dutch uniform and
tying him with Faas Wilkes of the 1940s and '50s for the all-time
Netherlands lead.
	   Bergkamp ran onto a long ball out of the back from Dutch captain
and defender Frank de Boer, settling it as Yugoslav defender Zoran
Mirkovic fell. He blasted a shot from 15 meters that Kralj managed
to get his hands to, but couldn't stop from squirting through and
dribbling inside the left post.
	   Looking to slow Marc Overmars, the Yugoslavs packed their right
side with Zoran Mirkovic and Zeljko Petrovic to double mark the
Dutch forward, and used only Predrag Mijatovic as a lone striker.
	   The Netherlands managed to create a few chances, but with
Yugoslavia rarely going forward, the Oranje found little room to
operate. The Yugoslavs, however, looked only dangerous once, that
on a free kick from Sinisa Mihajlovic in the 40th minute that
goalkeeper Edwin van der Saar covered easily.
	   The Yugoslavs came out quickly in the second half, drawing even
with just over three minutes elasped. Dragan Stojkovic lofted a
free kick from just outside the left side of the penalty area over
Dutch midfielder Phillip Cocu and onto the head of Komljenovic, who
headed the ball just inside the far post for his second goal of the
tournament.
	   Yugoslavia had a chance to take the lead less than three minutes
later when Jaap Stam was called for a penalty for grabbing the
shirt of Vladimir Jugovic and holding him back as Stam cleared the
ball.
	   But Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, who scored the only
goal in May's European Champions Cup final, crashed the spot kick
off the crossbar to waste Yugoslavia's best chance at victory.

Cuba prepared to enter trading group tied to EU

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told
Spain on Monday that Cuba is prepared for a possible future
admission into a trade group that links former European colonies
with the EU.
	   On Monday. the EU foreign ministers, at the request of Spain,
admitted Cuba as an observer to the African, Caribbean and Pacific
Group at a meeting scheduled for Sept. 30.
	   ``When Cuba makes a step, it is to reach their goal, and this
step is very important,'' Robaina said after his one-hour meeting
in Madrid with his Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes. Robaina was on
his way to Brussels, Belgium.
	   Seventy-one developing countries are currently members of the
ACP Group, which receive about dlrs 17 billion in aid, import
preferences and price protections from the EU. As a former Spanish
colony, Cuba is seeking trade benefits on its citrus exports.
	   Most member countries favor the admission of Cuba and many have
already increased trade with the island, despite U.S. pressure.
	   Robaina and Matutes said the relationship between both countries
was getting stronger.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Sabotage by telephone workers
protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company has caused
more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, the company's president said
Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, said Carmen Ana Culpeper.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. Labor leaders say the sale
will produce severe job losses.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.
	   Also Monday, Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE announced that
Citibank had agreed to finance dlrs 1.5 billion of the purchase.
	   Talks on transfer of control of Puerto Rico Telephone operations
will begin ``in the coming weeks,'' GTE said in a statement.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale.

Alliance Party leader resigns, gets Assembly speaker's job 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Alderdice appointed as Assembly speaker, CORRECTS
graf 4 to 1996 sted 1997
With BC-Northern Ireland
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The leader of Northern
Ireland's most moderate party, Alliance, announced his resignation
Monday after a disappointing performance in the Belfast Assembly
election last week.
	   But the British government immediately announced that John
Alderdice, 43, had agreed to convene the Assembly on Wednesday as
its ``initial'' speaker. One of his first tasks will be to get
himself elected permanently to the post.
	   Alderdice, who had led the Alliance Party since 1987, was
appointed a member of the House of Lords in 1996 in recognition of
his commitment to cross-community compromise in Northern Ireland.
	   In a brief announcement that caught political observers by
surprise, Alderdice said his resignation would take effect Tuesday.
He said the party needed a new leader who would pursue ``building a
fair, just, peaceful and prosperous society free from sectarian
divisions.''
	   Alderdice had predicted that Alliance would take seven to 10
seats in the 108-member Assembly. But the party won 6.5 percent of
votes and had six successful candidates, including himself.
	   That meant Alliance won't be automatically entitled to hold any
of the 12 posts in a new administration overseeing the Assembly. It
is supposed to gradually take over responsibilities from Mowlam's
Northern Ireland Office starting next year.
	   Alderdice, a Presbyterian, may be replaced as party leader by
his deputy, Seamus Close, a Catholic, who also was elected to the
Assembly.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The leader of Northern
Ireland's most moderate party, Alliance, announced his resignation
Monday after a disappointing performance in the Belfast Assembly
election last week.
	   But the British government immediately announced that John
Alderdice, 43, had agreed to convene the Assembly on Wednesday as
its ``initial'' speaker. One of his first tasks will be to get
himself elected permanently to the post.
	   Alderdice, who had led the Alliance Party since 1987, was
appointed a member of the House of Lords in 1996 in recognition of
his commitment to cross-community compromise in Northern Ireland.
	   In a brief announcement that caught political observers by
surprise, Alderdice said his resignation would take effect Tuesday.
He said the party needed a new leader who would pursue ``building a
fair, just, peaceful and prosperous society free from sectarian
divisions.''
	   Alderdice had predicted that Alliance would take seven to 10
seats in the 108-member Assembly. But the party won 6.5 percent of
votes and had six successful candidates, including himself.
	   That meant Alliance won't be automatically entitled to hold any
of the 12 posts in a new administration overseeing the Assembly. It
is supposed to gradually take over responsibilities from Mowlam's
Northern Ireland Office starting next year.
	   Alderdice, a Presbyterian, may be replaced as party leader by
his deputy, Seamus Close, a Catholic, who also was elected to the
Assembly.
	   Alliance, founded in 1970, had its biggest success in 1977 local
council elections, winning 14.4 percent of votes.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Sabotage by telephone workers
protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company has caused
more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, the company's president said
Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, said Carmen Ana Culpeper.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. Labor leaders say the sale
will produce severe job losses.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.
	   Also Monday, Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE announced that
Citibank had agreed to finance dlrs 1.5 billion of the purchase.
	   Talks on transfer of control of Puerto Rico Telephone operations
will begin ``in the coming weeks,'' GTE said in a statement.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale.

World Cup: Davids' injury-time goal gives Dutch 2-1 victory

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Edgar Davids blasted a 25-meter strike
in the second minute of second-half injury time to send the
Netherlands back to the World Cup quarterfinals for the second
straight time with a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia Monday night.
	   Davids' strike, his first for the Oranje, appeared to deflect
off the leg of Slobodan Komljenovic, and goalkeeper Ivica Kralj
barely got a hand to it before it sailed into the net.
	   The victory put the Dutch in a round-of-eight meeting Saturday
in Marseille with the winner of Tuesay's Argentina-England matchup.
	   The goal was a reward for the Netherlands' dominating play
throughout the first half and much of the second.
	   The Yugoslavs drew even 1-1 barely after three minutes had
elapsed in the second half and missed a chance to take the lead in
the 51st when Predrag Mijatovic crashed a penalty kick off the
crossbar. Other than that, the Yugoslavs seemed content to send the
game to extra time and a penalty shootout.
	   Dennis Bergkamp broke through the defensively determined
Yugoslavs in the 38th minute, giving him 35 in a Dutch uniform and
tying him with Faas Wilkes of the 1940s and '50s for the all-time
Netherlands lead.
	   Bergkamp ran onto a long ball out of the back from Dutch captain
and defender Frank de Boer, settling it as Yugoslav defender Zoran
Mirkovic fell. He blasted a shot from 15 meters that Kralj managed
to get his hands to, but couldn't stop from squirting through and
dribbling inside the left post.
	   ``We should have won and we did,'' Bergkamp said. ``When they
missed their penalty, I thought `Now us.' and it was _ in the last
seconds.''
	   Looking to slow Marc Overmars, the Yugoslavs packed their right
side with Zoran Mirkovic and Zeljko Petrovic to double mark the
Dutch forward, and used only Mijatovic as a lone striker.
	   The Netherlands managed to create a few chances, but with
Yugoslavia rarely going forward, the Oranje found little room to
operate. The Yugoslavs, however, looked only dangerous once in the
first half, that on a free kick from Sinisa Mihajlovic in the 40th
minute that goalkeeper Edwin van der Saar covered easily.
	   The Yugoslavs came out quickly in the second half, drawing even
in the 49th. Dragan Stojkovic lofted a free kick from just outside
the left side of the penalty area over Dutch midfielder Phillip
Cocu and onto the head of Komljenovic, who drove the ball just
inside the far post for his second goal of the tournament.
	   Yugoslavia had a chance to take the lead less than three minutes
later when Jaap Stam was called for a penalty for grabbing the
shirt of Vladimir Jugovic and holding him back as Stam cleared the
ball.
	   But Mijatovic, who scored the only goal in May's European
Champions Cup final to give Real Madrid the title, drove the ball
high into the bar to waste Yugoslavia's best chance at victory. It
was the first missed penalty in France '98.

Anti-censorship group criticizes Syrian record 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: for release at 0001 GMT Tuesday; time set by source
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The anti-censorship group Article 19 called on
Syria Tuesday to relax its strict censorship and to released
journalists and others imprisoned for exercising their right to
free expression.
	   ``As a police state in which the media are monopolized by an
authoritarian regime and dissent has been crushed to the point
where it is virtually inaudible, Syria is an anachronism in a world
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights,'' Article 19 said in a 104-page report.
	   ``... The stability it displays to the outside world is built on
visible and invisible repression,'' the reported added.
	   ``On one level, the ever-present threat of imprisonment, torture
and deprivation of civil rights deters open debate; most people
know of someone who has been punished for speaking their mind.
	   ``On the other, the regime buys the silence of the majority with
small concessions that enable the complaint to live what seems on
the surface to be a normal life.''
	   The report urged Syria to amend its constitution to make if
clear that its guarantees of freedom of expression supersede
legislation, to lift the state of emergency declared in 1962,
repeal legislation giving the government a monopoly on
broadcasting, and to abolish the licensing system for newspapers.
	   ``While Article 19 welcomes Syria's action in releasing many
political prisoners in early June, there must be a full overhaul of
the legal system to end the criminalization of free expression, and
further releases of people imprisoned for exercising their right to
freedom of expression,'' said Frances D'Souza, executive director
of Article 19.
	   Article 19, which takes its name from the free speech article of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a privately funded
non-government organization based in London.

Scientists produce boundless numbers of cow embryo cells in culture AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Researchers have found a way to produce
boundless numbers of embryonic cow cells in the laboratory, a step
that could one day give doctors a large and reliable supply of
animal tissue for use in transplants.
	   Currently, doctors transplant human or animal tissue into people
to treat diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and diabetes.
But the tissue comes straight from human or animal fetuses.
	   The new method yielded millions of embryonic stem cells. Stem
cells are cells that have yet to develop into specialized adult
cells or organs, such as blood, nerve or muscle tissue.
	   But the work isn't yet ready to yield biomedical benefits.
Scientists haven't found a way to trigger a stem cell in the dish
to turn itself into the specific brain, nerve or other cell needed
for transplant.
	   And they haven't yet reproduced the work in pigs, the preferred
animal for tissue transplants.
	   Steve L. Stice, a co-author of the study appearing in the July
issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology, said the results prove
that it is at least possible to get embryonic stem cells from
animals to reproduce indefinitely in a laboratory dish.
	   The goal ultimately is to provide a dependable, off-the-shelf
source of human and animal tissue for treating or curing human
illnesses with less risk of rejection or contamination.
	   ``Instead of having to make animals or fetuses for
transplantation, the potential is to be able to use these embryonic
stem cells,'' Stice said. ``We can grow them in a petri dish in the
laboratory and therefore have greater control over what their
background is, what they're exposed to.''
	   The research from Stice and James Robl of the department of
veterinary and animal sciences at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst, is an offshoot of their cloning research.
	   They began with fibroblasts, or fetal skin and connective-tissue
cells. The researchers took fibroblasts from a cow fetus and
injected them into a cow's egg from which the nucleus had been
removed. That created an embryo.
	   These embryos were then placed in petri dishes, where the
embryonic cells kept on dividing and dividing without maturing into
specialized cells.
	   The approach means you can store large numbers of embryonic
cells for use later and even genetically engineer them as desired,
said Neil L. First, an animal gene researcher at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.

NOW says no to Tyson's boxing license 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The National Organization for Women, which
protested Mike Tyson's return to the ring after he was released
from prison, wants Nevada authorities to reject his efforts to
regain a boxing license.
	   The head of the organization's Las Vegas office called on other
groups around the country to pressure the Nevada Athletic
Commission into not giving Tyson a new license.
	   ``If we fail to seize this opportunity to be heard, we will have
failed miserably in our obligation to the children of our nation
who look up to Mike Tyson, and many others like him, as athletes to
imitate,'' Anne Golonka wrote in a letter she said was sent to
women's groups across the country.
	   Tyson was banned from boxing by the commission last July 9 for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight title
fight rematch. He will be eligible to reapply to the commission at
the end of one year, and his advisers say he plans to do so this
month.
	   Golonka, president of the Southern Nevada chapter of NOW, was
the organizer of protests against Tyson at his fights following his
release from prison on a rape conviction.
	   She also spoke in favor of his boxing license being revoked when
the boxing commission met to consider what actions it would take
against Tyson in the wake of last year's fight.
	   In her letter, Golonka said Tyson's recent appearances with
disabled and foster children ``have sickened most of us'' and said
he should not be allowed to return to the ring because of his past
actions.
	   She included phone numbers and the e-mail address for the
athletic commission, and urged a ``tidal wave of public outrage''
to be directed at those who favor relicensing him.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac arrived
Monday in Angola to assess the ailing peace process and look at
ways of expanding French investment in this former Portuguese
colony.
	   Chirac, on a 24-hour visit, was invited to a banquet Monday
evening with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   ``In coming here I want to develop the dialogue and confidence
with countries which France wants to know better and to give rise
to better cooperation,'' Chirac said in a speech at the banquet.
	   He will hold private talks Tuesday with dos Santos and address
the National Assembly, while some 50 top French businessmen
traveling with him will meet local officials and business leaders.
	   Angola's two-decade civil war, which ended with the signing of a
1994 peace pact between the government and UNITA rebels, destroyed
the nation's economy. The southwest African country has vast
untapped natural resources, including oil, diamonds and other
minerals, as well as agriculture and forestry.
	   Lingering mistrust between the former foes has stymied
implementation of the accord, which is running more than a year
behind schedule and has placed a brake on foreign investment.
	   Chirac acknowledged that the peace was ``fragile'' and urged a
broad effort to ensure that peace ``puts down roots.''

Netanyahu gives east Jerusalem settlers his support 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At a gala event to raise funds for Jewish
settlement in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu threw his support behind the settlers Monday and
vowed to keep building in the disputed sector.
	   Meanwhile, over 1,000 Israeli peace activists protested outside
the event to raise money for Ateret Cohanim, a group which actively
settles Jews in land Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war from
Jordan and a Jewish seminary affiliated with the group.
	   The United States has asked Israel for a time-out in settlement
activity, saying it hurts chances for restarting peace talks with
the Palestinians. The talks broke-down 16 months ago after Israel
began building homes for Jews on a east Jerusalem hilltop.
	   ``We will build for the Jews and for the Arabs, because we are
the landlords here and the landlords build for all those living in
their house,'' a defiant Netanyahu told the crowd of 6,000
gathered.
	   Dozens of people booed Netanyahu when he mentioned homes for
Arabs, but the premier asked them to stop and refrain from chanting
``Death to the Arabs.''
	   Netanyahu supports natural growth in West Bank settlements and
in east Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after its capture. The
Palestinians entered into peace talks with Israel in 1993 in the
hopes of one day achieving independence and establishing a state in
the West Bank with east Jerusalem as its capital.
	   Netanyahu's presence at the dinner could help him win back key
support from the settlers, worried that the premier may go forward
with promises to cede West Bank land, which they believe God
promsied to the Jews, to the Palestinians.
	   ``You are dedicated friends who work day and night to ensure
that there is more and more building in Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu said
in a speech at the fundraiser which he attended with his wife
Sarah.
	   Illegal efforts by Ateret Cohanim to set-up homes inside the
Muslim quarter of the Jerusalem's Old city recently, sparked
violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, as have other
endeavors by the group.
	   When Israel captured east Jerusalem, its population was made up
entirely of Palestinians, but over the past 31 years, Israel has
altered the demographics by encouraging settlement in east
Jerusalem, where Jews now outnumber Arabs.
	   Peace Now activists marched several kilometers (miles) from
Netanyahu's home to the event held outside the Old city walls.
Waving banners, they shouted ``Netanyahu Resign,'' and ``No
settlements.''
	   Several right-wing members of Netanyahu's coalition also
attended the fundraiser which included a concert, fire works
display and dinner.

Europe scores two more, CONCACAF loses another pair 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Netherlands-Yugoslavia
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ CONCACAF lost two more and Europe gained two more.
	   Germany rallied with a pair of goals in the final 15 minutes to
eliminate CONCACAF's lone remaining hope _ Mexico _ on Monday,
while the North-Central American region also said goodbye to U.S.
coach Steve Sampson.
	   Germany led the way for two more European teams into the
quarterfinals, beating Mexico 2-1 on Oliver Bierhoff's 86th-minute
header. With the Netherlands joining them Monday night thanks to a
2-1 victory over Yugoslavia, Europe had five of the six
quarterfinalists and was assured of at least one more between
Romania and Croatia on Tuesday.
	   Argentina will face England in Tuesday's other second-round
matchup and with Mexico out, the World Cup again was solely an
European and South American affair.
	   For much of the second half, Mexico appeared on track for the
biggest upset in the single-elimination phase of a World Cup since
Cameroon stunned Colombia in 1990.
	   ``My compliments to Mexico, but if you look over 90 minutes, I
think we deserved to win,'' Bierhoff said. ``Mexico was dangerous
in the front but we had more chances.''
	   ``If you don't use your chances it becomes difficult,'' said
Bierhoff, whose 27 goals with Udinese topped the Italian league
this season.
	   Luis Hernandez scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the
47th minute, settling Cuauhtemoc Blanco's pass and avoiding Germans
Michael Tarnat and defender Christian Worns before beating
goalkeeper Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   Derided by its home media in the run-up to the World Cup as ``El
Tritanic'' _ a mocking reference to the team's unofficial nickname
of ``El Tricolor'' _ Mexico's legion appeared on the verge of
shaming its critics and matching its all-time World Cup high.
	   The quarterfinal berth would equal its performances in 1970 and
1986, but would be the first time it had advanced that far when the
World Cup was not played on its home soil.
	   ``I think this a message to the Mexican people,'' Hernandez
said. ``You should trust us. For those who do not trust us, please
understand. We have done the utmost. We are extremely proud of what
we have done today against the German team.''
	   But Germany, which has made the final eight in every World Cup
they've entered except 1938, prevailed as expected.
	   ``I wouldn't want to go through such a game every day,'' said
German coach Berti Vogts. ``My team went through 90 minutes of
torture. We won with our fighting spirit. They found the strength
to win a game that was nearly lost.''
	   Mexican defender Raul Lara opened the door for Germany, failing
to clear a cross to his feet and allowing Juergen Klinsmann to tie
the match in the 75th. Lara then held the door open, too, allowing
Bierhoff to get to Ulf Kirsten's cross first and beat Mexican
keeper Jorge Campos with a header.
	   ``Maybe it's an instinct that I have,'' said Bierhoff, who with
Klinsmann scored his third goal of the tournament. ``But one should
also pay tribute to Klinsmann.''
	   Later in the day, there was no question who the Dutch hero was.
	   Twenty-five-year-old midfielder Edgar Davids was the man of the
Oranje, scoring in the second minute of second-half injury time to
put the Netherlands in the quarterfinals for the second straight
time.
	   Davids' strike from 25 meters appeared to deflect off the leg of
Slobodan Komljenovic, and goalkeeper Ivica Kralj barely got a hand
to it before it sailed into the net.
	   The victory came despite Yugoslavia equalizing barely three
minutes into the second half and then missing a chance to go ahead
when Predrag Mijatovic slammed a penalty kick off the bar three
minutes later. It was the first missed penalty of France 98.
	   The Dutch dominated all of the first half and much of the
second, but were thwarted in their attempts by a Yugoslav team
clearly intent on defending at all costs.
	   ``We should have won and we did,'' said forward Dennis Bergkamp,
who gave the Netherlands the lead in the 38th minute. ``When they
missed their penalty, I thought `Now us.' and it was _ in the last
seconds.''
	   While Mexico's and Yugoslavia's tournaments came to an end, so
did the U.S. national team coaching career of Steve Sampson.
	   U.S. federation president Alan Rothenberg paid tribute to
Sampson, who resigned Monday, saying his ``tireless work has helped
advance our sport and on balance it was an era of growth.''
	   Sampson left as the most successful coach in U.S. national team
history and the only one with a winning record (26-22-14). Since
taking over the team in the spring of 1995, Sampson led the United
States to a fourth-place finish in the 1995 Copa America and
first-ever victories over South American powers Argentina and
Brazil.
	   But a last-placed finish in France 98 following three straight
losses with only one goal scored drew a deluge of criticism from
his players and the media.
	   He was the fifth coach at the World Cup to be either fired or
resign following a disappointing finish, joining Saudi Arabia's
Carlos Alberto Parreira, Japan's Takeshi Okada, South Korea's Cha
Bum-kun and Tunisia's Henry Kasperczak.

Bittersweet celebration as Mexico is eliminated from World Cup

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Rowdy in victory, Mexicans were somewhat
subdued in defeat after the national soccer team was eliminated
from the World Cup with a 2-1 loss Monday to Germany.
	   Although police said two people were seriously injured in a
firecracker explosion, dozens more suffered minor injuries and 53
people were arrested, the crowds in Mexico City were much tamer
than the bottle-throwing mobs that turned out after Mexico's
previous World Cup matches.
	   More than 10,000 people watched the game on a giant-screen
television in the city's main plaza, the Zocalo. But even after
watching Mexico blow a 1-0 lead, the crowd found plenty to
celebrate. Few had expected Mexico to advance to the World Cup's
second round and there was little disgrace in losing to Germany,
one of the best teams.
	   ``They gave some extremely cool moments to the entire nation. As
athletes, they demonstrated a world-class quality,'' Mario Sosa,
23, said after watching the game in the Zocalo. ``We think we
should be really proud of the team.''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo called the team after the game to
offer congratulations. He said its performance in the 1998 World
Cup, in which it previously won one game and tied two, ``has been
an example not only of its extraordinary athletic capacity, but
also of its enormous character, its extraordinary spirit and, above
all, its desire to win.''
	   After celebrations of last week's 2-2 tie with Belgium resulted
in 164 arrests and more than 90 injuries _ four of them severe _
police boosted security.
	   The worst violence occurred during the game. Police said a
homemade firecracker rigged with metal fragments exploded in the
Zocalo, injuring two people in the head: Oscar Rivas Medina, 20,
and Magdalena Mendoza, 18.
	   But there was little trouble after the game. The Zocalo quickly
cleared as fans _ many of them waving flags, wearing green Mexico
jerseys or with their faces painted in the national red, white and
green _ began an impromptu 2{-mile parade to the Angel of
Independence Monument. Some youths took over minibuses, hanging out
windows and standing on roofs, waving Mexican flags.
	   Hundreds of police in riot gear surrounded the monument or were
posted nearby, but appeared to have few problems. Within a couple
of hours, most of the crowd had left.
	   The few fans remaining offered a few cheers to their fallen
team. And if the celebration lacked the enthusiasm that followed
past games, there were also no tears in sight.
	   ``I saw that they gave their best effort and did all they
could,'' said Alejandro Jimenez Escobar, 19, at the Zocalo. ``It
was a good game, wasn't it? Someone has to lose.''

22 hurt In bus accident at Brussels airport 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Twenty-two people were injured Monday
when a bus with passengers from a Sabena flight collided with an
airport utility vehicle at the Brussels airport, the Belgian
airline said.
	   The injured, suffering from fractures and bruises, were taken to
three hospitals. None of the injuries was serious, Sabena said in a
statement.
	   The accident happened when the low-slung airport vehicle that is
used to park planes at jetways ignored a stop sign, Sabena said. It
struck a bus carrying about 50 people from a Sabena flight from
Rome to the airport terminal.

World Cup: Davids dtrike sends Dutch into last eight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional; ADDS quotes.
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Edgar Davids couldn't have picked a
better moment to score his first goal for the Netherlands.
	   The Juventus midfielder's left-footed drive in the second minute
of second-half injury time ensured a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia
and sent the Dutch into the World Cup quarterfinals for the second
straight time.
	   The victory came after the Netherlands weathered an early
second-half goal by Yugoslavia and a penalty attempt Predrag
Mijatovic's that crashed off the crossbar.
	   ``When they missed their penalty, I thought `Now us.' and it was
_ in the last seconds,'' said striker Dennis Bergkamp, who scored
the first Dutch goal in the 38th minute.
	   Davids, playing in his 15th international, was only recalled to
the Dutch lineup for this World Cup after being omitted for two
years for insulting coach Guus Hiddink at the Euro '96 tournament
in England.
	   ``I had some cramps in my leg and I had told Hiddink I had a
problem,'' Davids said. ``He told me to stay on the field and I put
all of myself into the final shot, and I scored.''
	   Argentina or England await the Netherlands in the next round.
	   ``I would prefer Argentina,'' forward Ronald de Boer said. ``I
think us against Argentina would be a hell of a game.''
	   Hiddink said he had no preference.
	   ``Both will be very dangerous,'' he said. ``But we are very
happy to be there and we have more ambitions.''
	   After playing an ultra-defensive first half in which they
conceded only the Bergkamp goal, the Yugoslavs came out quickly
after the break and equalized in the 49th minute when Slobodan
Komljenovic rose at the far post to head in a free kick from the
left by Dragan Stojkovic.
	   The goal stirred Yugoslavia and it began to move forward. The
pressure paid off almost immediately as Jaap Stam grabbed the shirt
of Vladimir Yugovic as the two battled in the area and Spanish
referee Jose Garcia Aranda pointed to the penalty spot.
	   Mijatovic stepped up but crashed his shot against the underside
of the bar as Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar dived to his
right. The ball ricocheted into the ground and to safety.
	   ``In the first part of the game our strategy was to keep the
Dutch down. Probably we were less cautious in the second half,''
Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
	   The Netherlands finally broke down the determined Yugoslav
defense in the 38th minute when Bergkamp latched onto a long pass
by Frank de Boer and held off Zoran Mirkovic to shoot under the
dive of goalkeeper Ivica Kralj at the near post.
	   The goal gave Bergkamp a share of the Netherlands' all-time
scoring lead with 35 in his 61 internationals. He equaled the
record of Faas Wilkes, who scored 35 in 38 matches in the 1940's
and 1950's.
	   After Yugoslavia had scored and Mijatovic had missed the
penalty, chances began to come thick and fast, with the Netherlands
having most of the opportunities.
	   In the 66th minute, Marc Overmars controlled a long cross-field
pass from Arthur Numan and cut inside from the right but his
curling left-foot shot flew past the post.
	   Phillip Cocu should have put the Dutch back into the lead a
minute later, but his diving header on a Ronald de Boer cross was
just wide.
	   Cocu then saw a volleyed goal of his disallowed in the 79th
minute because Bergkamp was adjudged to have lifted his foot too
high in the penalty area seconds before.
	   Finally it was Davids who settled the matter with his strike.
	   Hiddink said afterward he was prepared to substitute Davids if
the match had gone into extra time.
	   ``It was a happy non-decision to let him go until the end
because it was like it was,'' Hiddink said.

Prosecutors call King a liar but defense says that's not the truth 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A prosecutor Monday accused boxing promoter Don
King of lying to commit insurance fraud and then, hinting at the
difficulty of convicting a celebrity, warned that ``no one is above
the law.''
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Chung accused King of lying so
many times as she delivered her 3 1/2 hour closing argument that
defense lawyer Peter Fleming Jr. seized on the issue when he
started his defense statement.
	   ``I heard in the last five minutes the word lie as many as 15
times,'' he said, his voice slowly rising. Then he asked the jury
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to look carefully at the
indictment charging King with nine counts of wire fraud.
	   ``Do you see a single count of perjury against Don King?'' he
asked as he leaned over the podium and studied the jurors.
	   There was no perjury charge. The indictment contained only the
fraud charges, enough of them to carry a sentence of up to 45 years
in prison if King were convicted. His company, Don King Productions
Inc., is charged in seven of the counts.
	   The prosecutor accused King of lying to Lloyd's of London to get
them to pay dlrs 350,000 in nonexistent training expenses for a
1991 Cesar Chavez fight that was canceled when the boxer cut his
face while sparring.
	   She accused him of lying to Chavez so the boxer would not know
the training expenses he was forcing him to pay back were actually
insured. And she accused him of lying on the witness stand.
	   Despite branding the flamboyant and wildly successful promoter a
liar, she also asked the jury to believe he meant what he said when
he testified at his 1995 trial that it would be deceptive to submit
a fake contract to Lloyd's.
	   Fleming, noting that Don King Productions was not a defendant in
the first trial, said it was ironic that the prosecution wanted the
jury to find truthful parts of the testimony of someone they had
called a liar.
	   ``You may find those the answers of an honest man,'' Fleming
said. ``He's either a liar or a truth teller.''
	   Fleming accused prosecutors of putting their own spin on every
fact.
	   But Chung said it was the defense lawyers who were trying to
confuse the jury.
	   ``They want you to think this is a huge misunderstanding,'' she
said.
	   Chung said King began a campaign of fraud as soon as the bout
was canceled, backdating checks, faking a contract, trying to
create the expenses that must be proven to be reimbursed.
	   ``There was a scheme to defraud, a con of Lloyd's of London that
involved lying, trickery and deceiving,'' she said.
	   She called Chavez the ``perfect vehicle for a fraud'' because he
was easy to keep in the dark since he does not speak English and he
does not surround himself with lawyers.
	   Closing arguments were set to resume Tuesday.

	   _ Henri Leconte won the Delta Air Lines ATP Senior Tour of
Champions in Mariehamn, Finland, by defeating Bjorn Borg 4-6, 6-4,
10-5 in a Champions tiebreaker.
 &UR; Wimbledon &QC; 
	   _ Francisco Clavet eliminated No. 2 Marcelo Rios 6-3, 3-6, 7-5,
3-6, 6-3.
	   _ Natasha Zvereva ousted seven-time champion Steffi Graf, the
No. 4 seed, 6-4, 7-5.
	   _ Hicham Arazi upset No. 5 Carlos Moya, the French Open winner,
4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
	   _ Samantha Smith knocked off No. 8 Conchita Martinez, the 1994
champion, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``Don't ask me how I did it, all I know it was the greatest
match of my career.'' _ Natasha Zvereva, after upsetting Steffi
Graf.
	   ``Right now, I feel I have a lot more to do with some of these
defeats than my opponents.'' _ Andre Agassi, following his loss to
Tommy Haas.
	   ``It would be nice to play again and, hopefully, be in different
shape and enjoy myself. But I've learned enough to take what's
coming up next (as it comes). So I don't know.'' _ Steffi Graf,
when asked if she will return to Wimbledon next year.
	   ``We've seen everything. I was wondering if it's OK to breathe
this air.'' _ Monica Seles, after smoke from a blazing apartment
building forced a match to be suspended.
	   ``On grass especially, it makes no difference if you're a star.
Everybody can beat you if you aren't 100 percent.'' _ Martina
Hingis.
	   ``Behind that smile lurks a very ruthless guy.'' _ Brian
Teacher, talking about his former pupil, Greg Rusedski.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STREAK ENDS &QC; 
	   When Natasha Zvereva knocked off Steffi Graf in straight sets at
Wimbledon, the Belorussian ended a 17-match losing streak to the
German. It marked the end of the longest losing streak in the
women's game since Pam Shriver finally defeated Chris Evert at the
1987 Canadian Open after 18 consecutive losses. For Graf, it was
only the second time she has lost before the fourth round in 43
Grand Slam tournaments since the 1984 US Open.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STYLISH DUDE &QC; 
	   Seventeen-year-old Xavier Malisse was a surprise selection for
the Belgium squad that will play the United States July 17-19 in a
Davis Cup quarterfinal in Indianapolis. Malisse has been compared
to Dennis Rodman after playing this year in red-, yellow- and
green-dyed hair. He also was just two points away from defeating
Pete Sampras in the first round at Philadelphia earlier this year.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SCHNYDER THE LONELY &QC; 
	   After one of her early round matches, Switzerland's Patty
Schnyder sat in the interview room ready to bare her soul. But
there were no reporters, so a plea was made to the Swiss media.
Within minutes, the 13th-seeded Schnyder was all smiles. As the
press arrived, she shook hands with each reporter, welcoming them
to the interview.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SERVING BIG &QC; 
	   Venus Williams unleashed the fastest serve recorded in women's
tennis, 125 mph, during her second-round 6-1, 6-2 victory over
Barbara Schett at Wimbledon. The serve broke the previous record of
123 mph set by Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands at
Wimbledon last year. Williams' previous best was 122 mph at the
Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida earlier this year.
According to the daily statistics produced by IBM, only six men
have had bigger serves than Williams in the first week of this
year's Wimbledon.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SOME OLD ROCK, PERHAPS &QC; 
	   Pat Cash and the Wild Colonial boys were to play a two-night
rock gig in London during Wimbledon. Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon
champion who is working this year's tournament as a commentator for
BBC television, was joined in the all-star lineup by fellow tennis
star rockers Jim Courier and John McEnroe.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SANDU STOCK &QC; 
	   Raluca Sandu of Romania is romantically linked with French Open
champion Carlos Moya of Spain. In the Corel WTA player guide, Sandu
notes that she ``likes Carlos Moya's footwork.'' Sandu comes from a
sporting family. Her late mother, Simona, won a bronze medal in
handball for Romania at the 1972 Olympics, and her father, Mirea,
played soccer for the national team and is now president of the
Romanian soccer federation.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STANDING OUT &QC; 
	   Jelena Dokic, the top-ranked junior girl in the world, has been
named to the Australian team for next month's Fed Cup competition
against Argentina. The 15-year-old Dokic has won seven junior
singles titles this year and was runnerup at the junior French
Open.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STILL AROUND &QC; 
	   Competing in her sixth tournament of the year, veteran Lori
McNeil returned to the Corel WTA Tour this year after missing most
of the 1997 season with a stress fracture in her foot. So far this
year, she has won a challenger tournament in Rochester, Minnesota;
reached the third round at the Lipton in Key Biscayne, Florida;
upset third-seeded Tamarine Tanasugarn to reach the quarterfinals
of the Japan Open, and ousted Jennifer Capriati at Wimbledon.
McNeil's biggest moment at Wimbledon came in 1994 when she upset
top-seeded and defending champion Steffi Graf in the first round,
marking the first time in Grand Slam history that a defending
women's champion had suffered a first-round loss.

Japanese business survey shows deteriorating confidence South Korea and Pakistan. Stands for digest item slugged Asia-Economic Woes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS market, business developments from Malaysia, Singapore,
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Its economy is stuck in its worst recession in
decades, its currency is foundering and its government is
scrambling to save banks from an avalanche of bad debt.
	   What else could possibly go wrong?
	   A crisis of confidence, suggests a survey by Japan's central
bank. And it is already spreading.
	   In its closely watched quarterly report, the Bank of Japan said
Monday that corporate sentiment has deteriorated to its worst level
in four years, with most companies saying they have seen economic
conditions worsen over the quarter.
	   Also Monday, other developments in the region triggered more
angst for the suffering economies of least four countries.
	   _The Malaysian currency slipped sharply against the U.S. dollar
in late trading as market participants sold the ringgit on
perceived changes in Malaysia's monetary policy.
	   _South Korea's largest automaker, Hyundai Motors Co., made
official its layoff plan, and a labor union vowed to organize a
massive strike against the move. In a report to the Labor Ministry,
Hyundai said it plans to lay off 4,800 workers by the end of this
year.
	   _Singapore unveiled much-anticipated plans to stimulate the
economy as growth continues to dwindle. Speaking in Parliament,
Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced wide-ranging special
economic measures worth 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.17
billion) to help business cope with the economic downturn, and said
further action could be taken if the situation worsens.
	   _The Karachi Stock Exchange continued to tumble dropping 65.87
points by the end of the day's trading. The stock exchange closed
at 811.03, down from Friday's close of 876.90 -- which was a new
record low for the market. Brokers blamed the downward slide on
chaotic government policy and the ongoing feud between the
government and independent power companies.
	   In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed
much of corporate Japan remains worried over anemic growth in the
domestic market and the prospects for recovery in other Asian
nations hit by a financial crisis.
	   The survey's index measures the percentage of major
manufacturers seeing conditions improve minus the percentage seeing
conditions worsen and fell to minus 38 in June from minus 31 in the
previous quarter.
	   The June tankan survey marked the fourth consecutive drop and
the lowest level since a minus 39 in August 1994. The worst ever
tankan result, a minus 67, was recorded in 1975.
	   Still, the most recent survey showing was better than an average
forecast of minus 44 by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
It was also not as sharp a decline as reported in April when the
March tankan came in at minus 31, down from minus 11 in December.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average climbed 155.69 points, or 1.02 percent,
closing at 15,365.73 and bringing its four-day gain to 311.13
points. The yen, meanwhile, strengthened slightly to trade at
141.82 to the dollar late in the day in New York.
	   Also Monday, Japan's trade ministry said industrial production
in May fell a seasonally-adjusted 2 percent compared to the
previous month. That was below the 0.1 percent rise forecast by
private economists polled by Dow Jones.

World Cup: Davids' strike sends Dutch into last eight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Mijatovic quote in new 14th graf.
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Edgar Davids couldn't have picked a
better moment to score his first goal for the Netherlands.
	   The Juventus midfielder's left-footed drive in the second minute
of second-half injury time ensured a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia
and sent the Dutch into the World Cup quarterfinals for the second
straight time.
	   The victory came after the Netherlands weathered an early
second-half goal by Yugoslavia and a penalty attempt Predrag
Mijatovic's that crashed off the crossbar.
	   ``When they missed their penalty, I thought `Now us.' and it was
_ in the last seconds,'' said striker Dennis Bergkamp, who scored
the first Dutch goal in the 38th minute.
	   Davids, playing in his 15th international, was only recalled to
the Dutch lineup for this World Cup after being omitted for two
years for insulting coach Guus Hiddink at the Euro '96 tournament
in England.
	   ``I had some cramps in my leg and I had told Hiddink I had a
problem,'' Davids said. ``He told me to stay on the field and I put
all of myself into the final shot, and I scored.''
	   Argentina or England await the Netherlands in the next round.
	   ``I would prefer Argentina,'' forward Ronald de Boer said. ``I
think us against Argentina would be a hell of a game.''
	   Hiddink said he had no preference.
	   ``Both will be very dangerous,'' he said. ``But we are very
happy to be there and we have more ambitions.''
	   After playing an ultra-defensive first half in which they
conceded only the Bergkamp goal, the Yugoslavs came out quickly
after the break and equalized in the 49th minute when Slobodan
Komljenovic rose at the far post to head in a free kick from the
left by Dragan Stojkovic.
	   The goal stirred Yugoslavia and it began to move forward. The
pressure paid off almost immediately as Jaap Stam grabbed the shirt
of Vladimir Yugovic as the two battled in the area and Spanish
referee Jose Garcia Aranda pointed to the penalty spot.
	   Mijatovic stepped up but crashed his shot against the underside
of the bar as Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar dived to his
right. The ball ricocheted into the ground and to safety.
	   ``This is the worst moment in my career,'' Mijatovic said. ``The
Dutch goalkeeper is tall, so I decided to shoot high and under the
bar. It didn't work. I'm sad for my teammates.''
	   Had Mijatovic converted, Yugoslavia's defense-at-all-cost
tactics might have worked.
	   ``In the first part of the game our strategy was to keep the
Dutch down. Probably we were less cautious in the second half,''
Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
	   The Netherlands finally broke down the determined Yugoslav
defense in the 38th minute when Bergkamp latched onto a long pass
by Frank de Boer and held off Zoran Mirkovic to shoot under the
dive of goalkeeper Ivica Kralj at the near post.
	   The goal gave Bergkamp a share of the Netherlands' all-time
scoring lead with 35 in his 61 internationals. He equaled the
record of Faas Wilkes, who scored 35 in 38 matches in the 1940's
and 1950's.
	   After Yugoslavia had scored and Mijatovic had missed the
penalty, chances began to come thick and fast, with the Netherlands
having most of the opportunities.
	   In the 66th minute, Marc Overmars controlled a long cross-field
pass from Arthur Numan and cut inside from the right but his
curling left-foot shot flew past the post.
	   Phillip Cocu should have put the Dutch back into the lead a
minute later, but his diving header on a Ronald de Boer cross was
just wide.
	   Cocu then saw a volleyed goal of his disallowed in the 79th
minute because Bergkamp was adjudged to have lifted his foot too
high in the penalty area seconds before.
	   Finally it was Davids who settled the matter with his strike.
	   Hiddink said afterward he was prepared to substitute Davids if
the match had gone into extra time.
	   ``It was a happy non-decision to let him go until the end
because it was like it was,'' Hiddink said.

UN holds special session on children in armed conflict 
</HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that children are being used as
soldiers in war zones around the world, the Security Council on
Monday condemned the arming of children and on Monday demanded an
immediate end to the practice.
	   In a draft presidential statement, the 15-member council
condemned the targeting of children ``including their humiliation,
brutalization, sexual abuse, abduction and forced displacement and
use in hostilities in violation of international law.''
	   The council's special meeting, and a two-day symposium in London
last week, were set to launch a campaign by U.N. agencies and other
groups to encourage the implementation of international conventions
to protect civilians and to prevent children under 18 from
participating in combat.
	   ``I have a deep fear, a nightmare scenario, that we maybe
exposed to so much that we are in danger of accepting as normal
what in fact represents a radical departure from any acceptable
norms,'' said the U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, Olara
Otunnu.
	   In wars over the last decade, 2 million children have been
killed, 1 million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured and 10
million left with ``serious psychological trauma,'' said Otunnu, a
former Ugandan ambassador to the United Nations and now a citizen
of the Ivory Coast.
	   Estimating that a quarter of a million children, most of them
African, are currently armed, Otunnu urged the council to send a
clear message that the use and abuse of children in war is ``simply
unacceptable.''
	   He urged greater efforts to disarm child soldiers, treat their
physical and psychological wounds, return displaced kids and clear
their homelands of land mines, which kill or maim an estimated 800
children each month.
	   The presidential statement urged all nations to comply with the
Geneva Convention on the protocols of armed conflict, the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and stressed ``the
obligation'' of nations to prosecute those who violate
international humanitarian law.
	   Costa Rica's U.N. ambassador, Fernando Berrocal Soto, said the
negotiations under way for the creation of an international war
crimes tribunal were a step in the right direction for prosecuting
such breaches.
	   He also suggested the creation of a universal monitoring system
``to detect possible situations of armed conflict which might
affect children.''
	   The issue of child victims deserves a prominent place on the
agendas of the entire international community, said Britain's U.N.
ambassador, John Weston.
	   ``The causalities of modern armed conflicts are overwhelmingly
civilians rather than soldiers,'' Weston said on behalf of the
European Union. ``Among the civilians, women and children are
particularly vulnerable and consequently they are now the principal
victims of war.''

Precede: BETHUNE Clashes between English fans, French immigrant youths 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with clashes in Saint-Etienne
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ North African French youths clashed
with English fans at an outdoor screen showing a World Cup match on
Monday night, the eve of an England-Argentina game here.
	   Authorities stopped the screening of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match around 11 p.m., while violence spread to the area around the
stadium, where the local youths burned several cars.
	   At least 10 people were arrested, including nine French and one
Englander, said police, who have a reinforced 1,600-member force
for Tuesday's match where more trouble is feared.
	   There was no immediate word on injuries from the clashes.
	   Police said the incident began when the local youths from poor
neighborhoods, seeking to avenge English-Tunisians clashes after a
match in Marseille two weeks earlier, insulted, then struck English
fans.
	   The English fought back and CRS riot police intervened,
arresting the 10 people. Police dogs were deployed to help maintain
security.
	   Shortly before midnight, riot police cordoned off the downtown
area, though local youths regrouped in some spots.
	   Meanwhile, an English soccer fan was jailed for four months on
Monday for throwing beer cans at police after England's World Cup
match against Tunisia.
	   Anthony Winston, a 19-year-old from London, was picked up by
British police in Lens, northern France, which was the venue for
England's match last Friday against Colombia.
	   Winston admitted to a court in Bethune, northern France, that he
threw the cans. But he said he was aiming at Tunisian fans who he
said had provoked the English contingent, police said.
	   Several hundred Englishmen fought running street battles on June
15 in Marseille, southeastern France, with French-Tunisian youths
and police, leaving scores injured.
	   Security has been beefed up considerably at England matches.
Authorities fear England's match against Argentina on Tuesday in
Saint-Etienne could also be a flashpoint for hooligans from both
countries.
	   There are also security worries over matches involving Germany,
as a result of rioting after Germany's match in Lens against
Yugoslavia, which left a policeman in a coma.
	   But officials, who deployed 2,000 police in Montpellier, said no
problems were reported Thursday after Germany's match against
Mexico.
	   As a precaution, Montpellier's bars were ordered to close Monday
and supermarkets were not allowed to sell alcohol. At one downtown
supermarket, shelves stocking alcohol were covered in plastic
sheets.

Precede: BETHUNE Clashes between English fans, French immigrant youths lines 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with clashes in Saint-Etienne; also moved on news
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ North African French youths clashed
with English fans at an outdoor screen showing a World Cup match on
Monday night, the eve of an England-Argentina game here.
	   Authorities stopped the screening of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match around 11 p.m., while violence spread to the area around the
stadium, where the local youths burned several cars.
	   At least 10 people were arrested, including nine French and one
Englander, said police, who have a reinforced 1,600-member force
for Tuesday's match where more trouble is feared.
	   There was no immediate word on injuries from the clashes.
	   Police said the incident began when the local youths from poor
neighborhoods, seeking to avenge English-Tunisians clashes after a
match in Marseille two weeks earlier, insulted, then struck English
fans.
	   The English fought back and CRS riot police intervened,
arresting the 10 people. Police dogs were deployed to help maintain
security.
	   Shortly before midnight, riot police cordoned off the downtown
area, though local youths regrouped in some spots.
	   Meanwhile, an English soccer fan was jailed for four months on
Monday for throwing beer cans at police after England's World Cup
match against Tunisia.
	   Anthony Winston, a 19-year-old from London, was picked up by
British police in Lens, northern France, which was the venue for
England's match last Friday against Colombia.
	   Winston admitted to a court in Bethune, northern France, that he
threw the cans. But he said he was aiming at Tunisian fans who he
said had provoked the English contingent, police said.
	   Several hundred Englishmen fought running street battles on June
15 in Marseille, southeastern France, with French-Tunisian youths
and police, leaving scores injured.
	   Security has been beefed up considerably at England matches.
Authorities fear England's match against Argentina on Tuesday in
Saint-Etienne could also be a flashpoint for hooligans from both
countries.
	   There are also security worries over matches involving Germany,
as a result of rioting after Germany's match in Lens against
Yugoslavia, which left a policeman in a coma.
	   But officials, who deployed 2,000 police in Montpellier, said no
problems were reported Thursday after Germany's match against
Mexico.
	   As a precaution, Montpellier's bars were ordered to close Monday
and supermarkets were not allowed to sell alcohol. At one downtown
supermarket, shelves stocking alcohol were covered in plastic
sheets.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Researchers have found a way to produce
boundless numbers of embryonic cow cells in the laboratory, a step
that could one day give doctors a large and reliable supply of
animal tissue for use in transplants.
	   Currently, doctors are transplanting human or animal fetal
tissue into people in experimental attempts to treat diseases such
as Parkinson's, Huntington's and diabetes. But the tissue comes
straight from humans or animals.

Howard evades early election with deal on Aboriginal land rights 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates expected
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Trailing badly in opinion polls,
Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday avoided calling an early
election by apparently reaching a deal on an Aboriginal land rights
bill deadlocked in the Senate.
	   The bill, which has angered the country's 386,000 Aborigines, is
still being negotiated with Tasmanian independent Sen. Brian
Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the upper house.
	   But Harradine told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that a
compromise was reached in principle, and the details were being
ironed out.
	   ``All things are practically settled except there's a few dead
cats being thrown in into the ring at the moment,'' Harradine told
the domestic news agency Australia Associated Press.
	   No details of the compromise were disclosed yet.
	   Howard declined to confirm the deal and said he would have
further meetings with Harradine, and had nothing to announce yet.
But he said he had ``good news'' for his party.
	   Howard's plan to restrict native title rights on government
lands leased to farmers, ranchers and miners, recognized by the
country's most powerful judicial body, the High Court, had been
blocked by the Senate.
	   He has been planning to break that stalemate by taking both
houses of Parliament to an early election in a procedure called a
double dissolution.
	   With Parliament due to go into recess this week, that would have
meant calling the election within days and holding it in August.
	   That would have been political suicide for Howard, according to
a new public opinion poll published Tuesday in The Australian
newspaper.
	   The Newspoll survey showed the opposition Labor Party poised to
win back government after conservative support slumped to the
lowest on record in its term of office, at 34 percent.
	   That gives Labor its biggest lead under Kim Beazley and its
biggest lead over the coalition since just before Alexander Downer
was removed as leader, the paper said.
	   ``The government has dropped from an election-winning lead of 7
percentage points to trail by an election-losing 11 points in six
weeks that have been dominated by One Nation's campaign and
electoral success in Queensland,'' the paper said.
	   Conservative voters appeared to be continuing to defect to
Pauline Hanson's new right-wing, populist One Nation Party, as they
did in the Queensland state election in June.
	   That split the conservative vote in Queensland and resulted in
the opposition Labor Party capturing the government there.
	   The Newspoll, taken last weekend, showed that at 45 percent,
Labor is back to its highest level of support since the March 1996
election and One Nation's 13 percent is a new national high, The
Australian said.
	   The margin of error was not provided, but Newspoll's results
usually have a plus-or-minus margin of 2 to 3 percent.

Guyana opposition defies march ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Former President Desmond Hoyte led
thousands of opposition protesters on a march through Guyana's
capital Monday, defying a government ban on the demonstration
prompted by a week of political violence.
	   Rioting by Hoyte's followers injured several people and closed
downtown businesses last week. Police are still investigating a
finance ministry firebombing.
	   Fearing more violence, the government enied permission for
Monday's ``March of Defiance.'' But police kept a low profile as
Hoyte led a peaceful march of more than 7,000 people.
	   Hoyte's People's National Congress contends President Janet
Jagan won Dec. 15 elections through fraud. Hoyte also says his
party followers are discriminated against by officials from the
ruling People's Progressive Party.
	   The dispute has racial overtones. Hoyte's party members are
mostly Afro-Guyanese, while Jagan's People's Progressive Party is
backed mainly by Indo-Guyanese.
	   ``These protests will not be stopped. These protests will be
intensified,'' Hoyte told cheering supporters.
	   Another protest was scheduled for Tuesday.
	   Jagan, widow of the late President Cheddi Jagan, has rejected
opposition demands that she step down. Two international audits
concluded the elections were fair, and her victory was quickly
recognized by the United States, Britain and Canada.
	   Hoyte, who was president from 1985-1992, announced he will meet
with Caribbean leaders at a Caribbean Community summit in St. Lucia
this week.

category codes:
	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Under a hail of shells, thousands
of villagers fled into the woods as Serb forces battled to regain
control of a Kosovo mining village captured by ethnic Albanian
separatists. More than 8,000 people fled their homes in Belacevac
and the neighboring village of Hade, as government forces steadily
attacked the area from three sides Monday. Belacevac, 10 kilometers
(six miles) west of the capital, Pristina, has an open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which in turn provides
electricity for most of the province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Stepping up efforts to ease strained
relations with Nigeria's military regime, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan arrived for talks with the country's new leader and
opposition activists. Annan met Monday with Nigerian-born Emeka
Anyaoku, the secretary-general of the Commonwealth, who was also in
his home country for talks with Nigerian leader Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar. The two are expected to meet Abubakar on Tuesday morning,
government spokesman David Attah said. Annan and Anyaoku are the
highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the
late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by
executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995. Annan plans to meet several pro-democracy leaders, government
officials and opposition activists, said Ahmad Fawzi, a member of
Annan's delegation. (NIGERIA)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton, turning his
attention to China's economic future, pursued his dialogue with the
Chinese people in a quintessential American form of communication:
a radio talk show. The president's message was that the dynamic
forces of change propelling the booming economy in Shanghai,
China's high-rise financial capital, can spread prosperity
throughout China. ``This new century can be the dawn of a new
China,'' Clinton said in an address to university students in
Beijing before flying to Shanghai on Monday. He urged political
reforms in this communist country and then was challenged _
pointedly but politely _ by students about America's own human
rights record, arm sales to Taiwan and U.S. perceptions of China.
Clinton denied the widespread suspicion here that the United States
is trying to contain China. ``I'm not hiding another design behind
a smile,'' he said. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Clinging to its principle of
``no surrender,'' Northern Ireland's Orange Order vowed to defy a
ban on its march through the Catholic section of Portadown,
embittered birthplace of the stubborn Protestant organization. The
group's threat Monday provides a dangerous rallying point for the
untold tens of thousands of Protestants opposed to the compromises
that Northern Ireland's peace process is forcing upon them. The
Orangemen will face a certain blockade of British soldiers, riot
police and armored cars if they try to march Sunday from the
Drumcree Anglican church past the Catholic residences of Garvaghy
Road. The showdown has sparked violence across Northern Ireland
during the past two summers and has caused hundreds of casualties
and millions of dollars in damage. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former action movie
star who transformed his box-office appeal into a successful
political career, begins on Tuesday what he says will be his
greatest performance _ as president of the Philippines. And Estrada
is hopeful the parts he played in more than 100 movies will help in
his newest role. Estrada, who will be inaugurated at a historic
church, gained a devoted following among the country's many poor as
a movie star portraying tough guys who stood up to injustice.

Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The S-and-P 500 set another record and the Dow
industrials rose just shy of 9,000 Monday as the push into popular
blue-chip names continued with the second quarter winding down. The
Dow rose 52 points to 8,997, nearly posting its first close above
9,000 since June 9. An early afternoon gain of 108 points had put
the blue-chip barometer within 160 points of May 13's record close
of 9,211.84. The Standard -and- Poor's 500 closed at a new high for
the third time in four sessions. The red-hot Nasdaq composite index
posted another sharp gain as the resurgent technology group
continued a powerful two-week rebound. Much like last week's rally,
Monday's advance was dominated by household names that many money
managers want to show in their shareholder reports for the second
quarter, which ends Tuesday. Among the Dow 30, for example, Disney,
Wal-Mart Stores, Procter -and- Gamble, General Electric, IBM and
Merck posted sizable gains. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks and government bonds tumbled again
Monday while parliament worked on a dozen economic measures aimed
at digging Russia out of its financial crisis. President Boris
Yeltsin urged the Communist-dominated parliament to swiftly approve
the government's austerity plan. But the Communists in the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, generally want more
government spending, not less, and may be reluctant to support
Yeltsin's proposals. The austerity plan, outlined by Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko earlier this month, focuses on Russia's
complicated and outdated tax system. The new plan has won praise
from the International Monetary Fund, which is considering a new
loan to Russia. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe's Airbus Industrie is close to breaking
Boeing's grip on sales to British Airways, potentially a major step
in an intense battle over the world's commercial jetliner market,
an industry source said Monday. Several U.S., British and French
newspapers reported in the past two days that Airbus was about to
clinch a deal to sell as many as 100 jets to British Airways for
dlrs 3.8 billion. Up to now, British Airways had never bought an
Airbus, with more than two-thirds of its 300-plane fleet made by
the Seattle-based Boeing. An industry source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Airbus was close to reaching agreement for 60-70
firm orders plus optional orders. The planes would partially
replace British Airways' fleet of aging 737s with the Airbus A320
family, he said. (AIRBUS-BRITISH AIRWAYS)
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Compaq Computer Corp. on Monday detailed where it
would trim 5,000 manufacturing jobs worldwide, including 1,000 at
its Houston headquarters. The cuts come as Compaq restructures
after acquiring Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers.
Except for the Houston cuts, most of the restructuring affects
plants overseas. Monday's announcement details layoffs first
announced on June 12 after Digital shareholders approved Compaq's
dlrs 9 billion purchase of the Maynard, Massachusetts-based
computer maker after 42 years of independence. The acquisition made
Compaq the world's second-largest computer maker behind IBM. The
Digital deal followed Compaq's 1997 purchase of Tandem Computers, a
maker of big business computers based in Cupertino, California, for
dlrs 3 billion. (US-COMPAQ LAYOFFS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In its closely watched quarterly report, the Bank
of Japan said Monday that corporate sentiment has deteriorated to
its worst level in four years, with most companies saying they have
seen economic conditions worsen over the quarter. The survey showed
much of corporate Japan remains worried over anemic growth at home
and the prospects for recovery in other Asian nations hit by a
financial crisis. The report's ``business condition diffusion
index'' fell to minus 38 in June from minus 31 in the previous
quarter. The negative number means more major manufacturers saw
conditions worsen than saw conditions improve. Plagued by slumping
consumer demand and problems in its banking system, Japan is in its
worst recession since the end of World War II. Politicians have
tried to restore confidence, both at home and overseas, by
promising to speed up measures to resolve bank bad-loan problems.
(JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Negotiations continued Monday in the slow effort
to end two crippling parts plant strikes _ the longest labor
dispute between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers in
28 years. GM, meanwhile, has been contacting independent suppliers
in hopes of finding alternative parts sources that could help it
resume production of some vehicles. Talks resumed at the plants in
Flint, Michigan, where about 9,200 workers are on strike over a
variety of local contract issues. Shop Chairman Norwood Jewell of
UAW Local 659, which represents the Flint Metal Center stamping
plant, said there was no progress in weekend talks. (US-GM-STRIKES)

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The U.S. National Organization for Women is
taking a swing at Mike Tyson.
	   The female rights group's Southern Nevada chapter launched a
campaign Monday to block his effort to regain his boxing license
from the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   Tyson was banned from the ring last year after biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during a title bout. He can apply for
reinstatement on July 9.
	   In a letter to chapters in all 50 states, Southern Nevada NOW
President Anne Golonka urged members to contact the commission and
express outrage at the prospect of Tyson, a convicted rapist,
returning to the ring.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The ``King of Pop'' says he's still
interested in building a theme park in Poland's capital.
	   Michael Jackson has extended for a year his letter of intent to
build a dlrs 500 million amusement park in Warsaw.
	   ``Michael is not backing out from plans to build a theme park in
Poland,'' Marek Kwiatkowski, an art historian who represents
Jackson's interests in Poland, said Monday.
	   City officials in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, announced last week
that Jackson wants to build an dlrs 800 million theme park there,
though no site has been chosen.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joey Bishop, the last surviving member of the
Rat Pack _ which dominated U.S. television, nightclubs and movies
for a decade _ says this stuff you've been hearing about the guys
being drunken skirt-chasers is all wrong.
	   Bishop, 80, said in this week's Time magazine that he never saw
Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. or Peter Lawford drunk
during performances.
	   ``That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to
chase broads? They had to chase 'em away!'' the comic said from his
home in Newport Beach, California.
	   Bishop said the Rat Pack's renewed cultural currency _ the
books, tributes and an upcoming television movie _ has more to do
with money than with a truthful account of the Pack's place in the
early 1960s.
	   ``I don't understand this searching for things that weren't
there,'' he said. ``It's like a hunger.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Queen Beatrix's father celebrated
his 87th birthday as did most of his subjects _ by cheering the
Dutch soccer team.
	   Prince Bernhard planned to spend a low-key, laid back birthday
at home ``and enjoy himself by watching the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match on television'' Monday evening, the royal family announced.
	   The popular German-born prince isn't the only member of the
Dutch family to be transfixed by the fortunes of the Dutch squad,
who play Yugoslavia in Toulouse, France. His grandson, Crown Prince
Willem Alexander, was in the stands when the team, known as the
Orangemen, drew with Mexico last week.
	   Bernhard, the husband of former Queen Juliana, remains in
generally good health despite surgery last year on an enlarged
prostate.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Actor Sylvester Stallone and wife, Jennifer
Flavin, are the parents of another girl.
	   ``This is a great day for our family,'' Stallone said Monday in
announcing the birth of Sistine Rose, who weighed 7 pounds, 6
ounces. The baby was born Saturday at a Los Angeles-area hospital.
	   The couple, who wed in 1997, already have a 22-month-old
daughter, Sophia Rose, who underwent surgery last fall to repair a
hole in her heart. Stallone publicist Paul Bloch said Sistine Rose
is healthy.
	   Last July, Miss Flavin had a miscarriage.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Eddie Money, the former New York City cop who
scored hits with the songs ``Two Tickets to Paradise'' and ``Baby
Hold On,'' was arrested for allegedly belting someone outside an
apartment.
	   The 49-year-old rock star got into the scuffle Sunday evening,
Sgt. Christopher Vasquez said.
	   ``I don't know the particulars, what he was fighting over or
anything else,'' Vasquez said.
	   The officer didn't know if the other person was a man or a
woman.
	   Money was arrested on suspicion of battery and released early
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Stepping up efforts to ease strained
relations with Nigeria's military regime, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has arrived for talks with the country's new leader and
opposition activists.
	   Annan met Monday with Nigerian-born Emeka Anyaoku, the
secretary-general of the Commonwealth, who was also in his home
country for talks with Nigerian leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The two are expected to meet Abubakar on Tuesday morning,
government spokesman David Attah said.
	   Annan and Anyaoku are the highest-profile international
diplomats to visit Nigeria since the late military ruler Gen. Sani
Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing leading playwright
and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in November 1995.
	   Annan plans to meet several pro-democracy leaders, government
officials and opposition activists, said Ahmad Fawzi, a member of
Annan's delegation.
	   Annan was encouraged by the ``rapid steps'' taken by the
Nigerian general to ``affirm a transition to democratic and
civilian rule,'' Fawzi said.
	   ``He hopes that all Nigerians will work together in a spirit of
cooperation to ensure democracy. It will require ... flexibility
and wisdom, and he trusts these qualities will not be lacking,''
the U.N. official said.
	   Abubakar has raised expectations for democratic reforms by
releasing more than 40 political prisoners. The country's most
prominent detainee, the presumed winner of the presidential 1993
election, Moshood Abiola, remains behind bars, however.
	   Abacha, who took power following a coup in 1993, annulled the
results of the election. He died of heart failure on June 8 and was
succeeded by Abubakar.
	   Anyaoku was also upbeat about the prospects for returning
Nigeria to the international fold after years of being a pariah
under Abacha.
	   ``My being here is the beginning of the process of reintegrating
Nigeria into the international community,'' Anyaoku told reporters
after arriving late Sunday. ``The whole Commonwealth and the
international community has welcomed the steps so far taken by the
new leader and our hope is that this is just the beginning.''
	   The Commonwealth, a 54-nation organization comprising Britain
and its former colonies, suspended Nigeria from its ranks after
Saro-Wiwa was executed.

Serena Williams goes out with minor injury; Venus stays in AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon has finally split the
Williams sisters.
	   Venus stayed in with a victory, but Serena went out Monday when
she retired with a calf injury against Spain's little-known
Virginia Ruano-Pascual.
	   But their cocky attitudes stayed the same _ win, lose or retire.
Especially Serena's.
	   After dropping the first set 7-5 to Ruano-Pascual _ and being
down 4-1 in the second _ she quit with a left-calf injury that she
termed ``not serious... maybe just a little tight.''
	   ``I think at the moment in time, I could have carried on if I
wanted to, but I have to think about the future,'' said the
16-year-old American, who has been criticized by other players for
failing to show them respect.
	   ``I don't want to hurt myself over something silly and be out
for maybe two months.''
	   ``I just think she (Ruano-Pascual) played a pretty good day
today,'' she went on. ``She probably wanted to do well. But ... if
I was in better shape, it wouldn't have been happening at all.''
	   ``I had all the expectation for this Wimbledon. I expected to go
all the way. ... I definitely see myself as one of the champions.''
	   Ruano-Pascual, who _ by luck of the draw _ now faces Venus
Williams in the fourth round, found those words hard to digest.
	   ``Everyone says she's going to be the new No. 1 in the world,
but I think she has to change her attitude,'' the 24-year-old
Spaniard said. ``A player shouldn't go off the court in the
position she was without shaking hands.''
	   ``I forgot,'' Serena Williams said. ``I never really had to quit
during a match. I didn't even realize.''
	   Now the family burden falls to Venus, who shares the power game
and hair beads with her younger sister and would have played her in
the fourth round if Serena had won.
	   ``I have to go on and just make sure that I ... do what Serena
didn't do today,'' 18-year-old Venus said after a 6-3, 6-4 win over
fellow American Chanda Rubin to reach the final 16 after losing
last year in the first round.
	   ``I think I'm definitely at the point where I can do this now,''
she added. ``Last year I was not. This year, things are
different.''
	   Venus even moved to differentiate herself slightly from her
sister.
	   ``I think that people want to put us together as the Williams
sisters,'' she said. ``I think we're two very separate people with
different hearts and different minds.''
	   ``So it's not just the Williams sisters, it's Venus and Serena
... and vice versa.
	   Now, it's just Venus.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces battled to regain
control of a Kosovo mining village captured by ethnic Albanian
separatists, forcing thousands of villagers to flee into the woods
under a hail of shells.
	   More than 8,000 people left their homes in the southern town of
Belacevac and the neighboring village of Hade, as government forces
steadily attacked the area from three sides Monday. Villagers said
they expected the Serbs to take the area.
	   Police and heavily armed government forces began their attack
early Monday, and by evening had advanced within 200 meters (yards)
of Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina.
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics in
what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which in turn provides
electricity for most of Kosovo.
	   Monday's fighting came as international envoys urged the two
sides to seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders
to try to find a solution to the conflict, while another U.S.
diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in negotiations for peace in the region.
	   Meeting in Luxembourg, the E.U. foreign ministers issued a
statement urging ``all those in a leadership role in the Kosovar
Albanian community'' to commit to dialogue to resolve Kosovo's
problems.
	   In the hills around Belacevac on Monday, Serb police snipers
were posted, firing on men running water and biscuits to KLA
fighters camped in the woods surrounding the villages.
	   Albanian sources claimed the area was completely sealed off and
that government forces also attacked civilians in surrounding
villages, killing an 8-year-old child and trapping an unknown
number of villagers in their homes. Others fled into the forests
surrounding the village, where they were preparing to camp for the
night.
	   The Serbs' Media Center said armed Albanians had seized control
of the mine's administrative buildings and were firing at police,
who fought back with tear gas.
	   Earlier Monday, Albanian sources said armed Serb civilians were
backing up regular Serbian forces targeting the coal mine and other
rebel positions in nearby villages. Tanks were positioned at
Slatina military airport, just east of Belacevac, they said.
	   Another 8-year-old child was reported wounded Monday by gunfire
in Lismir, a village near Obilic.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serb security forces launched an offensive Feb. 28 to
try to halt growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims up to 40 percent of Kosovo. It increasingly is
supported by the ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Tensions were still high Monday at Kijevo _ Kosovo's other main
hot spot _ with rebels bracing for a new attack after Yugoslav
helicopters strafed them over the weekend.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen were estimated to be
in the village, cut off from supplies and other support by a ring
of Albanian fighters. A child and an adult _ both apparently ethnic
Albanians _ were reported killed in the region Sunday.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo and connects Pristina and the main city of
Pec.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Monday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged swift international steps to
prevent a ``second Bosnia'' in Kosovo, but reiterated that the U.N.
Security Council must approve any military action.
	   The United States says the Security Council's blessing is not
needed for NATO intervention, but Russia disagrees.

Henman leads way into men's quarters 1100 GMT on Centre Court and Court 1 AP Sports Writer

By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Henmania lives.
	   For the third straight year, Tim Henman has reached the
Wimbledon quarterfinals, raising Britain's hopes of having its
first male champion since 1936.
	   Feeding off the frenzied support of the Centre Court crowd, the
12th-seeded Henman downed U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter of
Australia 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``To walk out on a court when it was full as that, it gives you
a buzz,'' Henman said. ``I think I've shown in the past and I've
shown again that I do respond to that.''
	   Henman described Monday's win as ``one of the best, if not the
best'' victory of his career. With so much focus on the England
soccer team's progress at the World Cup, he said he felt less
pressure than ever before.
	   ``I do feel very, very relaxed about the whole situation,''
Henman said. ``I surprised myself a little bit, how relaxed I was
today.''
	   Rafter, the No. 6 seed, received treatment for a lower back
problem in the fourth set and said he was playing at ``90
percent.''
	   Still, Rafter was holding his own in the fourth set and earned a
break point. But Henman then served a second-serve ace down the
middle to save the break point and won four straight games to close
out the match.
	   ``That's an instinct,'' he said of the ace. ``I went for it, and
hit the line and that was probably the most important second serve
of the match.''
	   Henman next faces No. 3 Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion
who downed John van Lottum in straight sets. Korda strained his
left Achilles tendon in the third set but said he plans to play
Wednesday.
	   ``If it's going to be nice weather, I'll be there,'' he said.
	   Based on the weather so far, that's no certainty. Monday was the
fifth day affected by rain delays and more showers were forecast.
	   Henman, who beat Korda in their last meeting in Key Biscayne
this spring, said the left-handed Czech is ``probably one of the
most dangerous players'' in the draw.
	   ``He can hit winners from all over the court,'' Henman said.
	   The same goes for Goran Ivanisevic, who served 44 aces in his
third-round win over Daniel Vacek.
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, came into this year's
tournament as a forgotten man after a terrible slump that saw him
win only one match in his last five Grand Slams.
	   But the 14th-seed Croatian, scheduled to face Todd Martin in the
fourth round, believes he may be on the verge of a breakthrough
victory in a major.
	   ``It was not easy for me, all this talking, `He's gone, and he's
never going to be back again,''' Ivanisevic said. ``But every time
when I am on that court, I know I can beat anybody. My matches are
like horror thrillers. You cannot expect anything. I made the
movie, but I don't know the end.''
	   Pete Sampras, meanwhile, faced a fourth-round match Tuesday
against French qualifier Sebastian Grosjean. Sampras served 29 aces
in a straight-set win over Thomas Enqvist, while Grosjean ousted
No. 16 Felix Mantilla.
	   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and No. 9 seed, was due to
face Wayne Ferreira for a place in the quarters.
	   In women's play, the quarterfinalists in the bottom half of the
draw were set Monday when No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 6 Monica
Seles, No. 16 Nathalie Tauziat and Natasha Zvereva all advanced in
straight sets.
	   Seles will face Zvereva, while Davenport will play Tauziat.
	   Fourth-round matches in the upper half were scheduled Tuesday,
with No. 1 Martina Hingis, No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 5 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario and No. 7 Venus Williams all in action.
	   Tuesday had been projected as the day for a fourth-round
showdown between Williams and her 16-year-old sister Serena.
	   But Serena, citing a strained left calf muscle, retired from her
match Monday against Virginia Ruano-Pascual while trailing 7-5,
4-1.
	   Serena left the court without shaking hands with her opponent.
While Serena said it was an oversight, Ruano-Pascual was miffed.
	   ``Everyone says she's going to be the new No. 1 in the world,
but I think she has to change her attitude,'' she said.

Sampras endures longest weekend AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ What kind of a weekend was it for
four-time champion Pete Sampras?
	   His third-round match Friday with Thomas Enqvist was washed out.
	   Saturday, when the match finally began, he served aces on his
first six tosses. Then two downpours hit _ and a another after he'd
won one set 6-3 with the second at 5-5. Play called.
	   Sunday was an off-day at Wimbledon. So it ended Monday, but not
right away as rain set off another two-hour delay with the third
set at 4-4. Finally, Sampras prevailed 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3).
	   It was a long, long weekend,'' said Sampras. ``It's an emotional
rollercoaster. Really, you get up for playing, and you come off,
and you have a 20-minute delay. You come back, play a game. You
have yesterday off, which was kind of bizarre. So you get the highs
and lows.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNPHASED: &LR;  Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion, suggested the
other day that Sampras entered Wimbledon playing like the
10th-ranked player in the world _ not the No. 1.
	   Sampras shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes when he was
asked about it Monday after reaching the fourth round.
	   ``That stuff really doesn't phase me,'' Sampras said. ``I know
my capabilities. I know how I'm playing this week.''
	   ___
	   SING IT, MAC: &LR;  John McEnroe, keep your day job.
	   After doing an interview to entertain the Centre Court during a
rain delay Monday, McEnroe broke into a brief, impromptu rendition
of the Star Spangled Banner.
	   ``O-o say can you see,'' he sang out, his voice tailing off like
a weak serve in a tough wind.
	   A three-time Wimbledon singles champion who also fancies himself
as a singer, McEnroe also picked Sampras to win his fifth title.
	   ``He's one of the greatest players in his sport,'' McEnroe said.
``He's had incredible results here the last five years _ only one
loss. That's almost Borg like. For Pete, Wimbledon is where he's
most comfortable.''
	   Asked about his job with the American TV network NBC, McEnroe
said:
	   ``I look at it like the cake has already been baked and we as
commentators can add a little bit of icing to it, a little bit of
flavor to the match. Plus it beats the hell out of working for a
living.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   QUOTE ACE: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic, who served a record 46 aces last
year at Wimbledon and lost, served 44 on Monday and won in four
sets over Daniel Vacek to reach the fourth round. The quotable
Croatian also double faulted 15 times.
	   ``My matches are like horror thrillers and you cannot expect
anything,'' said Ivanisevic, twice a Wimbledon runner-up. ``It's
like a movie. I make the movie, but I don't know the end. That's
it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNSUNG: &LR;  Americans Lindsay Davenport, seeded No. 2, and Monica
Seles _ the sixth seed _ are into the quarterfinals, but has anyone
noticed?
	   That seems to suit them both, particularly Seles who hasn't been
the same since she was stabbed in April 1993 during at change-over
in a match in Germany. She's also coming off the death earlier this
month of her father, Karolj.
	   ``I think when I look back each time in 1996 and 1997, by far
the toughest losses are at Wimbledon,'' said Seles, a surprise
runner-up at the French Open.
	   ``But I'm very happy I'm here, and I'm not just going to be
happy reaching the quarterfinals,'' she added.
	   Seles was the runner-up in '92 and reached the quarterfinals the
only other time in 1990.
	   Davenport was a semifinalist last year, her best at Wimbledon.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Despite rain five of the first seven days,
chief referee Alan Mills says this year is better than last.
	   ``This year's Wimbledon is by no means as bad as last year,
which was my worst,'' Mills said. ``In any case, I'm too tired at
night to have nightmares. I drink coffee all day and sleep all
night.''
	   Robert Philip, writing in The Daily Telegraph, welcomed the
sulking, surly personality of world No. 2 Marcelo Rios, ousted in
the first round.
	   ``He is part Jimmy Connors, who was abandoned by wolves at birth
and raised by his parents, and part John McEnroe. Remember him?
When Mad Mac drove through a safari park, the animals rolled up
their windows.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Episcopalian clergy and lay workers
from 22 countries will debate and propose solutions to the problem
of poverty in Latin America during a conference this week.
	   ``Poverty is the principal problem weighing down Latin America
and an exit must be sought through human solidarity,'' said
Honduran Bishop Oscar Andres Rodriguez, president of the Latin
American Episcopal Council.
	   The bishop said foreign debt is pushing Latin Americans into
worsening poverty. Estimating that Latin American countries owe
more than dlrs 600 billion, he said one goal of the conference will
be to call on industrialized countries to stimulate growth in Latin
America.
	   The three-day conference, which opens Tuesday, is to be attended
by 15 bishops as well as officials from the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development
Bank.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former coup leader Hugo Chavez is
maintaining his lead in opinion polls for December's presidential
race, according to a poll published Monday.
	   Chavez received 27 percent of the vote from respondents,
followed by former Miss Universe and local Mayor Irene Saez with 16
percent. Former state governor Henrique Salas Romer was third with
6 percent.
	   Consultores 21 polling company questioned 1,500 people in 66
cities and towns during May and June. The margin of error was 2.28
percentage points in the poll, which was published in El Nacional
newspaper.
	   Chavez, a former Army paratrooper who led a failed coup attempt
in 1992, was ranked well behind other candidates as recently as
January. But he has surged in polls, capitalizing on Venezuelans'
anger over political corruption and mismanagement.
	   The same poll gave President Rafael Caldera a 74 percent
negative rating.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The party of disgraced former President
Abdala Bucaram has withdrawn its support for banana tycoon Alvaro
Noboa, one of two candidates in Ecuador's presidential election, a
party official said Monday.
	   Noboa, scion of Ecuador's richest family, trails Quito's
centrist Mayor Jamil Mahuad in the runup to the second round of
voting on July 12.
	   Noboa had the backing of the former president's Roldosista
party, but fought to distance himself from Bucaram, who was removed
from office by Congress in February 1997 for ``mental incapacity.''
	   ``Noboa has lost the trust of our supreme leader, Abdala
Bucaram, and his Roldosista party,'' Roldosista Congressman
Fernando Rosero said in a news conference.
	   Rosero said the party dropped its support for Noboa after he
said he wanted to go it alone in the next round of voting, trying
to distance himself from Bucaram.
	   Prior to the May 31 first round of voting, in which Noboa placed
second to Mahuad, Bucaram repeatedly criticized the Quito mayor in
radio and television broadcasts from Panama, where he lives in
exile.
	   Noboa, an electoral newcomer, directed the Central Bank during
Bucaram's six-month-long government.
	   Bucaram, known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for his
eccentric behavior, was ousted amid massive street protests and
corruption charges, but has vowed to return to Ecuadorean politics.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, who
was named by Congress to replace Bucaram.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ U.S. investigators have detected
more than 100 clandestine landing strips in rural Honduras which
could be used by international drug traffickers, the Honduran
government said Monday.
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, which located the runways this
year, is working with Honduran officials to identify planes using
the landing strips for drug shipments, the government said in a
statement.
	   The unauthorized runways were located mainly on ranches and
farms in 12 of the small Central American country's 18 provinces.
Some were in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach.
	   The government said Honduras is used as a stopping point by
traffickers shipping drugs from South American to the United States
and Europe.

World Cup: Davids' strike sends Dutch into last eight; Mijatovic distraught 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Yugoslav star striker Predrag Mijatovic
was shattered. Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar said he couldn't
be happier.
	   Mijatovic, who scored the only goal in May's European Champions
Cup final to give Real Madrid the title over Juventus, drove a
penalty kick high into the crossbar to waste Yugoslavia's best
chance at a victory against the Netherlands at the World Cup on
Monday.
	   Edgar Davids sent a 25-yard shot home in the second minute of
second-half injury time to lift the Netherlands into the
quarterfinals with a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia.
	   The penalty kick was awarded in the 51st minute with the score
1-1.
	   ``This is the worst moment in my career,'' Mijatovic said. ``The
Dutch goalie is tall, so I decided to shoot high and under the bar.
It didn't work. I'm sad for my teammates.''
	   Van der Sar said he got instructions from his coach, Guus
Hiddink, that Mijatovic always waits before kicking a penalty to
see where a goalie is going to dive. Hiddink trained Mijatovic in
Valencia before the Yugoslav striker moved to Real Madrid two
seasons ago.
	   ``So I waited a bit longer before making a move,'' Van der Sar
said. ``I think this put Mijatovic off. He lost concentration.
	   ``I couldn't be happier. Who knows what would have happened at
the end if the Yugoslavs took the lead.''
	   It was the first missed penalty kick in France 98.
	   The victory put the Dutch in a round-of-eight meeting Saturday
in Marseille with the winner of today's Argentina-England match.
	   Dennis Bergkamp broke through the defensively determined
Yugoslavs in the 38th minute, giving him 35 goals in a Dutch
uniform and tying him with Faas Wilkes of the 1940s and '50s for
the Netherlands' career lead.
	   Bergkamp ran to a long ball out of the back from Dutch captain
and defender Frank de Boer, settling it as Yugoslav defender Zoran
Mirkovic fell. He blasted a shot from 15 yards that Yugoslav
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj managed to get his hands to, but couldn't
stop from squirting through and dribbling inside the left post.
	   The Yugoslavs came out quickly in the second half, drawing even
in the 49th minute. Dragan Stojkovic lofted a free kick from just
outside the left side of the penalty area onto the head of defender
Slobodan Komljenovic, who drove the ball just inside the far post
for his second goal of the tournament.
	   ``We lost all the duels in the first half. The Dutch were always
one step ahead of us,'' Komljenovic said. ``In the second half, our
game picked up.
	   ``If Mijatovic scored that penalty and we took the lead, it
would have been a completely different game for us. But we have to
be fair, the Dutch are a great team and they deserved to win.''

Germany, Netherlands come through in the clutch AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Both favorites won. Both by 2-1. That doesn't come
anywhere close to telling the story.
	   The story was in the face of Edgar Davids, running toward a sea
of orange in the stands, his left index finger thrust in the air as
he celebrated his first goal for his country, a second-half injury
time game-winner that lifted the Netherlands into the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I put all of myself into the final shot, and I scored,'' said
the 25-year-old midfielder, breaking a two-year media silence to
discuss the 25-meter blast that eliminated Yugoslavia in the 92nd
minute.
	   The story was the sight of Germany's aging veterans, sprawled on
the grass, gasping for air, their tired legs cramping in 30-plus
degree Celsius (90-plus Fahrenheit) heat. They didn't just win:
They survived a heart-stopping scare, needing two goals in the
final 15 minutes to beat Mexico.
	   ``I wouldn't want to go through such a game every day,'' German
coach Berti Vogts said. ``My team went through 90 minutes of
torture. We won with our fighting spirit. They found the strength
to win a game that was nearly lost.''
	   The back-to-back thrillers left the quarterfinals bracket with
two empty places, those to be decided Tuesday when Romania played
Croatia at Bordeaux and England sought to avenge the 12-year-old
``Hand of God'' defeat in a much-anticipated match against
Argentina at Saint-Etienne.
	   In terms of cliffhanger value, those games have hard acts to
follow. On the heels of the World Cup's first ``golden goal'' _
France's sudden-death overtime victory over Paraguay on Sunday _
came not only Germany's comeback but also the Dutch survival of the
first missed penalty of France 98.
	   The crossbar was still vibrating long after Yugoslav striker
Predrag Mijatovic nailed it with a penalty kick that could have
given Yugoslavia a 2-1 lead in the 51st minute. His predecessors at
the tournament were 14-for-14 from the spot.
	   ``This is the worst moment in my career,'' Mijatovic said. ``The
Dutch goalkeeper is tall, so I decided to shoot high and under the
bar. It didn't work. I'm sad for my teammates.''
	   The Netherlands will play the Argentina-England winner in the
quarterfinals Saturday, the same day Germany faces either Romania
or Croatia.
	   European champion and three-time World Cup titlist Germany
trailed Mexico 1-0 when Juergen Klinsmann tied it in the 75th
minute. Oliver Bierhoff then outleaped defender Raul Lara to put
home a 12-meter header in the 86th to clinch the victory. It was
the third goal of the tournament for both strikers.
	   ``The way we fought in this hot weather makes us incredibly
optimistic for the next games,'' said Klinsmann, who moved into a
tie for second with Rudi Voeller on Germany's all-time scoring list
with 49 goals. ``We have tremendous fighting spirit.''
	   England has been waiting since 1986 to redress Diego Maradona's
dubious goal, the one he punched into the net in Argentina's 2-1
quarterfinal victory in Mexico. The referee never saw it.
	   ``That feeling of injustice has stayed with us a long time,''
said England coach Glenn Hoddle, who played in that match. ``We
have got a chance of readdressing that balance and turning that
result round and getting it out of our system.''
	   Ariel Ortega, however, hopes to emulate Maradona's goal _ not
the ``Hand of God'' one, but the one known as ``Diego's Wonder'' in
which the famous No. 10 dribbled more than half the length of the
field and past half a dozen English defenders for Argentina's
second goal.
	   ``I will try to score a goal like Maradona,'' Ortega said.
``Say, if I dribble past one, two English, I will try to keep
going.''
	   The match a high-risk affair as thousands of ticketless English
fans _ including some of the hooligans who wreaked havoc two weeks
ago in Marseille _ have converged on Saint-Etienne.
	   Monday night, North African French youths clashed with English
fans at an outdoor showing the Netherlands-Yugoslavia game. At
least 10 people were arrested _ nine French and one English _ said
police, who have a reinforced 1,600-member force in the city.
	   Also Monday, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced the
resignation of coach Steve Sampson, who was severely criticized by
his players after the United States lost all three of its games and
finished last of the tournament's 32 teams.
	   ``We were naive to think an inexperienced coach would see the
value of experienced players,'' forward Eric Wynalda said of the
first American coach to lead a U.S. team at a World Cup. ``We
should never let this happen again.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Sports Minister Tony Banks said he would
encourage an alcohol ban in Saint-Etienne before Tuesday's World
Cup match between England and Argentina.
	   But he said he could not criticize a decision by French
authorities not to restrict alcohol sales in the buildup to the
crucial knockout match.
	   During question time Monday in the House of Commons, Banks said
even the prospect of a ban _ like the total ban in Lens for
England's match against Colombia _ was a sad comment on the
minority of English fans who cannot mix football with drink.
	   ``I can't join the condemnation of decisions that might have
been taken in Saint-Etienne with regard to drinking,'' he said.
``It was not the fault of people in France that some England fans
could simply not hold their drink.''
	   Although alcohol will be sold, the match will not be shown on a
big screen in one of the city's main squares.
	   The only curbs on alcohol sales will be that bars will close at
11 p.m. both Monday and Tuesday, and that no alcohol will be sold
around the stadium area.

	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian captain Paolo Maldini, an auto
racing fan, says Italy is looking forward to imitating Ferrari's
triumph in France.
	   The red cars of the Italian team, driven by Michael Schumacher
and Eddie Irvine, finished first and second in Sunday's French
Grand Prix Formula One race at Magny-Cours.
	   ``Like the Ferraris, Italy wants to make it to the finish line,
the World Cup final in France,'' Maldini said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Netherlands improved from 6-1 to 5-1 on the
World Cup books of British bookmaker Ladbrokes after Monday night's
2-1 second-round victory over Yugoslavia.
	   Brazil remains the 9-4 favorite, but the Dutch have tied France
as second-favorite. Argentina and Italy follow at 6-1.
	   Germany is next at 7-1, then come England (10-1), Croatia
(25-1), Romania (25-1) and Denmark (33-1).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ England is the fairest one of all in this World
Cup.
	   The English team leads the competition for the FIFA Fair Play
Award, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   The FIFA Fair Play Committee monitors six criteria to judge the
teams' fair play performance. Only teams that play at least four
matches are eligible to win the contest.
	   The committee looks at the numbers of red and yellow cards,
attractive and attacking play, respect for the opponent and the
referees, behavior of the team officials and the conduct of fans at
matches.
	   Norway and Yugoslavia are tied for second place.
	   Since the Fair Play Award was set up in 1978, Brazil has won it
three times (1982, 1986 and 1994). England won in 1990 and
Argentina in 1978.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri,
the pair of strikers likely to lead Italy's attack in Friday's
quarterfinal match against France, combined for five goals in an
intrasquad match on a shortened field Monday.
	   Midfielder Sandro Cois, who's nursing a bruised heel, was
rested.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexicans were somewhat subdued in defeat
after the national soccer team was eliminated from the World Cup
with a 2-1 loss Monday to Germany.
	   Although police said two people were seriously injured in a
firecracker explosion, dozens more suffered minor injuries and 53
people were arrested, the crowds in Mexico City were much tamer
than the bottle-throwing mobs that turned out after Mexico's
previous World Cup matches.
	   More than 10,000 people watched the game on a giant-screen
television in the city's main plaza, the Zocalo. But even after
watching Mexico blow a 1-0 lead, the crowd found plenty to
celebrate.
	   Few had expected Mexico to advance to the World Cup's second
round and there was little disgrace in losing to Germany, one of
the best teams.

World Cup: Germany fights, fights and fights to edge Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ At the end of a very hot afternoon,
the aging victors lay sprawled on the grass, gasping for air, their
tired legs cramping.
	   Probably the greatest asset of the German team is its tremendous
fighting spirit. Of course, it also has Juergen Klinsmann and
Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Klinsmann and Bierhoff combined for two late goals and the
fighting spirit carried Germany to a 2-1 victory over Mexico on
Monday and a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   ``I wouldn't want to go through such a game every day,'' said
German coach Berti Vogts. ``My team went through 90 minutes of
torture. We won with our fighting spirit. They found the strength
to win a game that was nearly lost.''
	   Bierhoff, once again, got the winner for the European champions,
connecting on a cross from substitute Ulf Kirsten to head in from
12 meters in the 86th minute.
	   ``My compliments to Mexico, but if you look over 90 minutes, I
think we deserved to win,'' said Bierhoff, who also hit the
underside of the bar in the first half. ``Mexico was dangerous in
the front but we had more chances.''
	   Germany will play either Romania or Croatia Saturday in Lyon.
	   With an average age of nearly 30 years, Germany is the oldest
team in the tournament. But it found just enough stamina in a
temperature of 33 Celsius (91F) to prevail over a gifted Mexican
team that had taken the lead less than two minutes into the second
half.
	   Luis ``El Matador'' Hernandez took Cuauhtemoc Blanco's pass in
the box and moved deftly to the right to avoid midfielder Michael
Tarnat and defender Christian Woerns before beating goalkeeper
Andreas Koepke from eight meters.
	   But Mexico, which had come back in all three of its first-round
games to reach the round of 16, couldn't hold onto its lead under
relentless pressure from the three-time World Cup champions.
	   ``We were unfortunate not to score in the first half when Oliver
hit the bar,'' Klinsmann said. ``But I wasn't afraid, I felt we had
enough will power to turn it around.''
	   ``The way we fought in this hot weather makes us incredibly
optimistic for the next games,'' said Klinsmann, who pulled even
with Rudi Voeller on Germany's all-time scoring list with 49 goals.
They share second place behind Gerd Mueller's 68.
	   ``We have tremendous fighting spirit,'' the German captain said.
	   Klinsmann and Bierhoff now have three goals each in the Cup.
	   Klinsmann's goal in the 75th minute gave Germany the shot it
needed. When midfielder Dietmar Hamann's long cross bounded between
Raul Lara's feet, Klinsmann hustled to beat goalkeeper Jorge Campos
to the ball with a sliding shot.
	   ``The way we fought back and exerted pressure even after going
down speaks for the character of this team,'' Klinsmann said.
	   Mexico went out with its head high. Its first-round victory over
South Korea was its first World Cup win in Europe.
	   ``We lost but we tried our best,'' Hernandez said. ``The people
in Mexico should believe in us. We did our outmost, we are very
proud of this performance.''

World Cup: Danes looking for another upset _ this time against Brazil AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: WILL be UPDATED after Tuesday's games
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Denmark is proving to be the upset champion of
world soccer.
	   Gaining a backdoor entrance to the 1992 European Championship
when Yugoslavia was kicked out, the Danes went home with the title,
beating hot favorite Germany in the final.
	   After ousting 1996 Olympic gold medalist Nigeria from World Cup
'98 by a surprising 4-1 score, they now face defending titlist and
four-time world champion Brazil for a place in the semifinals.
	   Another upset? Why not.
	   ``Everybody expects Brazil to win,'' said Danish striker Brian
Laudrup. ``We might be able to do it again. You never know. I think
we showed the whole football world that we can play attractive
football as well.''
	   Brazil-Denmark takes place Friday at Nantes the same day that
host France takes on three-time winner Italy at the Stade de
France.
	   Reigning European champion Germany and the Netherlands have also
made it to the last eight and will play Saturday, but they wouldn't
know their opponents until later Tuesday.
	   The Germans, who came from behind to beat Mexico 2-1 on Monday,
will play either Romania or Croatia at Lyon. The Dutch will face
England or Argentina at Marseille.
	   Romania and Croatia met at Bordeaux Tuesday and England faced
Argentina at Saint-Etienne.
	   While the France-Italy quarterfinal could go either way _ the
French with home advantage and the Italians with a wealth of World
Cup experience _ the Danes aren't expected to beat the mighty
Brazilians.
	   But that's their strongest weapon, and they like it that way.
	   They exposed Nigeria's weakest point _ the defense _ and were
2-0 up before the Olympic champion's feared strikeforce had barely
touched the ball.
	   Brazil's only weakness happens to be its defense, too. Norway
proved that in a come-from-behind 2-1 victory in Group A and the
Norwegians are no longer in the competition, beaten 1-0 by Italy in
round two.
	   The Italians look more assured as the championship goes on,
while the French struggled to put out the modest Paraguayans.
	   The host needed an extra time goal by defender Laurent Blanc _
the first sudden death ``Golden Goal'' in the history of the World
Cup _ to beat the South Americans with a penalty shootout only six
minutes away.
	   Despite scoring nine goals in three Group C games, the French
showed against Paraguay they need a scorer of the quality of
Italy's Christian Vieri or Alessandro Del Piero.
	   The tireless Youri Djorkaeff set up chance after chance but
David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede and Thierry Henry couldn't finish
the job.
	   Italy, with Vieri leading the scorers' list with five goals in
four games, has strength throughout the team. Del Piero is back to
full fitness to partner Vieri, plus the Italians have Roberto
Baggio in reserve.
	   The Germans are nowhere near their best form, but have shown
once again they refuse to be beaten. During the Group F games, they
hit back from 2-0 down to secure a 2-2 tie with Yugoslavia and
overturned Mexico's 1-0 lead with late goals from Juergen Klinsmann
and Oliver Bierhoff to win 2-1 and reach the last eight.
	   Berti Vogts' team also appears to have the easiest route to the
semifinal. Romania has never reached the World Cup semifinals while
Croatia is making its debut.
	   The prospect of facing either England or Argentina looks far
tougher for the Dutch, a World Cup losing finalist in 1974 and '78.
The Netherlands edged Yugoslavia 2-1 on Monday thanks to an
injury-time winner by Edgar Davids.
	   England reached the semifinal the last time it qualified in 1990
and has spent 32 frustrating years trying to emulate the team that
won the title in 1966. Under Glenn Hoddle, England now plays with
more imagination and has top-quality matchwinners in Alan Shearer,
David Beckham and 18-year-old Michael Owen.
	   The last time they met in a major championship, England crushed
the Dutch 4-1 at the 1996 European Championship.
	   Argentina, a two-time winner which beat the Dutch in the 1978
final, is striving to step out of the shadows of South American
rival Brazil.
	   In Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta, it has one of the
current superstars of international soccer and Ariel Ortega,
wearing the No. 10 shirt made famous by Diego Maradona, is on
course to be one of the stars of the championship.

Two new ingredients may make AIDS cocktail easier to swallow AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous.
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Two new drugs may soon offer HIV-infected people
the first easy-to-take alternative to protease inhibitors, the
landmark medicines that made AIDS a treatable disease.
	   The results of large-scale testing of these medicines were
released Monday at the 12th World AIDS Conference. They showed that
both appear to be about as effective as protease inhibitors, which
until now have been the key ingredient of the so-called AIDS
cocktail.
	   However, the new drugs require taking far fewer pills than the
standard mix, and they may help those who fail to respond to
protease inhibitors and suffer bad side effects.
	   The two drugs are DuPont Pharmaceuticals' Sustiva and Glaxo
Wellcome's Ziagen. Sustiva is known generically as efavirenz and
Ziagen as abacavir. Both companies have asked the U.S. Food and
Drug Administrations for approval to sell the drugs, based on the
data presented at this week's meeting.
	   The drugs will be given like protease inhibitors in combination
with two older AIDS medicines. Taken early in infection, the
protease inhibitor combinations keep people from getting sick. When
given to people whose body's are already ravaged by the virus, they
often produce dramatic turnarounds.
	   Their biggest drawback for many is the requirement of taking as
many as 20 pills on a precise schedule throughout the day. Some
doctors are reluctant to prescribe them to people who are not
motivated to take them on schedule, because missing even a few
pills allows mutant viruses to evolve that are completely
impervious to the drugs.
	   When taking protease inhibitors, ``you have to plan, you have to
be organized, and you have to be disciplined. There is a need for
simpler treatments, ones that patients can adhere to better,'' said
Dr. Schlomo Staszewski of Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany,
who was involved in testing both new drugs.
	   Patients on three-drug combinations with Sustiva would take five
pills a day, one in the morning and four in the evening. Those on a
Ziagen combination would take three in the morning and three in the
evening.
	   The two drugs have not been compared head to head. Only Sustiva
has been directly compared to standard protease inhibitor therapy.
	   ``Sustiva is particularly interesting because this is the first
time that a protease-free regimen looks comparable,'' said Dr.
Douglas Richman of the University of California, San Diego.
	   He said Sustiva also appears to work better than Ziagen in
patients who have already received other AIDS drugs, although both
will probably be useful new medicines.
	   In the Sustiva study, 450 HIV-infected people were randomly
assigned to take either Sustiva or Crixivan, a standard protease
inhibitor. Both groups also got AZT and 3TC, which are older
standard AIDS drugs. After 24 weeks, virus levels in 69 percent of
the Sustiva patients fell below the amount detectable with standard
tests, compared with 52 percent on the protease inhibitor.
	   In the study of Ziagen, doctors treated 173 people. Half got
Ziagen plus AZT and 3TC, while the rest took AZT and 3TC alone.
After 16 weeks, virus levels fell to undetectable levels in 75
percent on Ziagen, compared with 35 percent in the people on the
two-drug combination.
	   Both Sustiva and Ziagen thwart HIV by blocking an essential
enzyme called reverse transcriptase. The virus's genes are written
in RNA, rather than the standard genetic code of DNA. The virus
makes reverse transcriptase so it can translate its genetic
information into DNA. It then insert these genes into infected
blood cells, where the genes direct manufacturing of new copies of
the virus.
	   The two drugs attack this enzyme at different points. Ziagen,
like AZT and 3TC, is called a nucleoside analogue, because it
interferes with gene building blocks called nucleosides. Sustiva
binds directly to the gene-deciphering enzyme and is known as a
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

World Cup: Vieri, Hernandez, Chilavert among top stars so far 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Christian Vieri became a star at home in Italy.
Then he was one abroad in Spain. Now he has taken his ascending
fame to the World Cup.
	   Luis Hernandez was just a fading starlet with Mexican club
Necaxa. Two weeks at France 98 changed all that.
	   Ronaldo was supposed to be the ultimate superstar of this World
Cup. Hyped by a massive marketing campaign, the Brazilian striker
was been reduced to the level of mere greatness along with a few
others among the 704 players who have taken the field since the
tournament began June 10.
	   The second round wraps up Tuesday with Argentina vs. England and
Romania vs. Croatia, and if the Coupe du Monde has taught us
anything, it is that in soccer's global village, surprises are ever
harder to come by. Almost everybody knows one another and any blase
armchair fan can always blurt out he's seen it all before _ and
probably be right too.
	   That's why the sudden emergence of Hernandez, all long blond
manes and good looks, warms the heart.
	   Out of the blue, he scored four goals for outsider Mexico and
gave Germany a mighty fright Monday before the European champions
eventually emerged 2-1 victors.
	   Then again, one can never aspire high enough in the World Cup.
With the Germans trailing and being outplayed, Hernandez missed the
simplest of tap-ins from close range, keeping Germany in the game
and ending his World Cup heroics on a sour note.
	   For Atletico Madrid's Vieri, the World Cup run is still alive.
With a build seemingly chiseled out of granite, he has rumbled home
five goals in just four games and is hot and ready for Friday's
quarterfinal against the host nation.
	   ``I'm going through a great spell,'' he said, hoping to enter
World Cup history alongside such national heroes as Paolo Rossi and
Toto Schillachi, top scorers in 1982 and 1990.
	   Despite four goals, Ronaldo is on no such high. He's hit the
woodwork from several angles. Brazil is through to the
quarterfinals, yet he has his work cut out to make sure the 1998
finals will be identified with him.
	   ``He's still not the Ronaldo we all want to see. He has a lot
more to give,'' said Brazil's coach Mario Zagallo.
	   Of course, Ronaldo has to live up to being selected FIFA Player
of the Year twice. At 21, that is some task.
	   Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta also has four goals going into
Tuesday's second-round match against England. By contrast,
England's main man, Alan Shearer, has just a single goal.
	   Something else has been missing, too.
	   A true No. 10, a playmaker that can singlehandedly turn a game
and is an inspiration to his team, still has to emerge.
	   France's Zinedine Zidane could have been one, but kicking an
opponent cost him a two-match suspension, and he's lucky that
France won without him and scraped into the quarterfinals.
	   Italy's Alessandro Del Piero got his opportunities but was so
ineffectual, especially against Norway, that it seemed he was only
stealing playing time from veteran Roberto Baggio.
	   In other positions, the aura of Jose Luis Chilavert stands out.
The goalkeeper was great as underdog Paraguay sent Spain and
Bulgaria packing in the first round, and he was even better when he
kept France at bay for 114 minutes in Sunday's second-round match
before conceding the first World Cup ``golden goal.''
	   It could have been different, if France's defense had not been
led by Marcel Desailly, truly a giant among the World Cup defenders
so far.
	   Argentina's defense, on the other hand, is one united star. It's
the only team yet to concede a goal.
	   Sometimes it only takes a few seconds to become a World Cup
shooting star. Cameroon's Pierre Njanka set loose from his own
half, slalomed past opponent after opponent and a handful of
seconds later unleashed a most incredible drive past Austria's
Michael Konsel. It is still on daily newsreels all over France.
	   Danish substitute Ebbe Sand only needed half a minute after
entering the game to seal Nigeria's fate with the third goal in a
4-1 drubbing of Nigeria.
	   Meanwhile, sidestepping most of the spectaculars, Germany keeps
marching on, with singularly solid performances, underlining it
takes more than a few flashes to win the Cup.

World Cup: Italian captain only talks of rival teams 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Being the team captain, as well as the son
of Italy's coach, Paolo Maldini is good authority when it comes to
assessing the Azzurri's upcoming opponents.
	   So, these days, his opinion is in demand concerning France,
Italy's opponent in the World Cup quarterfinals.
	   ``It can be considered a World Cup final from a technical point
of view,'' Maldini, son of Cesare Maldini, said Monday as the team
began preparations for Friday's match at Saint-Denis. ``They only
allowed one goal in four matches. But also their midfield is
strong.''
	   Although he considers defense France's best asset, Maldini also
knows the host team has a natural advantage.
	   ``France is the favored team, because of the home factor,''
Maldini said. ``But I believe it's a wide open match. It's going to
be a tough test for both teams.
	   ``Being favored, at home, you can also be afraid of not winning.
We noted this fear on the French side in the match against
Paraguay,'' which France won 1-0 in extra time.
	   Maldini said he and his teammates expected more Italians fans
for the match. Attendance by Italians at the team's first-round
games was disappointing.
	   ``I believe it's a problem to find tickets,'' he said.
``Italians are not as well organized as Danish or Norwegian
supporters. ... For sure French fans will be overwhelming Friday,
but I don't expect any hostile attitude.''
	   Maldini will set an Italian record of 19 appearances over three
World Cups by starting in Friday's match, beating by one cap 1982
World Cup stars Antonio Cabrini and Gaetano Scirea.
	   ``I was lucky to play in Italian teams which went far in the
1990 and 1994 World Cups,'' the 30-year-old defender said. ``I'm
not thinking of playing in the next World Cup; 2002 looks so
distant to me. However (Giuseppe) Bergomi is here with us at 34.
Thus never say never.''

Nobel winner calls for a freeze on legal status of East Timor

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing the monumental change that has
shaken Indonesia in the last month, East Timorese independence
activist Jose Ramos-Horta has called for a temporary freeze on all
talks on the legal status of East Timor.
	   Similarly, any referendum on the Indonesian-occupied territory
should not occur for another three to five years, Ramos-Horta said
in a press conference Monday.
	   Ramos-Horta, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace prize, said he
was trying to show some flexibility in East Timorese independence
demands, considering the ``political, psychological earthquake'' in
Indonesia this spring that culminated with the ouster of President
Suharto last month.
	   He urged Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to show
similar flexibility _ particularly in Indonesia's demand that it
receive world recognition of its sovereignty over East Timor in
exchange for increased autonomy on the island and freedom for
jailed rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``Indonesia should not insist on preconditions,'' Ramos-Horta
said. ``This is not the way to start negotiations.''
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering a
long-running guerrilla war.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty, and accuse the Indonesian
government of human rights abuses.
	   Habibie has ruled out a referendum in the former Portuguese
colony, something which Portugal and East Timor activists have
called for.
	   ``We are not going to relinquish our position'' that East Timor
be independent, Ramos-Horta said.
	   But he suggested the two sides negotiate more immediate issues _
the release of more political prisoners, including Gusmao, and the
reduction of Indonesian troops on the island _ before launching
into a protracted debate over the future of the territory.
	   ``There is a solid consensus between us, Portugal, the European
Union and the U.S. position today that the only way to resolve the
problem is to move step by step along these lines,'' Ramos-Horta
said.
	   Officials at Indonesia's mission to the United Nations did not
return a phone call seeking comment on his remarks.
	   Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with Bishop
Carlos Belo for their efforts to bring peace to their homeland. The
bishop is the spiritual leader of East Timor, which is
predominantly Roma Catholic in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia.
	   David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University's
international conflict resolution program, said Ramos-Horta's call
for a slower approach to the issue was a smart one.
	   ``What has to happen is there needs to be an overall improvement
in the atmosphere in East Timor,'' he said in an interview here
after Ramos-Horta spoke. ``That can occur through unilateral
actions by the Indonesian authorities to end the repression and
remove the instruments of totalitarian rule that have afflicted the
East Timorese for so many years.''

Dollar slips, Tokyo stock prices rise in early trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Tuesday amid a news report saying that Japan and the United States
may again intervene to prop up the Japanese currency. Tokyo stock
prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 141.92 yen in early trading, down 0.20 yen
from its late level in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
141.69 yen overnight.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Tuesday that Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto hinted that Japan and the United States could
once again jointly step in to the foreign exchange market to
stabilize the yen.
	   ``Wild exchange rate movements are not desirable. The best thing
would be stability and moderate rate movements,'' the report quoted
Hashimoto as telling a Monday night television news program.
	   Concerning comments made by U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin on Sunday in Beijing on the
importance of stabilizing the yen, Hashimoto said: ``I believe they
showed their readiness to cooperate with Japan's efforts to
maintain the yen's value. I would like to count on their support.''
	   The newspaper said Hashimoto's comments indicated that Japan's
central bank is ready for further joint currency intervention with
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
	   On June 17, central banks from the two nations intervened in an
attempt to halt the yen's slide after the dollar hit an eight-year
high against the Japanese currency.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
165.14 points, or 1.07 percent, to 15,530.87 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 155.69 points,
or 1.02 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 10.69 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,212.91 points.
The TOPIX closed up 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
	   Share prices continued to gain ground on buying of blue chips in
automobiles, electronics and electrical machinery issues, as
sentiment improved somewhat after the Bank of Japan's quarterly
``tankan'' report, released Monday, came in better than expected.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.270 percent from Monday's finish of 1.275
percent, driving its price up to 111.43 yen from 111.39 yen.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief and Security Council
members mourned the death of the U.N. Angolan envoy, urging the
government and rebels to intensify efforts to complete the peace
process that Alioune Blondin Beye helped foster.
	   ``I am sure that all African leaders, as well as the
international community, will join me in this appeal so that Maitre
Beye will not have perished in vain,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Monday.
	   A charter plane carrying Beye, 59, two pilots and five other
members of the U.N. observer mission for Angola crashed Friday
night east of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Beye was traveling in the
region seeking support for the peace process from African leaders,
Annan said.
	   Annan, speaking in Vienna, called the Mali-born Beye ``a
dedicated and dynamic peacemaker, and a great son of Africa whom
the Angolans dubbed `the Messiah of Peace.'''
	   The crash came just days before the Security Council's July 1
deadline for the former rebel movement UNITA to hand over their
strongholds to government control. Failure to do so would results
in sanctions that would freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and
ban diamond exports, which give the movement hundreds of millions
of dollars each year.
	   America's U.N. ambassador, Bill Richardson, said Monday after
the council met on Angola that Beye's death was a terrible loss for
the peace process.
	   ``I just hope it's not going to bring an outbreak of
hostilities,'' Richardson said. ``I think we have to redirect our
efforts to get both sides talking again.''
	   The United Nations has long complained that UNITA has stalled in
fulfilling terms of the agreement, signed four years ago in Lusaka,
Zambia, to end the two-decade civil war.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.
	   Despite the frustration in carrying out the Lusaka accords, the
United Nations should not give up hope on Angola, said Kenya's
ambassador, Njuguna Moses Mahugu.
	   ``What we can do for Maitre is now to fulfill what he lived for
the last five years _ that is, bring peace in Angola,'' he said.
``I hope the parties in Angola can pay tribute to this great
African by keeping to their words, their promises, to Maitre and
the international community.''
	   The Security Council, noting its ``grave concern at the
deterioration of the security situation,'' approved Monday an
extension of the U.N. observer mandate until Aug. 15.
	   The council resolution didn't mention Beye's death, but council
members held a moment of silence before taking the formal unanimous
vote. The U.N. deputy secretary-general, Louise Frechette, paid
tribute to Beye during the meeting, saying Beye ``he literally gave
the mision all the hours God gave him.''
	   ``No one can replace Maitre Beye,'' she said. ``But his work can
and must be carried on.''
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the joint commission. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N.
peacekeeping forces in Angola since April.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government after Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.

Number of jobless in Japan hits record high in May 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of jobless in Japan rose in May to a
record high of 2.93 million, the government said Tuesday. The
unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent.
	   The jobless figures come as Japan is struggling with its worst
recession since World War II and is under increasing pressure from
allies to repair its troubled financial system.
	   The number of unemployed in May rose by 490,000 from the same
month a year earlier to hit the highest level since the government
began measuring it in 1953, the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   The unemployment rate, also at a record high, was the same as
the previous month. The steady jobless rate follows three
consecutive months of increases.
	   The employment situation in Japan is grim, and layoffs are
increasing for workers at all ages, an agency official told
reporters. Previously, job losses had been common only for older
workers.
	   The number of people employed, meanwhile, dropped by 350,000, or
0.5 percent, from the same month a year ago to 65.97 million,
marking the fourth straight month of year-on-year declines.
	   The jobless rate for men rose 0.1 percentage point to another
record high of 4.3 percent in May, while the unemployment rate for
women improved slightly to 3.9 percent from April's 4.0 percent.
	   The unemployment situation was particularly severe for men from
younger and older generations. The jobless rate for men between the
age of 15 and 24 came to 8.5 percent in May, up 1.4 percentage
points from the year-earlier month.
	   The unemployment rate for men between ages 60 and 64 came to
10.5 percent, marking the highest jobless rate for any age group or
gender.
	   The Labor Ministry said on Tuesday that the ratio of job offers
to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, deteriorated to
0.53 in May from 0.55 in April.
	   The ratio shows that only 53 jobs were being offered for every
100 workers seeking employment. A year ago, the overall job offers
ratio was 0.73.
	   Japan's unemployment rate would be significantly higher if
calculated by U.S. and European standards. The nation counts anyone
who has worked one hour or more in the month surveyed as fully
employed.

Diana's brother accused of cashing in on death anniversary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Earl Spencer's moving funeral oration for his
sister Princess Diana made him world-famous in a single afternoon.
Since then, he's had acres more of newsprint _ often critical.
	   Now, as the first anniversary of her death approaches,
Wednesday's opening of a ``Diana museum'' at the Spencers' Althorp
family estate _ at 9.50-pound (dlrs 15.60) a ticket _ has been
called self-serving.
	   And his TV interview and Althorp tour broadcast by the British
Broadcasting Corp. last week fueled complaints from the newspapers
that he is cashing in on Diana's death.
	   ``He is opening his heart to the BBC precisely a week before he
opens the gates of Althorp to the paying public,'' commented
London's Daily Telegraph, which sees the earl as a ``lost soul now
tethering himself to the memory of his lost sister.''
	   Spencer, 34, said the interview was a chance to air his side.
	   ``I think it would be unreasonable for me to have to take
everything on the chin day after day.'' he told the BBC.
	   He rails against the press for hounding his sister to death in a
car crash in Paris on Aug. 31 and seeks jealously to guard his own
privacy when it suits him. Yet, he takes advantage of being a
celebrity as Diana's brother when that suits him.
	   The museum will draw huge crowds to that rural corner of
Northamptonshire, 75 miles (120 kms) northwest of London. Great
Brington, the village near Althorp, is apprehensive. The 200-odd
residents expect at least 152,000 ticket-holding visitors from July
1 to Aug. 30.
	   When Spencer buried Diana on an island at Althorp after her
Sept. 6 funeral, he made it clear he wanted her to rest in peace
and privacy. Within days, he appeared on the tabloid front pages,
posing near Diana's grave amid the public's floral offerings.
	   The burial island will be off-limits to visitors. But they can
stand at the water's edge and look at the house and the new museum,
built in the former stables.
	   Spencer says profits will go to charity and argues the museum is
a fitting tribute.
	   Among the exhibits he chose are her school report cards, letters
and home movies that Diana might reasonably have expected to remain
private.
	   In the funeral eulogy, Spencer declared that Diana's ``blood
family'' would do all they could to ensure her sons were not
engulfed by royal tradition and duty, but raised so their souls
could ``sing openly.''
	   However, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, show every
sign of closeness to their father, Prince Charles. Several
newspapers reported the boys turned down an invitation to vacation
with Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and her family this
summer, preferring to stay with Charles.
	   In the Spencer TV interview, the topics of his princely nephews
and his bitter divorce from the former Victoria Lockwood, a onetime
model and mother of his four children, were off-limits.
	   His divorce in South Africa, with accusations of multiple
adultery and insensitivity, provided the British tabloids with rich
material and handy revenge for the funeral eulogy.
	   He acknowledged in the documentary that he refused Diana a house
in Althorp Park to use as a ``bolthole'' after her 1996 divorce.
	   He refused a particular house to protect his children from the
inevitable press and police presence, he said, but offered Diana a
choice of 100 other houses on the estate _ away from the main house
and park .
	   ``It was typical Diana,'' Spencer said. ``The fact that I said
no to one thing _ she said `right, I'm not going to look at the
others.' ''
	   ``Very few people said `no' I think ... and I did,'' he added.
And that, he said, led to a rift lasting several months.

Security Council extends mandate of Cyprus peacekeepers 
</HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council, concerned about the
``excessive and increasing'' number of weapons on Cyprus, decided
to keep U.N. peacekeepers on the Mediterranean island for another
six months.
	   In a unanimous vote on Monday, the council approved a resolution
extending the mandate of of the estimated 1,200-member force until
Dec. 31. The mandate, which is regularly extended, was to have
expired at the end of the month.
	   The resolution came amid heightened tensions on the island
following the visits this month to Cyprus by Turkish and Greek
warplanes in a show of force.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   Council members are also concerned about the scheduled delivery
later this summer of Russian air defense missiles. Turkey has
threatened military action if Russia goes ahead and delivers the
S-300 surface-to-air missiles to the Greek Cypriot government as
scheduled in mid-August. The missiles could reach targets over
southern Turkey.
	   In the resolution, the council said it was gravely concerned at
``at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military
forces and armaments ... and the rate at which they are being
expanded, upgraded and modernized, including the introduction of
sophisticated weaponry.''
	   An estimated 1,200 U.N. peacekeepers patrol the 110-mile
(180-kilometer) ``Green Line'' between the two Cypriot communities.
	   In a related resolution, the 15-member council decried the
impasse in Cyprus peace talks and stated that the status quo was
unacceptable.
	   It said it welcomed efforts by the U.N. chief and his advisers
``to resume a sustained process of direct negotiations,'' to find a
lasting peace on the island.

Kazak venture paying off for Chevron; oilfield like a `pile of diamonds' 
</HEADLINE>
By BIRGIT BRAUER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TENGIZ, Kazakstan (AP) _ At 4:45 a.m. every day, workers stream
to the northern canteen at the Tengiz oilfield, for an early
breakfast near the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea.
	   Their 12-hour work day will begin at 6 a.m., when the sun is
still too weak to take the chill out of the air.
	   These work hours are kept by all employees of Tengizchevroil,
the American-led joint venture operating the Tengiz oilfield. From
bus drivers to the general director, all stick to the same schedule
on a 28-day rotation.
	   The Tengiz oilfield and the surrounding area are studies in
extremes and superlatives. Tengiz, which means ``sea'' in Kazak, is
one of the 10 largest oilfields in the world, with some 6 billion
to 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil.
	   The company mining this wealth is the first joint venture in
Kazakstan, a former Soviet republic. With 3,100 employees, it is
one of the largest employers in the region.
	   ``To a petroleum engineer, coming to Tengiz is like for a
jeweler to stumble over a pile of diamonds,'' said Guy
Hollingworth, Tengizchevroil's general manager for operations.
	   But the area's remoteness and inhospitable climate, with hot
summers and winters as cold as minus 40 Celsius (minus 40
Fahrenheit), makes for harsh working conditions.
	   Packs of wolves, wild horses and camels roam the wide expanses,
and wind howls across the endless plains. The nearest village is
more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.
	   The difficult environment was the least of the obstacles when
the Tengizchevroil (TCO) joint venture agreement was signed between
Chevron and the Kazak government in April 1993. At the time,
Western companies were still wary of investing in the Soviet
successor states.
	   But after enduring years of skepticism and criticism, Chevron is
now being praised for its foresight.
	   ``They are bringing to Kazakstan international standards and
practices, and getting them to recognize what it takes to develop a
world class oil and gas field such as Tengiz,'' observed Michael
Biddison, regional manager in Central Asia for Hagler Bailly, a
U.S. company that provides technical assistance to the energy
industry.
	   Oil production has constantly increased at Tengiz, from 1
million tons (240 million gallons) in 1993 to 6.9 million tons (2
billion gallons) in 1997 _ more than a quarter of Kazakstan's total
production.
	   By 2002, TCO plans to reach 32 million tons (9.4 billion
gallons).
	   ``I think this is a very conservative estimate,'' said
Hollingsworth. ``It's one big reservoir. We haven't drilled enough
to know what's in it.''
	   The biggest problem for any oil and gas company operating in
landlocked Central Asia is its lack of export pipelines. This has
been solved by TCO in various ways.
	   Of the 6.9 million tons (2 billion gallons) produced in 1997,
3.2 million tons (940 million gallons) were exported through
Kazakstan's only existing export pipeline to Samara in Russia, and
3.7 million tons (1 billion gallons) by rail, ship or barge to
different destinations. Some of the oil was sent by rail to Odessa
in Ukraine, and to the Kazak port of Aktau on the Caspian, and then
by tanker to Baku, Azerbaijan.
	   But as oil production continues to increase, TCO will need
another export route. This gap will be filled by the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium, which is scheduled to build a pipeline from
Tengiz to the Russian Black Sea by 2001.
	   Chevron is one of the members of the consortium, together with
Mobil and Russia's Lukoil, who have also become partners in TCO.
Chevron now owns 45 percent of the shares in the joint venture,
followed by Mobil with 25 percent, the national oil company
Kazakoil at 25 percent and LukArco _ a joint venture of Lukoil and
Arco _ with 5 percent.
	   ``When the pipeline construction is finished, it will increase
the production capacity at Tengizchevroil,'' said Ravil
Cherdabayev, the governor of the Atyrau region, which includes
Tengiz, and previously a director at TCO. ``It creates new jobs and
brings more profit to the economy.''
	   This is good news for the region, the heart of Kazakstan's oil
and gas sector, which currently receives 27 percent of its taxes
from Tengizchevroil.
	   The positive outlook for the joint venture's future is slightly
dimmed by oil prices that have recently slumped as low as dlrs 14
per barrel from around dlrs 20 in 1997.
	   ``At current prices, there will definitely be a cash call,''
said TCO general manager Ken Godard, adding that for the first
time, Tengizchevroil will have to ask shareholders to fund its
development plans.
	   Nevertheless, the company plans no changes to its scheduled
investment of dlrs 1 billion in three years, and dlrs 20 billion
for the next 35 years.

Defense, entertainment blur in new California economy AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL WHITE
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tank drivers preparing for war used to slip
on 3-D headsets and strap into virtual reality simulators designed
by technicians at Illusion Inc.
	   Today, tourists use that same technology to enjoy the thrill of
driving in the Indianapolis 500 _ complete with computer-simulated
bumps in the pavement and hair-rustling wind.
	   When its defense business began to shrink amid military cutbacks
that devastated Southern California's economy a few years ago,
Illusion began to explore alternatives in the world of
entertainment.
	   Similar technological crossovers are likely to become more
common as entertainment continues to eclipse aerospace and defense,
providing one of the brightest points on Southern California's
economic horizon.
	   ``There's a convergence not only between aerospace-defense and
entertainment, but telecommunications and electronics,'' said Bob
Pethick, a vice president of the consulting firm A.T. Kearney, and
lead author of a new study of Southern California's aerospace and
defense industries.
	   ``With the interdependency, the lines between these industries
do tend to disappear,'' he said.
	   Linking the two worlds has spurred the rapid growth of companies
such as Illusion that focus on multimedia software and hardware, as
well as telecommunications.
	   In the late 1980s, almost 80 percent of Illusion's business came
from defense contracts. The company built sophisticated simulators
to train helicopter pilots and tank drivers. Last year, about 10
percent of Illusion's sales were to the Pentagon, and the rest in
entertainment.
	   Illusion, based in suburban Westlake Village, isn't the only
company to capitalize on the evolution taking place in high
technology industries. Hughes Electronics, a former manufacturer of
military satellites, now builds them to beam television shows into
thousands of homes via its DirecTV television business.
	   This two-way flow of technology was unheard of during the Cold
War, when many big advances were made in secret laboratories for
the exclusive use of the military. In those days, big defense
budgets allowed the Pentagon to spend millions to develop products
that would have narrow, military applications.
	   Now, in an era of relative austerity, defense firms are finding
new customers in consumer markets. Likewise, pinched defense
budgets mean the Pentagon is relying more and more on cheap,
consumer-driven technologies it can buy off the shelf.
	   Matt Walton, Illusion's executive vice president, pointed out
that some companies such as Microsoft spend as much on research and
development as the Defense Department's central research and
development organization.
	   That also could mean jobs and growth for Southern California,
where officials are trying to capitalize on the new synergies
between shrunken defense industries and the booming entertainment
business. Last year, entertainment payrolls in the region soared to
dlrs 8.9 billion, compared to dlrs 8.4 billion for aerospace and
defense.
	   Of course, consumers will ultimately determine whether the new
technologies will turn into lasting industries, said Jon Goodman,
who examines new technology at the University of Southern
California.
	   ``Are we seeing huge new markets? Not yet,'' Goodman said.
``We're standing on the edge, and whether it's a vista or a void,
no one knows.''

EDS: With BC-US-Diversity Web Site-Q-and-A
By RON WORD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Why do some gay men feel they have
to sound gay? Why do black people call themselves
African-Americans? And why do Asians who know English speak to each
other in their native languages?
	   Questions generally reserved for close friends and comfortable
surroundings are getting a public airing _ and spirited debate _ on
an Internet site that spares no feelings in addressing them.
	   ``Y? The National Forum of People's Differences'' was started in
March as a way for people of different backgrounds to get answers
to questions that may be too embarrassing or uncomfortable to pose
in person.
	   ``We don't even care if you ask out of ignorance or lack of
understanding,'' says the site's greeting, ``just as long as you're
not asking out of hate _ or feel you already know the answer to
your own question.''
	   Issues of race, gender, age, class, religion and sexual
orientation are addressed candidly, honestly, and often eloquently.
	   Chi Yu, a 26-year-old woman from Indonesia, tackled the question
about Asians speaking to each other in their native tongue.
	   ``If I'm speaking to someone with the same native language, why
should we speak in English? We'll have to do a `double-thinking'
(translate my ideas into English, then translate what my partner
said in English), and in the process, it's very possible one of us
will misunderstand what the other said,'' she wrote.
	   Phillip J. Milano, founder and editor of the site, said roughly
two-thirds of the questions deal with race and about three-quarters
of those are black-white issues.
	   He estimated that 5 percent of the questions are true hate and
another 10 percent to 15 percent are venting hostility.
	   ``I post the type of questions that other people get fired for.
The site is not for the faint of heart,'' he said.
	   He depends on answers from readers who can provide first hand
insight on an issue _ gays, blacks, Asians, women.
	   ``I have no agenda other than to get people to talk,'' said
Milano, an editor at The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville.
	   The only excluded topics are hot-button issues of the day:
abortion, politics, war, affirmative action, the death penalty.
Milano believes they are adequately covered in newspapers and on
radio call-in shows and television. Also banned are outright racist
questions and those involving sexual technique.
	   Milano, creator and director of The National Diversity Newspaper
Job Bank, a newspaper recruiting site for minorities and women,
decides which questions and answers are posted on his Web site. Of
40 to 50 questions and responses he gets each day, he uses 25 to
30.
	   One day, when his site was listed as one of the best of the
Internet, he had 27,000 people connecting to it.
	   The question on gays elicited this response from Dennis P., who
identified himself as a homosexual from Tucson, Arizona.
	   ``I think the answer lies in the question, `Why do some straight
men feel they have to sound macho?' Sometimes, whether it is a gay
or straight man, the reason is simply that he is advertising for a
mate (or at least a sexual encounter),'' he said.
	   The site is drawing positive reviews from diversity experts and
newspaper columnists.
	   Leonard Pitts, a columnist for The Miami Herald, wrote: ``If we
come to grips with the ways we differ, we might begin to see the
ways we do not.''
	   Detroit News columnist Betty DeRamus called the site an overdue
forum for people to ``pose the questions they dare not raise in
public. Many of these questions, even the stupid ones, stem from
ignorance and isolation rather than raw racism.''
	   Carmen Vazquez, manager of diversity training and education at
the Newspaper Association of America in Vienna, Virginia., says she
is addicted to the site.
	   It presents ``everyday people talking with each other, everyday
people either venting their anger or giving their perspective.
That's soul food for me,'' she said.
	   Cindy Clardy, 47, of Southfield, Michigan, is a frequent reader
of the Y? forum. A self-described lesbian, she said, ``I post more
in the sexual orientation section than the other sections, but I
read them all.''
	   Responding to the question about the term African-American,
Jeffrey S., 42, of Pensacola, Florida, wrote: ``I've been Negro (on
my birth certificate), Colored, black and now African-American. Do
you think they put this to a vote? I may wake up tomorrow and be a
man of color.''
	   Some questions generate more responses than others.
	   One that drew a dozen asked: ``Why do blacks have larger than
average lips?''
	   ``Average, compared to what?'' replied Alex, 39, of
Lawrenceville, Georgia. ``It's all a matter of how you define what
`average' is _ and in this country `average' means `white.' This
means that anything that isn't white is therefore different or
non-average. See how strange that is?''

NBA lockout to begin at midnight Tuesday AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association didn't even
wait until the deadline to put out the official word: There will be
a lockout.
	   With collective bargaining talks at a standstill, the league
moved ahead Monday and said that as of midnight EDT Tuesday night
(0400 GMT Wednesday), all business will come to a halt. No trades,
no free agent signings, no practices, no summer camps.
	   ``The current system does not work,'' commissioner David Stern
said. ``We can't afford to play next season under the current
system. That's just the reality. That's why owners elected to
lockout.''
	   The move came as no surprise. Players had been told all season
to expect a work stoppage, and talks between the league and the
union broke off more than a week ago.
	   The biggest question now is when it will end.
	   Both sides are so far apart that the impasse could last into
November, when the season opens, or December _ or even 1999.
	   ``Yes, that is fair and accurate,'' Stern said of possibly
losing games to a work stoppage for the first time in NBA history.
``There are a number of clubs that will do better not operating
than operating. That's something the players don't seem to
understand.''
	   This will be the third lockout in league history. A lockout in
the summer of 1995 lasted three months; in 1996 it lasted only a
few hours.
	   The old agreement was to run for six years, but the owners had
the right to reopen it if the amount of designated revenue being
paid toward player salaries exceeded a certain level _ 51.8 percent
of basketball-related income.
	   The owners say they are now devoting 57 percent of those
revenues to player salaries, a total of almost dlrs 1 billion.
	   The impending lockout already caused 12 NBA players to be
removed from the team scheduled to compete next month at the world
championships in Greece. When the players refused to commit to
playing during a lockout. USA Basketball, the governing body for
the national team, responded by replacing them with a team of
Americans currently playing overseas, minor leaguers and possibly
some collegians.
	   The union proposed a moratorium that would have allowed for the
original world championship team to compete. But when the union
insisted that trades and free-agent signings also be allowed, the
league said no.
	   The lockout means teams cannot conduct practices, summer camps,
workouts, coaching sessions or team meetings.

Sampson out as U.S. soccer coach AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sampson and Harkes quotes.
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   U.S. soccer players got their wish Monday when Steve Sampson was
forced out as coach of the national team.
	   Sampson, the first American-born coach to lead the United States
at a World Cup, oversaw an 0-3 flop and a last-place finish in the
32-team field.
	   Veteran players, angered at their lack of playing time, had been
calling for Sampson's head since the team was eliminated with a 2-1
loss to Iran on June 20.
	   ``We were naive to think an inexperienced coach would see the
value of experienced players,'' forward Eric Wynalda said. ``We
should never let this happen again.''
	   U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg met Sampson for
breakfast in Paris on Monday morning, then announced Sampson's
resignation.
	   ``I really came to terms with it in my own mind,'' Sampson told
the San Diego Union-Tribune, ``Three losses is not an acceptable
result. Maybe it's time for someone else to see what they can do.''
	   When Sampson's predecessor, Bora Milutinovic, left three years
ago, Rothenberg announced he had resigned, but Milutinovic later
said he was fired.
	   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' Rothenberg's
statement said. ``His tireless work has helped advance our sport
and, on balance, it was an era of growth. I compliment him on his
many achievements with our team.''
	   Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup
title, is probably the top candidate to take over, with D.C.
United's Bruce Arena available if Rothenberg wants an American.
Parreira turned down the U.S. job after leading Brazil to the World
Cup title four years ago and was fired June 20 by Saudi Arabia
after it started the tournament 0-2.
	   ``I think someone with certainly some international
experience,'' midfielder Tab Ramos said when asked what qualities
the new coach should have.
	   ``It needs to be somebody who can handle pressure at the highest
level,'' former captain John Harkes said, ``someone who can still
teach us things, someone who's been there at the highest level,
maybe someone who's played. When you have someone like that,
automatic respect is there.''
	   Sampson, who took over in April 1995, had a 26-14-22 record, by
far the best of any coach who led the U.S. team for an extended
period. But in soccer, the quadrennial World Cup is far more
important than all the other games.
	   ``We need to learn some lessons from the problems that we had
this time around so it never happens again, so future teams are
prepared properly to show at the international level,'' defender
Alexi Lalas said.
	   The high point for Sampson was a 1-0 victory over world champion
Brazil on Feb. 10, but two months later he began a series of
controversial moves, starting with the April 14 decision to cut
captain John Harkes from the World Cup roster for tactical and
disciplinary reasons.
	   Once at the World Cup, Sampson relegated Wynalda, Lalas, Ramos,
Marcelo Balboa and Jeff Agoos to secondary roles, provoking bitter
attacks. Ramos, Lalas and Agoos vowed after Thursday's
tournament-ending 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia that they wouldn't play
for the national team again as long as Sampson was coach.
	   ``It's unfortunate for everyone, the way things turned out,''
Ramos said. ``Some guys, like myself, said some things and Steve
answered back. At the end, I was thinking, `This isn't smart by
anybody.' ''
	   Sampson said Friday he never considered resigning and that
Rothenberg had to decide whether the team's performance was caused
by poor coaching or poor execution. He also said he was proud of
the way the team played during most of the tournament and
maintained the United States improved since 1994, when it was
eliminated by Brazil in the second round.
	   ``The entire team, we're responsible for the performance we had
in France, and I hope we can look at the experience and we can
learn from our mistakes,'' Lalas said. ``But I think it's insulting
to the American fans to say, `We put on a show, we worked hard and
we're getting better as a soccer-playing nation.'
	   ``There's nothing wrong with saying we failed. If we're saying
we want to be viewed as a progressive soccer-playing nation, we
want to be viewed along with the best teams, we have to be honest _
both when we succeed and when we fail. If we're just going to
continue saying, `Rah, rah for the red-white-and-blue, and we
played well and we showed things,' we might as well have orange
peels at halftime and it'll be a youth league.''
	   Sampson used an unusual 3-6-1 formation (three defenders, six
midfielders and one forward) in the opening 2-0 loss to Germany,
then made five changes in the lineup for the critical game against
Iran. Players didn't seem to know where they stood.
	   ``Maybe there's a sense of frustration that international
careers are coming to an end and they needed a scapegoat,'' Sampson
said last Friday. ``It's unfair it was pointed at me, the
individual who stuck with them for a long time.''

Draft resolution condemns Israel for extension of municipal services 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Council meets at 1430 GMT
By NICOLE WINFIELD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Over U.S. objections, the Security Council
is considering a resolution that would condemn Israel's decision to
extend municipal services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements in
the West Bank.
	   A draft of the resolution also calls on Israel to stop illegal
settlement expansion because it constitutes ``a major obstacle to
peace.''
	   The council was meeting on the issue Tuesday at the request of
Arab envoys to the United Nations. Dozens of speakers have asked to
address the council; it was unclear whether the council would vote
on the resolution.
	   The United States had sought to delay the meeting until next
month, saying any council action would enflame passions and hinder
U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
	   But Bahrain, the only Arab country on the 15-member council,
insisted on the meeting. As a rule, the Security Council accepts
all such requests from its members.
	   On Monday, State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said the
United States objected to any resolution that would condemn Israel
for the move, saying it would be counterproductive to the peace
process.
	   With U.S. mediators trying to get Israel and the Palestinians to
end a 16-month stalemate, ``the last thing we need is action by the
parties or anybody else that raises suspicions and makes it even
more difficult to get the process back on track,'' McClenny said in
Washington.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But resorting to a veto is considered
a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent member is
unable to muster majority support.
	   Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved a plan
June 21 to put some Jewish settlements under Jerusalem municipal
authority for certain services, notably building and planning.
	   Settlements normally need approval from the defense ministry for
any construction. The United States has called for a ``time-out''
on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to help
re-start the stalled peace talks.
	   The Arab League has condemned the Israeli plan, calling it an
attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem'' and
``destroy the peace process.''

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, turning his
attention Tuesday to dramatic changes in communist China, hailed an
emerging new China ``that is more prosperous, more open and more
dynamic.''
	   In this high-rise capital of banking and trade, Clinton pursued
his dialogue with the Chinese people in a morning roundtable with
community leaders. Then he was facing a form of communication
popular in America: a radio talk show.
	   ``I hope that you will help us to understand what is going on
and to speak with us frankly and openly,'' the president said at
the roundtable, which covered a number of technical and social
issues but generally steered clear of politics.
	   ``What we want is to build the right sort of partnership and
friendship with the Chinese people over the long run into the 21st
century,'' Clinton said.

Senators GM quits 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KANATA, Ontario (AP) _ Pierre Gauthier, the most successful
general manager in the brief history of the Ottawa Senators,
resigned Monday.
	   ``The demands of my position and my family became
incompatible,'' said Gauthier, who is moving back to California
with his wife and two children.
	   Gauthier is free to pursue any other National Hockey League job
he wants, Senators president Roy Mlakar said.
	   Mlakar said there is no timetable for hiring a replacement, but
he has already interviewed some candidates.
	   Gauthier resurrected a franchise in disarray when he was hired
from the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and signed a five-year contract in
December 1995. Gauthier became the Senators' third general manager
in less than four tumultuous seasons.
	   His understated manner and methodical approach were just what
the young team needed.
	   Gauthier re-signed holdout star Alexei Yashin and reorganized
the front office and the scouting staff. He fired inexperienced
coach Dave Allison and brought in Jacques Martin and highly
regarded assistants Craig Ramsay and Perry Pearn.
	   Gauthier leaves his successor in good shape. The Senators have
made the playoffs in their two full seasons under Gauthier,
advancing to the second round this year. The team has one of the
NHL's lowest payrolls, a strong fan base and a new arena.
	   Although seven Senators become free agents this week, star
forwards Yashin and Daniel Alfredsson and key defensemen Igor
Kravchuk, Wade Redden and Chris Phillips are all under contract.
	   The team also has one of the hockey's most talented prospects in
Slovak forward Marian Hossa.
	   Gauthier was one of three NHL general managers appointed to
Canada's Olympic hockey team this past winter. He co-managed
Canada's 1997 world championship team and was the general manager
of Canada's 1996 world championship squad.

	   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces battled to regain
control of a Kosovo mining village captured by ethnic Albanian
separatists, forcing thousands of villagers to flee into the woods
under a hail of shells.
	   More than 8,000 people left their homes in the southern town of
Belacevac and the neighboring village of Hade, as government forces
steadily attacked the area from three sides Monday. Villagers said
they expected the Serbs to take the area.
	   Police and heavily armed government forces began their attack
early Monday, and by evening had advanced within 200 meters (yards)
of Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina.
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of Yugoslavia's two
republics.
	   The Serbs were trying to retake the Belacevac open-pit mine,
which fell to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army last
week. The mine is strategically important because it supplies coal
to the nearby Obilic power plant, which provides electricity for
most of Kosovo.
	   Monday's fighting came as international envoys urged the two
sides to seek a diplomatic solution.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders
to try to find a solution to the conflict, while another U.S.
diplomat met with KLA representatives.
	   The European Union agreed Monday that the Kosovo militants must
be included in negotiations for peace in the region.
	   Meeting in Luxembourg, the E.U. foreign ministers issued a
statement urging ``all those in a leadership role in the Kosovar
Albanian community'' to commit to dialogue to resolve Kosovo's
problems.
	   In the hills around Belacevac on Monday, Serb police snipers
were posted, firing on men running water and biscuits to KLA
fighters camped in the woods surrounding the villages.
	   Albanian sources claimed the area was completely sealed off and
that government forces also attacked civilians in surrounding
villages, killing an 8-year-old child and trapping an unknown
number of villagers in their homes. Others fled into the forests
surrounding the village, where they were preparing to camp for the
night.
	   In a separate account, villagers reported four ethnic Albanian
civilians were killed in the fighting in Hade. An ethnic Albanian
commander who identified himself only as Muja reported one dead
civilian in Belacevac, but said he could not get in the village to
count.

Clashes between English fans, French immigrant youths

Eds: RECAPS previous
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ North African French youths clashed
with English fans at an outdoor screen showing a World Cup match on
the eve of an England-Argentina game here.
	   Authorities stopped the screening of the Netherlands-Yugoslavia
match late Monday while violence spread to the area around the
stadium, where the local youths burned several cars.
	   At least 10 people were arrested, including nine French and one
Englander, said police, who have a reinforced 1,600-member force
for Tuesday's match where more trouble is feared.
	   There was no immediate word on injuries from the clashes.
	   Police said the incident began when the local youths from poor
neighborhoods, seeking to avenge English-Tunisians clashes after a
match in Marseille two weeks earlier, insulted, then struck English
fans.
	   The English fought back and CRS riot police intervened,
arresting the 10 people. Police dogs were deployed to help maintain
security.
	   Shortly before midnight, riot police cordoned off the downtown
area, though local youths regrouped in some spots.
	   Meanwhile, an English soccer fan was jailed for four months on
Monday for throwing beer cans at police after England's World Cup
match against Tunisia.
	   Anthony Winston, a 19-year-old from London, was picked up by
British police in Lens, northern France, which was the venue for
England's match last Friday against Colombia.
	   Winston admitted to a court in Bethune, northern France, that he
threw the cans. But he said he was aiming at Tunisian fans who he
said had provoked the English contingent, police said.
	   Several hundred Englishmen fought running street battles on June
15 in Marseille, southeastern France, with French-Tunisian youths
and police, leaving scores injured.
	   Security has been beefed up considerably at England matches.
Authorities fear England's match against Argentina on Tuesday in
Saint-Etienne could also be a flashpoint for hooligans from both
countries.
	   There are also security worries over matches involving Germany,
as a result of rioting after Germany's match in Lens against
Yugoslavia, which left a policeman in a coma.
	   But officials, who deployed 2,000 police in Montpellier, said no
problems were reported Thursday after Germany's match against
Mexico.
	   As a precaution, Montpellier's bars were ordered to close Monday
and supermarkets were not allowed to sell alcohol. At one downtown
supermarket, shelves stocking alcohol were covered in plastic
sheets.

Malaysia's new airport groans under load of first passengers 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ The first flight from Malaysia's new
dlrs 2.5 billion airport carried Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad up
into clear skies Tuesday, but teething troubles angered hundreds of
ordinary passengers.
	   Mahathir flew to the northern resort town of Langkawi on
Malaysia Airlines MH 1432 along with his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohd.
Ali, and the airlines's executive chairman, Tajudin Ramli.
	   An MAS Airbus 330 from the Indian Ocean island of the Maldives
was the first international flight to land at the airport, which
Malaysia claims is the world's largest.
	   The airport, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of downtown
Kuala Lumpur, was unveiled Saturday amid a dazzling laser display
and fireworks. Its sleek new architecture and modern equipment are
designed to put the Southeast Asian nation on the map in the new
millennium.
	   But many of the first travel-weary passengers complained about
long waits at the luggage carousels. Announcements predicted flight
delays because of technical problems.
	   Malaysia has desperately promoted the facility as a symbol of
economic confidence and Malaysian pride amid the country's
worsening economic crisis, part of the broader regional one that
began last year.
	   It flew in villagers on a jet from the old airport to the new
one and on Monday invited hundreds of people for a free bus ride to
Sepang.
	   Once all three phases are developed over a spread of 25,000

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's largest public sector
trade unions voted Monday to launch a general strike to support
telephone workers protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone
company.
	   The General Committee of Labor Organizations, an umbrella group
whose Spanish acronym is CAOS, said its member unions will strike
on July 7. Members include more than 12,000 workers with the state
water and electricity unions.
	   Monday's vote upped the ante in the battle between the unions,
which are fighting to save their government jobs, and Gov. Pedro
Rossello, who has sought to privatize utilities, health care and
the sugar industry.
	   Sabotage by telephone workers protesting the telephone company
sale has caused more than dlrs 1.5 million damage, the company's
president said Monday.
	   Sabotage and service reductions since the strike began June 18
are costing Puerto Rico Telephone an additional dlrs 600,000 per
day, said Carmen Ana Culpeper.
	   Two telephone workers unions are protesting the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. Labor leaders say the sale
will produce severe job losses.
	   Culpeper has accused strikers of sabotaging telephone lines and
installations. Nearly 110,000 customers out of 1.3 million were
without service Monday, she said.
	   Also Monday, Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE announced that
Citibank had agreed to finance dlrs 1.5 billion of the purchase.
	   Talks on transfer of control of Puerto Rico Telephone operations
will begin ``in the coming weeks,'' GTE said in a statement.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale.

Report: Official hints Japanese banks in distress 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A member of the policy-setting board of the Bank of
Japan has said some of the country's financial institutions are
substantially bankrupt, a major Japanese newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   ``There are more than a few banks that have virtually failed,''
Kazuo Ueda, one of nine members of the central bank's board, said
according to the Mainichi newspaper.
	   ``And there are many banks that have insufficient capital, even
if they are not bankrupt,'' the paper quoted Ueda as saying in a
speech Monday.
	   A Bank of Japan spokesman said that he could not confirm the
contents of Ueda's remarks, which he added were made at a lecture
in Tokyo sponsored by the central bank.
	   Ueda is one of nine members of the bank's policy-setting board.
	   Ueda's reported comments come as Japan's financial institutions
are saddled with 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion) in bad loans
left from the collapse in the early 1990s of the asset-inflated
``bubble economy.''
	   Last November, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's major
commercial banks, failed under a pile of bad debt, while Yamaichi
Securities Co., Japan's fourth-largest brokerage, also went under
that same month.
	   The government has promised to come up with a set of measures to
stabilize the nation's banking system by Thursday, a move that
analysts say is a prerequisite to getting Japan's recession-plagued
economy headed back toward recovery.

Dollar slips, stocks higher at midday in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday trading
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped further against the yen
Tuesday morning on growing speculation that Japan and the United
States may again intervene to prop up the Japanese currency. Tokyo
stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 141.12 yen at midday, down 1 yen from late in
Tokyo on Monday and below its late New York level of 141.69 yen
overnight.
	   Renewed concern about joint intervention grew after the Nihon
Keizai newspaper reported Tuesday that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto hinted Japan and the United States could once again
jointly step in to stabilize the yen.
	   ``Wild exchange rate movements are not desirable,'' the report
quoted Hashimoto as telling a Monday night television news program.
	   Citing comments by U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Chinese
counterpart Jiang Zemin on Sunday in Beijing on the importance of
stabilizing the yen, Hashimoto said he believes they are ready to
cooperate with Japan to maintain the yen's value.
	   The Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve intervened on June
17, after the dollar hit an eight-year high against the Japanese
currency.
	   Another report Tuesday that a key Japanese policy maker was
willing to study the possibility of carrying out a permanent tax
cut also caused the dollar to fall, traders said.
	   Taku Yamasaki, a top official in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, was quoted by the Nihon Keizai as saying that that the party
will study the possibility of implementing permanent tax cuts when
it begins policy deliberations after an election for Parliament's
upper house on July 12.
	   On the stock market, prices ended the morning session higher,
lifted by the stronger yen and the tax cut report.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 288.42 points, or 1.88
percent, to 15,654.15. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 155.69
points, or 1.02 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 16.99 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,219.21 points.
The TOPIX closed up 11.40 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
	   Market sentiment was also improving ahead of an expected
announcement of details of the government's ``bridge bank'' plan to
deal with Japan's bad debt problem, traders said.
	   The proposed system is seen helping the borrowers of failed
banks because it would enable them to continue to obtain money from
a new government-backed ``bridge bank.''
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.295 percent from Monday's finish of 1.275
percent, driving its price down to 111.25 yen from 111.39 yen.

Estrada, former actor and hero of the poor, becomes Philippines' leading man GMT

<TEXT>
	   MALOLOS, Philippines (AP) _ Joseph Estrada, a former B-movie
star loved by the masses, takes his oath Tuesday as the
Philippines' 13th president at a church where Asia's first republic
was inaugurated a century ago.
	   Estrada, who won an overwhelming victory in elections on May 11,
has pledged to devote his six-year term to narrowing the gap
between the country's rich and poor.
	   But his presidency, which Estrada says will be his ``greatest
performance'' ever, is off to a rocky start after many Filipinos
reacted angrily to his decision to permit the burial of former
dictator Ferdinand Marcos at a heroes' cemetery in July. The bitter
opposition forced Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, to reverse
his decision.
	   ``No previous president has assumed office with as much
dissonance in the air,'' says political scientist Alex Magno.
	   Arrangements for Estrada's inauguration emphasized this year's
centennial of the country's declaration of independence from 333
years of Spanish colonialism.
	   Hundreds of men in women in native costumes lined the road
leading to the historic Barasoain Church, guarded by a battalion of
soldiers wearing revolutionary uniforms, where the oath-taking was
to be held.
	   The church, decorated with white orchids and chrysanthemums, was
where the first Philippine constitution was drafted a century ago
and where Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president, was proclaimed.
	   Estrada says he will continue most of former President Fidel
Ramos' economic reform policies but will focus on helping the poor
and agriculture. He planned to meet a group of farmers outside the
church before his oath-taking to receive a list of demands and
complaints from the poor.
	   Estrada has also pledged to crack down on official corruption
and solve the country's severe crime problem within six months.
	   Estrada, a college dropout with a swagger, mustache and bouffant
hairstyle, gained a devoted following among the country's many poor
during several decades as an actor in B movies, playing tough guys
who stood up against injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   He won the May 11 polls by one of the largest margins ever in a
free Philippine election. The polls were also among the
Philippines' most peaceful, although at least 45 people were
killed.
	   Many in the traditional Philippine elite have looked askance at
Estrada, considering him an undereducated buffoon with little
ability to lead the country's economy through the murky waters of
Asia's devastating currency crisis.
	   Estrada freely admits little proficiency in economics and says
he will depend on a stable of 30 economic advisers who range from
leftist academics to conservative bankers.
	   He also openly acknowledges a history of womanizing, heavy
drinking and gambling, but insists he now has given up all vices,
including cigarette smoking, which he quit several weeks ago.
	   His landslide election victory prompted many to predict a long
``honeymoon'' period as president. But in addition to the divisive
decision to allow Marcos' burial, Estrada also has taken on much of
the Philippine Congress with a pledge to eliminate ``pork barrel''
funds often misused by congressmen.
	   All three unions at beleaguered Philippine Airlines _ owned by
an important Estrada backer _ also plan a demonstration Wednesday
demanding that Estrada take action in response to the carrier's
recent massive layoffs.
	   And Estrada faces a revolt from the popular head of the Subic
Bay special economic zone, who refuses to step down after being
fired by the new president over personal differences.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Daewoo Electronics Co. announced plans
Tuesday to build a dlrs 200 million television plant in Casablanca,
Morocco.
	   Construction is to begin in early July, with completion set for
early next year. Daewoo plans to finance the project with
syndicated loans from Morocco banks.
	   The plant will produce 1 million 14-, 20-, 21- and 25-inch color
television sets annually for sale in Africa, Europe and the Middle
East.
	   Daewoo's 13 plants at home and abroad produced 10.1 million
television sets last year, grabbing an 8.4-percent share of the
world's 120-million television market.
	   Daewoo Group is South Korea's third largest conglomerate in net
assets.

Dissident's family members turned away from Beijing: rights group 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police refused to allow the wife of a dissident
to return to China from Germany, and forced the mother of another
dissident to cut short a visit to Beijing, a human rights group
said Tuesday.
	   Chinese citizens should have the right to travel freely and
return to their country, New York-based Human Rights in China said
in a statement. It called on President Clinton, who is visiting
China, to do more to support better rights protection in China.
	   Tao Li, whose husband is a democracy activist in north China's
Inner Mongolia, arrived at Beijing airport on Sunday and was turned
away from customs and sent back to Germany despite her travel
documents, the group said in a statement.
	   She was trying to return to visit her 74-year-old father, who
suffers from cancer, it said.
	   In a separate case, Hu Suchan of central China's Hubei province,
whose son was involved in the 1989 democracy protests that swept
the country, arrived in Beijing on July 22 to buy medicine and
collect a business debt. Police detained her and escorted her back
to her home in Jingnan City two days later, the statement said.
	   Mrs. Hu's son, Yu Zhuo, was sentenced to two years in prison in
1992 for putting up posters calling for a re-evaluation of the
military attack on protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989. He died
in a car accident in which a police officer accompanying him was
unhurt, according to the rights group.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least eight mortar shells were
fired at the Sulu provincial capitol on Jolo island before dawn
Tuesday, stopping a scheduled oath-taking there by the re-elected
provincial governor.
	   A military report, which blamed defeated candidates in the May
11 election for the attack, said there were five ``casualties'' but
it was unclear how many of them were killed or wounded.
	   One shell landed at the residence of Gov. Sakur Tan, but there
was immediate report of damage or casualties there.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   Jolo, about 950 kilometers (590) miles south of Manila, is the
stronghold of the Moro National Liberation Front, the main Muslim
secessionist group, which signed a peace pact with the government
in 1996. Many MNLF members, however, still carry their weapons.
	   Some former MNLF leaders ran and lost in the last election.

Clinton hails more prosperous, more open, more dynamic China roundtable; edits throughout. AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES throughout with more quotes from
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, turning his
attention Tuesday to dramatic changes in communist China, was told
Tuesday that democracy is growing, that churches should cooperate
with the government and that Chinese parents worry about children
getting chubby on American-style fast foods.
	   Clinton said there is an emerging new China ``that is more
prosperous, more open and more dynamic.''
	   In this high-rise capital of banking and trade, Clinton pursued
his dialogue with the Chinese people in a morning roundtable with
leaders from business, law, the arts, media and the religious
community. Then he was facing a forum popular in America: a radio
talk show.
	   ``I hope that you will help us to understand what is going on
and to speak with us frankly and openly,'' the president said at
the roundtable, which covered a number of technical and social
issues but touched only lightly on politics.
	   ``I hope that you will help us to understand what is going on
and to speak with us frankly and openly,'' the president said.
``What we want is to build the right sort of partnership and
friendship with the Chinese people over the long run into the 21st
century.''
	   America's first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invited roundtable
panelists to talk about ``the good, the bad, the hard, the easy.''
	   Zuo Xuejin, an economist and expert on migrant research, said
America has a big influence on China's young generation.
	   ``Today there are not many people who have the chance to go
abroad, but they know there are many popular American stars and
they know those popular stars' names better than I do,'' Zuo said.
``And many of the kids in China love Kentucky Fried Chicken or
McDonald's and their parents are worrying about whether there will
be problems of obesity'' _ a problem that regularly draws attention
in America.
	   Responding to one politically sensitive question, Clinton
carefully spelled out U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which China
considers a renegade province.
	   Adhering to finely worded diplomatic language that broke no new
ground, Clinton said, ``We don't support independence for Taiwan,
or two Chinas ... And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a
member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement.''
	   Another participant, Bishop Jin Luxian, said religious leaders
should cooperate more with the government rather than challenge its
control of churches.
	   ``I believe, Mr. President, you are here to have more dialogue
with us, with the Chinese government, not to contend with us,''
said Jin, who belongs to an officially recognized Catholic church.
	   Part of the president's message was that the dynamic forces of
change propelling the booming economy in Shanghai, China's
high-rise financial capital, can spread prosperity throughout
China.
	   ``Everyone understands there is a new China emerging in the
world that is more prosperous, more open and more dynamic,'' he
said in a joint appearance with his wife.
	   Clinton flew here late Monday from Beijing where he addressed
students at Peking University. He urged political reforms and was
challenged _ pointedly but politely _ by the youthful audience
about America's own human rights record, arm sales to Taiwan and
U.S. perceptions of China.
	   State-run television sent out Clinton's university speech live
after trying _ but failing _ to get an advance look at his address.
The American side did suggest beforehand that Clinton would not
bring up again the sensitive subject of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, as he did in a televised news conference Saturday with
President Jiang Zemin.
	   Shanghai's dazzling lights and bustling downtown were a dramatic
change from the bureaucratic capital of Beijing. Clinton and his
family got a brief look at the city's harbor from their limousine
and rode past thousands of people gawking on the streets.
	   The third stop on a five-city tour, Shanghai boasts one of the
world's most technologically advanced stock exchanges, opened last
summer, and is the headquarters in China for scores of
multinational banks from around the world.
	   Clinton on Tuesday meets with leaders from business, law, the
arts, media and the religious community _ agents of change who are
helping transform life in China and opening this country to the
world.

With BC-Philippines-Estrada

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former movie star Joseph Estrada may
need more guards than any past Philippine presidents _ not to ward
off any particular threat but to watch over his many families.
	   Estrada, who has openly acknowledged being a past womanizer, has
fathered seven children with five different women out of wedlock,
according to news reports. He also has three children with his
wife, Eloisa, a former psychiatrist.
	   ``I was an actor surrounded by many temptations,'' Estrada says.
``I had numerous flings.''
	   Estrada, 61, was inaugurated Tuesday as the country's 13th
president, replacing President Fidel Ramos, a disciplined
workaholic who brought respect back to a country once called the
``sick man of Asia.''
	   In a former Spanish colony where the word ``macho'' has no
negative connotations, Estrada's colorful past has helped endear
him to many Filipinos, particularly the country's impoverished
majority. But his past flings are also causing security worries.
	   A military official said the Presidential Security Group, the
equivalent of the U.S. Secret Service, has no choice but to guard
all of Estrada's mistresses and children.
	   ``We have to secure everything that might potentially cause
disability to the president,'' said the official, who asked not to
be named. ``It is in the national interest.''
	   Most of Estrada's other families reportedly live near his swank
residence in an upper-class Manila district.
	   Estrada's dalliances have caused other worries. Stung by his
womanizing ways, Estrada's wife and three children left him once in
the 1980s but later reconciled with him.
	   His reputation for philandering, gambling and drinking also
appalled leaders of the Catholic Church, which claims about 84
percent of the Filipino people as members.
	   Manila's influential archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, warned that
an Estrada presidency could be ``disastrous for the country'' and
would create a terrible role model for the country's young.
	   Estrada takes such criticism in stride. He once even joked
unabashedly that he will offer advice to U.S. President Bill
Clinton when they meet.
	   ``Both President Clinton and I have sex scandals,'' he says.
``But Clinton has the scandals, and I have the sex.''
	   Estrada says he is properly supporting all the children he
fathered and insists that no one in his various families has
benefited from his political posts.
	   Estrada served as mayor, senator and vice president before
running successfully for president in elections on May 11.
