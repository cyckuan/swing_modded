<HEADLINE> Germany Favors Multilateralism: Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany said Wednesday
it is committed to multilaterism and the strengthening of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In the international state system of tomorrow the answer to
the challenges of globalization will come from multilateralism
alone," said Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
He told the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly that the
world "will always be plural and no form of unilateralism can work
in the long run".
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will need a United Nations capable of taking
action, he said at the general debate, adding that Germany will be
"the staunchest" ally of the U.N. member states in the efforts to
strengthen the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues he touched upon is the development cooperation
between the developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of its European Union and Group of Eight
countries Presidencies, Germany launched substantial initiatives
which must be further developed in the form of the 1999 Cologne
Debt Initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the G-8 summit in Cologne in June Germany called for
creditor countries to speed up the debt relief process for the
heavily indebted countries by ascertaining the extent and date of
the debt relief by 2000.

Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan
of 62.5 million U.S. dollars to Brazil to help preserve urban
historical and cultural sites, improving their management and
developing a preservation strategy and priorities.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used to finance investments in
restoration and improvements of the sites and surrounding
infrastructure, strengthen and modernize the Instituto do
Patrimonio Historico e Artistico Nacional, and promote economic
activities in the project areas, mobilizing support for heritage
enhancement from the private sector, nongovernment organizations,
and residents, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
A strategy and a list of heritage site priorities will be
developed. In addition, the program will finance the training of
artisans in restoration techniques and the training of
instructors, as well as educational projects to inform the
population about the importance of its historic and artistic
heritage and its care and its use.
</P>
<P>
Several urban historic monuments and sites throughout Brazil
will be improved by the project, which will be carried out by the
Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
Early investments are expected to be made at project sites at
Ouro Preto, Olinda and Recife, and Rio de Janeiro.

<HEADLINE> Holiday Online Sales in U.S. Expected to Double This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Online sales in the
United States are expected to double this holiday season,
according to a new research report released this week by leading
Internet research firm Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce sales in November and December could reach 6 billion
U.S. dollars, up from an estimated 3.1 billion dollars spent
during the same period in 1998. Jupiter expects online shopping to
grow to 78 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter also expects that 10 million online users in the United
States will begin shopping in 1999 and many will make their first
purchases during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
But Jupiter researchers warned that e-tailers will have to deal
with issues, such as site failures, inadequate customer service
and poor order fulfillment, if they want to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
One area that sites should address is performance. Jupiter
expects traffic volume to grow enormously at leading retail sites
this holiday season, jumping from an average 15,000 transactions
per day between January and October to 58,000 transactions per day
during the winter holidays.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. research firm, Forrester Researcher, predicted
this week that online retail sales in North America will be worth
184 billion U.S. dollars by 2004. Further, the Internet will
influence another 500 billion dollars worth of goods purchased
offline.

<HEADLINE> Duma Approves Amendment on Parliamentary Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma on Wednesday
approved, during its first reading, a constitutional amendment
that would strengthen parliament's role in investigations.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was backed, in a second vote, by 300 deputies,
the required minimum of votes needed for the bill to clear the
lower house of parliament, the Interfax news agency reported. A
first try was four votes short of the required minimum.
</P>
<P>
Under the approved amendment, the State Duma shall have the
right to set up commissions for handling matters of public
interest.
</P>
<P>
The attendance of individuals called to commission sessions and
the presentation of all the required documents is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers believe that parliamentary investigations will
become a key form of the State Duma's control over the state's
government agencies, including the Cabinet and its individual
members, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
However, President Boris Yeltsin's representative in the Duma,
Alexander Kotenkov, opposed the bill, saying that that by
introducing the concept of parliamentary commissions, the State
Duma is trying to secure the word "parliament" for only one
chamber. He also said that by setting up such a commission, the
Duma is going beyond the limits of its powers.

LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government said its
strategic position between the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development
countries (SADC) coupled with its liberalized economy gives it
great potential for investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce, Jazzman
Chikwakwa, said this in Lusaka Wednesday when he addressed an
Indian delegation which is searching for investment opportunities
in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He assured them that they would not regret having invested in
Zambia as it had a great potential in tourism, agriculture and
mining.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government has adopted a liberalized economy
where it has left everything in the hands of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chikwakwa praised India for being an all weather
friend adding that Zambia has benefited from India, economically,
socially and politically.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, India High Commissioner to Zambia, Ashok Attri,
described Zambia as one of his country's major trading partners
despite the information gap that has hampered a much faster growth
rate in their economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investment from Indian companies in Zambia
during the period of 1994 to 1998 amounted to 307 million U.S.

JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African
National Assembly on Wednesday unanimously approved the World
Heritage Convention Bill, paving the way for three of South
Africa's most important cultural and natural sites, including
Robben Island, to be granted world heritage site status.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, by the United Nations Environmental, Social
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is expected to take place in
December this year, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill will create the legal and administrative framework
necessary for heritage status.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the debate, Deputy Environment Minister Joyce
Mabudafhasi said the government was confident that UNESCO would
give South Africa's first three nominations -- Robben Island, the
hominid site at Sterkfontein, and the greater St Lucia wetlands --
their rightful status in the world alongside the Acropolis in
Athens, the Grand Canyon in America, and Great Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa intended to add others, such as the Drakensberg,
to the list, she said.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from various parties agreed that the status of the
three areas as world heritage sites would enhance South Africa's
tourist industry at a time when it was vital to economic growth
and job creation.

UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday
brought a case against India to the International Court of Justice
(ICJ) over the shooting down of a Pakistani aircraft by Indian air
force planes on August 10.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan contends that the unarmed aircraft was on a routine
training mission in the country's own airspace with 16 personnel
on board who were all killed when it was hit without warning by
Indian air force planes, a U.N. spokesman told reporters here.

<P>
Pakistan is charging that this action violated the U.N. Charter
and an agreement between India and Pakistan on the Prevention of
Air Space Violations, spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.

"Pakistan also says the incident violated obligations under
customary international law not to use force and not to violate
another state's sovereignty," he said.

<P>
According to information from the Hague-based ICJ, Pakistan
requested that ICJ order India to make reparations to Pakistan for
the loss of the aircraft and the lives.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan
of 140 million U.S. dollars to Argentina to support the
modernization of firms through the use of technology.
</P>
<P>
The resources will assist enterprises producing goods and
services, mainly those that are small and medium-sized, in order
that they may initiate, import, alter or adapt technologies to
increase their efficiency and competitiveness, the
Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The program provides mechanisms and incentives for
technological innovation through credit and noncredit co-financing
instruments that include up to 50 percent of the cost of projects
submitted by enterprises for development and improvements of
products and processes.
</P>
<P>
The resources will also finance the development of strategic
and scientific research capacities to meet priorities of the
productive sectors, especially those in geographic areas with
special needs.
</P>
<P>
The project will apply international technological advances and
operations of previous technology programs in Argentina,
especially those that benefit small and medium-sized enterprises,
so as to produce products with a higher value added and to

MADRID, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ibero-American economy will
rebound in the last quarter of the year, according to a study
performed by the Spanish financial unit "Argentaria", made public
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the Department of Studies of Argentaria, this tendency will
continue in the year 2000, until the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of the region reaches 3.4 per cent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a forecast fall of 0.6 per cent of the GDP for this
year, the Ibero-American economy will register growth over the
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The study done by Argentaria also shows a slight fall in the
rate of unemployment, which should reduce from the present level
of nine per cent to 8 per cent in the year 2000. Inflation is also
forecast to reduce slightly from the 8 per cent of this year to
7.5 per cent next year, due to the deceleration of the price rises
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the evolution of the level of activity, a
forecast is made for improvement in the deficit of the public
sector, especially notable in Brazil and Colombia, and only a
slight rise in the deficit of the current account.
</P>
<P>
Ibero-America is composed by all Latin American countries plus
Spain and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Committed to Decentralization: Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Acting President
Simon Muzenda said Wednesday that his government is committed to
the process of devolving responsibilities and functions to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The decision to devolve responsibilities was made on the
philosophy that important developmental views arise from the
people at grassroots level, Muzenda said when officially opening
an African ministers conference on local government systems in the
resort town of Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the people have to be given appropriate structures
through which they can be involved in programs and projects that
benefit them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To this effect, our parliament has passed laws to provide for
democratic participatory structures at village, ward, district and
provincial levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
The acting president said appropriate institutional structures
to implement and monitor the transfer of powers and functions to
the local authorities have also been put in place.
</P>
<P>
"We have been mindful of the fact that our decentralization
program is taking place at a time when we are also implementing
economic structural reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that local governments in Africa are going to
deal with issues of attracting capital and investment, creating
jobs, combating poverty and crime and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of building strong local governments in Africa,
 therefore, cannot be over-emphasized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is through strengthened local governments that there is a
higher likelihood of reflecting local needs more accurately than
centralized systems of government," Muzenda said.
</P>
<P>
He said decentralized and democratic local governance has
become the vehicle through which people are going to have a voice
and choice in matters affecting their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the African ministers conference came at an
appropriate time to enable participants to prepare for the next
summit of African cities to be held in Namibia early next year.
</P>
<P>
The conference would enable the 14 countries represented to
learn from each other's experience in adopting decentralization
strategies and actions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Worried About Rapid Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
State Edward Lowassa Wednesday expressed worries that the fast
growth of population could hamper the east African country's
development.
</P>
<P>
While launching the State of World Population 1999 Report in
Dar es Salaam, Lowassa said Tanzania's population is estimated to
have reached 31. 8 million by the middle of this year compared
with 23.1 million in1988 and 7.7 million in 1948.
</P>
<P>
But the country's annual population growth rate has declined to
2.8 percent from 3.2 percent during the period from 1978 to 1988,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Though there is a decline in growth rate, the number of people
added to the population each year amounts to 880,000 a year
currently, compared with 660,000 a decade ago, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We do understand that population growth ... is not necessarily
an obstacle to development," he said. "But rapid population
growth, out of proportion with the nation's wealth creation
momentum, can be a serious impediments to improvement of the
quality of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's economic growth rate stands at between 3.5 percent
and 4.0 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa said the rapid population growth tends to increase
outlays on consumption, drawing resources away from savings for
productive investment and, therefore, tends to retard growth in
national output through slow capital formation.
</P>
<P>
The strains caused by rapid population growth are felt most
acutely and visibly in the public budgets for health, education
and other sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
S.B. Buberwa, director of Social Services at the Planning
Commission, told Xinhua that the Tanzanian government has set up
maternal health clinics across the country, providing free
contraceptives for people to adopt family planning.
</P>
<P>
However, contraceptives are not available to all people for
lack of resources from donors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Demographic experts said that many people are reluctant to use
the devices due to religious or cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, contraceptive prevalence rate in Tanzania rose from
6.3 percent in 1992 to 16 percent in 1996. But the rate is still
below a goal set at the International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo in 1994, Lowassa said.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not say what measures would be taken to slow
down the population growth rate, but he stressed the importance of
reproductive health care services.
</P>
<P>
With respect to quality and accessibility of reproductive
health services, about 48 percent of all deliveries are attended
by health professionals and 47 percent of deliveries take place in
health facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition there is high unmet need of reproductive health
services, he added.
</P>
<P>
Teferi Seyoum, representative of the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) in Tanzania, said that 22 women in the country die
daily from preventable pregnancy-relation complications.
</P>
<P>
Buberwa said that the government adopted a national population
policy in 1992, which has enhanced people's awareness of family
planning.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will continue to review policies
to link reproductive health with family planning, and to address
environment, gender and other issues.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Buberwa said Tanzania will mobilize resources
to provide more family planning services to people, and carry out
education among women to arouse their awareness of the importance
of a smaller family size.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Research on health done in
Africa has benefited the international community more than the
African continent itself, Zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps said in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of a four-day conference on African health
research for development, the minister said the African continent
has become the research laboratory for the world in which there
are few ethical consideration for the researched.
</P>
<P>
"African research is dedicated to interests outside Africa and
this must be redirected to benefit local communities," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Stamps asked the participants at the conference to resolve how
policy and decision makers could exploit the intellectual social
capital on the African continent to benefit local communities.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 participants from various African countries were
attending this conference which would examine the linkages between
health research program and policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
This would be done to enhance the impact of research on health
development in Africa, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Stamps also asked the participants to come up with Africa-based
journals that were accessible to policy makers and program
managers.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a lot of high quality research work has
remained on the shelves or only available in excellent
international journals not readily available in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the conference was an opportune moment for the African
region to prepare for a good African representation for the year
2000 Bangkok international conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference has drawn participants from non-governmental
organizations, donor agencies, governments, regional and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total investment for health research
amounted to about 56 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of this is spent on research into problems
that concerns only 10 percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
And only 10 percent of the funds are currently used to improve
the health of 90 percent of the world's population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Angola has exported about 900
cubic meters of "black granite" for the first half of 1999, the
official news agency Angop reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The black granite, extracted from the mining zone of
Tchicuatite in southern Huila Province, has been exported to
countries in Europe, America and Asia, such as Portugal, Belgium,
Spain, Italy, the United States, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The largest company in the mining zone Angostonem, which
established its first stone-pit in August 1998, has exported 500
cubic meters of black granite from January to June this year.
</P>
<P>
The company has reportedly invested two million U.S. dollars
this year in a bid to produce more black granite which has a ready
sale in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Ango-Rochas Company, another big granite company in the
mining zone, has acquired advanced techniques and the production
of the black granite is expected to reach 150 cubic meters per
month, said Francisco Bernardino, general director of the company.

MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday welcomed
assurances from Saudi Arabia that the Arab country "is not one of
the states financing armed Chechen groups."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia "follows a firm political line dictated by the
Muslim religion, seeks stability between peoples and countries and
does not interfere in the internal affairs of other states," the
Russian Foreign Ministry quoted a statement published Tuesday in
Riyadh as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These statements, which express the official position of
Riyadh, have been received with satisfaction in Moscow," the

</P>
<P>
Russia is ready for "interaction with Saudi Arabia in fighting

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Banks Raise Minimum Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two major commercial banks in
Zimbabwe announced Wednesday that they have hiked their minimum
lending rates to 56. 5 percent, threatening to put Zimbabweans
into another round of increases in borrowing rates.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and First Bank raised their
lending rates from 52.5 percent to 56.5 percent with effect from
September 21 and September 22 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other major banks which charge interest rates of around 52
percent are expected to follow suit in the near future, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Money market analysts said that the moves were expected given
the inflationary pressures in the economy and the upward movement
in the 91-day treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
The treasury bill rate, which determines the movement of other
money market rates, shot up by two percentage points last week to
50.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe recommended that in such an
environment, short-term investment remains the best option as
banks are likely to revise upwards their lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan VP Calls for More Attention to Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Young people ... lack working skills and are prone to drugs,
smoking, violence and HIV/AIDS. So they are the most vulnerable
group in the society in a sense," the vice-president said in a
speech read at the official launching of the World Population
Report 1999 here on Wednesday evening..
</P>
<P>
In the speech read for her by Minister of General Duties in the
Prime Minister's Office Mondo Kagonyera, the vice-president urged
the government at both national and district levels as well as
non-governmental organizations to give more attention to youth.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has a population of 22.1 million people and about 80
percent are under the age of 30, according to the latest
information released by the Population Secretariat under the
Ugandan Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
"The future challenges are too important to be left to the
government alone. We need participation of all interested
groups," said the vice- president.
</P>
<P>
Confessing that the government has a long way to go to
remarkably improve the quality of the youth's life, she reaffirmed
the government's commitment to continue to invest in education
programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Defense Ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries on
Wednesday called for a collective approach to intervention in wars
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, making the call at a two-day meeting in the
Swaziland capital of Mbabane, were seeking to clarify the SADC
approach to intervention in conflicts in any of its 14 member
states, Swazi Foreign Minister Albert Shabangu said in his opening
address.
</P>
<P>
The defense commanders of all SADC states attended the opening
session apart from those from the war-wracked nations of Angola
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), who were still
expected, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Shabangu, head of SADC's committee on interstate defense and
security, said peace and security were essential for economic
development in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace and security, all the work in producing goods
would have been wasted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shabangu said talks were under way to include foreign ministers
in discussions on a new protocol on intervention in conflicts in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Mbabane meeting, due to end late Thursday, follows talks on
the protocol in Pretoria on Monday between Shabangu and the
defense ministers of South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, South Africa and Botswana on behalf of SADC launched a
joint military intervention in the troubled kingdom of Lesotho to
quell a coup.
</P>
<P>
Later in the year, several SADC states were intervening in the
DRC, taking sides with different parties in the conflict after the
Tutsi-led rebels launched an uprising against the government of
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
All parties to that conflict have signed a ceasefire accord,
but sporadic fighting is still being reported.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls EU Integration on Balkan's Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Isolating Serbia and Belgrade
from reconstruction efforts will not serve any purpose, Italian
Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international convention on reconstruction in
the Balkans in Italy's south city of Ancona, Fassino underlined
that the international community should not exclude Serbia from
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Isolating Serbia and Belgrade from reconstruction efforts will
not serve any purpose," he said, adding that "the international
community's policy should therefore be to maintain relations while
pressing for change."
</P>
<P>
"The only way to bring peace and stability to the region is the
prospect of European integration bringing the Balkans closer to
the European Union," Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
The matter of European integration, one of the "pillars for
stability" cannot, however, be resolved in two or three years,
Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a long process, especially since the various phases
of EU enlargement have already been defined," the minister said,
adding, "it is important, however, to lay out our objectives."
</P>
<P>
It is also important that efforts to re-build the economy in
the region should continue, Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic reconstruction will lead to social and moral
reconstruction, it will help heal the country's awful wounds,
which were opened up by the war," the minister said.

MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The world's population will
reach 6 billion on October 12 this year, a U.N. official predicted
here Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Nizamuddin, of the U.N.'s Population Foundation, said
the population will have grown by 1 billion in just 12 years.
People younger than 25 will make-up nearly one-half of the
population and the 15-24 age group alone will total 1 billion.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, Nizamuddin said, the earth's population may increase
to 8.9 billion, Interfax said, quoting an annual Population Fund
report.
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the population suffer from malnutrition and
shortage of protein, 2 billion are anemic, one-third of the
population has no access to running water, modern medical services
are not available to one-fifth of the population. Nearly 20
percent of the world's children do not attend primary schools.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa have held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
bilateral and multilateral issues at the United Nations
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The talks were "cordial and very fruitful," according to a
report by Mkapa's press secretary Geoffrey Nkurlu from New York
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents held the talks Tuesday after both had
addressed the U. N. General Assembly to articulate their positions
on matters facing their countries and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is on a working visit to the United States, flew to
Atlanta, Georgia Wednesday morning and later visited the CNN

<P>
The Tanzanian President will receive an honorary Ph.D. degree
Thursday at Morehouse University College and is scheduled to visit
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Denktash to Pay Political Price if Refuses Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Government Spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said in New York Wednesday that Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash would pay political price if he
refuses to take part in talks over the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, who is on a visit in the
United States, and the U.S. Presidential envoy for Cyprus Alfred
Moses discussed Wednesday the preparations for a new round of
talks aimed at a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou, who was accompanying the president, told reporters
after the meeting that the meeting "did not focus only on
procedural issues, but rather on issues which would secure the
success of the talks, if they take place."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. has put forward any proposals,
Papapetrou said "there was an exchange of views on all issues
including the basic aspects of the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. believes that United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan is committed by U.N. Security Council resolutions to send
invitations to the two sides in Cyprus for talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiate for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their June summit in Cologne, Germany, asked the U.N. chief to
invite leaders of the two communities to unconditional
negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has said he expects to be invited to talks in the
second half of October.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of holding such meetings remains gloomy
as Denktash insists that he would not enter into negotiations
unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus, recognized only by
Turkey, be internationally recognized and talk with Nicosia on
equal basis.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Urges to Improve Human Living Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) Wednesday urged peoples of the world to
make efforts to improve their lives when the new millenium comes.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based UNFPA, which was established in 1966, made
the appeal here at the launching of the 1999 State of the World
Population Report with a theme "A Time for Choices".
</P>
<P>
The UN agency said the fate of the world population largely
depends on the decision and action taken in the next decade,
particularly on actions to increase education, promote gender
equality and ensure the universal exercise of the right to health.
</P>
<P>
The world population has passed the six billion mark, rising by
about 78 million a year, according to the UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
More than one billion people are still deprived of basic needs
while one third have no access to clean water and one fifth to
modern health services.
</P>
<P>
Despite progress on women's health and lives, hundreds of
millions of women continue to suffer from gender-based violence,
unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and ill health, the UNFPA
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ethiopian government, the UNFPA and
pertinent non- government organizations attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The "Day of Six Billion" population will be observed on October
12 this year, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy Falls in  Africa Due to High AIDS </HEADLINE>

Prevalence
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy in the
African continent is suffering heavily from the AIDS pandemic,
the leading cause of death in the continent and the fourth most
common cause of death worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"In demographic terms, the future effect of AIDS is likely to
be relatively limited on the global scale, but it will have a
devastating impact on several African countries," according to
the World Population Report 1999 launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that out of the 34 countries most affected by
HIV/AIDS, 29 are in Africa. The average life expectancy at birth
in these countries is currently seven years less than it would
have been in the absence of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"In Botswana, with the world's highest HIV/AIDS prevalence
rates, one of every four adults is infected and the life
expectancy has fallen from 61 in the late 1980s to 47 today," the
76-page report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, the second-hardest-hit country, one in five
adults is infected. Estimated life expectancy at birth is 44
years and will fall to 41 in 2000-2005, 25 years less than what
would be expected in the absence of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 33.4 million people who are HIV positive in
the world now, 70 percent of whom are living in Africa. The
pandemic has a terrible effect on individuals and communities, as
it strikes down working people, orphans children and places huge
strains on health care and social systems.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Continues Efforts for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A 100-day long debt
cancellation campaign in Zambia will focus on advocacy by
continuing to collect signatures to add to the 300,000 that have
already been collected.
</P>
<P>
Jack Zulu, national coordinator Jubilee 2000 Zambia, said here
 Wednesday that the Zambian debt project had renewed its efforts
to make debt cancellation a reality before the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee 2000 is an international debt cancellation campaign
aiming to provide hope for the indebted millions around the world.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said the debt cancellation project in Zambia will also
carry out educational campaigns targeted at schools, churches,
non-governmental organizations and all other concerned
individuals.
</P>
<P>
It will also engage in research to try and find out mechanisms
for guaranteeing that any resources freed from that are
accountable and effective.
</P>
<P>
Without debt cancellation poor countries worldwide would not
experience any sustainable development as reflected by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) report, said Zulu.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, everyone of the 10 million Zambians owes
650 U.S. dollars to international creditors.
</P>
<P>
According to a human development report released by the UNDP,
sub- Saharan African countries are at the bottom of human
development index.
</P>
<P>
About 260 million people in the region are subsisting on less
than one dollar per day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large debt burden motivates a lot of poor
countries to lower labor standards as they engage in a desperate
struggle to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide anti-debt campaign, organized by the Jubilee 2000
group, is underway to lobby donor countries and international
lending institutions to cancel the unpayable debt for the
impoverished countries of the world by the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rises as OPEC Sticks to Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures rose on
Wednesday after first stumbling slightly as the markets responded
to mixed signals over increasing U.S. crude stocks and the message
from OPEC ministers that output cuts were to stay.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend crude abandoned early gains after the
Energy Information Administration (EIA) caught the market off
guard with news of U.S. crude reserves actually rose last week
rather than fell, as previously thought, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
But the November contract swiftly recovered to trade 22 cents
higher at 22.90 U.S. dollars a barrel as OPEC President and
Algerian Oil Minister Youssef Yousfi told the cartel's
policy-making conference in Vienna that the oil market remained
fragile and stocks high.
</P>
<P>
The EIA said U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels last
week, contradicting earlier American Petroleum Institute figures
which pointed to a substantial fall in reserves to near two-year
lows.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the high EIA figure caused short-term jitters as
the market considered the impact of OPEC's supply curbs on the
world's biggest oil consumer, but was soon overshadowed by
reassuring comments from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
"(Brent) came off after the EIA numbers but then it bounced
right back up...Everyone's forgotten about (the stocks data) now,"
Reuters quoted one broker as saying. "We're just watching out for
OPEC now."
</P>
<P>
Yousfi noted that equilibrium between supply and demand was
only just beginning to emerge, saying: "This assessment also shows
that there is no shortage of oil in the market, and that stock
levels are still high and could,at any time, have a negative
impact on prices."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that with the continuation of the same high
degree of compliance by member countries witnessed to date, up to
March 2000, we shall attain a better and more sustainable
equilibrium," he was quoted as telling oil ministers.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices have more than doubled this year since OPEC
introduced supply curbs and began holding back 4.3 million barrels
a day. But ministers want to be sure last year's oil glut, which

</P>
<P>
Some analysts have predicted a supply shortfall in the northern
hemisphere winter months as a result of the OPEC cuts, which could
push prices too high and subsequently stunt demand growth. But
OPEC seemed content to allow prices to rise further to help
restore member states' shrivelled revenues, Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says World Economic Situation Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund released the World Economic Outlook here today, predicting a
global economic growth of about 3 percent in 1999, 0.7 percent
higher than that projected in May this year. The global growth
rate for 2000 would be 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Global economic and financial conditions have improved markedly
after the turbulence in emerging markets in 1997-98, which gave
rise to fears of a widespread credit crunch and global recession,
and most of the economies recently in crisis have begun to
recover, said the IMF report.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that financial market confidence has
been returning in most of the emerging market economies affected
by the crisis, allowing monetary conditions to ease and setting
the stage for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
For all the Asian crisis economies, growth projections for 1999
have been revised up significantly, and the economic overturns in
Brazil and Russia have been shallower that expected earlier, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have recovered, and declines in many other commodity
prices have been arrested, providing relief for some
commodity-exporting countries affected by the ripple effects of
the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
There has also been an upward revision of growth in Japan,
where there was a significant rise in activity in the first half
of 1999 following the steep contraction during 1997-98,. And the
projected strengthening of growth in Europe seems to be
materializing, while the impressive U.S. expansion has continued,
amid few signs of emerging price or wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
Global growth appears to have bottomed out at 2.5 percent in
1998, in what the projections suggest will have been the mildest
of the four slowdowns in the world economy in the past three
decades, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Economic Outlook projections, Advanced
economies will grow 2.8 percent and 2.7 percent respectively in
1999 and 2000, 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent higher respectively
that the figure projected in May.
</P>
<P>
Economies of the developing countries will grow 3.5 percent and
4.8 percent in 1999 and 2000 respectively, 0.4 percent higher and
0.1 percent lower than predicted earlier. China's economic growth
is predicted to be 6.6 percent and 6.0 percent in 1999 and 2000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Countries in transition such as Russia will grow 0.8 percent
and 2.8 percent in 1999 and 2000 respectively, 1.7 percent and 0.3
percent higher than earlier projected.
</P>
<P>
However, the report cautioned that many challenges remain to be
addressed to ensure that these recoveries are sustainable, and to
foster stronger and more stable growth in the world economy in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
There is particular reason for concern about the unbalanced
pattern of growth observed recently among the major industrial
countries and about the economic and financial consequences
worldwide if the eventual demand slowdown in the United States
turns out to be sharper than is generally expected at present.
</P>
<P>
While the return to broad price stability remains an important
policy achievement, macroeconomic instability has persisted in
much of the world economy, continuing to pose challenges for, and
in many ways making new demands on, economic policies.
</P>
<P>
If growth were to weaken significantly in the U.S. without
offsets in Japan and Europe, there would also be reason for
concern about the sustainability of the recoveries underway in the
Asian economies recently in crisis, and much of Latin America
would be particularly vulnerable under such a scenario.
</P>
<P>
An additional risk factor relates to potential financial
market reactions to actual or perceived Y2K compliance problems
in emerging market, the report said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
voted 93-5 to pass the nation's defense bill for the fiscal year
2001.
</P>
<P>
The 288.9-billion-U.S.-dollar bill includes a military pay
raise and a 4.4 percent across-the-board increase in Defense
Department spending, including more money for military housing and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the measure on a 375-45 vote last week, and
the bill was sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
The defense bill authorizes the full 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
for production of six supersonic, radar-evading F-22 warplanes. A
separate House spending bill endorsed cutting those funds, and the
issue was to be taken up by a joint House-Senate negotiating
committee later Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Personnel Sent to Discuss East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Thai military
personnel has been sent to Australia to discuss and decide areas
where Thai peacekeepers will be in charge in East Timor, Supreme
Commander of Thai Armed Forces General Mongkon Ampornpisit said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A five-member team of Thai strategic planners flew to Canberra
to coordinate and work out for Thailand's assigned areas with
other countries taking part in the United Nation-led peacekeeping
force in East Timor, or Interfet.
</P>
<P>
A batch of Thai peacekeepers will then be sent to the territory
next month after the strategic planners reach agreement with other
parties over the responsible areas, Mongkon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Songkit Chakkabat and 33 members of the
76-strong advance team have returned from East Timor from a
preparation trip there.
</P>
<P>
Songkit, who is also Interfet's deputy commander, reported to
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai that the team had met with other
advance teams from 15 countries in Darwin, Australia, before
traveling to Dili, the capital of East Timor, and Baucau, a small
town located 100 kilometers east of Dili.
</P>
<P>
He said his team was welcomed by Indonesian troops, and "the
geographic survey with good cooperation from the Indonesian
military has achieved a set goal, ensuing anticipated
accomplishment of the Thai mission in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
Bloody violence has erupted in East Timor after a majority of
its people voted for independence from Indonesia on August 30,
prompting the international community to pool troops and
assistance to help return the territory back to peace.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Million Tanzanians Suffering from AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- More than half a
million people in his country are suffering from AIDS, a Tanzanian
minister said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State Edward Lowassa said that although only
109,863 AIDS cases are reported, it is estimated that over 550,000
are already suffering from the deadly disease in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
When launching the State of World Population 1999 Report,
Lowassa said that over 1.5 million Tanzanians are infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The minister compared the figures to those of neighboring
Uganda where 1. 9 million people are HIV positive while there are
500,000 reported AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
At present, the HIV status of blood donors in Tanzania stands
at 10 percent, compared with five percent ten years ago, Lowassa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania has 300,000 children orphaned by victims of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony of launching the population report, Teferi
Seyoum, representative of the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), said that the worldwide new HIV/AIDS infections count 11
a minute, more than 15,000 a day and more than 5.7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Over half of those infected are young people below the age of
24.

<HEADLINE> China on New Security Concept and International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary to
foster a new security concept that satisfies the needs of the
times and to explore new ways of maintaining peace and security,
China said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said the core of the new security concept should be mutual trust,
mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The five principles of peaceful coexistence and the purposes of
the U.N. Charter are the political foundation for the maintenance
of international security, and mutually-beneficial cooperation and
common development, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that some recent negative developments in
international situation have seriously hindered the healthy
development of the disarmament process, and how to promote the
disarmament process, prevent arms race and maintain international
security have become a pressing concern for the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to any attempt to seek military strength that
goes beyond the needs of legitimate defense of a country under an
unreal excuse, and China is also opposed to any attempt to
restrict and weaken other countries in the name of disarmament and
non-proliferation in order to seek absolute unilateral security
supremacy for one country or group of countries, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang called on the international community to take the new
security concept as a guidance and promote the healthy development
of the disarmament process thoroughly in the interests of world
peace and security.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday it has arrested 93 people in a crackdown on one of the
largest drug cartels in Mexico, seized nearly 20 million U.S.
dollars and seven million U.S. dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
The two-year investigation, dubbed "Operation Impunity," was
conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug
enforcement Administration and Customs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press (AP) said key to the success was
apprehension of three alleged "cell heads" working for the drug
trafficking organization that remained after the death of Amado
Carillo Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Attorney General Janet Reno said,"The
impact of Operation Impunity is significant."
</P>
<P>
"By targeting the cartel's importation, transportation and
distribution network we have substantially hindered their ability
to move cocaine and other drugs into and around this country,"
Reno added.

<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and India on Wednesday
signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at bolstering
cooperation in upgrading Egypt's software industry.
</P>
<P>
The memo was inked by the General Arab Organization and the
Social Fund for Development (SFD) on the Egyptian side and the
Bae-Hal-and-Bel Foundation for India, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foundation is specialized in developing computer
software, programs, and manufacturing electronics and spare parts
of computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
The memo came as a quick response to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's call on state institutions to work out plans of action
to upgrade Egypt's software industry, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the General Arab Organization will set up
an advanced training center with the help of the Indian foundation
to train professional programmers and, meanwhile, manufacture
low-cost personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Salah Halabi, head of the organization, said at the signing
ceremony that his organization plans to establish an international
consultancy house for programming.
</P>
<P>
Halabi said the organization focuses on developing high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU, Zimbabwe Hold Talks on Fund Disbursement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the Zimbabwean Ministry of Finance are expected to come up with a
framework that will assist in the disbursement of 34 million U.S.
dollars to help the economic reforms in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
EU economic adviser Jose Leandro said here Wednesday that the
two sides are holding technical discussions ahead of the release
of the fund.
</P>
<P>
"We are not setting up new conditions but merely looking at
issues within the general framework under the action plan program
which was adopted by the (Zimbabwean) government for its economic
reforms," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Leandro as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the government is doing all it can to
implement measures set by the IMF (International Monetary Fund)
for its economic reforms," the EU official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU was also waiting to see Harare's commitment to
education and health especially when it came to budget
allocations.
</P>
<P>
The talks come a month after the IMF released a 193
million-dollar balance of payment support to Zimbabwe and signed
an agreement with Harare to implement a program to stabilize the
macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leandro said EU's board would meet in December to
decide on the release of a 11.4-million-Euro support to Zimbabwe's
educational sector.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently approved 5.2 million dollars in support of the
Zimbabwean land reform program following a land donor conference
held in Harare last year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Officials' Phones Tapped: House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri Wednesday renewed his accusation that the country's
officials' phones are being tapped.
</P>
<P>
"The phone tapping is being conducted for purpose of security,
politics and judiciary and need to be legalized in a mechanism
which can make the practice serve the country's security rather
than infringe on public freedom," he told local guests.
</P>
<P>
His claim came in the wake of a parliamentary investigation
into telephone tapping, which sparked a controversy last week
after contradictory statements by Interior Minister Michel Murr
and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
Murr denied authorities were tapping Lebanese phones, while the
head of the General Security Services, Brigadier General Jamil
Sayed, told parliament last week there was tapping.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lebanese former Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul
threw another heavy bombshell on the issue by accusing the United
States of having a spy station near the Lebanese Defense Ministry
and presidential palace on the eastern edge of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
He said the surveillance equipment had long been used by the
U.S. for regional monitoring to serve Israel's interests.
</P>
<P>
His statements prompted his successor Ghazi Zuetir and the
judiciary to demand immediate clarifications, although the
U.S. embassy in Beirut has declined to make any comments on it.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul added he was prepared to accompany Zuetir to
investigate the purported location of the equipment.

<HEADLINE> UK Expert Warns of Human "Mad Cow" Disease Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain could face an epidemic
of human "mad cow" disease in the years ahead, with the cases
possibly running to thousands and the true scale of the problem
not known for 15 years, Britain's chief medical officer has
warned.
</P>
<P>
In a report to British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown,
Professor Liam Donaldson, British government's chief medical
adviser, said the number of cases of new variant of CJD
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease), the human form of "mad cow" disease,
could range from a few hundred to many thousand.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, first cases of the new variant of CJD
in Britain had been identified three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of June 1999, the total number of people who had
died from the disease was 43. In 1998 alone, 16 people died, a 60
percent increase on 1997, when there were 10 deaths.
</P>
<P>
"What is absolutely certain is that the present relatively low
number of CJD (cases) should not lead anyone to conclude that the
worst is over," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Also in the report, Professor Donaldson said the risk of
catching CJD from eating beef-on-the-bone is "tiny and
unquantifiable" and recommended the lifting of the
beef-on-the-bone ban which has been in place since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, some British scientists disagreed with Professor
Donaldson' prediction, saying that speculation about a CJD
epidemic is "alarmist".
</P>
<P>
Researchers from City University said that they believed there
will be a decline in CJD deaths after this year and these will be
over by 2006.
</P>
<P>
"The total number of (CJD) deaths ever could be as low as 75",
they said Wednesday in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Hardline Faction to Join Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), a
Palestinian hard-line faction, said Wednesday the DFLP has decided
to join the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Taysir Khaled, member of the DFLP political bureau, said the
group made the decision after its leader Nayyef Hawatmeh met
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Cairo, Egypt recently.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh, who runs the DFLP from Damascus, Syria, has said he
would like to return to the West Bank and Gaza. Israel said last
week that there will be no problem for Hawatmeh's return to the
territories since the DFLP leader has not participated in any
terrorist activities against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP would take part in a Palestinian leadership meeting
about the peace talks, and would decide then on its level of
participation in the negotiations, Khaled said.
</P>
<P>
DFLP's decision to take part in the peace talks reflects
efforts made by Arafat to rally more support from Palestinian
factions in peace negotiations with Israel, beyond his own Fatah
movement.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians launched their final-status talks
on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Under the new peace deal signed by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Arafat in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh
earlier this month, the two sides have to work out a framework
agreement on final-status talks by February and a full lasting
treaty by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
or PFLP, have stayed out of peace-making process with Israel so
far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Sues tobacco Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Justice Department
filed a lawsuit against eight major tobacco companies Wednesday to
recover billions of dollars taxpayers have spent on
smoking-related illnesses, Attorney General Janet Reno announced.
</P>
<P>
"In the complaint, the United States alleges that for the past
45 years, the companies that manufacture and sell tobacco have
waged an intentional and coordinated campaign of deceit," Reno
told a news conference in announcing the civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
She says the campaign has been aimed at preserving what she
calls the "enormous profits" of the companies -- no matter what
the cost would be in human lives, human suffering and medical
resources.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, alleges that
the cigarette companies conspired since the 1950s to defraud and
mislead the American public and to conceal information about the
effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
The eight companies are Philip Morris Inc., Philip Morris
Companies, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., American Tobacco Co., Brown
$ Williamson Tobacco Co. Inc., Liggett and Myers Inc., The Council
for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Inc. and the Tobacco Institute Inc.
</P>
<P>
"Smoking is the nation's largest preventable cause of death and
disease, and American taxpayers should not have to bear the
responsibility for the staggering costs," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We filed a lawsuit that seeks to recover from the tobacco
companies the billions of dollars that American taxpayers spend
each year on tobacco-related illnesses," she said. ``On behalf of
the taxpayers, we are asking the tobacco companies to pay their
fair share."
</P>
<P>
Reno said the aim of the lawsuit is to "require the tobacco
companies to restore the funds that they acquired through their
unlawful conduct.... I pledge today that we will work tirelessly
to see that justice is done."
</P>
<P>
"The Justice Department is taking the right course of action:
It is time for America's taxpayers to have their day in court,"
President Bill Clinton said in a statement after the suit was
filed.
</P>
<P>
The American Lung Association, in a quick response to welcome
the lawsuit, said tobacco companies must be held accountable for
the death, disease and economic burdens caused by their products.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government now spends an estimated 22 billion
dollars each year on smoking-related illnesses," the association
said. "More than half of it is paid by Medicare. For too long,
these costs have been unfairly borne by U.S. taxpayers."
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit poses a major new legal threat to the tobacco
industry, which has already been faced with lawsuits filed by
states and individual smokers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's lawsuit was a new setback for the tobacco industry
which agreed in November 1998 to pay 46 states 206 billion dollars
in a broad deal to treat smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has strongly questioned the government's
authority to bring such a lawsuit, saying the lawsuit was
"legally meritless" and would fail in court.

<P>
CHENGDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first domestic-made
550,000 kilowatt hydropower generating unit went into formal
operation today at the Ertan Hydropower Station in southwest China
's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The unit, jointly produced by the Harbin Electrical Machinery
Works in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and the Shanghai-
based Dongfang Electrical Machinery Works, is the fifth generating
unit that has gone into formal operation at the Ertan power plant
near Panzhihua city.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, designed with six 550,000 kilowatt generating
units, would be the largest hydropower plant in China when the
last unit goes into operation at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ertan is also China's first hydropower plant to be built
through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
Canada's General Electric Co.(GE) won the contract for the
manufacture of the six generating units through the bidding, but
according to the contract, it would only independently produce the
first two units, while the third and fourth would be a joint
project of GE and the Harbin and Shanghai firms, and the fifth and
sixth would be produced by the Chinese firms alone.
</P>
<P>
Before this project, the most powerful hydropower generating
unit produced by China had the capacity of 320,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan power plant has produced 3.9 billion kilowatt hours
of power since August 1998, when its first generating unit went
into operation.

<HEADLINE> British Trade Delegation to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of more than 50
delegates from British oil, gas, construction and engineering
companies are scheduled to visit Libya next month to forge
business contracts from renewed political goodwill.
</P>
<P>
It will be the biggest British trade mission to Libya since
diplomatic ties between the two countries were broken off 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The trade mission could not be better timed. Libya is in the
process of enjoying an economic renaissance and is actively
seeking out business partners to explore the possibilities of
joint venture," Jeremy Hanley, the trade mission's co-leader, said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The planned trip, from October 3-7, comes less than three
months after the two countries announced they were resuming
diplomatic relations when Tripoli agreed to cooperate in
investigations into the death of a British police-woman in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The police-woman, Yvonne Fletcher, was shot to death outside
Libya's embassy in London. Her death strongly effected the
relation between Libya and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Four years after the death of Fletcher, a Pan-AM airliner was
bombed over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
Britain and the United States accused two Libyan agents of
responsibility to the bombing and requested Libya to send them to
Britain to face trial.

Libya's tourism, railways and airports could also be targets

<HEADLINE> Weak Baht Good for Thai Exports: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government saw no
need to intervene in the market to support the sliding baht as a
weak currency could help exports, Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai told reporters that the government was not concerned
with the temporarily weak baht, as the currency had been
stabilized and the Thai economy had been steadily recovering.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary fluctuation of the baht results from both
external and internal factors, which are believed to last long,"
Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the baht's losses partly to the
lower-than-expected 3.5 percent year-on-year growth of the Thai
gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1999, compared
with an earlier market expectation of up to 8 percent. Fluctuation
of the Japanese yen was also seen as a factor for the weakening of
the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
Thai baht moved to a new year-low of 40.40 to the dollar on
Wednesday.

constituted 2.3 percent of the country's foreign trade volume.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's national telecommunication company Bezeq
has filed a 19 million dollars lawsuit against the U.S. company
AMS Technical System over an agreement signed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Bezeq claimed that the AMS did not meet its commitments made in

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces Permanent Memorial to Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Wednesday that Britain would build a permanent
memorial to late Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
He announced his decision in the mass circulation Mirror
newspaper, which said the memorial would take the form of a
fountain in one of London's royal parks.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a permanent memorial to Princess Diana," Blair
said. "It is very important that we honour the memory of someone
who not only was very dear to people in this country but also
achieved a lot."
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said any plans would be made in
consultation with the Royal family, while there would also be
talks with the Royal Parks over a site for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
Diana's brother, Earl Spencer and Diana's mother, Frances Shand
Kydd, backed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, chairman
of the Princess Diana Memorial Committee, said in a statement that
he would consult the princess's family about the planned memorial.
</P>
<P>
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee has considered
proposals for a fountain in Kensington Gardens. The Princess lived
at Kensington Palace after her marriage to Prince Charles
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Fans of Diana have long been urging Britain to build a memorial
to the princess, who died in a Paris car crash in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President to Attend U.N. Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will leave for New York on
Saturday to attend the last historic session of the United Nations
General Assembly, the Government Information Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that the president, who is
also the finance minister, will also attend the annual meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
She will also have discussions with U.S. officials especially
on the issue of separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
in the aftermath of the Amparai massacre, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE guerrillas, fighting the government since 1983 for a
separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east, have been blamed
for last weekend's massacre of over 50 civilians in the southeast
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The attacks followed LTTE accusations that Sri Lanka's Air
Force had killed 22 Tamil refugees in airstrikes on a village in
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The United States designated the LTTE as a foreign terrorist
organization in October 1997, banning its fund-raising on the
soils of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Mrs. Kumaratunga will also use the
visit to seek support for Sri Lanka's bid to get the top post of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) for its candidate Senaka Bandaranayake.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Meet for Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A tense meeting between two of
the main parties in the Northern Ireland peace talks concluded in
Belfast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour session between the Ulster Unionists and the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, the SDLP described
the meeting as "honest and straight".
</P>
<P>
The meeting was part of former U.S. Senator George Mitchell's
review of progress in implementing the Good Friday Agreement
signed in April last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on seeking ways to breaking the deadlock
over decommissioning and devolution which have blocked political
progress in the province.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two parties have been strained after a
summer of recrimination over the failure to establish a
power-sharing executive and the decision of SDLP deputy leader
Seamus Mallon to quit as deputy first minister.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's meeting, Mallon said the parties had got down
to the heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to give it every effort we have to ensure, if
it can be got, that we do get to a resolution of this problem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
also met Mitchell on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But ahead of that session, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was
downbeat about the chances for success of the review.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for people to work together as opposed to
working against each other," he said. "There needs to be a
political will - that seems to be absent at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as he arrived at the Stormont talks venue, Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble said he was prepared to listen to
what the SDLP had to say but he had been disappointed by recent
attacks on unionists by leading SDLP members.
</P>
<P>
He said he had stated his position "clearly and unambiguously
to Sinn Fein" last night but the question remained whether they
were truly committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's review was sparked by the collapse of talks at
Stormont in July, following the Ulster Unionists' refusal to sit
in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins to decommission
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Trimble and Adams met for two hours at Stormont,
Belfast, but there was no indication that any real progress had
been made.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no breakthrough at the meeting, it did
re-establish a working relationship between Gerry Adams and David
Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Further meetings are expected between Sinn Fein and the Ulster
Unionists but no firm time has been set.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mitchell is expected to make a statement before the
weekend in which he will outline his view of the viability of the
peace process, including the formation of a devolved government
for Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Leads to 200,000 Orphans in S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 children
under the age of 15 will be orphaned due to the affection of
HIV/AIDS in South Africa' s KwaZulu-Natal Province by the year
2000, the National Assembly's welfare committee heard Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation on the implications of HIV/AIDS, Mary Caesar,
national coordinator of the AIDS Legal Network, said about 75
percent of hospital beds in the province were currently occupied
by children suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 12,000 children throughout the country
were already HIV positive, she said.
</P>
<P>
Children in affected households might not be infected, but the
disease would have negative impact on them before and after the
death of their parents because they would have to leave school and
get jobs to supplement household income.
</P>
<P>
She said the death of a parent would also have a psychological
effect because the child would be deprived of love.
</P>
<P>
Sian Hasewinkel, a social worker with Cape Town Child Welfare,
said in an article published by South African Press Association
Wednesday that her organization had started a program to make
people realize that AIDS was not just an adult disease and to
mobilize partnerships between government, business, service
providers and communities.
</P>
<P>
She said strengthening families' capacity to cope with the
disease was important.
</P>
<P>
Community-based day care needed to be linked with health so
that children could be overseen on a number of levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Hegemonism and power
politics are the root causes for the turmoil in the world today,
China stressed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said the outbreak of war in Kosovo has sounded a loud alarm for
the world.
</P>
<P>
A regional military organization, in the mane of "humanitarian"
and "human rights," bypassed the United Nations and took military
actions against a sovereign state, which created an ominous
precedent in international relations, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
This act is a violation of the UN Charter and other
universally-recognized norms governing international relations, it
has eroded the leading role of the United Nations in safeguarding
world peace and security and gravely undermined the authority of
the U.N. Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
maintained that the Kosovo issue should be resolved through
peaceful negotiations on the basis of respect for the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and guarantee of the legitimate rights and interest of all ethnic
groups in Kosovo, Tang added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
called for peaceful settlement of international disputes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said the principle of the peaceful settlement of international
disputes initiated by the Hague Peace Conference held 100 years
ago is now an important principle of the U.N. Charter and a basic
principle of contemporary international law.
</P>
<P>
Tang said in the current international situation, adherence to
the principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is
still of major immediate significance.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful settlement of international disputes is predicted on
the non-use and non-threat of force in international relations,
and China maintained that to handle state-to-state relations with
mentality of "hot war", "cold war", "power politics" or "bloc
politics" would get nowhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be
resolved justly and fairly through peaceful negotiation and
consultation on the basis of equality, rather by arbitrary use or
threat of force on strength of military superiority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can there be a fundamental solution to
disputes or conflicts without complicating or aggravating them or
leaving a hidden peril behind, and only in this way can state
co-exist in harmony and attain common prosperity, he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China said here
Wednesday that the current international economic system should be
reformed to promote common development for all countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
took the floor at the general debate of the 54th General Assembly
session, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The old and irrational economic order has seriously impeded
the sound development of world economy, further widening the gap
of wealth between the North and the South," he said.
</P>
<P>
The East Asian financial crisis that broke out two years ago
has affected many countries in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent financial risks and ensure economic security has
become an urgent task facing many countries, especially the
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world economy is an inter-related and indivisible whole,"
he said, "All members of the international community should step
up cooperation and jointly promote a steady growth of world
economy in a responsible and risk-sharing spirit."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is necessary to reform the current international
economic and financial systems," he said, "The United Nations and
the international financial institutions should earnestly
construct a framework to prevent an overcome financial and other
economic risks."
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the developed countries should undertake more
obligations," he said, "The developing countries have the right to
equal participation in world economic decision-making and
formulation of relevant rules."
</P>
<P>
In the new round of negotiations that will soon begin in the
World Trade Organization, the reasonable demands of developing
countries should be fully reflected, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation should be strengthened on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit," he said, "No country should prejudice other
countries' economic security and development by virtue of its
economic, technological and financial advantages," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should all oppose trade discrimination, the rich bullying
the poor and arbitrary resort to economic sanctions or threat of
sanctions against other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The developed and developing countries both have their own
advantages and should learn from each other to make up for their
deficiencies, so as to achieve common sustainable development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, on such global issues as environment, population,
poverty and debt, the developed countries shoulds not shirk their
responsibility and obligation, but rather, they should take the
lead in providing technological and financial assistance to the
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We deem it necessary for the United Nations to hold a special
conference at an appropriate time to discuss the globalization of
world economy, in order to promote international cooperation in
this field and common prosperity," he said.

<P>
Tang told the U.N. General Assembly that "we are willing to
continue to develop friendly relations and cooperation on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with all
other countries in the world and make our due contribution to
safeguarding world peace and promoting common development."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement as China is poised to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on October 1.

UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan Wednesday said that "the Chinese Government
and people will, as always, resolutely safeguard China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continue to advance the
great cause of national reunification."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister made the statement as he took the
floor at the general debate of the 54th General Assembly session,
which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact universally recognized by the international
community that there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan
is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and that the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing the whole of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's territory and sovereignty are absolutely indivisible,"
he said. "To realize the ultimate reunification of the motherland
represents the common aspiration and firm resolve of all the
Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, and no force can
hold them back."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government will continue to adhere to the set
policy for settlement of the Taiwan question," he said. "We are
firmly opposed to any attempt to create 'Taiwan independence,'
'two Chinas', or 'one China, one Taiwan'," he said.

<P>
"All moves to split the motherland are doomed to failure," he
said. "China's great cause of national reunification must be

<HEADLINE> China on UN Role And Authority of Security Council (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The role of the United
Nations is indispensable to the achievement of genuine peace and
development and to the establishment of a just and reasonable new
international order, China said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said to strengthen the role of U.N. goes with the historical
trend, meets the needs of the times and conforms to the shared
aspiration of all people in the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the role of U.N., efforts should first
be made to uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of
the U.N. Charter, and the most important reason for which the U.N.
has been able to grow from 51 founding members to its current size
is that it has acted according to these purposes and principles,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
It is the view of the Chinese Government that despite the great
changes that have taken place in the international situation, the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are still
relevant, and China is opposed to any irresponsible interpretation
or revision of them, under whatever excuses, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the role of U.N. is to be strengthened, the authority of the
Security Council must be preserved, and any act to weaken this
authority or to impose the will of an individual country or a
group of countries on the Security Council is very dangerous, and
will further breed power politics and hegemonism and give rise to
endless troubles, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. role to be strengthened, it is essential to ensure
to all member states the rights to equal participation in
international affairs, so that their reasonable propositions will
be fully reflected and their legitimate rights and interests
protected by the U.N, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Decisions made by the UN must give expression to the common
will of the majority of its members, and any attempt by a few
countries or a group of countries to monopolize world affairs and
decide the destiny of the people of other countries goes against
the trend of the times and will never succeed, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> IDB Supports Educational Reform in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan
of 36 million U.S. dollars to Colombia to initiate an educational
reform process.
</P>
<P>
The reform process aims to strengthen decentralized, autonomous
management of schools, improve efficiency and social equity in the
allocation of resources, and to improve quality of educational
services. It will also ensure that students in participating
schools are offered the full cycle of basic education, grades one
to nine. It will also ensure access to transparent information and
performance evaluations and promote citizens's participation in
the school system, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
As a demonstration, during these initial steps in the
transformation of the educational system, the reforms in the
management and resource allocation will be carried out in a
limited number of departments (five to eight) and municipalities
(100 to 160); between 500 and 800 schools offering all grades of
basic education will be established under the program, through the
reorganization and consolidation of existing schools.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the program by departments, municipalities,
and schools will be voluntary. The participating departments will
sign agreements with the National Ministry of Education to
undertake the refrom process. The program will finance technical
assistance, as well as incentives, to carry out the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is 76 million dollars. The IDB
loan is for a 25-year term, with a four-year grace period, at the
variable annual interest rate, now 6.84 percent. Local counterpart
funds total 40 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, with a population
of 12.5 million, saw its population growth down to 1.4 percent,
but it would have been 2.4 percent were it not for the AIDS
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 1999 State of the World Population Report,
Zimbabwean State Planning Minister Swithun Mombeshora said on
Wednesday that it was disheartening that HIV/AIDS is the
significant culprit for the fall.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, average life expectancy now standing
at 44 years was expected to fall to 41 in the years between 2000
and 2005, 25 years less than what would be expected in the
absence of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS. About 1.4 million adults, or 25.8
percent of sexually active adults between 15 and 49 years are
thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative AIDS cases since 1985 are estimated to be 650,000.
More than 700 people die every week from HIV/AIDS-related disease.
</P>
<P>
Mombeshora said that even though there was a decrease in
population growth, many people were still living in poverty.

PARIS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here Wednesday that he believes France will play a role
in the peace process between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that France will play a role and will have an
influence of good will," said Barak after holding talks with
French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
A close advisor of Barak said earlier Wednesday that Israel is
opposed to a French mediation in the future talks between Israel
and Syria, which have been suspended since March 1996.
</P>

Barak also said that Israel is looking for a "formula" for
resuming talks with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that he understands that Lebanon is a country which is
very close to France in historical and traditional terms.
</P>
<P>
He also expected to reach an agreement with Syria within 12 to
15 months, but the implementation of such an agreement will take a
longer time.
</P>
<P>
Barak also promised that Israeli troops will withdraw from
southern Lebanon by July 2000, a date from which "the Israeli army
will ensure the country's security from the international
frontier."

LUANDA, September 22 (xinhua) -- Angola is in heavy debt to
Portugal, with the amount of the official debts reaching 679
million U.S. dollars by the end of 1998, official news agency
Angop reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Angola's official debts to the Portuguese government
has increased by four percent, or 24 million dollars, from 655
million dollars in 1997.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Latvia Wednesday
voiced its full support to the U.N. reform, and its hope to see
the United Nations play a more important role in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Vaira Vike-Freigberga, president of
Latvia, addressed the session at the general debate of the 54th
General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"The reform process of the U.N. is underway and my country,
Latvia, fully supports it," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the negative feelings about the U.N. stem from
over-expectation," she said. "One cannot view the U.N. as a
panacea, particularly where decisions on long-lasting regional
problems are concerned or when preventive actions on a regional
level had been long overdue."
</P>
<P>
"Yet, even in those situation a modern U.N. system is expected
to look for earlier and more effective involvement than it has
been the case in Southeast Europe, East Timor and the Middle
East," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be stressed that the painful refugee crisis of
Kosovo could not possibly be resolved without direct involvement
of the U.N. and its institutions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But sadly, the maximum potential of the United Nations cannot
always be utilized because of prejudice, lack of political will
or perceived political ambitions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The topical issues of cooperation at regional and global level
and conflict prevention, non-proliferation, arms control and
disarmament, humanitarian, environmental protection, follow-up to
U.N. conferences, poverty eradication and gender equality need to
be addressed on a global scale, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, the United Nations and its institutions
have to play an increasingly important role to this end," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate of the United Nations is to serve humanity, and
the United Nations should observe the principle of universality,"
she said. "The U.N.'s possibilities in conflict prevention and
preventive diplomacy are by no means exhausted and further
attention should be paid to fostering the observance of these
principles throughout the world."

PARIS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Wednesday that there
exists a historical chance for Israel and its Arab neighbors to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely convinced that there is today a historical
chance to arrive at peace, at the peace of the brave men, at an
end of the conflict between Israel and its immediate neighbors,"
said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak after holding two hours of

</P>
<P>
For his part, Chirac said that peace is again within sight and
that all men and women of good will in the Middle East should
seize the chance to obtain it.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that a chance will not always be there and the
people with wisdom should lose no time and work out a clear
timetable.
</P>
<P>
"That (the chance) cannot last long. Thus the wisdom should let
all the people make the necessary efforts to arrive definitely at
peace. The idea of limiting the time is a good idea," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said that France can play a role in the future talks
between Israel and Syria, in contrast with an earlier declaration
by a senior advisor of his own that Israel is opposed to a French
mediation in such talks.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Raps Jordan Over Arrest of Its Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Militant Palestinian Resistance
Movement (Hamas) Wednesday condemned Jordan over the arrest of two
of the group's leaders, and hoped the issue can be solved through
dialog and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Hamas made the condemnation in a statement issued Wednesday in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jordanian police arrested two leaders of
Hamas and denied the entry to the third into the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Mashaal, Moussa Abu Marzuk and Ibrahim Ghosheh, senior
Hamas members who are based in Amman, was detained upon their
arrival at the Amman airport aboard a United Arab Emirates flight
from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the arrests and entry-denial as "unreasonable,"
Hamas held Amman fully responsible for the crackdown and hoped
such an act will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
After a brief interrogation at the airport, police released
Abu Marzuk who holds a Yemeni passport, but denied his entry into
Jordan and asked him to "leave the country for any destination he
wishes".
</P>
<P>
The other two men, who are Jordanian citizens, faced charges of
engaging in illegal political activities in the kingdom and a
possible one-year prison term if convicted under the Jordanian
law.
</P>
<P>
The arrests are apparently another step by Jordanian
authorities to crack down on the Hamas movement after police shut
down the Hamas office in Amman and arrested 12 of its members on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
Police also issued arrest warrants against Hamas spokesman
Ibrahim Ghosheh, former politburo chief Abu Marzuk, current leader
of the movement`s politburo Khaled Mashaal and Hamas representative
in Jordan Mohammad Nazzal, who were then on a visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The whereabout of Mohammad Nazzal is not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a militant Palestinian organization which
opposes the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and
stands for a "holy war" to liberate all Palestinians territories
to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians but called
for an early resumption of peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians as well as Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Says Money Laundering Fully Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The alleged illegal
diversion of money from Russia to the United States was being
fully investigated, a senior U.S. justice official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Assistant
Attorney General James Robinson said that the investigation has
been and will be "complex and painstaking."
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to become the world's repository of foreign
criminal proceeds," Robinson said, adding that additional tools
were required for law enforcement to combat the problem of money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Also testifying Wednesday, Bank of New York Chairman and Chief
Executive Thomas Renyi admitted before the committee that there
had been a "lapse" in internal controls at his bank, but he
stressed the bank had not been accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The bank had failed to act quickly enough to question large
flows of funds through accounts held by the relatives of one of
the bank's executives.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing these accounts to remain open and active without
sufficient questioning was a lapse on the part of the bank," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration said it will ensure that the full
story was uncovered behind those transactions and bring any
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was reluctant to discuss specifics of the case because
the investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors in New York
City was ongoing, stressing the need to protect witnesses.
</P>
<P>
U.S. media reports said late last month that up to 10 billion
U.S. dollars had been illegally channeled to the Bank of New York,
possibly including some of the loans by the International Monetary

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Tell Clinton New ideas on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton will meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday and
hear him about some new ideas on the Middle East peace process,
the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat requested to meet with the president to review some
of his latest ideas on moving the peace process forward," said
Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the White House national Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the two leaders to meet since
Arafat signed a new peace agreement with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on September 5 and opened the door to talks on a final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Hammer said he did not know what ideas Arafat would tell
President Clinton. He said the United States sees the peace
process as proceeding on track after the revised peace deal was
signed at Sharm el-Sheikhh in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 199 Palestinian prisoners and transferred
a further seven percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority since the revised peace agreement.

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara in New York on

of the peace negotiations on Syria-Israel track. But he said
Syria would continue its contact with the United States seen as
a go-between.

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers to Meet in Tanzania to Facilitate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) said Wednesday that 14 ministers of
its member states will meet in Dar-es-Salaam next month to pave
way for implementing a free trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will address the remaining obstacles to the
free-trade agreement for the region, SADC deputy director Marina
Mayer told South African parliament's trade and industry
committee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is aimed at producing a free-trade bloc in
southern Africa by 2004 and to accelerate the economic development
of the region.
</P>
<P>
But the member states have not agreed on a timetable for
reducing trade barriers between them and on rules-of-origin
provisions of the trade protocol, which determine what percentage
of a product has to be locally produced in a country before it can
be exported at reduced tariffs, she said, quoted by South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Mayer said the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) was
objecting to the percentage of their products other countries,
such as Mozambique and Zimbabwe, want to exclude from tariff
elimination over a number of years.
</P>
<P>
SACU, comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and
Swaziland, is refusing to allow SADC states to export textiles,
clothing and processed agricultural goods that have a high
foreign-made content at reduced tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Mayer said South Africa was hoping that SADC trade ministers
would show the political will to resolve the deadlock on the
issues when they meet in the Tanzanian capital in the last week of
October.
</P>
<P>
If they do not, she said, the South African parliament would
proceed to ratify proposals on rules of origin and the timetable
for the lowering of tariffs which have already been agreed to by
other SACU states.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is planning to ratify the deal before the end of
November. Five other countries presently are in the process of
ratifying it, which would allow implementation to start in
January.
</P>
<P>
Ten spatial development initiatives, which open trade and
development corridors between countries, are expected to be
created as part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, those planned for Angola and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo were unlikely to proceed because of the wars there,
Mayer said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Excavate 18th Century Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An 18th century
shipwreck buried deep in the sea believed to be worth over 120
million rand (20 million U.S. dollars) is to be recovered from off
the coast of Cape Agulhas, Network Radio News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to get under way in February next year.
</P>
<P>
It will be South Africa's first hi-tech deep water
archaeological excavation of a shipwreck ever.
</P>
<P>
The Brederode went down near Cape Agulhas in May 1785 while on
its way home to China. It was carrying a cargo of satin, spices
and tea for the Dutch East India Company.
</P>
<P>
The Brederode is thought to have struck an uncharted reef.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe that the hull of the ship is still
intact under the sand.
</P>
<P>
A unique legal agreement between the salvage team, the National
 Monuments Council and the Maritime Museum has been struck for the
wreck's excavation.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, the exploration team will get the
bulk of the excavated goods, but the museum will get a sample of
everything of cultural or historical importance.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists hope to raise the Brederode's cargo of precious
Chinese porcelain and 80 tons of perfectly-preserved tin.

<HEADLINE> Fed Survey Shows U.S. Economy Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is enjoying
"moderate-to-brisk rates of growth" with rising industrial
activity and strong retail sales in most areas of the country,
the Federal Reserve said in a survey Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, known as the "beige book," said the strong
economy is contributing to widespread labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said, even with the tight labor market, it
had "few reports of acceleration in nominal wages and salaries
although some districts note a substantial upswing in the cost of
health-care benefits." And, consumer prices remain stable, the
survey reported.
</P>
<P>
The "beige book," compiled from reports from its 12 regional
banks, will be used when Fed policy-makers meet Oct. 5 to review
the central bank's stance on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was based on information collected before
Sept. 13, reported strong growth and tight labor markets, but it
also said inflation generally remains subdued.
</P>
<P>
It said that "price pressures at the consumer level remain
mostly calm, and numerous districts report significant increases
in some materials prices" including lumber and plywood for housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said manufacturing activity had accelerated in almost
every district, with Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis Fed
districts reporting solid demand for steel and other metal
products, particularly for the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
The Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis districts noted strong
demand for semiconductors and computer components while the San
Francisco district said demand from markets in East Asia, the area
hardest hit by the global currency crisis, was beginning to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The survey noted that many districts reported strong
back-to-school sales and even stronger demand for new autos.
</P>
<P>
It said the recent drought had worsened crop and livestock
conditions in the East and parts of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond and St. Louis districts rated
corn and soybean crops as in poor to fair condition. The San
Francisco district said adverse weather had lowered the quality
and yield of many grain, fruit and vegetable crops.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported
favorable agriculture conditions with corn and soybean crops rated
as good to excellent with above average yields.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said Wednesday he has gained big support and will look
for more U.S. support for his plan to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, who came to Washington Tuesday after attending the
U.N. Assembly in New York, told reporters that President Bill
Clinton has promised him that the U.S. will provide assistance for
his three-year plan to curb drug trafficking and revive the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Clinton and Pastrana had a 45-minute meeting.
However, the Associated Press quoted a U.S. official as saying
that Clinton did not offer a specific aid amount to Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The United States had indicated that it is willing to provide
material support for the plan but that the bulk of the financing
would have to come from Colombia itself.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana is also expected to meet some Congressional leaders to
gain support for his 7.5 billion U.S. dollars plan.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Liberalize Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government on
Wednesday submitted a bill to the parliament on liberalization of
the country's telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the bill, Deputy Transport and communications
Minister Antonio Fernandes said that the government also intends
to privatize the national telecommunications company, TDM , adding
that the state will maintain a significant shareholding.
</P>
<P>
He argued that bringing private capital into TDM was the only
way to provide it with the muscle to ensure its survival in a
competitive situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the viability study for TDM's privatization
should start in January.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisages opening the cellular phone market to
competition at once. This means that there could be a competitor
to the current operator, M-Cel (a joint venture between TDM and
Deutsche Telecom of Germany), by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But opening the fixed telephone network to competition will
not take place until five years after TDM's privatization.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes argued that the introduction of competition would
push down the price of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
The pailament will debate over the bill on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Second UK Auction Sends Gold Price Surging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The prices of gold leapt
sharply in early European trading Wednesday after a
stronger-than-expected response to the Bank of England's second
auction of its reserves.
</P>
<P>
The sale, in which the Bank received 255.75 U.S. dollars an
ounce for its 25 tonnes, sparked a sharp swing in sentiment
towards the depressed metal, prompting speculators to cover short
positions.
</P>
<P>
Having gained close to 5 U.S. dollars an ounce on Tuesday after
the results came through, gold reached higher still in early
business Wednesday, easily breaking through the 261.20 U.S.
dollars achieved at the first auction and touching a bid high of
263.90 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The strong response did not protect the Bank against further
attacks from the gold industry, led by the World Gold Council,
which repeated its heavy criticism of the move.
</P>
<P>
The Bank does not disclose the prices tendered for the gold or
the names of the bidders. However, Gold Fields, the South African
gold mining giant, confessed to having bought 12.5 percent of the
bullion auctioned Tuesday in the belief that "it was cheap".
</P>
<P>
The first British auction, which took place against a
background of other central bank sales over recent months and the
threat of sales from the International Monetary Fund, had dragged
gold to multiple 20-year lows that bottomed at 251.70 U.S. dollars
on August 25.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Kosovo Shouldn't Be Precedent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany said Wednesday
NATO's armed intervention in Kosovo must not set a precedent for
weakening the U.N.'s role in dealing with humanitarian crises.
</P>
<P>
The move should not be a precedent to weaken the U.N. Security
Council's "monopoly" on authorizing the use of international
force, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told the 54th Session of
the U.N. General Assembly on the third day of its general debate.
</P>
<P>
"Nor must it become a license to use external force under the
pretext of humanitarian assistance," he said, noting that this
"would open the door to the arbitrary use of power and anarchy,
and throw the world back to the 19th century."
</P>
<P>
The only solution to the issue is to further develop the
existing U.N. system "to intervene in good time in cases of very
grave human rights violations," but not until all peaceful means
of settling conflicts have been exhausted and "within a strictly
limited legal and controlled framework."
</P>
<P>
NATO waged a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia on the
pretext of "defending" Kosovo ethnic Albanians from Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The massive military action since March 24 against the
sovereign state of Yugoslavia bypassed the Security Council and
did not get prior consent of the country.
</P>
<P>
It caused a great humanitarian catastrophe by perishing
Yugoslavia's infrastructure and leaving tens of thousands of
people including women and children displaced.

<HEADLINE> Italians Enjoys Car-Free Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian streets were
significantly emptier of traffic Wednesday after a European-wide
initiative aimed at encouraging people to get about town without
their cars.
</P>
<P>
"Italians have proved that they can live without their cars,"
said Environment Minister Edo Ronchi, after many in the 92 Italian
participating cities heeded calls to leave their cars at home and
use public transport instead in an effort to reduce traffic and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently registered a lower volume of traffic in
all cities, even in areas where cars weren't banned from city
centers," said Ronchi, who has championed the cause of
traffic-free city-centers in Italy.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, the Cities Without Cars initiative sponsored by the
European Union was a "resounding" success, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was also significantly reduced in the northern Italian
towns of Trento, Bolzano and Turin where public transport was free
for the day, according to early estimates.
</P>
<P>
However, Milan, Italy's biggest city, disassociated itself from
the car-free day and Mayor Gabriele Albertini said it was a
"useless" stunt which could not take place in his city while
fashion shows were underway.
</P>
<P>
In the central city of Florence, the central Piazza del Duomo
was closed to traffic for four hours Wednesday morning; in another
central city of Bologna traffic rules were as normal.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Databank polling agency for the
environment ministry, some 84 percent of Italians say they favor
keeping cars out of city centers.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that on a normal working Wednesday 63
percent of Italians take their cars to work.

Hefty early losses in London were halved by the close, but the
mood was still one of caution ahead of the 5 October meeting of

The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader measure of the largest
pan-European stocks, lost 0.6 percent to close at 1287.50.
</P>
<P>
The market was also hit by an upward revision in second-quarter
GDP growth from 0.5 to 0.6 percent. Economists said this increased
the chances of another rate hike this year.

Germany's Dax index fell 0.5 percent in thin trade on Wednesday

MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank on
Thursday agreed to grant a loan of 300 million U.S. dollars to
Thailand in a bid to promote the nation's agricultural
productivity.
</P>
<P>
In a news release available late Thursday night, ADB said the
loan is aimed to encourage Thailand to conduct structural reform
in the agricultural sector, which the ADB believes is needed to
remove the sector's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Although agriculture has not been affected directly by the
region's economic crisis, many weaknesses require reform," the ADB
noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the loan, the ADB is providing two technical
assistance grants of 1 million dollars for capacity building in
Thailand's water sector and 750,000 dollars to restructure the
Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for improved
governance.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan is from the bank's ordinary capital resources and
will be repayable in 15 years, including a grace period of three
years, it added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level in 25 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims
for jobless benefits in U.S. dropped last week to the lowest level
in 25 years, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that 272,000 people filed new claims
for unemployment benefits for the week ending Sept. 18, down by
17,000 from the previous week. That was the lowest level since
Jan. 5, 1974, when claims were at 269,000.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, part of the sharp drop could
have been because some unemployed who were affected by Hurricane
Floyd were unable to get to claims offices. But the officials had
no specific data on the storm's effects.
</P>
<P>
The four-week average for claims also was down last week, to
285,750. That was the lowest level since April 21 when claims were
at 284,500.
</P>
<P>
Last week's decrease in new claims was unexpected. Many

<HEADLINE> Trade, Environment Issues to Dominate U.N. Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 small island
nations will use their two days in the global spotlight to seek
international support on trade and environment problems, when the
United Nations focuses on island issues at a special session of
its General Assembly on September 27-28 at the U.N. headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Tuiloma Neroni Slade of Samoa, chair of
the Alliance of Small Island States, at a conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While island nations often conjure up image of "paradise",
their coasts, coral reefs and forests are under increasing stress
from pollution, development, climate change and natural disasters
-- problems often beyond their means or control to solve.
</P>
<P>
"We want to strengthen the partnership between our nations and
the international community," Slade said. "We do not want to be
left behind in the technological advancement."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special session -- to be attended by a number of
island presidents and prime ministers -- will assess progress on
the action plan adopted by more than 100 countries five years ago
at the 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of
Small Island Developing States, held in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties small islands face in an increasingly
competitive global economy was a top issue at preparatory talks
held this past April at the U.N. Commission for Sustainable
Development.
</P>
<P>
Caribbean nations protested recent rulings by the World Trade
Organization against the long-standing trade preferences for their
bananas and other products in European markets. Pacific island
economies have suffered from the financial crisis that has
afflicted their Asian trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The small islands action plan aim to strike a balance for
"sustainable development," which promotes needed economic growth
and improves social well-being while preserving the environment.
This approach was popularized at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, which
called for the Barbados Conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the
disastrous earthquake which struck Taiwan on September 21 had
risen to 2,103 by 5 p.m. this evening, with 7,821 injured, 1,641
feared trapped among the collapsed buildings and 210 missing,
media reports monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
An aftershock measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale hit northwest
Hualien at 8:46 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m., a total of 3,975 aftershocks had been reported
since the tremor struck Tuesday, seismologists said. They said the
aftershocks are becoming fewer as time goes by, but might not stop
completely for two or six months.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the mainland's earthquake monitoring
networks, Tuesday's quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale, with
its epicenter in southwest Hualien, 145 kilometers (90 miles) from
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 6,005 houses have toppled, and another 1,569
houses are uninhabitable. Victims are in great need of tents,
drinking water, and other relief goods, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Taiwan authorities show that traffic on the
main roads in central Taiwan has been completely disrupted, and
596 roads have been closed and will not re-open until September 28.
Repair work of some bridges may require up to two months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quake has loosened rocks in the mountainous area,
leaving the region more vulnerable to mud-rock flow, local sources
warned.
</P>
<P>
Power shortages brought on by the quake have also led to the
suspension of numerous industries in Taiwan, which has incurred
severe economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: Sino-Russian Ties Face Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Russia
Wu Tao said here Thursday that Sino-Russian ties face a bright
future as the two countries march toward the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment
of diplomatic ties between China and Russia, Wu said bilateral
relations have matured.
</P>
<P>
The current Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation
oriented toward the 21st century, featuring non-confrontation, non-
alignment and not targeting a third country, confirms the
fundamental interests of both countries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries are preparing for the autumn visit to
Beijing by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who will hold the
second informal summit with his Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The exact date of the visit is being arranged through
diplomatic channels, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that bilateral economic ties lag behind political
cooperation, Wu said the two sides should work together to
increase their trade in more high-tech and high-value-added
products, to improve the servicing sector of trade and to lower
China's mounting trade deficit with Russia, which has accumulated
to 15 billion U.S. dollars since 1992.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation in the military-technical field, the
ambassador said cooperation has been conducted at an appropriate
level and that China only purchases limited amounts of military
hardware from Russia for defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
Wu also dismissed some Russian media reports that said illegal
Chinese immigrants are swarming into Russia, and the Chinese
government encourages illegal immigration to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said illegal immigrants only account for a very small
percentage of Chinese nationals here and that their action is
motivated by themselves rather than encouraged by China's
government policy.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said it is a good thing for the two countries to
have more personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Chinese border control authorities, Wu said the number
of Russians traveling to China in 1998 and the first half of this
year was about 1 million, which surpassed the number of Chinese
nationals traveling to Russia, about 700,000.
</P>
<P>
"We should base our judgments on facts rather than propaganda."
Wu said, stressing that the Chinese government firmly opposes any
form of illegal immigration to any country because "illegal
immigration not only taints China's image but also adversely
affects China's exchanges with other countries."

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Envoy Hopes for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Addor Neto, out-going
Brazilian ambassador to Angola, has expressed his hope for the
rapid implementation of peace in the war-torn southern African
country without the existence of one more parallel nation.
</P>
<P>
The civil conflict should be ended as soon as possible "on
condition that there doesn't exist a parallel state in Angola,"
the official news agency Angop Thursday quoted the ambassador as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Public Television of Angola, the Brazilian
envoy also urged Angola to keep its air space under control, hence
the government can better detect the clandestine planes carrying
military supplies to the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
After the Angolan civil war renewed in late 1998, the Angolan
government found that Jonas Savimbi had reinforced his UNITA rebel
force during the period of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the troops of the Jose Eduardo dos Santos'
government encounter many difficulties in their battle against the
rebels, which hindered the government from going further in the
rural areas under the control of Savimbi.

GENEVA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- It is a matter of utmost
urgency to restart basic health-care services in East Timor now
while the world is responding to the plight of the people by
sending medicines and other supplies, World Health Organization (
WHO) Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Don't put the cart before the horse," Brundtland warned. "For
weeks now, over 800,000 people -- who already had health standards
lower than the rest of Indonesia -- have been deprived of basic
medical care."
</P>
<P>
She called on the United Nations humanitarian coordinator to
help get basic medical care to the people in need, since many
organizations and the personnel are ready and willing to provide
it.
</P>
<P>
She said that nurses, midwives and doctors are urgently needed
to deal with two classes of problems: maternal and child health,
and infectious disease control.
</P>
<P>
"We could have boxes and boxes of supplies on hand, but if
there's no trained medical staff, mothers could die in childbirth,

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of a biennial
World Cup system could cause economic damage to the European
soccer and reduce its income by 1 billion U.S. dollars over eight
years, said a report commissioned by the UEFA.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current structure of world football, European
football is unlikely to gain from the introduction of a biennial
World Cup and European championship tournaments," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a reduction in the growth rate of top
level competitions of just five percentage points a year could
reduce European soccer's income by over 1 billion U.S. dollars
over an eight year cycle.
</P>
<P>
The report explained, "The overall increase in the supply of
top level football could also affect the value of major club and
TV sponsorship, causing an indirect negative impact."
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed the possible clashes in sports calendar
with the Grand Slam tennis tournaments and the Formula One Grand

<HEADLINE> Philippines Moves to Avert Y2K Problem in Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Manila International
Airport Authority (MIAA) Thursday hosted a Y2K contingency
conference to address the Y2K problem in the Philippines' aviation
sector.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was conducted by International Air Travel
Association (IATA) representatives -- Kok Ming Cheang of Singapore
and Chris Drabble from the United Kingdom, Philippine News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Present at meeting were Philippine representatives from the
MIAA, Cebu International Airport Authority, Clark International
Airport and Subic International Airport and officials of different
local and international airlines.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed such issues as how to ensure the
Philippine airports and airline business keep normal operation in
the face of Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem or millennium bug stems from an oversight by
computer software developers designating only by last two digits
so that early computers will be unable to correctly recognize year
2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the adverse effects of Y2K problems, the
participants adopted the Joint-Airport-Airline Year 2000 Liaison
Program, which encourages cooperation and communication among
aviation industry players in developing their respective
contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, airport authorities should share information
with their partners in the industry and draw business plans that
can be achieved to sustain public and business confidence.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Sign Oil Exploration Pact With Greek Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Afghan Taliban
militia have signed a deal with a Greek firm, ECC, regarding
survey and exploration of oil in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban official for mines and industries Maulvi Ahmed Jan
signed the agreement in the Afghan capital of Kabul this week with
the Greek firm, a report from Kabul Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The firm will first conduct a survey for oil exploration in the
southwestern part of Afghanistan which is believed to be rich in
oil and gas. Several other companies had also conducted such
surveys earlier, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Jan said the Taliban authorities had been trying to
attract investors to the oil and gas sectors of Afghanistan for
three years since they occupied the capital.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also underway for the installation of a refinery in
Kabul but most of the foreign firms preferred exploration and
extraction of oil before installation of refineries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that sufficient work had been done in connection with
the exploration in northern Afghanistan, particularly around
Sar-e-Pul province.
</P>
<P>
"At present we are capable of extracting 10,000 barrels of oil.
Most of the oil wells in northern Afghanistan which had been
damaged, have been reconstructed over the last two months," Ahmed
Jan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed gas pipeline project, the Taliban official said
the project mainly belonged to Pakistan and Turkmenistan while
Afghanistan only provides the transit route.

MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and the Italian government agreed Thursday to establish an
Italy-aided fund to finance technical assistance activities in the
bank's developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Italy will make an initial
contribution of 5 billion Italian lire (3 million U.S. dollars) to

The fund, which is called the Italian Cooperation Fund for
Consulting Services, will be administered by the ADB. Italy and

Technical assistance plays an important role in the bank's
operations by helping developing member countries identify,
design, implement and operate development projects.
</P>
<P>
Such assistance not only strengthens the member countries'
ability to formulate development strategies, policies, programs
and plans but also promotes technology transfer and regional
cooperation, the ADB said.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for U.N. Security Council Declaration on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- France has called on the United
Nations Security Council to make a declaration this week regarding
a solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said earlier this week
in New York that France hopes the five permanent members of the
Security Council will make greater efforts to resolve humanitarian
problems caused by the embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France suggested at the beginning of this year that the U.N.
Council review its policy "on a new basis" toward Iraq, including
an efficient new control system to make sure that Iraq does not
arm itself again with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Such a monitoring system should prevent Iraq from using its
income from oil exports to obtain such arms, according to the
French proposal.
</P>
<P>
"From such a system and controls, the U.N. could lift the
embargo, which is a primitive approach and very cruel to Iraqi
society," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should "absolutely give an
answer" to the humanitarian disaster in Iraq, but at the same time
"seriously take into account regional security."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the United States and Britain are not
"completely against" the French proposal.
</P>
<P>
France has been criticizing the U.S.-British air raids against
Iraq and wants the U.N. to lift its economic sanctions against
Iraq on the condition that Baghdad stick to its commitment on
disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Peace Talks to Start in Mid-October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan is expected to call the two sides in Cyprus to
three-week-long peace talks in mid-October, in West Point of the
U.S., according to Cyprus News Agency (CNA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The invitations will be extended at the end of this month
after a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Turkish
Premier Bulent Ecevit on September 28, in Washington, a CNA report
from New York said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted reliable sources as saying that Annan is
expected to preside over the talks, with American and British
representatives in the wings. U.S. officials have prepared
scenarios that they will present at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks will break after three weeks so that
the Cyprus president can attend November's Commonwealth summit in
South Africa and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
European summit in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the U.S. president is scheduled to visit
Ankara and Athens, where he will act depending on the outcome of
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
All meetings relating to the Cyprus peace talks are expected to
conclude before December's European Union (EU) summit in Helsinki,
as Turkey's EU prospect is one issue that is attractive for both
Ankara and Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking with union Athens.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their June summit in Cologne, Germany, asked the U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to invite leaders of the two communities to
unconditional negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has made it clear that it wants peace
talks to take place, but will not accept the preconditions set out
by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash insists that he would not enter into negotiations
unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus, backed by Turkey,
be internationally recognized and talk with Nicosia on
state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Kofi Annan is concerned with the possibility
of the talks failing, but the U.S. and British foreign ministers
have asked him to go ahead and extend the invitations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bombs Grozny Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry
on Thursday confirmed that federal fighter jets fired a missile on
the Grozny airport early in the day and destroyed an AN-2 plane "
which militants used for the delivery of arms and munitions across
Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
"The air force will continue attacking targets which militants
use," Interfax news agency reported the ministry press service as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the federal force in the North Caucasus
said earlier that the air strikes were conducted over arms depots
and at an airport radar station militants were using.
</P>
<P>
"The radar tracked Russian flights over Chechnya and supplied
information to the terrorists," a headquarters source told
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
In addition, attacks were also made at a fuel storage and
lubricants facility, arms and munitions depots, a power sub-
station and an oil refinery, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, capital city of the breakaway republic, local
authorities said an airport technician was killed in the air raid,
which took place shortly after midday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said the AN-2 plane, the only one available in Chechnya,
was used for agricultural purposes and from which parachutists
jumped during festive occasions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry is also considering the
possibility of using heavy bombers capable of carrying more
powerful weapons to deliver air strikes against rebel bases in
Chechnya, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Tactical bombers such as Tu-22m2 and Tu-22m3 may be deployed to
deliver more powerful air strikes, Interfax quoted ministry
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, air strikes on rebel bases were carried out by
Su-24 front-line bombers and Su-25 attack planes.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Denies Palestinians Family Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Both Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) currently have more than
13,000 Palestinian requests pending for family unifications in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Thursday by the Center for the Defense
of the Individuals in its report, which presents the historical
background, the social and legal aspects of the separation of
Palestinian families in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The report contains research on 1,573 complaints handled by
the center from 1961 to 1996 and data on 100 separated Palestinian
families from Bani Naim Village near the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel has never recognized the right of Palestinian
residents of the occupied territories to family unification, nor
to have residents' spouses and children receive the legal status
of resident, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, it said, the Israeli authorities have approved
family unification infrequently and according to undisclosed
criteria.
</P>
<P>
The situation did not change following the signing of the Oslo
Accord, because Israel continues to decide which Palestinian
families are allowed to live together in the territories and
which must remain separated, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Requests filed now will take almost a decade to be approved.
Consequently, a Palestinian who marries a non-resident today will
only be able to live with his or her spouse in the West Bank 10
years from now, or never," the reported pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Marriage between residents of the occupied territories and
non-resident Palestinians is widespread, tens of thousands of
Palestinians have been compelled to live apart from their
spouses, leaving their children to live for long periods without
one of their parents, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the vast majority of cases, the only way residents of the
occupied territories married to non-residents may live together
lawfully is to leave the territories, thereby abandoning their
houses, parents and homeland, it said.

Palestine and Israel, Li said China is closely following the
Middle East peace process, and welcomes the recent agreement
reached between the two sides on implementation of the Wye
Agreement and the resumption of negotiations on the final status
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
This is another important step in the peace process, and also a
substantial achievement reaped through the flexible and practical
strategy of the Palestinian side, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that China has consistently supported the
comprehensive, just and rational settlement of the Middle East
issue through peaceful negotiations, and that this is the right
and only choice.

<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) laid the foundation for its new library and
archives museum in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The current CAS library, which was built in April of 1950, has

center of scientific archives. It now has a collection of more
than six million books.
</P>
<P>
To increase the library's floor space and provide an upgraded
environment for readers, the CAS has decided to build a new
library just two blocks away from the old one in Zhongguancun,
northwest Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The new library will cover an area of 18,000 sq. meters. The
top two floors of the nine-story library will be used to hold the
museum archives.
</P>
<P>
When it is completed in 2001, the library will be able to serve
1,200 readers a day and provide round-the-clock service for more
than 5,000 Internet users.
</P>
<P>
The archives museum is expected to collect 350,000 sets of
records in various categories.

<HEADLINE> Israel Does not Recognize Palestinians' Rights to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel has never recognized
the rights of Palestinian residents in the occupied territories to
family unification, said a report by the Center for the Defense of
the Individuals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said both Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) have currently received more than 13,000 requests
by Palestinians pending for family unifications in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is charged with collecting historical
background, social and legal aspects of the separation of
Palestinian families in the occupied territories, conducted
research on 1,573 complaints received from 1961 to 1996 and data
on 100 separated Palestinian families from Bani Naim Village near
the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"Requests filed now will take almost a decade to be
approved. Consequently, a Palestinian who marries a non-resident
today will only be able to live with his or her spouse in the West
Bank ten years from now, or never," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Marriage between residents of the occupied territories and
non-resident Palestinians is common. However, tens of thousands of
Palestinians have to live apart from their spouses, leaving their
children to live for long periods without one of their parents, it
said.
</P>
<P>
In the vast majority of cases, the only way residents of the
occupied territories married to non-residents may live together
lawfully is to leave the territories, thereby abandoning their
houses, parents and homeland, it said.

<HEADLINE> Young Scientist Advocates Industrialization of Hi-tech (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Professor Chen Zhangliang,
the 38-years-old vice-president of Beijing University, is one of
the most influential Chinese scientists advocating bringing high
technologies much closer to everybody's life through
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Chen now is widely recognized as the country's youngest vice-
president of a prestigious Chinese university, after receiving the
position at the age of 35 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
His work searching for new genes from plants and special local
Chinese biological resources has aroused widespread interest among
scientists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer that all my students call me 'boss' rather than vice-
president," Chen said. And he explained that at most universities
in western countries, it is commonplace for students call their
professors like this, even though such a thing is hardly heard on
campuses of Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
But Chen is actually a successful boss, as he initiated the
Beida Weiming Bio-engineering Group in 1992, after he was
appointed dean of the Biology Department of Beijing University,
which was one of the poorest departments at that time.
</P>
<P>
Now, his company has developed into the largest Chinese
manufacturer of bio-genetic medicines in China, and its pre-tax
income exceeded 60 million (about 7 million U.S. dollars) yuan
last year. Its subsidiary, the Shenzhen Kexing Biological Group,
has about 60 percent of the share of China's interferon market,
which used to be monopolized by foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
But Professor Chen's pocket is not bulging with cash from the
rapidly expanding of his company, because the company is not his
own property, but belongs to Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"My bank deposits have not increased a bit since I returned to
the motherland, and even worse, I have never been to the bank. But
I don't regret this, because I am living in a society where you
feel changes all the time, and I can contribute to these changes,"
Chen said.

"I am bent on researching genetic medicines and technologies of
bio-genetic engineering to be used in China's agricultural sector,
and hope to use my wisdom to pay back the society," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen received the 1991 Javed Husain Prize for Young Scientists
in recognition of his outstanding contributions to gene conversion
research and gene molecular adjustment and control at the
headquarters of UNESCO in Paris on October 28, 1991, the youngest
individual winner of this prize since 1987.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he was picked by "Time" magazine of the United States
as one of the 100 scientists in the world with the most potential.
</P>
<P>
"I was born into a poor fisherman's family in southeast China's
Fujian Province in 1961, and I am among those Chinese students who
studied abroad and then returned to China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He went to school at the age of nine, and was recruited by the
South China Institute of Tropical Plants in Hainan Province at the
age of 17.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Chen returned to China after graduating with a Ph.D.
degree from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
Answering the Chinese government's call, this promising young man
returned to China to build the country's first botanical gene
engineering laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The national laboratory for protein and plant genetic
engineering at Beijing University constructed by Chen himself can
be used for the most advanced botanical gene-engineering research
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There are nine returned students working with me in my
laboratory," said Chen proudly, adding that the number of returned
Chinese students will further increase as China has adopted a
series of favorable policies to encourage the students to return.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen now also serves as vice-chairman of the All-
China Youth Federation, director of the Life Sciences Academy of
Beijing University, and as a member of the committee of China's
first high technology research plan, "Program 863."
</P>
<P>
Chen is now a nationally known scientist with many titles: vice-
president of the All-China Youth Federation, deputy to the
National People's Congress, member of the country's education,
science and culture committee, member of the Standing Committee of
the Chinese Scientists' Association; advisor to the British
magazine Botany; member of the International Biochemistry
Consultative Committee, member of the Specialist Committee on
Biology of the "863" High Technology Program, and member of the
Editorial Board of the American journal Genetics.
</P>
<P>
Chen has also been invited to deliver a speech before the chief
executive officers (CEO) of large multinational companies
attending the upcoming '99 Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The fences around colleges and universities will gradually
disappear in the 21st century, with the rapid development of
information and high technologies, and this trend will allow
universities to become the most important incubator of new
technologies, Chen plans to tell the CEOs gathering in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Intensify Efforts for Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook has assured that his country will intensify efforts to
secure success in the negotiations on Cyprus, the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cook gave the assurance to his Cyprus counterpart Ioannis
Kasoulides during a meeting in New York Wednesday on the sidelines
of the 54th session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed efforts to convene talks on
settling the Cyprus issue in accordance with U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to the negotiation table for reunification
through a bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has
been made.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their Cologne summit in June, asked U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to invite the leaders of the two sides to unconditional
negotiations in the autumn of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has said it expects to be invited to
the talks in the second half of October.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of holding such talks remains gloomy as
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that he will not
attend the talks unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus,
backed by Turkey, be recognized by the international community and
talks with Nicosia based on an equal basis.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Ancient Chinese Tradition Big Hit at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A moving story date back as
early as some 2,300 years ago in ancient China later became a
popular sporting event in many Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
And it is now expected to become a big hit at China's Sixth
National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities
opening here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dragon boat races, which feature a heated contest among teams
each consisting as many as more than 20 rowers. Members of a team
aboard a slim wooden boat decorated into the shape of a dragon row
in surprisingly neat and rhythmic motion to push their boat
forward as fast as possible. The fastest boat in the race is
declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
Dragon boat racing can inaugurate to ancient China's Warring
States period (475-221 B.C.). Qu Yuan, a patriotic and popular
poet of the Chu State at the time, committed suicide in 278 B.C.
by drowning himself in River Miluo located in what is now southern
China's Hunan Province, after his mini-state was destroyed by
invaders. Many local people set off aboard boats, trying in vain
to receive his body.
</P>
<P>
Commemorative dragon boat races were thus been annually held
along the river at the date of Qu's death and it became a popular
sporting event later in many Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to enthusiastic introduction by overseas Chinese, dragon
boat racing has become increasingly popular in many other
countries and regions and races are annually held worldwide.
Finland, for example, has held annual dragon boat races since 1990,
with up to 225 teams participating in last year's event.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese team with rowers from south China's Guangdong
Province won the world dragon boat racing championship in Hong
Kong, China, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dragon boat racing has been a competition event of China's
National Games of Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities
since the fourth version in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The week-long competition of this year's Games here will see
actions by some 500 athletes in 19 racing teams from 11 Chinese
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, which is the
largest field for the event since 1991.
</P>
<P>
And racing teams from Beijing, Yunnan Province, Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will make
their debut in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Probe Another Complaint About Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police are
investigating a complaint against former prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu concerning "breach of trust and the illegal transfer of
state funds to foreign elements."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was allegedly involved in transferring one million
shekels (298,000 U.S. dollars) from an association that organized
Israel's jubilee celebrations in 1998 to the organizers of the
jubilee events in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Ministry spokesman was quoted by the local daily
Haaretz as saying Thursday that the matter is being investigated
by the police.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation was given in reaction to a claim by Ami Carmon
that Attorney General Elyakam Rubinstein has ordered the police
not to look into the complaint, which was submitted more than nine
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Carmon noted that in June 1996, shortly after being elected
prime minister, Netanyahu named two close American friends, Merv
Adelson and Marvin Josephson, to be responsible for the jubilee
celebrations outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the complaint was that the Israeli
association in charge of the celebrations had not received the
bills to cover the American groups' expenses, but the transfer was
made to the U.S. at the directive of the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Carmon, who is close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and bears
the title "head of the One Israel reaction team," stated that
Barak has no connection with the matter.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his wife Sara are currently under police
investigation on suspicions of taking bribes and misusing of state
funds.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims UN Committee Block Over 300 Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry has
accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking 328 contracts
worth 438 million U.S. dollars signed under the fifth and sixth
phases of the oil-for-food program, Iraqi News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry accused the U.S. and
British governments of practicing a genocide policy against the
Iraqi people through a deliberate impediment in the approval of
Iraqi contracts by their representatives at the Sanctions
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that those 328 contracts included 116 for
oil sector, 90 for electricity sector, 48 for health sector, 20
for education sector and 54 for other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. and Britain intend to kill more
innocent Iraqi people. He called upon the international community
to put pressure on the U.S. and British governments to lift the
embargo imposed on Iraq nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), mortality rates among Iraqi children have doubled since
the imposition of the U.N. sanctions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Health Ministry announced on Sunday that nearly 8,000
Iraqi children aged under five died in last August of different
curable diseases and malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City Expects Sharp Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Ho Chi Minh City in
the first nine months of this year are expected to reach 3.3
billion U.S. dollars, up 23 percent from the same period last
year, Vietnam's business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the city statistical bureau, exports in this month
alone are expected to reach 463 million dollars, up 10.9 percent
from last month.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries exports are expected to be 153 million dollars in the
first nine months, up 13.6 percent from the same period last year.
Exports of forestry products are estimated at 31 million dollars,
up 28.3 percent from the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
However, the high export growth is mainly due to the increase
in the volume and value of crude oil exports, which are expected
to push the export of industrial products up 37.7 percent over the
year-ago level. This sector will account for 81.3 percent of the
city's total export value in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, exports of agro-products will fall 23.5 percent from
the year-ago level due to falling shipments of most items
belonging to this group. For instance, rice exports will fall 18.5
percent, coffee down 37.2 percent, and cashew nuts down 45.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest economic hub, is expected
to import 2.45 billion dollars worth of products in the first nine
months of this year, down 4.8 percent from the year-ago level.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Cuisine Recipes Found in Han Dynasty Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Several ancient Chinese
cuisine recipes recorded on bamboo slips which may date back more
than 2,000 years have been unearthed from a Han Dynasty tomb in
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe that this find in Yuanling County in
western Hunan is the oldest food recipes ever found in the country.
The recipes are written in ink on 20 pieces of bamboo slips and
detail cooking procedures for rice and other dishes, as well as
ways to mix beverages and make smoked meats.
</P>
<P>
Hu Pingsheng, a member of the Chinese Relic Research Institute,
said that Chinese archeologists have collected the names of many
ancient dishes from historical records of the Qin and Han
dynasties (221 B.C.-A.D. 24). The cooking methods, however, have
never been found before.
</P>
<P>
He said his excavation team found that the recipes written on
20 bamboo slips were divided into two categories to separate the
cooking of rice from other dishes, and the largest serial number
of the recipes is 46.
</P>
<P>
According to the recipes, there are nine kinds of rice and
seven ways to cook them. Meat dishes include pork, beef, rabbit,
deer and fish.
</P>
<P>
"The recipes were recorded in such a detail that we can
understand how people in ancient times butchered animals, cleaned
the viscera, and cooked and presented the dishes," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists here believed that they have found only a small
fragment of a complete recipe book, but it is enough to see how
luxurious the imperial life was at that time.
</P>
<P>
The occupant of the tomb was identified as Wu Yang, a high
ranking official guarding Yuanling Prefecture during the Western
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D.24). He died and was buried in 162 B.C.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Open Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China will further open its
market to foreign insurance companies, Wu Dingfu, vice-chairman of
the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on insurance regulation, the official
said that as China's insurance legislation and regulatory capacity
improves gradually, the country would allow more foreign insurers
into its market and open more Chinese regions to them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, when China opened its insurance market on an
experimental basis, nine insurance firms from eight countries have
opened 12 organizations in Shanghai and Guangzhou, the only two
Chinese cities now open to foreign insurers.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, the CIRC gave its go-ahead to another four
foreign insurers to start business in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said, "The experiment of opening the Chinese insurance
market was successful and has had a good effect."
</P>
<P>
As part of the CIRC's efforts to improve its supervision over
the market at the grassroots level, Wu said, its regulators will
have offices in all the regions of China by the end of next year,
and the first ones will be operational this year.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the CIRC is taking a positive attitude
toward the establishment of insurers' associations, which would
promote self-regulation among their members.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 20 Chinese regions have established
insurers' associations. Wu said a national insurers' association
is also being prepared.

that the government is only going to accompany the economic
globalization rather than organizing it.

Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- France's leftwing forces are preparing for an action in
support of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's call for fight against "
dictatorship of shareholding." The Socialists have condemned the
plan by the Michelin tire group to lay off 10 percent of its work
force in Europe, while the Communists will stage a movement
against unemployment in collaboration with some extreme-left
parties.

<P>
La Tribune:
</P>
<P>
-- The latest economic perspectives published by the
International Monetary Fund said that the world will experience a
3-percent economic growth in 1999 and 3.5-percent growth in 2000.
The very dynamic activity in the United States and the improvement
of performance in Europe, plus a recovering economy in Asia, are
contributing to the growth.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban United
Front Thursday claimed significant gains in western Afghanistan
after five days of heavy fighting against the ruling Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the United Front said that opposition troops had
captured 200 villages in Ghor and Farah provinces after several
days of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition sources claimed that about a dozen Taliban
soldiers were also taken prisoners while another 50 surrendered

<P>
However, there was no independent confirmation of the claims by
the anti-Taliban United Front.

Afghan experts in Pakistan said that if the claims proved true,

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank may soon
approve a 2.3- billion-shillings grant (around 30 million U.S.
dollars) to support Kenya's HIV/AIDS campaign, Public Health
Minister Sam Ongeri said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks upon his arrival in the capital
Nairobi from Washington, D.C., where he attended an AIDS symposium
and had discussions with World Bank officials over the AIDS
problems in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Thursday quoted Ongeri as
saying a team from the World Bank is already in the country on a
fact-finding mission of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the team in Kenya would approve the grant package
in assisting his ministry in fighting AIDS in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that at the symposium, he presented the
country's 1997 sessional paper on AIDS and tabled the strategy
plan of his ministry for 1999 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri also disclosed that Sandra Thuman, Director of the U.S.
National AIDS Program and President Clinton's Advisor on AIDS
worldwide, had asked the Congress to provide one billion dollars
to Africa for its HIV/AIDS campaign for a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
According to Ongeri, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS
in Kenya was increasing quickly from 3.8 percent in 1980 to 13.9
percent in 1998. The current population of Kenya is estimated at
30 million.

TAIYUAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
found a 1,400-year-old outer coffin made of white marble in this
capital of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was unearthed from a tomb dating back to the Sui
Dynasty (586-618), according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The rare relic, first of its kind found in China, is embossed
with colored patterns in the style of the ethnic cultures of
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was found in the square brick chamber of the tomb,
said one expert, adding that the tomb was occupied by Yu Hong, a
foreign affairs official.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was made by joining marble slates carved with scenes
of banquets, performances and hunting. The figures look typical of
ancient Central Asian people.
</P>
<P>
The coffin as its decorations will provide valuable material
for study of the culture and economic exchanges between East and
West in ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Better to Make Peace With Arab Old Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel should seek to
strike peace deals with the old guard in the Middle East, such as
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks in an interview with local daily the
Jerusalem Post, which will publish the full text of the interview
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It should not wait for a generational change in the Arab world
since old leaders have a unique authority in their societies to
"take big decisions today," while it will take younger leaders
time to consolidate their power, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Assad is the symbol of the revolution in Syria
and he molded the state, while Arafat also in a way is the one who
molded his people, said Barak, adding these leaders hold the sort
of authority and perspective that allow them to make the hard
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the final-status talks with the Palestinians,
Barak said that if a final-status framework deal does not
succeed, a long-term interim set of understandings might be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Wye Two Accord signed on September 5,
Israel and the Palestinians have to reach a framework agreement on
final-status talks by February and a full lasting peace deal by
next September.
</P>
<P>
Barak called for the immediate construction of a bridge
linking the West Bank and Gaza, which he hopes will be completed
within four years.
</P>
<P>
On the ruling of the High Court of Justice halting physical
pressure against Palestinian suspects, Barak expressed his belief
that the court will permit use of pressure under extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Lebanese issue, Barak said serious Hezbollah
attacks emanating from south Lebanon could lead to a freeze in
talks with Syria. This was the first time that he has linked the
Lebanese issue with Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
"Terror from Lebanon could put a halt to the process with
Syria," said Barak, adding that he and Assad have a common
interest in curbing Hezbollah terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that once peace is reached with Israel's immediate
neighbors, this will diminish the threat emanating from Iran and
Iraq.

</P>
<P>
The University LEAD (Leadership and Excellence in Application

CIMS is a comprehensive technology which is used to improve the
competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises through the use of
information technology.
</P>
<P>
CIMS has played an important role in promoting the development
of manufacturing enterprises and the combination of production,
education and research, said Zhu Lilan, Minister of Science and
Technology, today. She said she hopes the university will strive
to win the Industry LEAD Award, another scientific prize given by
the SME, in near future.
</P>
<P>
CIMS is a key project of the State "863" high-technology
development program, which has involved 5,000 people from dozens
of colleges and institutes and 200 enterprises. Some 150
enterprises have introduced the CIMS to improve their
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The Central China University has been listed among the top ten
premier universities and colleges in China for the past few years.
The university's CIMS center was built in 1989 and became one of
the major participants in the "863" project.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Witness Major Social Reforms: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has said the period ahead will witness major social
transformations to complement the country's all-out economic
reforms, the Egyptian Gazette Newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The starting point lies in working out a comprehensive social
policy based on unequivocal foundations and agreed criteria in
which governmental and non-governmental sectors will be involved,"
Mubarak said on Wednesday at an opening ceremony of a housing
scheme for young people.
</P>
<P>
A national social conference will be held later this year to
draw up the outlines of social development, the president told the
ceremony held at New Sherouk City built near the Cairo-Ismailia
Desert Highway.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be attended by governmental and
non-governmental agencies, would also seek to set priorities for a
social renaissance matching economic accomplishments, the
pro-government English-language newspaper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since undertaking responsibility, I have been convinced that
the legitimacy of rule itself emanates from the provision of basic
services for citizens and care about society's categories without
discrimination," Mubarak stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak became president in 1981 after the assassination of
former President Anwar Sadat. He was re-elected in 1987 and 1993.
He is set to win a referendum on Sunday to endorse parliament
nomination for a fourth six-year term.

sector's initiatives and efforts for the improvement of people's
life.

U.S. dollars) in housing projects, building 2.4 million housing
units, since 1982. The private sector contributed 28 billion

forge a common position on a number of trade issues that will be
to their advantage, M. Supperamaniam, deputy secretary general of
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said here
Thursday at a seminar on "WTO: What it Means to Malaysian
Businessmen" organized by the National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry of Malaysia (NCCIM).
</P>
<P>
"Except for a few vocal ones, many are not participating," he
said, adding developing countries have themselves to blame if big
countries "can do what they want to do" in their trade practices
with developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the provision of dispute settlement, one of
the WTO functions, is important especially to developing
countries, he said that through this, developing countries can
challenge the discriminative action of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the notion that the WTO is an institution that
works towards free trade and said: "It doesn't say countries can't
protect domestic industries and in no way does WTO aim to bring
down import duty to zero percent."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NCCIM President Tajudin Ramli said at a press
conference later that the more developing countries understand the
WTO process and the more they participate in the forum, the better
it will be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian business community needs to acquire the knowledge
of WTO rules so that they can take full advantage of the
institution, Tajudin said, adding the ability of the Malaysian
private sector to benefit from the multi-lateral trading system
under WTO rests on their initiative in conveying their views to
the government.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Issues $700 Million Eurobonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has issued its new,
dual-currency sovereign eurobonds worth 700 million U.S. dollars
in the international bond markets, the daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The issuance, which was officially launched Wednesday, offered
400 million dollars of 10-year bonds at a spread of 440 basis
points over U.S. Treasury bonds and 300 million euros of
seven-year bonds at a spread of 400 basis points over German bonds.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Finance Minister George Korom said the spreads show
Lebanon's ability to borrow much more cheaply than other
emerging-market sovereigns that have tapped international markets
recently.
</P>
<P>
Argentina launched a 500-million, 10-year dollar eurobond in
mid-April at a spread of 623 basis points over U.S. treasuries.
</P>
<P>
The issue also broadens the investor base for Lebanon's
external debts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors bought 32 percent of the overall issue after
being courted on an extensive roadshow held prior to the launch,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Large pension and investment funds in the U.S. and Europe
bought 36 percent of the dollar issue, while foreign
participation in the euro tranche was lower at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic Lebanese banks, the main buyers of previous sovereign
issues, received 63 percent of the total placement. The remaining
5 percent was placed with Lebanese banks abroad.
</P>
<P>
The new eurobond is the first issue in a 2-billion foreign
borrowing program approved by Parliament in July and it is designed
to reduce the government's reliance on short-term, expensive
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
Korom said Lebanon does not plan any more international debt
issues before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has sold more than 3 billion eurobonds since 1994,
often at tighter spreads than those achieved by higher-rated
sovereign borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Its one billion U.S. dollar eurobond in April 1998 was the
largest sovereign issue ever in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Foreign borrowing only accounts for one quarter of Lebanon's
public debt of almost 20 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Lebanese Student "Spying" for Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua)n -- Cossette Elias Ibrahim, a
communications student arrested by the South Lebanese Army (SLA)
three weeks ago, has "confessed" to aiding the Hezbollah, local
media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Israeli security sources as saying that
Ibrahim "gathered intelligence information for the guerrilla
organization Hezbollah" within Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who also worked occasionally as a freelance
journalist for a variety of Lebanese papers, was arrested by SLA
while visiting her parents in the village of Rameish, in the
central sector of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese sources claimed that she was arrested for her negative
descriptions of the Israeli occupying forces in south Lebanon in
her articles.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations, as well as the Journalists Without
Frontiers organization, are demanding for her release, and
demonstrations have been staged in Beirut to protest her arrest,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim has been reportedly tortured severely at the
SLA-operated El Khayam jail, where she is being held.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has refused to
address the claims, saying that the jail is under SLA control and
the IDF does not involve itself in what goes on there.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985,
proclaiming to protect its northern security. The Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been staging military resistance to the Israeli
military occupation ever since. The SLA is a Lebanese military
group supporting the IDF.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Falls Silent While Evacuees Still Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- After a jolting blast on
Wednesday noon, Mount Mayon fell back to a deep slumber without
the slightest trace of violence, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But evacuees kept flowing in government organized centers,
fearing for their life because of the volcano's erratic character,
PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Close to 500 families are now housed in at least three
evacuation centers, numbering to more or less 3,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
Many of the evacuees come from within and along Mayon's
6-kilometer permanent danger zone, although some come from less
dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Daep, chief of the Provincial Disaster Management Office
(PDMO) has warned residents of high risks areas from venturing
near the 6-kilometer zone which is declared a no man's land.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs maintained Mount Mayon's alert status at level 2.
</P>
<P>
The volcano erupted Wednesday noon, about 11:45 a.m., a preatic
blast stronger than the June 22 explosion and a huge column of ash
laden clouds rose about 7 kilometers up the sky
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the clouds were carried by the northeasterly
winds to Albay province's first district, Mayon fell silent once
more leaving observers puzzled about its real status.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique
trade exposition which takes place next month in Chipata, Eastern
Province of Zambia has attracted at least 140 exhibitors from the
three countries, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Eastern Chambers of Commerce and Industry
secretary, Norman Chipakupaku, as saying on Wednesday that the
exposition, the biggest of its kind so far, has attracted a large
number of exhibitors because of the inclusion of Mozambique for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
He said the three-day event is aimed at promoting the concept
of the economic growth triangle that is being supported by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), observing that this
concept could work successfully among the three countries because
of the vast potential in each state.
</P>
<P>
The exposition, which is scheduled for October 29 to 31, would
also be used to launch the Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique private
sector forum for promoting trade in the private sector between the
three countries, Chipakupaku said.
</P>
<P>
"The exposition will also serve to open the Tete Province of
Mozambique for business opportunities to Zambian and Malawian
businessmen," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tremendous Changes Made In Shanghai In Past Half Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tremendous changes have
taken place in Shanghai in the past half century as the city
turned from a former semi-colony of Western powers into a modern
international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
During an interview, Huang Ju, secretary of the Shanghai
Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said
these huge changes are attributed to the gigantic efforts made by
the CPC over the past 50 years, which have allowed Shanghai to
cast off its humiliating past and take onto the road to a
promising future with brilliant prospects.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1840, the year in which the "Opium War" broke out,
Shanghai was forced to open to the outside world as a treaty port.
Then, after 1845, foreign powers, including Britain, France and
the United States, continuously snatched up land in Shanghai and
carved them up as concessions.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the Western-style Bund along the Huangpu River was
first grabbed in the 1920s and 1930s as a concession where foreign
powers set up banks and engaged in many commercial and trade
activities, and the district became known as the Wall Street of
the East. The Bund was looked on as a financial center controlling
old China's economy, as Shanghai served as an abnormal dependency
of the Western nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people living in the concessions experienced untold
sufferings not only from ruthless exploitation, but also from
great indignity and humiliations.
</P>
<P>
The founding of New China in 1949, however, ushered into a new
era in Shanghai, which has since taken on a new look.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks are now allowed to do business in the Shanghai
Bund area along with Chinese banks, and the Bund has become an
attraction for business people and visitors for its row upon row
of Western-style buildings and modern skyscrapers like the 468-
meter-tall Oriental Pearl TV Tower and the 420-meter-tall Jinmao
office building.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou Road, which was once a British concession, now has more
than 100 book and stationery shops, companies line both its sides,
and it is now a cultural and information center in Shanghai,
instead of the red-light district it was in the past.
</P>
<P>
Hengshan Road, once a French concession, features a combination
of Western and Eastern art and culture. Local residents and
visitors alike can now get the feel of the romantic and
intoxicating ambiance of the Champs Elysees there.
</P>
<P>
All sorts of feelings well up in the Shanghai people when they
reflect on the city's past in the light of its present, and
mention its great change from a humiliated semi-colony to an
independent and open metropolis.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the city of Shanghai had approved more
than 18,000 overseas-funded projects and had established friendly
relations with 36 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is now striding forward with pride toward a still more
promising future in the new century.

<P>
The controllers were able to contact the pilot at almost last
second and order him to climb. The plane was only 100 meters above
the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway at the time and the pilot was
instructed to fly toward the sea before making a second approach,
according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Later, the pilot executed the landing at the airport but
ignored the signalers on the ground and committed a series of
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
The crew was questioned by senior officials of Israel Civil
Aviation Authority and the crew focused their debriefing on
the fact that the pilot had a poor command of English.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and the crew were released after being
questioned. The pilot was also examined for possible intoxication,
but emerged with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Tupelov 134, belongs to the BRZ Airlines, which
makes a weekly flight to Israel. About 40 passengers were on the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused a delay of about an hour in the scheduled
flight back to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Given Deadline on Power Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has been given a deadline to enact the electricity bill
to facilitate the construction of a power station at the
controversial site of Bujagali in Jinja, 80 kilometers east of the
capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
This deadline was contained in a letter to the president by
U.S. Secretary of Trade Denis William and the letter was read to
MPs in the Natural Resources Committee at the State House
Wednesday, the Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the law is delayed beyond the end of September, it will
spoil U.S.- Uganda relations, the letter warned, urging Kampala to
*6"
enact the electricity bill quickly to allow a U.S. company to
generate power on the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
MPs in the committee, however, defied the warning from the
United States, saying that Uganda's Parliament is not an arm of
Washington, a legislator who attended the impromptu meeting was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
AES Nile Power, a U.S. company, planned to invest 450 million
dollars in building a hydroelectric power station on the Nile
River, a project expected to end load-shedding in Uganda whose
power demand is increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Those who support the project are focused on the possible
economic, social and tourist advantages, while the opponents,
including environmental groups, argue that the project would
destroy Uganda's natural heritage and environment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Uganda Electricity Board is the sole supplier
of electricity in Uganda. It has an installed capacity of 180
megawatts at the Owen Falls Hydropower Station against an
estimated current peak demand of 250 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Only about five percent of the population in Uganda has access
to electricity, of which 70 percent is in the three major cities
of Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordan Cracks Down on Hamas to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has closed the Amman
office of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
arrested 15 of its members on national security charges in an
apparent move to promote the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown upon Hamas came at a time when Israel and the
Palestinians are making progress on the implementation of the Wye
River peace accord and are heading for the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a radical militant Palestinian organization
which opposes the peace process between the Jewish state and the
Palestinians, and it has reportedly carried out several deadly
attacks on Israeli civilians in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
The government has long tolerated the presence of the Hamas
office in Amman and its activities because of its many
sympathizers among the predominantly Palestinian population of the
desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, the tolerance came to an end on August 30 when police
closed the Hamas office, arrested 12 of its members and issued
arrest warrants against four of its leaders who were then on a
visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, police also detained Khaled Mashaal and Ibrahim
Ghosheh, two Jordanian citizens but the most senior Hamas leaders
based in Amman, and deported another senior Hamas leader Abu
Marzuk who held a Yemeni passport.
</P>
<P>
The move was viewed as a preemptive measure to pave the way, to
some extent, for the critical and yet vulnerable peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Charges against the Hamas members included holding military
exercises in Jordanian territory as part of its campaigns on
Israel and illegal possession of arms and weapons, which the
government said had violated Jordan's national interest.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a staunch supporter and broker for the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and Amman viewed its 1994
peace treaty with Israel as one of the pillars of its foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas movement still stands for a holy war "to liberate
all Palestinian territories" to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental difference means that Hamas activities will
be strictly prohibited in the foreseeable future, at least until
some tangible progresses are made in the Israeli-Palestinian track
of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mashaal, political chief of Hamas who was arrested on
Wednesday, said his arrest was politically motivated during an
interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
``This is a political issue caused by pressures from the
United States, the Zionist entity (Israel) and the Palestinian
Authority on Jordan to muzzle Hamas during the final status
negotiations," said Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said Mashaal and other Hamas members will
be tried under the Jordanian law on charges of engaging in
illegal political activities in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they might face a one-year prison term.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Urges Followers to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan has called on a group
of his militants to surrender to the government to show their
sincerity in making peace.
</P>
<P>
"I call on a PKK group to come to Turkey, with their arms, to
join the democratic republic as an expression of goodwill and to
prove that the PKK is not an obstacle to democratic reforms," the
imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader said in a statement published by
the local Daily News Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the statement delivered by Ocalan's lawyers
as saying that "this step by the PKK would be a symbolic step for
a peaceful and democratic solution. Such a step would be very
important in order to show that our decision to give up the armed
struggle is earnest."
</P>
<P>
"We expect the attention and assistance of the state and
society," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan prepared the statement at a meeting with his lawyers on
the island of Imrali in western Turkey on Monday, where he is the
sole prisoner.
</P>
<P>
The PKK announced last month that it was pulling PKK militants
out of Turkey to pave the way for peace.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has claimed that about one-quarter of an estimated
1,500 militants have been pulled out of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has dismissed the move as a tactical
ploy, saying the PKK was retreating to spend winter in nearby
bases as it usually did at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese army soldier was
killed and another six were wounded overnight during Israeli air
raid on south Lebanon, the Voice of Lebanon radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a Lebanese army post, which is on
the edge of Sarba village in Iqlim Toufah just north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, was hit by Israeli
missiles.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese army's armored personnel vehicle was destroyed in
the attack, the radio quoted security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the bloodiest strike Lebanese army has suffered during
conflicts in south Lebanon in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes also blasted other areas inside the
border zone to avenge earlier assaults launched by Lebanon's two
leading military groups Hezbollah and Amal on its positions.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> New Tool for Timber Developed in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A hitman will soon be
roaming forests in New Zealand. However, the target won't be
people but felled logs on the forest floor awaiting their fate.
</P>
<P>
The Hitman is a new acoustic tool to assess the stiffness and
fiber properties of tree stems and logs using soundwaves.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by New Zealand's Industry Research and Carter
Holt Harvey, one of the biggest forestry companies in the country,
the tool is designed to help an operator determine where the cuts
should be made on a stem to maximize the usefulness of each
section.
</P>
<P>
Stiffness and fiber properties affect the wood's performance in
construction and pulp and paper applications. Different uses have
widely different dollar values.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of natural variation within any stand of trees.
The advantage of the Hitman is that we can accurately sort the
logs in terms of strength and fiber properties and then maximize
the total value of the forest," Marco Lausberg of Carter Holt
Harvey was quoted as saying by the latest issue of "Innovate"
published by the Industrial Research.
</P>
<P>
The Hitman tool comprises a small palm-sized calculator
connected by a short cable to an acceleration sensor. The
calculator houses sensing electronics and the equivalent of a 386
computer, and the whole device can be hooked on to an operator's
belt or clothing.
</P>
<P>
By holding the sensor against the cut end of the stem and
hitting this same end with a hammer the operator sends a soundwave
down the tree. The soundwave bounces off the other end of the stem
and the reverberation time is measured by the sensor.
</P>
<P>
The reverberation is a direct measure of the log's stiffness.
The faster the soundwave, the stiffer the tree is and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
"The device has quite a lot of intelligence built into it to
interpret bounce times under different conditions, like whether
the log is on the ground or in a stack, and can cope with logs up
to 35 meters," Lausberg said.
</P>
<P>
The Hitman is powered by a single 9-volt battery which should
last for more than one operator's shift.
</P>
<P>
Future work in this field could lead to the development of
sonic or ultrasonic methods for assessing trees before they are
even felled, "Innovate" said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Wellington
region sees increasing sexual disease cases this year.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post, a Wellington-based newspaper, Thursday
reported that Wellington doctors are "alarmed at an upsurge in
sexual diseases in the region and fear an epidemic".
</P>
<P>
The Wellington Independent Practice Association (WIPA) has
noticed a 400 percent rise in HIV cases in the region over the
past six months and a 50 percent rise in cases of gonorrhoea, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Local laboratory Medlab has found a new gonorrhoea case once a
week on average this year compared with a new case every three
weeks last year. And last week three new cases were diagnosed," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The genital herpes and warts rates in the Wellington region
have also been above the national average for the last two years,
according to the Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
It quoted WIPA sexual health physician Margaret Sparrow as
saying that she is "alarmed at the cases because, if not stemmed,
there would be an epidemic."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Passes Bill on State of Danger Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A bill concerning the State
of Danger Management was passed by Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the four factions in the parliament said the
bill is a revised-form of the previously named draft Law on State
Security.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates the presidential authority to declare a
state of emergency in troubled territories. The president also is
allowed to delegate authority to the military, which is given
virtual free rein to handle threats to state security.
</P>
<P>
It allows the military to carry out investigations and raids,
and take over all mail, telecommunications and electronic
facilities. An emergency also allows a ban or limitation on
demonstrations and public exposure through print and electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a state of emergency, the bill states that the
military chief would be permitted to resort to any measures, such
as barring demonstrations, which violated existing laws.
</P>
<P>
The military would have the full authority to bar individuals
from entering or leaving the country, isolate designated
"troublesome individuals and areas" and set curfews.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, outside the House's building, hundreds of
students are staging protest demanding the House to postpone the
bill.
</P>
<P>
Students decried the bill for investing the government and
military with excessive powers.
</P>
<P>
They are concerned enactment of the bill will provide legal
leeway for the Indonesian Military to clamp down on the press and
stifle reform.
</P>
<P>
Some say the bill was contrived to maintain the military's
influence in sociopolitical matters.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Cuts State Corporation Spenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Extravagant foreign travel,
huge and uncontrolled expense accounts and free spending in
Kenya's state corporations are to severely cut back, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new tough measures are part of the government's efforts to
cut spending and improve services, Richard Leakey, Civil Service
head, told a meeting attended by heads of parastatals and
government departments, permanent secretaries and other top
public officials held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leakey warned the parastatal heads who have run down their
institutions or were implicated in corruption will be sacked, and
they will also be made to repay money misappropriated during
their tenure.
</P>
<P>
With immediate effect, parastatal chiefs travelling outside
their stations will have their expense accounts severely cut, the
civil service head said.
</P>
<P>
Official foreign trips to attend conferences or workshops will
be limited to only one official for each parastatal or
supervising ministry, who will travel economy class, Leakey said,
adding that those who want to travel first class will have to pay
the difference in the price of the ticket from their own pocket.
</P>
<P>
Leakey urged the state corporation heads to ensure their
operations must match in efficiency and match those in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the National Social Security Fund and
National Hospital Insurance Fund, Kenya Railways and Kenya Ports
Authority are among some of the big corporations which had
previously been cited as havens for corruption and mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Leading China's Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province adjacent
Hong Kong will lead China in approaching the country's
modernization target because of its pioneer role in reform and
opening, said provincial Governor Lu Ruihua in a recent exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong has witnessed dramatic changes during the past 50
years, which has transformed it from a backward province to the
country's fastest-growing economic powerhouse," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth in the southern province last year tripled that
in 1978 to reach 793.7 billion yuan, accounting for 10 percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
It also leads the country in tax revenue, the use of foreign
investment, exports, retail sales and personal bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
Lu attributes Guangdong's success to the good use of its
proximity to Hong Kong while pioneering the country's market-
oriented reform.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, the late general architect of China's reform and
opening up policy, said in 1992 that Guangdong will catch up with
Asia's four "Little Dragons," Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the
Republic of Korea, by the next century.
</P>
<P>
The present Chinese government and State President Jiang Zemin
pin high hope on Guangdong and expect the province's three
economic zones and the economic belt of the Pearl River Delta to
take a faster pace in realizing the country's modernization target
in 2010.
</P>
<P>
To that end, Guangdong has a strategy for developing an export-
oriented economy through science and education and continuing a
sustainable economic growth, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's practice will provide experience for other parts of
the country to follow and it will not let the Chinese leadership
and people down, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Worries About Incomplete Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Y2K Commission has shown worry about the incomplete Y2K readiness
of some key sectors and government agencies as the government-set
deadline for Y2K compliance is drawing up.
</P>
<P>
Y2K Commission Chairman Amable Aguiluz told reporters Thursday
that only 80 percent of firms and government agencies were Y2K
ready as of last month.
</P>
<P>
While the commission wants to 100 percent readiness by the
pending deadline of September 30, he predicts that "it will only
be 88 percent at the end of the deadline set."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the commission reported only 200 of the more than
18,000 companies and government agencies belonging to the
so-called seven mission-critical sectors are Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
The seven mission-critical sectors include finance,
telecommunications, transportation, utilities, health care,
manufacturing and government service.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said the commission will go after companies and
government agencies which do not comply with the Y2K law.
</P>
<P>
All government agencies and private companies are required to
submit Y2K disclosure statements every month. Those which fail to
do so are presumed to be non-Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Those who could not be Y2K-compliant on September 30 will be
subjected to all the sanctions that are provided in the Y2K law,
Aguiluz stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, heads of the government agencies face
administrative charges, while private companies may be charged
under the Civil Code for damages related to the bug.

<HEADLINE> Russian Pilot Narrowly Escapes Landing on Highway in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A major disaster was
narrowly averted Wednesday night when the control tower at the Ben
Gurion Airport spotted a Russian passenger plane about to land at
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem Highway next to the airport, instead of on
the runway.
</P>
<P>
The controllers were able to contact the pilot at almost the
last second and order him to climb. The plane was only 100 meters
above the highway at the time and the pilot was instructed to fly
toward the sea before making a second approach, according to
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Later, the pilot executed the landing at the airport but
ignored the signalers on the ground and committed a series of
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
The crew was questioned by senior officials of Israel's Civil
Aviation Authority and the crew focused their debriefing on the
fact that the pilot had a poor command of English.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and the crew were released after being questioned.
The pilot was also examined for possible intoxication, but emerged
with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Tupelov 134, belongs to the BRZ Airlines, which
makes a weekly flight to Israel. About 40 passengers were on the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused a delay of about an hour in the scheduled
flight back to Russia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hawaiian Airlines Buys 13 Boeing 717s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Hawaiian Airlines said
Wednesday it has agreed to buy 13 Boeing 717-200 airplanes for 430
million U.S. dollars, according to a report reaching here late in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 12th-largest carrier said the order eventually
will replace its entire fleet of 15 inter-island aircraft, with
all of the new planes flying by the end of 2001. Hawaiian also has
an option to buy seven more airplanes before 2005 for an
additional 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Airlines will be able to increase customers by flying
more flights because the new aircraft are more efficient and less
costly to operate.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major investment in the future of the company,"
Hawaiian president Paul Casey said. "It underscores our commitment
to the future of inter-island travel."
</P>
<P>
Launched as the MD-95 in October 1995, the airplane was renamed
the Boeing 717-200 after McDonnell Douglas was merged into Boeing
two years ago. The first of the new models, produced in Long Beach,
California, is scheduled for delivery Thursday to AirTran Airways
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian would be the fifth airline to order the 717. The
Hawaiian Airlines order brings the total number of orders for the
model to 128, with options taken on 117 more.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Major on Preparation for Fortune Forum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is proud to be the
venue for the '99 Fortune Global Forum, Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the last high-level international economic event
that Shanghai will host for this century," Xu said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has turned from a processing, industrial city into a
multi-functional and modern international economic center over the
past 50 years, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and the State Council decided to set up the Pudong New Areas
in the early 1990s, the city of Shanghai has recorded rapid,
sustained and healthy economic development.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has maintained an annual double-digit economic
growth since 1992. At present, its industrial output value
accounts for 12 percent of the national total, its revenue income
is nine percent of the national total, and its import and export
value is one-fifth of the national total, the mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Shanghai totaled
368.8 billion yuan (44.4 billion US dollars), and the per-capita
GDP in the city exceeded 3,400 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The tremendous changes in Shanghai are the epitome of China.
In my view, this is the main reason the forum chose the city in
which to discuss China's development in the next 50 years," Xu
said.

<P>
MACAO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official stationed in
Hong Kong has announced that the United States will accord full
acceptance to the new passports of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
"Macao travelers will continue to enjoy the same favorable
treatment that Hong Kong travelers receive," Michael Klosson, U.S.
consul general in Hong Kong, said here Wednesday night at a
reception attended by Macao's senior government officials and
social celebrities.
</P>
<P>
A Macao Policy Act, now before the U.S. Congress, states that
after December 20, the U.S. should continue to play an active role
in maintaining Macao's confidence and prosperity, unique cultural
heritage, and the mutually beneficial ties between the people of
the United States and the people of Macao, Michael Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
The consul general also noted that the United States wants to
build on economic and commercial links with Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. currently receives nearly 50 percent of Macao's
exports. We hope to continue to serve as an important market for
Macao exporters, but are also eager to expand U.S. sales here,"
Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's infrastructural development has created and we hope
will continue to create opportunities for U.S. trade and
investment," the U.S. diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> US Pledges to Exert Influence Over Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has pledged to
exert its influence to accelerate the peace process in Cyprus,
Cyprus' Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said in New
York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Cyprus President Clerides reiterated his readiness to
participate in talks the U.N. chief is expected to invite next
month, Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described the meeting as constructive, saying
they discussed efforts to resume intercommunal talks under the
auspices of the U.N. Secretary General in a bid to achieve a
breakthrough and reach a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"All aspects were examined and the Greek Cypriot side stressed
the need to proceed with the implementation of U.N. Security
Council resolution 1250 which calls for the resumption of talks
without preconditions, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Clerides reiterated that "the Greek Cypriot
side is ready to participate in these talks on an absolutely equal
footing."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiations for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has said he will not
attend talks unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Albright did not indicate whether or not
Denktash will accept a U.N. talks invitation, but the sooner
the invitations go out, the sooner the answer will be known.
</P>
<P>
He said whatever form any negotiations take, they will not
be shuttle talks.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a process of more substantial talks," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit to Britain a New Milestone: Chinese Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador to Britain,
Ma Zhengang, said here Tuesday that Chinese President Jiang Zemin'
s state visit to Britain next month will be a new milestone in
Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China which falls on
October 1, Ma said, the Sino-British relations have been further
developed in recent years with increased exchanges and cooperation
in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
He added that long-term, sound and stable comprehensive
cooperative ties between China and Britain will not only benefit
the peoples of the two countries, but will also be in the common
interests of the peoples all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and the reunification
of the motherland is a strong common aspiration of all Chinese
people," he said, "We will adhere to the basic principles of '
peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems', and firmly
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said that since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China has
become a major power with economic, political and cultural
importance, and has been playing an important role in world events.
</P>
<P>
During the Asian economic crisis, China showed great courage in
resisting the easy option of devaluation. The decision was vital
to the stability of Hong Kong, the Asian region and vital to
stability for the global economy, Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we all want to see China playing a full part in
the world's economy and why we fully support and welcome her
entry into the World Trade Organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the deputy
prime minister said, the British-Chinese relations have been
strengthened and become matured.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Britain next
month, the first ever by a Chinese head of state, will be "an
important and highly symbolic occasion for the strong partnership
that we are building between our two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Among the 600 guests attending the banquet were Margaret
Beckett, Britain's lord president of the council and leader of the
house of commons, Baroness Jay, the lord privy seal and leader of
the house of lords, Chris Smith, secretary of culture, media and
sports as well as former Prime Minister Edward Heath.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The five-year construction of
the Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, which was completed recently,
has been approved following quality tests.
</P>
<P>
The 3,071-meter-long bridge at the lower reaches of the Yangtze
River has cost some 3.374 billion yuan (406 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With a main span of 1,385 meters, it is the longest suspension
bridge in China and fourth-longest in the world. The bridge is 36.
9 meters wide and has six lanes designed for speeds of up to 100
km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The main arch span of the bridge is 50 meters high, allowing 50,
000-ton class cargo ships to pass through safely.
</P>
<P>
The sunken foundation is 96 meters long, 51 meters wide, and
reaches a depth of 58 meters underground, making it the world's
largest.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is an important section of two national highways,
the Beijing-Shanghai national highway and the highway between the
city of Tongjiang (in north China's Heilongjiang Province) and
Sanya scenic tropical city (in south China's Hainan island
province). It will contribute to the economic growth of Jiangsu
and neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
The 5,800-km-long Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia.
Since China started to build its first large-scale bridge across
the river in Wuhan in 1954, fifteen gigantic bridges have been
built over the river, a vital impetus for the development of the
country's transportation and economy.

BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Lao currency the kip
Wednesday went against the sliding tide of Southeast Asian
currencies by appreciating against the Thai baht to 145 kip per

An official at the Lao Embassy in Bangkok confirmed the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' manufacturing
output, hurt by Asia's economic turmoil, decreased by 4.6 percent
year-on-year in July while net sales declined by 5.8 percent, the
government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, existing capacity continued to operate at low
levels, the National Statistics Office said, adding that
responding establishments operating below 70 percent of capacity
were 43.7 percent in July compared to 37.9 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
July is the second consecutive month posting manufacturing
output slowdown after a three-month increase starting in March,
which was the first month since January 1998 that the volume of
production index did not fall.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of basic metals, non-metallic mineral products,
petroleum, paper and paper products, furniture and fixtures, food,
beverages, tobacco, textiles and wearing apparel suffered declines
in both production and sales in July.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the fall to the prevailing weak
construction and consumer demand leading to the shutdown of some
machineries and plants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubber, transport equipment and electrical machinery
manufacturers managed to turn in positive performances in both
production and sales in July.
</P>
<P>
Separately, an index measuring the value of production
decreased 0.7 percent year-on-year in July, after rising 2.3
percent in June.

<HEADLINE> Safety First for Genetically-Modified Food: Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is taking a "safety
first" approach toward genetically-modified food (GMO), the
Bangkok Post Thursday quoted an Agriculture Ministry official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The country will not become involved in or promote the
application of genetically-modified organisms in food until
scientists can come up with solid evidence to prove that GMOs are
safe for consumers and the environment, Ampon Kittiapon, permanent
secretary for agriculture, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Thailand has no policy to promote modified
food and that rigorous studies will be made before there is any
change to this approach.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that many local importers require manufacturers
to label their products as free from GMOs because of consumer
worries.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials and those of other departments concerned
will work together to test products and certify exports as free
from GMOs.
</P>
<P>
Companies will be able to take part in the program on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thailand's clear position on GMOs would bring
windfalls for exporters, especially to markets with tough
requirements such as the European Union and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's New King Officially Installed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new King
Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, upon his ascendance to the
throne on Thursday, urged Malaysians to always uphold and respect
the system of Parliamentary democracy to ensure the country's
continued stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah was officially installed at a
traditional ceremony held at the National Palace here as the 11th
Supreme Head of State (paramount ruler) under the country's unique
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
At the glittering ceremony, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
read out the proclamation of installation and the Grand
Chamberlain Zubir Ali then presented the short-sword of state and
the oath letter to the King.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his installation, the king said the ability of the
various races to live in peace and harmony while respecting the
provisions in the Constitution is a matter of national pride.
</P>
<P>
"The special attributes of this multiracial country are its
eastern values, high ethics, courtesy, politeness and preserving
family harmony," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia practiced a system of government based on
Parliamentary Democracy and Constitutional Monarchy as provided
for in the Constitution, he said, adding "I am happy this system
has ensured the country's peace and progress."
</P>
<P>
Wanting his subjects to cherish racial harmony and strive with
determination for Malaysia's continued peace, progress and
prosperity, Sultan Salahuddin said Malaysians should always
cooperate with the Government in its efforts to raise productivity
and improve the competitiveness of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The mischievous attempts by certain groups to erode people's
confidence in the Government should be opposed to the end," the
King said, hoping his subjects of various races will not be
influenced or made use of by irresponsible groups.
</P>
<P>
"Our duty now is to ensure the country's full economic
recovery, " the King said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Malaysians in their pursuit of progress would not
neglect eastern values, discipline and loyalty to King and
country.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Salahuddin also expressed the hope that the general
election to be held in the country would proceed smoothly and
safely without any unpleasant incidents.
</P>
<P>
The general election is due by the first half of 2000 but there
are wide speculations that the polls would be held any time this
year.
</P>
<P>
The new King advised his people not to allow themselves to fall
prey to values which sacrificed the larger interests of the
community.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks to the government and people for their
expression of loyalty and congratulations on the occasion of his
installation.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that I will be able to discharge my duties and
responsibilities entrusted to me with wisdom, justice and
fairness," the new monarch said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sets Y2K for Protecting Threatened Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has declared year
2000 as the year for the "Conservation of Threatened Species" to
counter the imminent threat of extinction of endemic species of
fauna and flora, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Minister of Forest and
Environment Mahinda Wijesekera as saying it was a timely decision
because tropical countries like Sri Lanka accounted for a higher
level of biodiversity than others.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest study by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN), about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's
endemic species of fauna and flora face the threat of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The study said, "these figures are all the more significant as
they are not exhaustive. Only a mere 1,239 species of fauna and
flora and only 811 species of flowering plants have been evaluated
for threat status."
</P>
<P>
Wijesekera said the biodiversity crisis was very real as all
recognizable levels of biodiversity genes, species and ecosystems
had been threatened, adding that about one third of all animal and
plant species are likely to be lost during the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was time to reflect on changing
environmental, social, economic and political conditions and how
to adapt to these changes in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Meaningful results could be achieved if specialists in the
arena of conservation lend their pool of knowledge to formulate
and implement conservation strategies, he added.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has ordered curbs on imports of potassium chlorate,
following blasts in northern Thailand on Sunday, the Bangkok Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was quoted as saying on Wednesday that potassium
chlorate import quotas will be reviewed to limit domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Too much of the fertilizer composite had been brought into
the country, said Chuan, and the Agriculture Ministry would be
told to determine how the import volume could be cut without
hurting the farm sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the number of people killed in Sunday's
blast in a longan processing factory in northern Thailand has
risen to 35.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has noted that the factory had blown up because it had
not stored the substance correctly.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chuan had ordered five ministries to
adopt a coordinated system to monitor the use and storage of
potentially explosive potassium chlorate nationwide.

OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Swiss drug giant F. Hoffmann-
Laroche Ltd. and four other multinationals Wednesday were fined a
record sum of money up to more than 88 million Canadian dollars (
about 59 million U.S. dollars) in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann-LaRoche pleaded guilty in the Federal Court in Toronto

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Ambassador to China on Cross-Straits Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Ambassador to
Beijing James R. Sasser has warned that any attempt in Taiwan to
upset the present one-China policy will be detrimental to the U.S.
interests as well as to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said in a recent interview here with Xinhua that the one-
China policy has served all parties concerned very well for almost
30 years, including the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, the United
States and the people in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"To try to upset this relationship now and try to modify or
reframe it is not in the best interests of anyone, certainly not
in the interests of the United States. It's to hurt," said Sasser,
who was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the People's Republic of
China on January 10, 1996, and back home after completing his
tenure last June.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits relations have plunged into an abyss since Lee
Teng-hui put out the "state-to-state" fallacy last July in an
apparent bid to shred off the one-China policy as a major step
towards a de facto independence of the island.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that there would be some pulling back from the so-
called 'state-to-state' relations by the authorities of Taiwan,"
Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Taiwanese authorities "would make a great
mistake if they think the United States and the U.S. military is
going to back them no matter what sort of problems are at issue."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and the American people don't want to be
pulled into some sort of conflict in the Taiwan Straits by the
Taiwanese authorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has insisted that the dispute
between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland should be resolved between
themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has always embraced a peaceful reunification under the "
one country, two systems" formula, but does not rule out the use
of force as a last resort to prevent Taiwan's separation from
China.
</P>
<P>
The former ambassador witnessed in the last couple of years
heightening moments as the heads of state of the two countries
exchanged official visits in 1997 and 1998, as well as low ebbs
this year following the release of Cox report and the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador dismissed the Cox report, which smeared China
with nuclear espionage, as "overstated" and "not well researched."
</P>
<P>
He described the Cox report as having "a strong smell of
partisan politics" as well as "racist tones," because it aims just
at Chinese American scientists who work at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on, the Cox report will become more and more
discredited," Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also urged the Clinton administration to close
an agreement on China's access to the World Trade Organization (
WTO) by the end of this year as agreed upon by the two sides when
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji paid a visit here last spring.
</P>
<P>
Sasser pointed out that the growing economic ties between the
two countries are "very strong" and "very powerful."
</P>
<P>
"When there're difficulties in our relationship on the
political front, the economic ties have become the things that
kept the ship stay afloat," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sasser also rejected the so-called China threat from a
historical point of view, saying that Chinese history over the
past few centuries has proved that the Chinese nation is neither
militaristic nor expansionist.
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate it (China) will become a power which will
try to infringe upon its neighbors, or try to impose its will on
other countries against their will," he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Factories to Undergo Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe has stressed the need for factories and plants in the
country to undergo modernization and renovation.
He also said that private industries, which are only small-scale
ones, need to be upgraded into medium-scale and then into
large-scale ones.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with industrialists in Mandalay Industrial Zone in
central Myanmar on Tuesday, Than Shwe, who is the country's
chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, said the
government is providing assistance to private industrialists,
adding that without the government's help it is impossible for
them to develop, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have made allotments for 4,000 more
industrialists to engage in the activities in the Mandalay zone,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have also planned to extend low-interest loans
to industrialists beginning October 1 this year and to cut the
rate of revenues as part of its measures to encourage the
industrialists for the activities, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mandalay Industrial Zone is one of the 18 of its kind so far
established in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent issue of Myanmar Business News, there
registered 36,275 private industrial enterprises in Myanmar at the
end of 1998, of which 4,075 are medium-sized enterprises, while
30,650 are small-sized ones.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 7,980 are located in Mandalay, topping all other
states and divisions, followed by Yangon with 5,396 and Bago with
4,514.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial sector
accounts for 9.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP),
standing as the second largest contributor to the GDP after
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Discusses Industrial Reform With Non-Communist Parties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) met recently with non-communist
parties, the All-China Federation for Industry and Commerce, and
other non-Party figures to solicit suggestions and comments on a
draft decision on the reform and development of the country's
State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin, who
is also president of the country, presided over the meeting in
Zhongnanhai, the seat of the State Council. Premier Zhu Rongji,
Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan, and Vice-President
Hu Jintao also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that continuing the reform and opening-up drive and
modernizing the country in the next century require certain
measures for major issues. He explained that the 3rd Plenary
Session of the 15th Central Committee of the CPC last year dealt
with agriculture and that the 4th plenary session this year would
deal with reforms and development in State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the 4th plenary session is necessary because
State-owned enterprises as a whole have an important place in the
nation's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years since New China was founded, these enterprises
have made an enormous contribution to promoting industrialization
and modernization of the country, he said. But in view of the
fierce international competition at the end of the century,
economic strength and national defense ability and cohesion need
to be strengthened and, to achieve that, the continued development
of the State sector of the economy is needed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in the 20 years of reforms, these enterprises have
made giant strides while trying to fit the needs of a socialist
market economy and some have accumulated valuable experience and
better conditions for further improving management.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that enterprise reforms have reached a crucial
period and some hidden problems have been uncovered and demand
urgent practical policies.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the CPC Central Committee held it as timely and
necessary to concentrate on the reform and development of State-
owned enterprises at its 4th plenary session, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision for discussion at the 4th plenary
session has been drafted with the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and in the spirit of the 15th Party Congress, with an aim to make
new breakthroughs in State-owned enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the non-communist parties, the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-Party figures have
shown great concern for the reforms and development of State
industry and have made some good suggestions. He said he hopes
that they will continue to provide comments about revising the
draft.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the system of multi-party cooperation
and political consultation with the CPC at the head, is China's
basic political system and an important form of socialist
democratic politics. The CPC consulting the non-communist parties
for the sake of improving the CPC's policy making is significant,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the non-communist parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce approved the draft at the
meeting but offered suggestions on revising it. Most of the
suggestions dealt with technological renovation, the high-tech
sector, improved supervision over enterprises, and social security
and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang thanked them for their candid comments and suggestions
and arranged to revise the draft.
</P>
<P>
The 4th plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee was
held between September 19-22, and discussed and approved the
decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) --The Australian army is
planning to recruit reserves to support its mission in East Timor,
a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The rotation requires an expansion of the current force. That
will be achieved by fleshing out the 7th Brigade and increasing
its full-time component," Australian Defense Force spokesman
Colonel Duncan Lewis was quoted Thursday by the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) as telling reporters.
The 7th Task Force, an infantry brigade stationed in Brisbane, is
currently made up mostly of part-timers.
According to the spokesman, the Australian defense force holds
only about 23,000 standing troops and is not enough to rotate the
panned force of 4,500 in East Timor.
The Australian government has promised to meet the cost of
raising another brigade of troops to ensure Australia can
maintain its 4,500-strong force in East Timor.

Keobounphan, Foreign Minister Somsawat Lengsavad and Minister and
Chief of the Government Office Saysomphone Phomvihan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua recently in the Lao capital of
Vientiane, Prime Minister Sisavat said China's achievements in the
50 years show the advantages and vitality of socialism.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China half a century
ago was a great victory after arduous struggle under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"It ended the history of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism in
China and enabled the Chinese people to be real masters of their
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was making the remarks pending the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on
October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, Chinese people have built a backward
and poverty-stricken country into a powerful socialist state, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He was most impressed by the great changes in China in the past
20 years after China adopted the reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
"China has adopted the economic policy which conforms to the
real situation of the country and therefore its productive forces
improved rapidly," Sisavat said.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1997, China's gross national product (GNP) were
increasing at an average annual rate of 9.8 percent, making the
country one of the fastest growing countries in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saysomphone, an economist who is also president of the Lao-
Chinese Friendship Association, elaborated on China's economic
development in a separate interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The reform and opening-up policy has brought the Chinese
people real benefits as their living standard has been greatly
improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that rural areas in China have seen significant changes
in these years.
</P>
<P>
He was also impressed by the special economic zones in China,
which enjoy favorable policies and therefore become very
attractive to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
With the world's largest population of more than 1.2 billion,
China has accomplished what might take other countries scores of
years or even a century to achieve, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Somsawat also expressed his appreciation of
China's accomplishment in the diplomatic field, saying as one of
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
China has become more and more influential in the world.
</P>
<P>
"A powerful China is a very important element to ensure the
stability of the region and of the world at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed gratitude for China's keeping its promise of
not devaluating its currency in the face of the Asian financial
crisis, saying China's decision can only come from a strong sense
of responsibility for the region.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges All Parties of Congo to Implement Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its declaration of September 1999, the EU acknowledged the
completion of the signing of the Lusaka agreement and expressed
its readiness to support the implementation of the agreement,
provided that all the parties themselves implement it in
accordance with its terms.
</P>
<P>
A Finnish presidential declaration released here today said the
EU expresses deep concerns over the delays in the implementation
of the agreement by the parties, the continued military activities
and hostile propaganda. The essential requirements for
implementing the agreement have not been fulfilled. For instance,
the selection of the representatives for the Joint Military
Commission has not been completed and the facilitator for the
national dialogue has not been agreed upon by all the parties .
</P>
<P>
"The EU therefore strongly urges all parties to fully abide by
the contents and the time-table of the agreement, which is the
negotiated instrument for a peaceful solution of the conflict.
The EU also encourages the UN and the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to make all necessary efforts to support the
implementation of the agreement," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It also added that the EU will continue to support various
components in the implementation of the agreement, such as the
peace-keeping operations by the UN and the OAU, the Joint Military
Commission, the national dialogue, the reintegration of refugees
and displaced people in their countries of origin and the process
of democratization, re-habilitation and reconstruction in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers End Toronto Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers ended
their two-day informal meeting in Toronto Wednesday, with U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen urging more spending from member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo experience is a lesson for NATO which needs more
transport ships and aircraft, improved communications and better
air-ground surveillance, Canadian media quoted the secretary as
saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO had to rely heavily on the American military in its air
strike against Yugoslavia, exposing "deficiencies" in terms of
equipment ranging from surveillance systems to precision-guided
weapons, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some member countries would simply "have to spend more" to
close the technology gap with the U.S., Cohen told the meeting,
adding he wanted NATO to set priority targets by December, when
ministers will work out a timetable for improvements.
</P>
<P>
NATO ministers agreed earlier to cut down troops in Bosnia from
the current 30,000 to 21,000. NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said Tuesday that a cut in peacekeeping forces in the
Balkans is possible due to the improved security in the region.
</P>
<P>
This was the last meeting of NATO defense ministers attended by
Solana in the capacity of secretary-general. British Defense
Minister George Robertson will replace him as NATO chief next
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel group will
meet with the country's peace mediator Thursday in Venezuela,
Venezuelan Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Valero said that the Venezuelan government last Monday received
a fax signed by Pablo Beltran, Commander of Colombia's National
Liberation Army (ELN), asking for convocation of peace talks in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting between the ELN, Colombia's second largest
guerrilla group, and the Civil Society of Colombia was held here
on September 16.
</P>
<P>
The venue of Thursday's meeting is not known.
</P>
<P>
In both February and March, various meetings were held in
Venezuela between ELN delegates and the High Commissioner for
Peace, Victor G. Ricardo, and representatives from different non-
governmental sectors of the Colombian society.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting took place on February 9-11 between Ricardo
and Antonio Garcia, the second figure in the command of the ELN.
</P>
<P>
It concluded without any kind of agreement, because the
Colombian government would not accept the ELN's request to
demilitarize four municipalities in the province of Bolivar.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Tourism on Road to Recovery: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian tourism is showing
signs of recovery despite the continuing monetary crisis and
political uncertainty, Director General of Tourism Gede Ardika has
said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has shown significant growth in foreign exchange
earnings, as visitor arrivals from January to July 1999 totaled
2,237,928 compared to 2,019,052 during the first seven months of
1998 through 13 main gateways, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The political situation has created many changes to take the
nation along the path to democracy. In the tourism sector we have
a new paradigm in tourism promotion. We have changed direction
from a centralist to a de-centralist policy which has had the
effect of altering the position of our tourism image," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the tourism industry, it has meant the deregulation of the
licensing process, giving the provinces the authority to issue
permits for tourism development, Ardika was quoted by Thursday's
Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the industry is coming up with innovations,
offering a host of new packages at bargain prices, adding that
familiarization tours are being organized so that tour operators
and travel journalists can see the real situation in Indonesia, he
added.

<P>
ALMA ATA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen countries including
China, Uzbekistan and Turkey vowed to revive the ancient Silk Road
at a three-day international meeting ending on Wednesday,

setting up U.S. military bases in Bulgarian territory, President
Peter Stoyanov said Wednesday in connection with a recent report
by Russian magazine "Express."
</P>
<P>
"However, we should not approach this problem shyly if Bulgaria
is oriented towards NATO membership," Stoyanov said in the city of
Veliko Turnovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that following the devastating earthquake in
Turkey, in which a big U.S. military base was destroyed, U.S.
warships take shelter in Bulgarian ports, if the U.S. navy command
makes a request to this end," the president was quoted as saying
by the local media.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian head of state and his, wife Antonina Stoyanova,
are in Veliko Turnovo to take part in the national celebrations
marking the 91st anniversary of Bulgaria's independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
economy, submerged in its worst recession for over 50 years, fell
by 7.56 percent in the second quarter of the year, compared with
the same period of 1998, said the National Administrative
Department of Statistics (DANE) on Wednesday.

<P>
The greatest contractions sections were farming (4.93 percent),
construction (24 percent), the manufacturing industry (17 percent)
and the financial institutions (7.03 percent), said DANE.

Coffee production, one of the principal export products of the
country, registered a contraction of 16.74 percent over the period
April-June, almost doubling that of the previous quarter of 8.04
percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves, after months of stability, fell to
8.391 billion dollars in the quarter, compared with 8.7 billion
dollars at the end of 1998, while the unemployment rate reached

CARACAS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's food consumption
fell by 10.6 percent in the first eight months of the year,
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the study of the Datanalisis company published
Wednesday, the Venezuelan family income dropped by 5.5 percent in
the same period, which has limited the purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
However, the company forecast that by the end of 1999, the
consumption is expected to increase, since the price of oil, the
country's principal export, has been rising in the world market.

<HEADLINE> CPV, CPJ to Further Strengthen Friendly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Communist
Party of Vietnam (CPV) and the Communist Party of Japan (CPJ)
agreed to further strengthen friendly relations of the two parties
during their talks here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of CPV Le Kha Phieu had talks with Chairman
of the Presidium of CPJ Central Committee Tetsuzo Fuwa, who is on
an official friendship visit to Vietnam at the invitation of CPV,
according to local press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two party leaders had examined each
party's situation and discussed future activities to promote
bilateral relations between the two parties in line with the
promotion of cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Phieu congratulated the CPJ over its victory in the recent
elections, saying the CPJ has thus gained a very important
position in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa's visit, which he said
contributed to the strengthening of the ties between the two
parties and the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary pledged that the CPV and the Vietnamese
people will always support CPJ in its struggle to improve people's
livelihoods and encourage social progress in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tetsuzo congratulated Vietnam on the great achievements
recorded by its people during Doi Moi (renovation), saying that he
hoped the Vietnamese people would achieve more successes in their
desire to construct a modern industrial society.
</P>
<P>
Tetsuzo Fuwa and his delegation arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on
Monday, beginning a six-day official visit to Vietnam after ending
his visit to Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Tetsuzo Fuwa, who is on tour of Southeast Asian countries, will
conclude his visit to Vietnam on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Callens Advances to Luxembourg Open Quarters </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Els Callens, who got into the
Luxembourg Open women's tournament when America Serena Williams
withdrew, won her first match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Callens beat Barbara Schwartz of Austria 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 in her
opening match and reached the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Williams withdrew from the tournament on Tuesday, saying she
was exhausted after three straight weeks of tennis. That gave
Callens, a Belgian, a berth as a lucky loser from the qualifying
round.
</P>
<P>
On a good day for Belgians, she was joined by No. 2 seed
Dominique Van Roost in the quarterfinals. Van Roost rallied from
one set down to upset Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
A third Belgian, qualifier Kim Clijsters, also advanced after
romped Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik 6-1, 6-1 to reach the second
round.
</P>

In other action Wednesday, sixth-seeded Silvia Farina of Italy
dispatched France's Sarah Pitkowski 6-1, 6-4 to move into the

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Fast Recovery From Crisis in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said the macroeconomic performance of the crisis-hit
economies in Asia has continued to improve in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Positive GDP growth is expected in almost all countries in the
region in 1999 as a whole, with projections in some cases revised
up substantially, the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis in Asia is largely over," said Michael
Mussa, IMF economic counselor and director of the Research
Department, at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines should end up with a substantially better economic
performance this year and next than estimated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"Stronger growth is projected for 2000 in most countries as the
recent improvements in economic confidence and activity are
followed by a broader-based pickup in domestic demand," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Exports have generally increased, supported by competitive
exchange rates and improved growth in regional trading partners,
said the report. The bottoming out of some commodity prices and an
upturn in the electronics industry have also helped to underpin
the recovery.
</P>
<P>
The partial recovery of capital inflows has eased financing
constraints in most cases, and the rise in confidence, along with
declining inflation, has permitted further monetary easing. Fiscal
policy also continues to play an important supportive role.
</P>
<P>
A resumption of inventory accumulation is being felt as well,
while weather-related turnarounds in agriculture are also
contributing to growth in Indonesia and the Philippines, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report cautioned that for the recovery to be
sustainable, there is an agenda of structural reforms still to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
"Reforms in the corporate sector are lagging behind in all the
crisis countries, and past experience from many other countries
points to the risk that losses in this sector, rather than being
borne by corporate shareholders, may be largely shifted to the
financial system and ultimately to taxpayers through repeated
recapitalizations of banks," the report said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been recovering at a surprising fast pace from
the sharp contraction of 1998, backed by supportive macroeconomic
policies.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, a strong economic recovery is also now under way
in response to fiscal and monetary stimulus and the pegging of the
exchange rate at a competitive level.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand also the recovery has strengthened, the report
said. A range of indicators point to an increase in consumer
spending, and net exports have also picked up.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit crisis economy in Asia, Indonesia, now also
seems to have turned around, and although real GDP is still
projected to decline a little further in 1999 as a whole, positive
growth resumed in the first half.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, a turnaround in agriculture and rising
exports are supporting a broader pickup in domestic output and
spending.
</P>
<P>
Following the weakening of activity in 1998, a strong economic
recovery is under way in Singapore, with growth of 4-5 percent
expected in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
There are also recent signs of an economic turnaround in
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Led by a rebound
in private consumption, output rose sharply in the second quarter
this year after five consecutive quarters of decline.
</P>
<P>
China has weathered the effects of the Asian crisis relatively
well, aided by fiscal stimulus in mid-1998, and also by its
relatively strong external position, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Seeks More Sufficient Action on Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia said Wednesday
that the international community should take more sufficient
actions on debt relief for the poor nations, in order to pave the
way for the economic development in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Zambian President Frederick Chiluba was
addressing the General Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
"External debt remains both a burden and a major impediment to
the development process of many developing countries, including my
country Zambia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we welcome the recent outcome of the G-8 Summit held in
Cologne, Germany, on the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
initiative, the measures for faster, broader and deeper debt
relief, in our view, are not sufficient to resolve the external
debt problem of developing countries, especially the poorest among
them, unless they are translated in real tangible, practical,
economic, development programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the view of my government that the G-8 target of debt
relief of about 100 billion U.S. dollars for the poorest countries
in the world, the majority of whom are in Africa, will have little
effect on the problem unless the terms of the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries initiative are further revised in such a way
as to make them more flexible and tailored to suit the specific
conditions of the targeted countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of us in the developing countries understand that, in
order to survive and contribute positively in the global markets,
we need to make our economies more competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These challenges cannot be wished away, neither can they be
remedied by empty statements," he said. "Global poverty will only
be eradicated by a concerted global program."
</P>
<P>
"By solving the issue of poverty, the world will solve the
problem of conflict and instability in the developing countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president voiced his deep concerns over "the
continued deterioration of the financial situation of the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
"This situation is well known to all of us in this Assembly, as
it has been the focus of our discussions for the past five years
now," he said. "The reform of the United Nations will not be
implemented effectively if the financial situation is not
seriously addressed."
</P>
<P>
"It is the inescapable duty of all of us to honor our
obligations by ensuring that we pay our assessed contributions in
full, on time, and without conditions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopeful on DPRK's Pledge on Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Wednesday expressed the hope that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) would commit itself to a pledge not to
test a long-range missile after the United States partially lifted
sanctions last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, when asked by reporters at the White House whether he
believed the DPRK would hold to its commitment, said, "I do. And
of course, if the future proves otherwise, there are always other
options open to us."
</P>
<P>
During talks in Berlin, Germany, on Sept. 7-12, the United
States promised to ease the sanctions in return for the DPRK's
pledge not to engage in a missile test launch, which was said to
be accepted by Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the mutual compromise between Washington and
Pyongyang would contribute to the easing of tensions on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very hopeful about it. If it works, it does," he
said. Under the easing of sanctions, trade in most consumer goods,
commercial transport of cargo and passengers, and funds transfers
between individuals in the U.S. and DPRK will be allowed in most
cases.
</P>
<P>
Investment in raw materials sectors including agriculture,
petroleum and timber, as well as in infrastructure and tourism,
also will be permitted.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Chief Says Sorry to Duchess of Kent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon tennis chief John
Curry apologized Wednesday to the Duchess of Kent after forbidding
non-royal children from the royal box - but he is standing by the
ban.
</P>
<P>
The duchess, 66, a long-time supporter of the All England Club,
was said to be considering boycotting the royal enclosure
following a letter from Curry. She was also reported to be "deeply
hurt" by the letter.
</P>
<P>
Curry, 61, said: "I regret any unintentional hurt this may have
caused Her Royal Highness."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the letter, he said he had written to thank her for
her years of support at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
He said he had also "reconfirmed guidelines concerning the
invitation of additional guests and the subject of children".
</P>
<P>
Curry, who steps down as chairman of the All England Lawn
Tennis and Croquet Club in December, explained the thinking behind
the ban.
</P>
<P>
"Because of demand for space in the royal box, we also ask that,
apart from children of the Royal Family, children are not invited
as they exclude other worthy people from attending, many of whom
contribute to tennis," he said.
</P>
<P>
However he denied reports that he had restricted the number of
the duchess's guests to one each day.
</P>
<P>
"No royal has been limited to one guest in the past or will be
in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The duchess, 66, whose husband, the Duke of Kent, has been
president of the All England Club for 30 years, is thought to have
been upset by an incident at this summer's tournament.
</P>
<P>
She was refused a place in the 75-seat Royal box for the 12-
year-old son of a bereaved friend.
</P>
<P>
The most regular royal attender of Wimbledon, she has become
its royal "face". Her presentation of the winners' trophies is an
annual tradition.
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the championships it is thought she may obtain
her own tickets for the Center Court or Court One.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Duchess of Kent said: "The Duchess has
asked me to make clear that she respects the rules and regulations
of the All England Lawn Tennis Club with whom she shares a wish to
encourage more children and young people to watch and participate
in tennis.
</P>
<P>
"She has also asked me to say that, as in previous years, she
is much looking forward to attending next year's championships and
the next Davis Cup matches," added the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Happy as Big Gamble Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
admitted Wednesday night he had landed a massive gamble in order
to keep Arsenal's Champions League dreams alive.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal ended with four forwards on the pitch as they
desperately sought the vital three points against AIK Solna at
Wembley, beating the rivals with 3-1.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners looked set for a draw after Fredrik Ljungberg's
first-half goal was canceled out by Krister Nordin after the break.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger's gamble of bringing on both Thierry Henry and Kanu
paid off as the Frenchman and Croatian Davor Suker scored in
injury-time.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said: "It was a gamble but not to have won tonight would
have made it nearly impossible to qualify. "We would not have been
out mathematically but it would have been very difficult. It still
is, but at least we have the points.
</P>
<P>
"Their goal was a major psychological blow because they hadn't
looked dangerous in the first-half but these games are decided
more and more in the last five minutes when players are really
tired, and it shows the value of the bench.
</P>
<P>
"At some stage I was concerned that we could lose the game
because we had everybody forward and they were dangerous on the
break. "Games like this are not good for the heart but you forget
about that when you score and when you win," he said.

maximum six.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, who have failed to get past the group stage in the
last two seasons, look well placed this time after beating Italy's
Fiorentina 4-2 at the Nou Camp for their second win in group B.
</P>
<P>
Lazio came from behind to beat Dynamo Kiev 2-1 while Arsenal
scored twice in injury time to beat AIK Stockholm 3-1 at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
There were also wins for Germany's Bayer Leverkusen and
Borussia Dortmund while Norway's Rosenborg Trondheim drew 2-2 with
Dutch side Feyenoord.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United eased past Sturm, the Austrian double-winners,
without ever having to hit top gear.
</P>
<P>
Roy Keane, back after a month's injury absence, fired them
ahead with a 25 meter drive after 15 minutes and then two goals in
two minutes by Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole later in the half
settled it.
</P>
<P>
Marseille went ahead after five minutes in Zagreb when Ibrahima
Bakayoko scored but Tomo Sokota got a deserved equalizer in the
64th.
</P>
<P>
The hosts continued to press but Marseille grabbed the winner
with a great volley by Sebastien Perez 13 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barcelona were fortunate to beat AIK Stockholm 2-1
with two late goals but this time they struck early as Luis Figo
and Luis Enrique Martinez had them two up after 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Christian Amoroso pulled one back for Fiorentina five minutes
after halftime but two for Rivaldo settled it.
</P>
<P>
AIK suffered heartbreak for the second time in a week after
again being caught at the death.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal dominated the first half and led through their own
Swede Fredrik Ljungberg after 28 minutes but Krister Nordin
equalized for AIK six minutes after the break.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal continued to press and got their reward when Thierry
Henry scored in injury time and Davor Suker added a third.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona have six points to the four of Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Lazio hit two goals in two minutes to beat Kiev in their group
A clash in Rome.
</P>
<P>
A Serhiy Rebrov penalty had the Ukrainians ahead after 67
minutes but Paolo Negro (69) and Marcelo Salas (71) turned things
round.
</P>
<P>
Lazio have four points, as do Bayer Leverkusen after the
Germans won 2-0 at Maribor Teatanic of Slovenia with late goals by
Boris Zivkovic and Ulf Kirsten..
</P>
<P>
Kiev, semifinalists last season, are still pointless after two
games.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund completed a good night for Germany as Fredi Bobic hit
two in the 3-1 home win over Boavista in group C.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund have four points, as do Rosenborg, who twice came from
behind to draw 2-2 with Feyenoord.
</P>
<P>
All four goals came in a hectic first 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Three of them came in a four minute spell as John Carew first
equalized Jon Dahl Tomasson's opening goal in the 21st minute and
then canceled out Brazilian Kalou's 22nd minute goal with another
equalizer two minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Improved U.S.-DPRK Ties to Help Better Seoul-Pyongyang Relations: Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung said Wednesday that improved relations between the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States will help
better relations between Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks at a meeting with visiting U.S coordinator
for DPRK policy William Perry, who arrived here earlier in the day
for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim spoke highly of Perry for his "active
and sincere attitude" over his report of policy recommendation to
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Congress, calling the report "
realistic."
</P>
<P>
Kim said further Washington-Tokyo-Seoul cooperation will be
very important in helping the implementation of Perry's report.
</P>
<P>
Perry, the former U.S. defense secretary, said his report based
on President Kim's "sunshine policy" to Pyongyang is a product of
Washington-Tokyo-Seoul cooperation.

to create an atmosphere conducive to the DPRK's suspension of its
test-firing of long-range missiles in exchange for Washington's
lifting of economic sanctions.

week to ease trade and economic sanctions against Pyongyang.

ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An Italian navy transport ship
weighed anchor Wednesday night at the Italian central port of
Livorno, bound for East Timor with Folgore and Carabinieri
paratroopers, vehicles and supplies aboard.
</P>
<P>
Six hundred Italian soldiers will participate in the U.N.
mission in the ex-Portuguese colony, with a company of 200
parachute troops expected to arrive on the island before the end
of the month, the Italian Defense Ministry said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Most troops, equipment and supplies will be transported by sea
on board the San Giusto, which recently took part in humanitarian
operations for earthquake-stricken Turkey, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Present for the departure of the transport ship from the port,
Italian Defense Undersecretary Paolo Guerrini said the
peacekeeping mission was agreed to "also on the recommendation of
the Italian government which very strongly urged" the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The paratroopers aboard the San Giusto will reach Townsville,
Australia, and then the East Timorese capital of Dili after about
four weeks at sea.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be joining an 8,000-strong force in which there
will be 4,500 Australians. About 2,000 Australians with British
Gurkhas and troops from New Zealand have already landed on the
island.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges New Approaches for Broad-Based Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday
urged the international community to formulate new approaches for
broad-based development, guided by the need for economic equality
for individuals and nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said free
markets and free political systems are rapidly integrating the
world across frontiers and continents, and most developing
countries have been bypassed by the benefits of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"In trade, we need a truly level playing field to ensure
greater balance in the benefits of a rules-based multilateral
trading system for the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In finance, we need a more stable financial order which can
control the volatility of capital flows, make available adequate
liquidity, especially for developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In technology, with an increasingly knowledge-based global
economy, the technology gap must be rapidly narrowed. To this end,
it would be useful to evolve global principles and guidelines for
access to and transfer of technology," he added.

<HEADLINE> India Advocates Role of State, Importance of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday
emphasized the role of state in a globalizing world and the
importance of development to enhancing human rights.
</P>
<P>
It would be an error to assume that the days of the state are
over, said Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh at the general
debate of the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The state and national sovereignties continue to have a crucial
role and relevance today, he said, noting that "there is no
substitute to the sovereign state, even gobolization can but work
through state intermediaries only."
</P>
<P>
The state needs to be strengthened, Singh said, adding that to
diminish, marginalize or to ignore the state would be "bad
practice" because "the weaker the state is rendered, the less
shall it be able to promote the interests of its citizens."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the relationship between human rights and
development, the minister said human rights requires economic
growth because many of the deprivations faced by individuals are
rooted in marginalization created by poverty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, development should be "the cross-cutting theme of
the United Nations" and the multilateral development system must
be strengthened, he said.
