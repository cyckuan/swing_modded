<HEADLINE> Nigerian Civil Servants Threaten to Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Civil servants in Nigeria's 36
states are threatening to go on a nationwide strike if their
demands for a new minimum wage are not met, a week after the
settlement of the one sparked by a 50 percent hike in the prices
of petroleum products, sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, the federal government announced 7,500 naira (about
75 U.S. dollars) monthly minimum wage for its workers and 5,500
naira (about 55 U. S. dollars) for those employed by state
governments.
</P>
<P>
Public workers in most states are demanding minimum wages
ranging from 6, 500 naira (about 65 U.S. dollars) to 7,500 naira.
</P>
<P>
But most of the state governments have said that they would
have to sack a large proportion of their work force to pay the
amount approved by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The 36 state governors and the state councils of the Nigeria
Labor Congress have scheduled a meeting in the capital Abuja on
Thursday to discuss the wage controversy.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Urges UN to Try Rebel Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government has
asked the United Nations to set up an international tribunal to
try rebel leader Foday Sankoh and others, reports reaching here
from Freetown said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Sierra Leone's Information Minister Julius
Spencer as saying that his government had called for the
establishment of a tribunal on Sierra Leone soil to operate under
a combination of Sierra Leone and international law.
</P>
<P>
"The tribunal will be set up to try for crimes past and
present," the minister said, adding "the initial work (for the
tribunal) has begun."
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh was
arrested on May 17 in the capital Freetown and has since been
detained at a secret location after the RUF rebels held hostages
of about 500 U.N. peacekeepers in early May over disarmament
dispute and fired at demonstrators in front of Sankoh's home in
Freetown..
</P>
<P>
He was once sentenced to death for treason in 1998 but was
granted a presidential pardon last year as part of the Lome peace
accord signed last July between the Sierra Leone government and
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The accord gave a blanket amnesty for all human rights abuses
committed up to the date of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has gained worldwide notoriety during the course of
Sierra Leone' s eight-year civil war for the murder, rape and
mutilation of civilians, including children.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. criminal tribunal has been set up in Tanzania's northern
town of Arusha to try perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
but it has been criticized by the Rwandan government for its slow
progress in bringing the ringleaders to justice.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An 88th minute panalty in scored
by substitute Ioan Ganea helped Romania dramatically come from
behind to beat England 3-2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dejected England fans trooped out of Charleroi after their
team were knocked out of the championship.
</P>
<P>
Defender Phil Neville hauled down Viorel Moldovan wide on the
right and Swiss referee Urs Meier pointed to the spot. Ganea sent
goalkeeper Nigel Martyn the wrong way and the Romanians marched
into the last eight along with Group A winner Portugal.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan was devastated for the defeat,
saying "We did not play well enough but with five minutes to go I
thought we could hang on to something. But it was not to be."
</P>
<P>
Romania, needing to win to go through, led after 22 minutes
with a goal by Cristian Chivu but an Alan Shearer penalty and a
goal by Michael Owen gave England an undeserved 2-1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Dorinel Munteanu equalised early in the second half and
Romania then ran the match but could not turn their dominance into
a third goal and England looked like they would qualify -until
Neville's late foul.
</P>
<P>
After surviving a couple of early scares England fell behind
in the 22nd minute when they allowed Chivu all the time he wanted
to curl the ball from almost on the byline over goalkeeper Nigel
Martyn, a late replacement for David Seaman, and in off a post.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Ilie should have made it 2-0 when he headed straight at
Martyn after 33 minutes and Chivu shot just over the bar soon
after as Adrian Mutu, a more than capable replacement for the
suspended Gheoghe Hagi, carved through the English midfield at
will.
</P>
<P>
But England, who had barely threatened, equalised in the 40th
minute when Shearer converted a penalty after Chivu had tripped
Paul Ince.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes into first half injury time they grabbed a shock
lead when Paul Scholes lifted a delicate pass into the path of
Owen whose pace enabled him to get past the the advancing Bogdan
Stelea and score.
</P>
<P>
Romania were level within three minutes of the second half
when a poor punch by Martyn was lashed back past him by Munteanu.
</P>
<P>
England, as in their opening game against Portugal, seemed
completely unable to prevent themselves being overrun in midfield
as Mutu, Ilie, Constantin Galca, and Cosmin Contra found space at
will.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of English fans had tickets for the Romania end, and
although separated by a thin line of stewards, both sets of fans
caused no trouble.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Minister-delegate to
the Foreign Ministry in charge of cooperation Charles Josselin said
here Wednesday that he believed security and stability in Jordan
would attract more French investments.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the end of his two-day visit, Josselin
said French companies were willing to establish joint ventures and
increase investments in the water, irrigation and tourism sectors
in the kingdom with their Jordanian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He described his visit to Jordan as a reflection of the close
and strong ties between the two countries, and said France would
donate another 8,000 tons of wheat in addition to the 4,000 tons
already sent as drought relief aid to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He also commended Jordan`s effort to promote the Arab-Israeli
peace process since it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state
in 1994.
</P>
<P>

constructive."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel's Meretz Party Quits Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's leftist party Meretz
decided Wednesday to quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition
government in what it called an effort to further Barak's
peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Three Meretz cabinet ministers will tender their resignations to
Barak later on Wednesday after the party's 10 Knesset (parliament)
members met and made the decision earlier, according to Israel
Television.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's decision may improve Barak's chances to save his
floundering government from a deepening crisis caused by defection
of the biggest coalition partner, the ultra-orthodox Shas party,
which demanded more funds for its ill-managed school system and
legalization of its radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which has 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset, quit Barak's
government on Tuesday. It has blamed Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, the
education minister, for refusing its demands for funding and
control of the religious school system.
</P>
<P>
Its departure leaves Barak's coalition with a minority in the
Knesset after 11 months in power. Barak's representatives and Shas
leaders were negotiating a compromise, in an attempt to keep a
fine-tuned government before Tuesday's resignations of four Shas
ministers take effect 48 hours later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meretz, the secular, left-wing party with 10 seats in the
Knesset, said its withdrawal from the government was in the
interests of furthering Barak's peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Its leader Yossi Sarid said that Meretz will support the peace
process, whether it is inside or outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The government crisis broke out at a critical juncture, as
Israel and the Palestinians were trying to resolve the thorniest
issues at the core of their conflict: Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and water.
</P>
<P>
Shas raised its demands Tuesday for more involvement in
decision-making in peace talks, and voiced its opposition to more
West Bank land transfer to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iran, EU Ready for More Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In their fifth round of "
constructive dialog" held here on Wednesday, Iran and the European
Union (EU) voiced their determination to bolster cooperation in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian panel was headed by Deputy Foreign Minister for
European and American Affairs Morteza Sarmadi and the other side by
Portuguese Deputy Foreign Minister Francisco Costa, whose country
is the current rotating chairman of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said after the talks
that it is necessary for Iran and the EU to continue their dialog
in order to promote mutual understanding, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Costa, Kharrazi termed as positive the Iran-EU
cooperation in bilateral, regional and international fields.
</P>
<P>
He cited the campaign against narcotics smuggling and the
problem with refugees as the most important grounds for cooperation
between Iran and the 15-nation European group.
</P>
<P>
Drug producers in Afghanistan are smuggling narcotics to Europe
via Iran, hence the more the European countries cooperate with Iran
in campaign against drugs, the less their problems in this respect
would be, said Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the planned formation of working
groups by Iran and the EU for mutual cooperation in anti-drug
campaigns and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Costa termed the outcome of the fifth Iran-EU dialogue as
comprehensive, helpful and fruitful, stressing the importance of
forming working groups for further convergence and understanding.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted various dimensions of dialogue and cooperation
between Iran and the EU, including trade, investment, anti-drug
campaigns and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the two sides exchanged views on
such areas of bilateral cooperation as energy, transportation,
commerce and investment, narcotics, refugees and the environment,
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed regional issues such as those pertaining to
Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea,
Central Asia and the Balkans as well as international issues on
disarmament, terrorism and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Previous four rounds of talks were held in Tehran and European
capitals.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Iran started their so-called "constructive dialogue"
in July 1998, instead of the previous "critical dialogue,"
following a warm-up between the two sides after President Mohammad
Khatami started a new policy of detente in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU launched the so-called "critical dialogue" with Iran in
December 1992 with an aim to soften Iran's policies on the Middle
East peace process, international terrorism and production of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue was suspended in April 1997 after a Berlin court
verdict accused Iranian leaders of being behind a terrorist
assassination of Iranian dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to resume talks with Iran in March 1998 after the
two sides ended the diplomatic row over the Berlin court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Pledges Support for Cyprus Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people support
reunification of Cyprus and an end to occupation by foreign troops
of the island's northern part, said a visiting Palestinian official
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is "an important strategic ally for the Palestinian
people in their quest for independence, freedom, prosperity and
development," said Nabil Shaath, minister of International
Cooperation of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), who
arrived here Wednesday for an official two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1974 we support the unity of Cyprus, the sovereignty of
the Republic of Cyprus, the unity of the people and the end of
occupation," said Shaath after meeting Cyprus Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said Cyprus and the PNA are trying to strengthen their
relations, not only in the political arena, but also in the fields
of economy, trade, investment, culture, transport, tourism,
education and high technology.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that Cyprus will become a full member of
the European Union at the earliest date.
</P>
<P>
"We would very much like to seek Cyprus becoming a connection
hub to Europe and the rest of the world for our airlines, as well
as a connection hub for cable communications and Internet," Shaath
said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides said he was briefed on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, adding Cyprus "is
particularly interested" in those developments.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus has always shown its solidarity with the
Palestinian people and supported the implementation of U.N.
Security Council resolutions, and has taken positions of
principles.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue this kind of cooperation and assist the
Palestinian people in their struggle for reconstruction as we have
assisted them in their struggle for freedom," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Shaath also exchanged views with Cyprus Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis on ways to further develop
cooperation in trade, industry, tourism, manufacturing and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis extended an invitation to Shaath to visit Cyprus in the
second half of this year to discuss future cooperation and matters
of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Shaath will hold talks with Cyprus Finance Minister Takis
Clerides and members of the island's business circle Thursday,
according to Cyprus News Agency.

<HEADLINE> Party Leaders Urged to Hold Substantive Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the two Cypriot
communities on the divided Cyprus should respond to a call by the
United Nations for substantive and continuous talks aimed at
solving the Cyprus issue, two parties on the island appealed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made after General-Secretary of the Greek Cypriot
left-wing AKEL party Dimitris Christofias met with Turkish Cypriot
Republican Party (TRP) President Mehmet Ali Talat in the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north of the island.
</P>
<P>
AKEL and TRP reiterated their common stance for "a just and
peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem to the benefit of both
communities" which will "exclude any form of secession or creation
of a separate state," said a press release issued after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed developments in the Cyprus question,
the economic situation in the island's northern area since 1974, as
well as common activities to promote rapprochement and confidence-
building between the two communities, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to organize rapprochement activities
between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then the U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so far
no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Recently political parties from both sides have exchanged
meetings aimed at promoting rapprochement between the two
communities.

<HEADLINE> Cereal, Maize Production in SADC to Increase by 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Cereal and Maize production in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region is expected
to increase by 12 percent this year due to improved plantings and
above average rainfall, the SADC Early Warning Unit has said.
</P>
<P>
The total cereal production is forecast at 23.79 million tons
and the total maize production at 19.70 million tons during the
1999/2000 agricultural season, the unit said in its latest monthly
bulletin released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/1999 season, the region produced 21.40 million
tons of cereal and 17.15 million tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
Cereal production prospects for SADC are generally brighter
than last year despite the devastation caused by flooding in
Mozambique and parts of South Africa, Swaziland, Botswana and
Zimbabwe earlier this year, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya Introduces Electronic Ticketing System for National Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- To improve revenue collection and
management information and data gathering, Kenya will introduce a
new electronic ticketing system, the Smartcard, for its six major
national parks from July 1, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to KWS, the Nairobi National Park, just 10 minutes'
drive from Nairobi downtown, will be the first to use the new
system from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Other parks to be applied with the new system are the Lake
Nakuru National Park and the Aberdares National Park, both in
central Kenya, the Amboseli National Park bordering Tanzania, and
Tsave East and West national parks in eastern Kenya from August.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the system launching ceremony at the KWS
headquarters in the capital Nairobi, KWS chairman Charles Njonjo
said the development of Smartcard is a result of many shortfalls
in the present paper ticketing system proved to be both expensive
to run and open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
He said the six major national parks run by KWS received nearly
500,000 visitors annually, accounting for half of Kenya's
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Njonjo noted that KWS loses an estimated 100 million shillings
(around 1. 3 million U.S. dollars) yearly due to fraud by park
rangers, visitors and tour drivers and ticket recycling.
</P>
<P>
The Smartcard system will revolutionize the way payments are
done at the park gates, he said, adding it will help reduce
ticketing error and improve security in cash transit.
</P>
<P>
Njonjo estimated that the new ticketing system will enable KWS
to cut fraud by at least 80 percent which will result in a
revenue increase of some 1.2 million dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
The new system involves resident, non-resident and citizen
cards, tour card and school card.
</P>
<P>
A KWS official told Xinhua that Kenya has a total of 59
national parks and wild game reserves and he expected over one
million foreign tourists to visit Kenya this year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Kenya's major foreign exchange earners, with
21.4 billion shillings (around three million dollars) income from
tourism last year, compared to 17.5 billion shillings in 1998.
Kenya received 969,300 foreign visitors in 1999 compared to
894,300 in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Close Forests to Prevent Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Forestry Ministry
Wednesday initiated a ban on picnics in forests and denes, as a
measure of precaution against ever-rising danger of forest fires as
heat builds up.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia news agency reported that Forestry Minister Nami
Cagan has asked the Prime Minister's office to issue the ban in the
form of governmental decree.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, which will last until September 30, picnics
will be prohibited in denes and forests, and gendarmery and police
units will be charged with inspecting compliance with the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Patrols will also be on duty to prevent agricultural fields
close to forests and denes from catching fire.
</P>
<P>
Forests will be closed to people in the coming days, due to the
approaching of a spell of hot and dry weather, which may increase
the risk of forest blazes.
</P>
<P>
Power communication lines will also be under close scrutiny,
particularly in risky areas, to prevent any possible breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cagan called on people, particularly in the
Mediterranean, Aegean and Marmara regions, to heighten vigilance
against breakout of forest fires as summer has set in.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a forest land in Serik, southern
Mediterranean province of Antalya, started blazing Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigades, supported by helicopters, struggled to prevent
the fire from spreading afar.
</P>
<P>
An extinguisher helicopter, which had been sent on a fire-
fighting mission to the Marmara region, was called back with an
emergency signal to join the other helicopters fighting the flames.
The fire was brought under control in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, Turkey is rich in forestry resources with a
total of 26 percent of lands covered by forests.
</P>
<P>
Turkey drew up a "National Afforestation and Erosion Control
Mobilization Law" in 1995, aimed at increasing the number of trees
in the national forests and on lands owned by individuals.

<HEADLINE> COE Official Clears Position on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The position of the Council of
Europe (COE) on the Cyprus issue has never changed and it
recognizes the sole entity on the island, the Republic of Cyprus
and its government, said a visiting COE official.
</P>
<P>
Andras Barsony, the Cyprus rapporteur at the Political Committee
of the Parliamentary Assembly of COE, said Tuesday after meeting
with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides that his visit and overnight
stay in northern Cyprus have been "misinterpreted."
</P>
<P>
Barsony, who is here on a working visit to prepare a report on
the island's situation, has drawn strong criticism from the Cyprus
government and political parties after he spent Monday night in the
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north and addressed Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash as "president."
</P>
<P>
The president of House of Representatives of Cyprus, Spyros
Kyprianou, Tuesday refused to meet him, saying it is totally
unacceptable for a COE official to do so, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said Clerides
conveyed dissatisfaction with certain particular actions by the
Hungarian official, but "the whole issue is considered closed even
though the situation will be closely monitored."
</P>
<P>
In an effort to quench angers here, Barsony said he will not
allow his personal emotions and the climate created here to affect
the report he will present on behalf of the committee.
</P>
<P>
On the fact that he addressed Denktash as "president," Barsony
mentioned his own experience and the fact that he is also called "
president" because of his term in the Political Affairs Committee
Presidency.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he never called Denktash as president of the
Turkish Cypriot regime.
</P>
<P>
He also said he did not "think that an overnight stay is
something which could be introduced as recognition or
acknowledgement of a non-existing state."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Only Turkey has recognized the breakaway state in the Turkish
Cypriot area unilaterally declared in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Meets with Chinese Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid
and visiting Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng Wednesday discussed ways of
strengthening economic, trade and investment cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China is a great country and plays a key role in the
international and regional affairs, Obeid said during the meeting.
He added Egypt highly appreciates China's positions on
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Following 20 years of economic reforms and opening to the
outside world, China has made great achievements in the fields of
economy, science and technology, and culture, Obeid said.
</P>
<P>
He described the Egyptian-Chinese cooperation as strategic and
praised China's steps aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is taking measures to widen cooperation areas, Obeid said,
calling for China's investment in Egypt's infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, who arrived here on Tuesday for a three-day
visit, said China and Egypt have long maintained friendly
cooperation relations. Last year, the two countries established
strategic partnership, which conforms to the interests of the two
nations and has important political and economic significance.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt have a broad prospect in economic and trade
cooperation and China is exerting efforts to increase imports from
Egypt in a bid to reduce Egypt's trade deficit and expand the total
trade volume, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a series of trade accords in the first
half of this year, he said, adding joint efforts have yielded a
rise of 30 percent in bilateral trade and 103 percent in Egypt's
exports between January and April, compared to the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume stands at an annual 600 million U.S. dollars
between China and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the Chinese government supports and encourages Chinese
enterprises to invest in Egypt, adding a lot of companies have
intentions to invest in Egypt's electrical appliances,
telecommunications, textiles and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Egyptian government to improve the investment
environment in an effort to attract more Chinese investment.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Shi and Egyptian Minister of Economy and
Foreign Trade co-chaired the fourth session of the Chinese-Egyptian
Economic and Trade Joint Committee to seek ways of expanding
cooperation areas.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Egyptian Presidents Hold First Direct Contact in Two Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday received a phone call from his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak, who offered his congratulations on Iran's accession to the
Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct contact between leaders of the two
countries since they cut off ties in 1980, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of G-15, in their 10th summit which closed in Cairo on
Tuesday, accepted Iran's application to join the bloc of developing
nations, which was founded in 1989 to counter the power of the
wealthy industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone conversation, Mubarak conveyed the warmest
greetings of the Egyptian nation and government to the Iranian
president, government and people, and expressed pleasure with the
membership of Iran in the G-15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that relations between Iran and Egypt will
further develop in the future.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Khatami said both Iran and Egypt boast of
ancient civilizations which helped form the Islamic civilization,
and hoped that the two nations will endeavor to reinforce bilateral
ties and undertake their effective part in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also thanked Egypt for supporting Iran in its bid for G-
15 membership.
</P>
<P>
The number of G-15 member states has reached 19 after Iran and
Colombia were accepted as new members at the two-day G-15 summit.
Other members are India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Kenya, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria,
Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed its diplomatic relations with Egypt after the 1979
Islamic revolution as Tehran accused Cairo of signing the Camp
David peace accord with Israel in 1979, the first such accord
signed by an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
However, with the foreign policy of detente advocated by Iran's
moderate President Khatami, Tehran and Cairo have improved
bilateral ties and cooperation in recent years, even though they
have not resumed diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have called on Iran to remove the hurdle for
the resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in
Tehran, which was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin of
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In return, some Iranian officials and media urged the Egyptian
side to demolish the tomb of former Iranian Shah in Cairo as a
condition for Iran to change the street name.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said in
April that relations between Iran and Egypt, particularly in the
areas of economy and culture, had improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries were pursuing bilateral cooperation at
the regional and international levels.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges More Donor Support for Drought Relief in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The executive director of
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Carol Bellamy,
Wednesday urged government and individual donors to provide more
support to drought relief efforts in the Horn of Africa region,
where at least 13 million people in five countries are facing
displacement, disease and the grim toll of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy made the appeal at a press conference here after she
returned from a five-day, five-country mission to the Horn of
Africa region, where she visited displacement camps, feeding
centers and emergency immunization sites. She noted that slow
response to earlier appeals had caused UNICEF to launch its
drought relief efforts using money borrowed from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"I made this trip because I was deeply concerned that the
humanitarian crisis caused by the drought had become obscured by
the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea," Bellamy said. "Now
that a cease-fire has been signed, we have a golden opportunity to
turn our attention to the humanitarian needs that the war and the
drought have conspired to create."
</P>
<P>
"Without greater support, we will not be able to complete the
job of saving lives in the Horn, especially among children," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken Bellamy to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti,
Somalia and Kenya in order to see the real situation on the ground
and how the U.N. agencies are working and how the UNICEF is
working, she said.
</P>
<P>
"My observations are that the crisis continues, and the needs
are great," she said. "We've seen the increasing level of
malnutrition among more children and women."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the United Nations launched a drought appeal
totaling some 386 million U.S. dollars, covering relief activities
from the provision of food, the improvement of water sources and
the replacement of cattle to the immunization of children against
disease and the provision of emergency teaching supplies, she said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the appeal -- about 85 percent -- is for the
provision of food. The other 15 percent covers crucial non-food
relief such as medicine, water, sanitation and other life-saving
interventions. UNICEF's portion of appeal, about 30 million
dollars for the five countries, covers primary non-food assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that major international donors -- mostly
governments -- had so far indicated pledges covering roughly half
to the total appeal. However, she noted that almost all the
indicated pledges are for food.
</P>
<P>
"I must point out that while food is necessary, it is by no
means sufficient alone," she said. "Malnourished children need
supplemental feeding and special attention. Immunization are
required against disease. Sanitation and clean water prevent the
spread of disease to begin with."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I am calling for a renewed outpouring of support
for the people of the Horn of Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that her tour through the Horn of Africa region
convinced her that "despite some local variations, a very severe
drought still grips this region."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946, UNICEF, the only U.N. agency dedicated
exclusively to children, works for child protection, survival and
development within the framework of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child.

<HEADLINE> Former French Army General Admits Tortures in Algerian War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, General Jacques Massu,
former commander of the 10th Parachutists' Division of the French
Army, said that he regrets what the French army did in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
``Torture is not indispensable in times of war... When I again
think of Algeria, I feel sorry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Massu gave the interview two days after Le Monde published a
testimony given by a former Algerian nationalist fighter,
Louisette Ighilahriz, who said that after she was taken prisoner
on September 28, 1957, she was tortured for three months by a
French officer under the command of Massu.
</P>
<P>
Ighilahriz said that Massu and another head of the parachutists
' division, Colonel Marcel Bigeard, also joined the interrogations
but did not personally torture her.
</P>
<P>
The tortures were done by an officer named Captain Graziani,
who was killed during a fighting with Algerian nationalists in
1959.
</P>
<P>
Ighilahriz, who is now 63 years old, said that she was finally
saved from the hand of her torturer by a French army doctor named
Richaud, who took her away from the military camp to a hospital in
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Massu said that he could not remember if he had participated in
interrogating Ighilahriz but said that he knew the two other
French officers named in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
He said he also knew very well the doctor in the story, Richaud,
who he said had died one and a half years ago.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Hold Rally to Protest Against Government Decision on ID Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands and thousands of Greeks
from all over the country late Wednesday held a major rally in
central Athens to protest over a government decision to remove the
religious beliefs' category in new identity cards.
</P>
<P>
It is the second rally organized by the Church in Greece to
protest the government's decision on identity cards. On June 14,
the Church organized a similar rally in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki with the participation of an estimated 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has insisted that its decision on
identity cards is to protect citizens' personal data and to
streamline Greek IDs with those issued to European Union (EU)
citizens while the Church argues that the category should be
retained on an optional basis.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government Wednesday ruled out the possibility of
holding a national referendum over identity card issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that a political role was not compatible with
the spiritual role that truly belonged to the Church.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges More Donor Support for Drought Relief in Horn of Africa  (Updated with more quotes on Eritrea, Kenya) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The executive director of
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Carol Bellamy,
Wednesday urged government and individual donors to provide more
support to drought relief efforts in the Horn of Africa region,
where at least 13 million people in five countries are facing
displacement, disease and the grim toll of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy made the appeal at a press conference here after she
returned from a five-day, five-country mission to the Horn of
Africa region, where she visited displacement camps, feeding
centers and emergency immunization sites. She noted that slow
response to earlier appeals had caused UNICEF to launch its
drought relief efforts using money borrowed from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"I made this trip because I was deeply concerned that the
humanitarian crisis caused by the drought had become obscured by
the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea," Bellamy said. "Now
that a cease-fire has been signed, we have a golden opportunity to
turn our attention to the humanitarian needs that the war and the
drought have conspired to create."
</P>
<P>
"Without greater support, we will not be able to complete the
job of saving lives in the Horn, especially among children," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken Bellamy to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti,
Somalia and Kenya in order to see the real situation on the ground
and how the U.N. agencies are working and how the UNICEF is
working, she said.
</P>
<P>
"My observations are that the crisis continues, and the needs
are great," she said. "We've seen the increasing level of
malnutrition among more children and women."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the United Nations launched a drought appeal
totaling some 386 million U.S. dollars, covering relief activities
from the provision of food, the improvement of water sources and
the replacement of cattle to the immunization of children against
disease and the provision of emergency teaching supplies, she said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the appeal -- about 85 percent -- is for the
provision of food. The other 15 percent covers crucial non-food
relief such as medicine, water, sanitation and other life-saving
interventions. UNICEF's portion of appeal, about 30 million
dollars for the five countries, covers primary non-food assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that major international donors -- mostly
governments -- had so far indicated pledges covering roughly half
to the total appeal. However, she noted that almost all the
indicated pledges are for food.
</P>
<P>
"I must point out that while food is necessary, it is by no
means sufficient alone," she said. "Malnourished children need
supplemental feeding and special attention. Immunization are
required against disease. Sanitation and clean water prevent the
spread of disease to begin with."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I am calling for a renewed outpouring of support
for the people of the Horn of Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that her tour through the Horn of Africa region
convinced her that "despite some local variations, a very severe
drought still grips this region."
</P>
<P>
"In Eritrea in particular, lives are at immediate risk," she
said. "Due both to drought and war, Eritrea is facing a
humanitarian crisis on almost unimaginable scale. One-third to one-
half of the entire population is displaced. The outlook for
agriculture is very bleak. I visited a camp that was home to
nearly 70,000 people -- about 90 percent of them children and
women. This camps didn't exist three weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is also facing a dramatic humanitarian crisis," she
said. "I was told in several small villages in the north of the
country that this drought appears to be worse than anything in the
'80s or '90s. Moreover, unlike some parts of Ethiopia and Somalia,
northern Kenya has not seen any rain at all in recent months."
</P>
<P>
Despite the challenges, Bellamy said that she was heartened by
the relief activities she saw in every country. "Governments, U.N.
agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities
themselves are making a real difference," she said. "I'm sure
lives are being saved."
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF is very hopeful that with an end to the war, the
humanitarian crisis will take center stage," she said. "It's
absolutely essential that all of us turn our attention from the
loss of life to the saving of lives."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946, UNICEF, the only U.N. agency dedicated
exclusively to children, works for child protection, survival and
development within the framework of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child.

ADDIS ABABA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has sent an observer team to Zimbabwe to monitor the
country's parliamentary elections to be held from June 24 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member team, headed by Liberian former president Amos
Sawyer, consists of diplomats, lawyers, human rights workers,

outcome, according to a press release from the OAU.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim has described the
forthcoming elections as important and crucial for the peace,
security and stability of Zimbabwe in particular, and the region

<HEADLINE> EU Condemns Political Violence In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pierre Schori, head of the European
Union (EU) election observer team to Zimbabwe, Wednesday condemned
the on-going political violence in the country, and urged
Zimbabweans to vote for parties of their own choice.
</P>
<P>
Schori, who is in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city,
to get first hand information on the political situation in the
city and surrounding areas, told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
violence and intimidation had no place in any democratic election.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years into independence," he said, "time has come for
Zimbabweans to exchange sticks and bullets for secrecy on the
ballots."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans should put fear aside and go to vote to exercise
their democratic power as equal citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schori said although the level of violence which had resulted
in the death of at least 30 people had subsided in the cities, his
team was concerned about that people were still being victimized
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He said his 150-team would contribute to the creation of a
"favorable" election climate in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with my team's operations because we have links
with all the districts in the country," said Schori, adding, "We
are very much aware of the situation taking place on the ground."
</P>
<P>
The EU election observer team, which would issue a full report
after the June 24 and 25 elections, would remain in the country
for at least 10 days after the poll.

<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Lopez, resident
representative in Zimbabwe of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), reaffirmed here on Wednesday the organization's
commitment to help solve the land issue in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that UNDP was working on proposals to mobilize the
donor community to fund the acquisition of land.
</P>
<P>
He said the preliminary notice issued on June 2 by the
Zimbabwean government to compulsorily acquire 804 farms did not
stop the process as speculated by some political commentators.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has stopped," Lopez said. "The pace depends on how
much progress we have made on mobilizing the funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the government were on the highest level and
the prospects were not yet to be made public, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 white commercial farmers own more than 70 percent
of the arable land in the country and more than 12 million black
Zimbabweans occupy 30 percent of the land.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Corruption Crucial to Economic Prosperity: WEF Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth was closely
associated with levels of corruption and the fight against
corruption was a crucial contribution to economic prosperity, the
World Economic Forum (WEF) said in a report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There appeared to be a rising awareness in several African
countries that fighting corruption needed to be an integral part
of their growth strategy and corruption had in fact decreased in a
number of countries, said the report, issued at the WEF's southern
African economic summit in Durban.
</P>
<P>
The report, part of the WEF's second African competitiveness
report, pointed out that the differing degree of corruption in
individual African countries was inversely related to the level of
income.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said while Africa is regarded as having a
high level of corruption, it should not be singled out.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is often perceived as a continent universally suffering
from corruption. In the view of many, corruption in Africa is far
more widespread and serious than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"However, these views are fallacious and misleading," the
report stated.
</P>
<P>
"While Africa as a region is reported in business surveys as
having a high level of corruption on average, in comparison with
other regions of the world it would not seem to be justified to
single it out," the report asserted.
</P>
<P>
"Frequently overlooked was the fact that Africa was as diverse
and heterogeneous as any other continent, with the individual
countries being far more complex than generally thought.
</P>
<P>
"But, that the continent did not appear worse than other
regions should not give rise to complacency.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, given its relative poverty and scarce
development resources, Africa can least afford the negative
effects of corrupt practices," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report singled out Seychelles, Botswana, Namibia, Tunisia,
Swaziland and South Africa as countries which maintain a low level
of corruption, while considerable degrees of corruption were
reported in Madagascar, Nigeria, Angola, Egypt and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean White Farmers Uncertain About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Director of the
Commercial Farmers Union Jerry Grant Wednesday said producers do
not know how to respond to the gazetted 804 white commercial farms
which the government intends to use for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
"I can't speculate. Some might decide to go out of farming and
others will stay in farming," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Grant said the issue of land resettlement should best be
discussed after the parliamentary elections this weekend because
it had been politicized.
</P>
<P>
He said his union was willing to support the government with
money and identifying suitable farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The land issue should be handled properly to avoid negative
impacts on the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a preliminary notice early this month to
 compulsorily acquire 804 farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
War veterans have invaded more than 1,000 white farms in the
countrywide since February this year. They said the government had
taken too long to redress the land imbalances between white and
black people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government requires 5 million hectares of land to resettle
 thousands of its landless people.

<P>
LUANDA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola will sign an integral
program for its industrial development with the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Austria later this
month, the official news agency Angop said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Industrial Minister Albina Assis Tuesday left here for
Austria, where she will sign the agreement during a UNIDO forum to
be held from June 22 to 24 in Vienna, the capital city of Austria.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to Vienna, Albina Assis will discuss with
UNIDO experts the Angolan government's request accepted by the
UNIDO, when two technicians with the U.N. organization visited
Angola in April this year.
</P>
<P>
This program is aimed at promoting "a change in the dynamics of
Angola's industrial development," said the minister, adding that
to this end, some programs should be appropriately adjusted, and
UNIDO will provide advice, support, funds for some projects.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Angola has to come up with some projects in the
fields of food industry and institutional support for improving
the functioning of the National Industrial Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
Albina Assis is also expected to attend the five-day UNIDO
general assembly scheduled for June 26, in Geneva, Switzerland,
and a forum promoted by the Swiss government from June 28 to July
2.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the forum will discuss the world political and
economic matters, while the UNIDO general assembly will focus on
issues related to the industrial development.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Economic Growth Not Enough: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economy has
performed well but the country is not achieving the growth rates
that it should and needs to attain, said Harvard University
Director for International Studies Jeffrey Sach on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It should achieve 6 percent growth a year to make a dent in
its high unemployment level," he said while addressing a news
conference prior to the opening of the World Economic Forum's
(WEF's) 10th Southern Africa Economic Summit in South Africa's

</P>
<P>
Although South Africa's economic prospects are good, they are
not as good as they should be, the U.S. scholar said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, he said, is without a doubt the most powerful and
 technologically advanced country in sub-Saharan Africa, but this
has not been translated into accelerated growth.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's ranking as the seventh most
competitive economy in Africa by the WEF's Africa Competitiveness
Report, Sach said South Africa could expect increases in foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa can expect more foreign investment given the

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Future Economic Growth Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum's
10th Annual Southern African Economic Summit meeting, which is
opened in South Africa's port city of Durban on Wednesday,
expressed optimism about Mozambique's future economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is rated 18th out of 24 countries on the African
competitiveness rankings, moving up one position from last year,
South African Press Association quoted a statement from the
three-day meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years since its first democratic elections,
Mozambique has shown impressive economic growth, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that between 1992 and 1997, an average annual growth of
7.5 percent was recorded in the country and the projected growth
for 2000 is 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mozambique's strong fiscal and
monetary policies have drastically reduced inflation from higher
than 50 percent in 1996 to between 0.5 percent in 1998 and 2
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for Mozambique's growth are a stable economic
and political environment combined with structural reforms, the
statement said, noting that the country has opened up to global
markets and a large number of investments have been made in the
country in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Crime, AIDS Obstruct S. Africa's Development: WEF Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa still needs to
fight crime and HIV/AIDS to maintain sustainable economic growth,
though it is a competitive economy, the World Economic Forum (WEF)
said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Competitiveness Report (ACR) was unveiled in Durban
on the WEF's southern Africa economic summit which opened here
earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa remains in the top seven countries in Africa,
which are the leading countries. South Africa has a large role to
play in the African economic renaissance," WEF director Peter
Cornelius said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, AIDS and crime still obstruct South Africa's economic
development, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one in eight South Africans was HIV
positive and by the end of 1997, 360,000 citizens had died of
AIDS-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The report said AIDS-related illnesses would claim the lives of
6 percent of the workforce between 1999 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Besides, maintaining law and order and curbing spiralling crime
was important to encourage foreign and domestic investment. The
survey showed that 92 percent of South African firms felt that
crime imposed significant costs on business.
</P>
<P>
According to the ACR, South Africa faces the challenging task
of translating positive economic developments during the later
half of the decade into sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
For macro-economic progress, substantial structural changes to
the economy were essential. These changes included privatization,
easing exchange restrictions, reducing tariff barriers and
improving the functioning of civil service.
</P>
<P>
Another factor affecting the competitiveness of South Africa's
economy was the quality of human resources.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big concern for the country, because it has a
relatively small base of skilled labor and one that is severely
eroded by the scourge of HIV/AIDS," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Support for Palestinians in Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday reassured visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
that his kingdom stood for the legitimate rights of the
Palestinians in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
briefed Abdullah on the latest developments of the Palestinian-
Israeli final status talks, which mainly focused on Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements, borders, Palestinian refugees, and water.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah reiterated Jordan's principled support for the founding
of an independent Palestinian state on its own soil with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Israel should implement all agreements it
reached with the Palestinians to ensure progress on the Palestinian
track in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat thanked Abdullah for supporting the
Palestinians to restore their legitimate rights, and praised the
king's efforts to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker in the Middle East region
since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 as the second
Arab country after Egypt to realize peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Arafat also expressed satisfaction with the current

Police said Najeh Abdel-Karim, 26, a truck driver, parked an 18-

Fong allegedly shot Abdel-Karim with a 20-gauge shotgun and
then fired into the doors of the mosque as the wounded man sought
refuge.

Abdel-Karim was shot in the leg and taken to the Regional
Medical Center at Memphis in serious condition. Fong was arrested

<HEADLINE> NATO Has No Plan of Military Deployment in Bulgaria: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO's plans do not envisage the
deployment of military forces in Bulgaria, said NATO Supreme
Allied Commander Europe General Joseph Ralston on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO is not planing to deploy forces in non-member states,
Ralston was quoted by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency as saying
after a meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO continues viewing the exercises within the
Partnership for Peace (PfP) program as an opportunity for the
enhancement of stability in the region. Bulgaria is a PfP partner.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is eager to join NATO and the European Union. It
provided NATO planes with an air corridor during NATO's war
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After the war, Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov even hinted
that, if requested, he would allow NATO to set up military bases
in Bulgarian territory.
</P>
<P>
"Since Bulgaria has, for two and a half years, constantly
reiterated its willingness to become a member of NATO, the country
should also share NATO's responsibilities. If the question of
setting up bases is raised with us, I shall say 'yes'," Stoyanov
said on October 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's activities during the Kosovo war and its pro-West
attitude sparked anger from Moscow. Bulgaria was an ally of Moscow
within the framework of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in the Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
Ralston on Wednesday refused to made any specific commitment to
Bulgaria's accession to NATO. He said Bulgaria's future NATO
membership is rather a political, than a military matter.
</P>
<P>
Kostov told Ralston that his country is willing to contribute
officers to the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Kostov
said Bulgaria has very well-prepared officers who speak both Serb
and Albanian and may be useful in communications between the
military and the civilian structures of the administration in
Kosovo. Ralston voiced support for the idea, said Kostov's press
office.
</P>
<P>
Kostov also expressed Sofia's concern over the rising tension
in southern Serbia. Ralston said for the time being the situation
in southern Serbia does not pose a threat for Bulgaria, but that
NATO is following closely the situation in that part of the region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with President Stoyanov, Ralston expressed his
satisfaction with the fact that the reform of the Bulgarian
military complies with the NATO criteria. Stoyanov reassured his
country's willingness to cooperate with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Ralston also held talks with Defense Minister Boiko Noev and
Army Chief of General Staff Miho Mihov.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Prosperity Cannot Be Achieved at Cost of Environment, UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Asian region has a dense population and very large numbers
of people, said JoAnne DiSano, director of the Division for
Sustainable Development, the U.N. Department of Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
DiSano admitted that it is understandable that after a big
crisis like the one that happened in Asia, people are getting more
and more concerned about improving their living standard."
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a real concern and a dual challenge, that is
how to improve the life of the citizens in the region and at the
same time grow and prosper," the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that you can do both," she said, stressing that
Asian countries do not have to really cause destruction to the
environment if they really think carefully.
</P>
<P>
DiSano said she has seen good evidence that Asian countries can
find a balance between economic development and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Before taking up her current job, DiSano said, she worked for
the Australian government and was heavily involved in bilateral
arrangements for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries.
</P>
<P>
She has seen close cooperation among ASEAN countries in dealing
with environmental issues, which, as she put it, is very
encouraging. By so doing, these countries can learn from each
other and know what each other is doing, she said.
</P>
<P>
She believed that cooperation is necessary for communities,
countries and even regions when it comes to environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also said governments should raise people's
awareness of environmental protection through education and let
everyone know the importance of a healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
DiSano is here in Hong Kong for the International Association
for Impact Assessment (IAIA) Conference 2000, a week-long
gathering of more than 500 environmental experts from all over the
world on the topic of environmental impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
She said she has travelled to China many times and her
department is also in cooperation with China's relevant
organizations.
</P>
<P>
From her experience in China, DiSano said, she has got the
message that though China, a huge and diverse country with a large
population, is facing environmental problems like many other
countries, people here "are working very hard to resolve some of
those difficulties."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is very committed," she said, referring
to a full range of activities and initiatives under way both at
the central and grassroots levels.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. offical admitted that people cannot expect to
see changes overnight, since "it takes time, takes effort, takes
certain amounts of resources to help make things better."
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that people recognize there are
problems and they actively intend to do something," she said.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the situation in Hong Kong, DiSano said that as
Hong Kong has such a small geographic space and so many people,
the pressures on the environment of course are "very very strong."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government has prepared a full range of
activities to improve the situation and Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa has mentioned that the government is considering establishing
a council for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is absolutely excellent and we are watching with
interest to see how that develops," DiSano said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Discuss Interim Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting here on Wednesday,
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran discussed interim issues such as Israel's
further troop redeployment in the West Bank and the release of more
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed all interim issues, but no final
agreement has been reached, Erekat said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel was scheduled to conduct the third troop redeployment in
the West Bank on Friday. But the Palestinian side has agreed to
allow the redeployment delayed for two weeks as requested by Israel
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel has to transfer
all the remaining West Bank territories, except some military zones
and Jewish settlements, to the Palestinians in the third
redeployment. Israel has so far handed over about 40 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has submitted a list of 270 Palestinian
prisoners to Israel for release, but Israel has not taken its final
decision on who will be released.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Israel released three Palestinians on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Till now, a total of 1,650 palestinians are still detained in
Israeli jails, many of whom were jailed without trial.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said all these issues will be discussed further when the
two sides meet on Thursday, with the participation of U.S.
officials.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Cites Conditions for Cease-fire Extension With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday asked the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to show
sincerity in pursuing peace before he accommodates its request to
extend the deadline he has set for its peace negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement issued here, Estrada said the MILF
must fulfill the two conditions he set earlier this month before
he considers extending the June 30 deadline for the forging of a
peace pact between the government and the Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"I might accommodate their request if they abandon their
secessionist movement now and if they stop their terrorist and
criminal activities now. If they do these, we might extend the
deadline," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"On their laying down of their arms, perhaps we will give them
six months," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF asked the government to extend the peace
process by postponing the scheduled resumption of the formal
negotiations from June 28 to July 29.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't like my conditions, we'll continue with the
military operations," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, the biggest Muslim rebel group based in Mindanao,
claimed to fight in that region for the creation of a separate
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government, which has repeatedly rejected the
MILF's secessionist demand, has ordered its troops to attack the
MILF camps in the past couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, other reports said two major MILF bases in Cotabato
Province fell into the hands of the military Tuesday, increasing
the the total number of the camps captured by government troops to
more than 30.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Asked to Separate Financial, Non-Financial Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) will enforce new regulations requiring the
separation of financial and non-financial activities of Singapore
banks and asked local banks to implement these changes within
three years, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told
bankers Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Associations of Banks in
Singapore, Lee, who doubles as MAS chairman, said the measures are
a necessary part of Singapore's on-going reform initiative to
strengthen the domestic banking sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the new regulations will require significant corporate
restructuring and divestment of non-financial assets from banks, a
new structure for grouping the financial activities under the bank
or under a non-operating financial holding company, and separation
between management of the financial entities and that of their non-
financial affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also ban the financial entities from
directly or indirectly owning the shares of non-financial firms
affiliated to the same principal shareholders and sharing names
and logos with non-financial entities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that the separation of non-financial activities
from the banking groups and the unwinding of cross-shareholdings
are aimed at limiting the risks of contagion to the banks,
enhancing market discipline, increasing transparency and ensuring
that bank management focuses its attention on the core business of
banking.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the banks improved performances will benefit
depositors and shareholders and strengthen the financial system as
a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also warned against a fire sale of
non-financial assets from banks, saying fire sale would weaken the
banks and diminish confidence, and would be against the interests
of shareholders and depositors.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid uncertainty and minimize the tax impact on
the banks arising from the divestment of assets as required by the
new rule, the government has decided on a set of one-off
administrative concessions which will facilitate the exercise, he
announced.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone As Freetown Seeks Special Court for Sankoh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday began a closed-door meeting with a delegation from the
Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS), during which
the two sides exchanged views on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came one day after Sierra Leone asked the United
Nations to set up a special court to try rebel leader Foday Sankoh
and others for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah made the request in his
recent letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the New York
Times said Wednesday, and the proposal was confirmed by the Sierra
Leonean Government in its statement issued in the nation's capital
Freetown Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government statement read on state and television late on
Tuesday said the West African country lacked the resources to
handle cases of such magnitude, and such a court would use a blend
of international and Sierra Leonean law and be based in Sierra
Leone, with judges drawn from West Africa and possibly further
afield.
</P>
<P>
"After careful study of all the available options and extensive
consultations with our international partners, government has
decided to propose to the U.N. Security Council the establishment
of a special court for Sierra Leone," the statement said. "This
court will be established by a resolution of the Security Council.
"
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations has not made any official response
to the Sierra Leonean proposal.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
was arrested on May 17 and is currently in government custody, but
his fighters in the east of Sierra Leone still hold 21 Indian U.N.
peacekeepers hostage and pinning down more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
Snkoh and his armed followers broke a year-old peace agreement
which had given him a role in the government and turned his troops
on both Kabbah's government forces and U.N. peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Passenger Jet Maker Unveils Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's top passenger jet maker,
Bombardier Inc., will produce 100 regional jets this year, with
the production to reach 135 in 2001 and 150 in 2002, the company
has announced.
</P>
<P>
With 41 percent of the global market, Bombardier is planning
to further tap its potential in 50-passenger and 70-passenger jets
while trying with a 90-passenger version.
</P>
<P>
"We can control our costs because of commonality of design and
parts from the 50-passenger jet to the 70-passenger version that
will fly next year and the 90-passenger to come," said Robert
Brown, the company chief executive, at Bombardier's annual meeting
Tuesday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a two-to-three-year lead over the competition with
our 70-passenger," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bombardier bases its expansion on the outlook for a strong
business aircraft market, where total aircraft deliveries are
expected to hit 350 this year from 292 last year.
</P>
<P>
"With a robust North American economy and improvement in
Europe and Asia, the outlook is generally favorable," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
The company said it's order backlog is nearing 30 billion
Canadian dollars (about 20.39 billion U.S. dollars), including a
recent order for 10 of the 90-passenger version.

<HEADLINE> CIS Summit Calls For Sticking to ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on Wednesday called for
preserving the 1972 Soviet-U.S. Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty to keep global strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
The CIS urged more efforts to preserve the treaty "through its
strict and full compliance," said a statement adopted at the end
of the summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The ABM treaty should remain "the foundation of global
strategic stability, international security and world peace," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Any measures diluting the aims and provisions of the current
ABM treaty would have a negative impact on the security interests
of both the treaty signatories and all members of the world
community."
</P>
<P>
The treaty will remain a tested foundation for further
limitation of strategic nuclear armaments in the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Russia's ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty-II (START II), the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
and the 1997 package of agreements on ABM, the CIS leaders urged
Washington to do the same.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their determination to continue their
efforts to strengthen global strategic stability and international
security.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Northwest Airlines Corp.of the
U.S. has spent 20,000 U.S. dollars on a painting by Xu Dongdong, a
leading Chinese artist, to hang in its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
John Dasburg, Northwest's president and chief executive, said
that Xu's work is full of oriental charm and romanticism, and
worth long-term preservation.
</P>
<P>
Xu has also made admirable efforts to promote cultural
communication between China and the U.S., said Dasburg in Shanghai,
where an exhibition of Xu's works was staged recently.
</P>
<P>
Xu is well-schooled in traditional Chinese painting in water
and ink, and decided years ago to donate his paintings to world-
famous libraries and museums.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Xu is visiting U.S. cultural institutions as an
envoy of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries,to make Chinese traditional art more widely
known in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
So far, Xu's works have been collected by more than 300 U.S.
cultural institutions, including the Library of Congress in
Washington D.C., New York's Metropolitan Museum and Harvard
University.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Export Processing Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has decided
to set up its first group of 15 export processing zones nationwide
on a trial base, to reform the country's existing processing trade
administration system.
</P>
<P>
The zones are to be built in the cities of Dalian, Tianjin,
Beijing and Shanghai, and the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan and Jilin, according
to a source at the working conference on the country's export
processing zone held here today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the General Administration of Customs
said export processing zones are special sealed areas administered
by the Customs, which only engage in processing products for
export.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises concerned with export processing, storage and
transportation will be allowed to be set up in the zones, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of export processing zones will
lead to better Customs supervision and help curb smuggling. At the
same time, it will help expand the country's export volume.
</P>
<P>
The official said that export processing zones are only allowed
to be built within the country's existing economic and
technological development zones, in a bid to avoid duplicate
construction.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law Over Lebanese "Prisoners" Fate Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament) on
Wednesday passed the first reading of a proposed law over the fate
of Lebanese "prisoners" with a vote of 22 to 6.
</P>
<P>
The move was sharply criticized by the Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, which said the
knesset's manner is "a heinous act."
</P>
<P>
The real objective of the proposed law is to enable Israel to
continue holding Lebanese "prisoners" such as Sheikh Obeid and
Mustafa Dirani, the two Lebanese resistance leaders, the center
said.
</P>
<P>
And such a move is against the Basic Law of Israel and
international humanitarian law, it said.
</P>
<P>
The center also sent on Wednesday letters to all Knesset
members, urging them not to support the proposed law or be involved
in enacting legislation that would be "a stain on Israel's code of
statutes," the center said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law now goes to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, before returning to the full Knesset for the
second and third readings required to pass into law.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved on June 11 the proposed law to
enable the continued detention of Obeid and Dirani and any other
combatant in any force which fights against Israel or takes part in
terrorist activities against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the cabinet decided
to table the draft legislation in the Knesset this week and work
for its rapid enactment.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Israel is obligated to exhaust all chances to
find out what happened to Israeli air force navigator Ron Arad, who
was reportedly captured by Lebanese guerrillas years ago, and other
prisoners of war and those missing in action, hence the need for
the draft legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government and the resistance guerrilla group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, have vowed to continue fight until
Israel frees all Lebanese detained in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, a former Hezbollah religious leader, was snatched by
Israeli commandos from his home in south Lebanon in 1989, while
Dirani, the former Amal security chief, was seized by Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
They are being used as bargaining chips to discover the fate of
missing Israeli servicemen in Lebanon, particular Arad whose plane
was hot down in Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Israeli supreme court ordered the release of 13
Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> Largest Venture Capital Company Formed in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Wednesday saw the
emergence of its largest private equity vehicle, K1 Ventures
Limited, a venture capital company jointly formed by three of the
city state's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
With an initial funding of about 500 million Singapore dollars
(290 million U.S. dollars ), K1 Ventures is also considered as one
of the largest venture capital companies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Keppel Corporation, one of the largest conglomerates in
Singapore, announced Wednesday the birth of K1 Ventures in
cooperation with DBS Bank, the largest bank in town, and SingTel,
the dominant local telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
K1 Ventures, originally Keppel's listed subsidiary Keppel
Marine, will be dedicated to investing and supporting innovative
Internet businesses in Asia and worldwide, said Lim Chee Onn,
executive chairman of the Keppel Group.
</P>
<P>
With its focus based on geography, investment stage and
industry, most of K1 Ventures' investments will target Asia,
directed toward high-growth technology companies requiring
expansion stage funding, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
K1 Ventures will not only invest, but also expects to offer
strategic, operational and financial advice to firms in which it
invests via strategic relationships.
</P>
<P>
While Asia will be a prime focus, the company will also
consider appropriate investments in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Keppel Corporation will issue up to 142 million new shares at 1.
55 Singapore dollars per share, to raise up to 220 million
Singapore dollars, which together with its existing cash reserve,
will give it a cash fund of about 500 million Singapore dollars to
start the new business.
</P>
<P>
Lim Ho Kee, chairman and CEO of K1 Ventures, said the
establishment of the venture capital company comes at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
"The time is right, as equity markets have corrected
significantly, bringing valuations, especially among technology
firms, to more realistic levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said information technology and e-commerce will
fundamentally change the Asian business landscape.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Send Delegations for Prisoner Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's warring factions
Wednesday sent delegations to visit prisoners being held by each
other and to negotiate their swap, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP)
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ruling Taliban militia took clothes and other
supplies for their fighters in the custody of the anti-Taliban
alliance United Front in the Panjsher valley,the stronghold of
major opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously an opposition delegation arrived in the Afghan
capital of Kabul controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Taliban have handed a list of 491 soldiers being
held prisoner by the opposition to the International Committee of
the Red Cross which facilitated the visits across the front lines
to the north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner-swap agreement was reached by the two warring
sides in talks held recently under the aegis of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 8,000 prisoners languishing in Taliban and
United Front jails, with the number roughly equally divided
between them, said AIP.

NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Prices of gold recovered smartly
on the bullion market in Mumbai (Bombay) Wednesday due to good

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Begins Landmine Sweeping in Central Border Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gebremichael Hagos, commander of the engineering division, was
quoted as saying that some 43,000 anti-personnel and anti-tank
landmines were planted around the town by Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mines were found to be anti-personnel, planted
across the farmlands and in villages, the commander said, noting
that the landmines were planted only 30 centimeters apart, and at
some places two mines on a same spot.
</P>
<P>
The strategic border town of Zalambessa had been under Eritrean
control for about two years before Ethiopian troops recaptured the
border town in their latest offensives that ended at the end of
May.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Looking Forward to Chinese Leader's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament Chairman Ivan
Plyushch said he is looking forward to a visit by China's top
legislator, Li Peng, and would discuss with him cooperation
between the two countries and the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, will visit Ukraine on June 24-26.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Plyushch described the
current economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
as "positive," saying his country hopes to see continuous growth
in bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have a great potential for
cooperation in the fields of trade, investment and defense
industry.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is studying China's successful experience in economic
reform and is willing to deepen economic and cultural cooperation
with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Plyushch pledged his country will not have
any official ties with Taiwan, a promise Ukraine solemnly made in
1992.
</P>
<P>
"During my visit to China in 1993, I reiterated this position,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Considering Taiwan as an ordinary province, Ukraine maintains
only non-official economic and cultural relations with it,
Plyushch said.
</P>
<P>
Li is on a six-nation tour, which has already taken him to
Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia and Slovakia. He will also tour
Azerbaijan.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The current drought threatens a
water shortage in northern China, according to the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and the rural areas in general have been hit head-
on by the drought, while the cities are suffering too, said Zhang
Jiatuan of the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
North China's Tianjin Municipality, which has been suffering
from drought for four years running, is compelled to implement a
water quota as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Many other cities have already limited their water supplies,
and the restrictions on water will be strengthened in major cities
in northeast China such as Shenyang, should the drought not be
relieved by rainfall in the near future.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 industrial enterprises in southwest China's
Sichuan Province have suspended or almost suspended production due
to water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage has been plaguing China since the early 1990s,
and the urbanization process will make it worse over the next few
decades, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-ROK Program Targets Parasitosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from China and the
Republic of Korea (ROK) seeking an effective means to control
parasitic diseases will jointly carry out a program in two Chinese
provinces in the next five years, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
They hope the program, focusing on control strategies for soil-
transmitted helminthiasis such as ascariasis in Jiangxi Province
and food-borne helminthiasis like clonorchiosis in Heilongjiang
Province, will provide a model for parasitosis prevention and
treatment throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The project marks the first collaboration in the field of
public health between China and the ROK. With a donation of one
million U.S. dollars from the ROK government, the project will be
carried out by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM)
and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).
</P>
<P>
"Parasitosis is still a major public health problem in China,
even though some health-threatening types of parasitosis have been
under effective control for the past five decades, such as
schistosomiasis, malaria and filariasis," said Feng Zheng,
director of the CAPM's Institute of Parasitic Diseases.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that more than 10 million residents of China have
been affected by clonorchiosis, which is often caused by eating
uncooked aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The infection rate of ascariasis remains high in remote and
underdeveloped areas of the country, though the average infection
rate has dropped from 60 percent ten years ago to 40 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese, U.S. and Australian scientists are working
on a program to develop vaccines against schistosomiasis and
hookworm, Feng said.

to ensure the party's leading position in ideology and vigor, and
lead the people to a new level of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>

viewed from the necessity of meeting the strategic goal of
socialist modernization, safeguarding national unity and stability,
and achieving step by step the goal of socialist prosperity and
the revitalization of the Chinese people.

Jiang said it is a great decision made by the CPC Central
Committee to step up the development of western China, following
new changes in the international situation and the entry of China'
s economy into a new period.
</P>
<P>
He said implementing the program and ensuring faster
development in those regions will open new and broader scope for
China's economic development in the 21st century. The western
strategy is an important measure for maintaining the country's
sustained, rapid and healthy development.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance for the country's prosperity and
durable stability, he added
</P>
<P>
He said the program should be carried out in an orderly, rapid
and efficient way by using the experience China has accumulated
during economic construction in the past, and abide by economic
and scientific laws.
</P>
<P>
The central government must give special support to the program
of western development, as it has great economic and political
importance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Policies should be drawn up to offer the west support in the
fields of finance, taxation, foreign investment and foreign trade,
supply of professionals, science and technology, and education, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said it will take the sustained efforts of many generations
to make fundamental changes to the west.
</P>
<P>
He said some key state-funded projects that will eventually
have a significant impact on the regional development in the west
should be carefully selected.

advantages in the western region so as to improve the economic
returns, while special attention should be given to social and
environmental benefits during development and construction, Jiang
added.

He said efforts should also be made to achieve initial success
in five to 10 years in promoting economic and social development,
unity among various ethnic groups and environmental protection.

establish a mutually benefiting cooperation mechanism between the
eastern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the central part of China should step up its
development, while the west should improve its economic exchanges
and cooperation, and take full advantage of the western
development program.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the supply of professionals, Jiang described it
as the key to the success of the western development program,
calling for measures to allow professionals to give full play to
their talents in the region, while efforts should be made to train
and absorb professionals from both at home and abroad for current
and future development.
</P>
<P>
He called on local authorities in the west to do their utmost
to create better working and living conditions for professionals,
and set up an income distribution mechanism that will help to
retain and absorb professionals.
</P>
<P>
On the party's work concerning ethnic groups and religion,
Jiang said unity among ethnic groups is an important guarantee for
China's development and prosperity, and for people to live and
work in peace and contentment. He called on the local authorities
to do a better job of promoting unity among ethnic groups and
managing religious affairs.

<HEADLINE> Barak Seeks Dialogue With Jewish Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Wednesday that he intends to engage in a continuous and
fundamental dialogue with the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is the continuation of a series of meetings between
Barak and leaders of the Council of Jewish Communities of the West
Bank, which is called Judea and Samaria by the Jews according to
the biblical tradition, and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza have been staging frequent
demonstrations outside Barak's residence in Jerusalem to protest
Barak's reported plan to transfer over 90 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations culminated on Monday when all the settlement
schools in the West Bank and Gaza were closed and children were
taken to Jerusalem to take part in a one-day strike organized by
the extremist right-wing Yesha Council of Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Barak, greatly weighed down with an escalating coalition crisis
which threatens to cripple his ability to clinch any deals with the
Palestinians, also sees a running-out-of-time in his efforts to
solve remaining problems with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease tensions over the lagging Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, Israel set free three Palestinian prisoners,
imprisoned for attacks on Israelis, as a good-will gesture.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians were angered that it fell far short of
their demands of releasing 270 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians agreed to a two-week postponement in
the Israeli third redeployment on the West Bank after getting the
U.S. promise that Israel will implement the interim accords. The
redeployment is due on Friday under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum
signed last September.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians have been trying to settle interim
problems which include the third and final redeployment of Israeli
troops on the West Bank and the release of Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails, totalling about 1,650.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far transferred about 40 percent of the West Bank
to Palestinian control in accordance with interim deals.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also trying to formulate a framework agreement
to guide the settlement of the thorny final-status issues including
the status of Jerusalem, the future of settlements, border, water
resources and refugees. The negotiators missed the February and
then the May deadline without reaching the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has sought to delay the redeployment and make it part of a
framework accord while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insists on
the withdrawal before signing a framework deal.
</P>
<P>
Barak's earlier plan to transfer three Arab villages to the
Palestinians was frozen under strong right-wing opposition inside
the country following the violent demonstrations on the West Bank
and Gaza pressing for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are reportedly preparing for a
possible flare-up of clashes with the Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza once the peace talks are bogged down.
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to broker an intensive summit
between Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton to help the
sides remove obstacles and wrap up a deal.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts say the Barak government, now deep in
crisis, may be too weak to seal a breakthrough peace with Arafat.
Barak's coalition is set to lose its parliamentary majority
following the resignation of the ministers from the ultra-Orthodox
Shas party, Barak's key partner in the coalition government.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Continue Pushing Mideast Peace Process Forward: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will continue
pushing the Middle East peace process forward and work together
with countries in the region to implement the Security Council
Resolutions, said visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, Annan said,"We will continue the efforts to implement
the resolutions 242 and 338...and work together with the
international community to push the peace process forward based on
the formula of land for peace."
</P>
<P>
"We set for peace and work for peace and hope all countries in
he region will work together for peace," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged Israel and the Palestinians to make compromise
to be able to move the israeli-Palestinian track ahead.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the purpose of his visit to Lebanon early this
week, Annan said he had discussed with the Lebanese leaders about
the U.N. verification of Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, the
expansion of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and
the presence of Lebanese government troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan had also met leaders of former Lebanese resistance group
Hezbollah and asked them to cooperate fully with the UNIFIL to
maintain peace in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Wednesday from Jordan for a two-day visit. He
is scheduled to hold talks in the West Bank city of Ramallah with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday before going to Syria
to continue his Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
Annan discussed with Barak about Israel's withdrawal from South
Lebanon and ways of stabilizing the Israeli-Lebanese border
following the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Barak told Annan that in pulling Israeli
troops back to the international border, Israel has done its part
in fulfilling the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, and that
Syria and Lebanon must now do their part to guarantee calm on the
Israeli-Lebanese border and to re-establish Lebanese sovereignty in
south Lebanon, a senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also brought up several complaints about the U.N.
demarcation of the border line and particularly he demanded that
the village of Rajar not be divided, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Rajar village is located on the border with half of the village
on each side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister also asked Annan to speed up the
process of sending more U.N. peacekeeping forces into south
Lebanon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending its 22-year military occupation there.
</P>
<P>
Following the withdrawal, the U.N. experts started immediately
mapping the border line and till now only a number of points
determined by the U.N. mapping experts are opposed by both Lebanon
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Rajar village on the border is a sensitive issue and the U.
N. will consult with parties concerned to solve this problem, Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the Israeli government will continue its efforts to
move the peace process ahead although it is facing the coalition
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan also met Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy earlier in
the day and the two discussed the peace process and issues
concerning Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan has already visited Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt,
Lebanon and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Thailand Sign MOU on Legal Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Thailand signed
here Wednesday a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on legal,
judicial and arbitration cooperation as a step to further
strengthen their ties within the framework of the Thailand-
Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programs (CSEP).
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs S. Jayakumar and his
Thai counterpart, Surin Pitsuwan, witnessed the signing by senior
officials from Singapore's Ministry of Law and Thailand's Ministry
of Justice at the third CSEP coordinating meeting at which
delegates from both sides discussed the state of cooperation
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, which aims to boost the exchange of information and
legal experiences, is the third within the framework of the CSEP,
established in 1997 to strengthen linkages between civil services
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the second CSEP coordinating meeting in Bangkok in February
last year, Thailand's NECTEC and the National Computer Board of
Singapore signed an MOU on cooperation in information technology.
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, the Office of the Civil Service Commission of
Thailand and the Singapore Public Service Division signed an MOU
to formalize their cooperation in official exchanges and training
of public officials and personnel management.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the third coordinating meeting together with
Jayakumar Wednesday morning, Surin said the CSEP is one of the key
pillars of Thai-Singapore relations and a high-level forum to
inject political direction into the efforts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In this millennium year, we should re-focus on the original
objectives of the CSEP, that is to establish a framework for high-
level contacts and informal exchanges between our officials," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Threatens not to Attend OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister
Jorge Chicote has warned again that his country will not attend
the summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) scheduled
for July 10-12, if it is to be held in the Togolese capital of
Lome.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister is in Maputo, Mozambique, taking part in a
two-day conference discussing ways of bringing peace to Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday he believed it is absurd to hold the OAU summit
in a country whose government has been accused in a United Nations
report of violating the sanctions decreed by the U.N. Security
Council against the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Chicote denied that his government's position could be
described as a boycott, saying: "It is not a boycott", "We want to
take part in the OAU summit, so long it is not held in Togo."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Angolan government has evidence of the
involvement of Togo in the war waged by UNITA against the Angolan
people.
</P>
<P>
"We have provided this evidence to the United Nations, which
only strengthens the suspicions of the U.N. itself, which produced
a report where it gives a list of African and other countries that
support (UNITA leader Jonas) Savimbi," said Chicote.
</P>
<P>
However, South African President Thabo Mbeki said on Monday he
is not in favor of changing the venue of the OAU summit from Togo,
just because of the Angolan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government has yet to make a clear statement on
the matter.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian State Leader Soothes Non-Moslems Over Sharia Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of
Nigeria's northern Kano State has said the federal government and
non-Moslems have no cause to fear over planned adoption of the
Islamic law of Sharia in his state.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Wednesday quoted the governor as pledging to a
visiting federal government delegation on Tuesday that peace would
be maintained when Sharia comes into place on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kano, one of the most populous and influential states in the
north of the West African country, is to join the other northern
states of Zamfara and Sokoto to implement the controversial law.
</P>
<P>
Troops and riot police have already been deployed on the
streets of Kano City, capital of the state and the largest city in
northern Nigeria, to prevent riots like those which took place in
another northern state of Kaduna in February.
</P>
<P>
Clash between Christians and Muslims over the proposed
introduction of the law in Kaduna had left nearly 1,000 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims in Kano have reportedly threatened a showdown if
the Sharia does not come into force on Wednesday as promised by
the state governor last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Christians in the two states have voiced
concern that the implementation of Sharia would mean disaster to
the country. They accused the Muslims of using the law to drive
them out.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are the two most populous and influential
states in northern Nigeria. Unlike other northern states, which
are overwhelmingly dominated by Muslim population, the two states
have a large Christian population.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Crisis Affects Economies of S. Africa, Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The political turmoil and
economic meltdown in Zimbabwe over the past three months have cast
a shadow over South Africa and Namibia, hammering confidence in
their economies and raising the threat of similar land-related
violence, economists said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign confidence in the region has been dented (by the
Zimbabwe crisis)," said South African economist Magan Mistry.
</P>
<P>
"Normally foreign investors look at Africa as one," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"It has had repercussions on the image the region has in the
world," Director of Namibian Economic Policy Research Unit Dirk
Hansohm said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who visited South
Africa last week, warned that the world might "get the impression
that what has happened in one country could happen in another".
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said "the re-establishment of the secure
rule of law is very important for Zimbabwe and the region".
</P>
<P>
The rand, to which the Namibian dollar is pegged, dropped to an
all-time low of 7.20 rand to one U.S. dollar at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the South African Bureau for Economic Research of
1,000 manufacturers in the country in May and June showed that 46
percent of those who exported to Zimbabwe said their exports had
decreased since the unrest in Zimbabwe, which has also raised
fears and threats of similar land invasions in South Africa and
Namibia where white minorities still own the bulk of commercial
farms.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, about 80 percent of arable land is owned by
whites, who make up about 12 percent of the population. In
Namibia, 4,000 whites, out of a population of 1.8 million, own 44
percent of the land.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Coffee-Growers Short of Money to Buy Farm Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Coffee-growers in the
northern region of the country are short of money to buy farm
tools to support the harvest of coffee in the current agricultural
year, the Angolan National Institute of Coffee said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the institute, coffee-growers
from the northern region, mainly from the Uige province, raised
the problem to director of the institute Manuel Dias.
</P>
<P>
The coffee-growers said that small and medium coffee-growers
are badly in need of hoes,cutlasses, bags and food.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are also concerned over insecurity in the fields
due to military instability in the province of Uige, which will
this year host the inauguration of Angola's coffee harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Dias said that his institute will lobby before the
business sector and financial institutions in Angola to support
the farmers' projects in the province and relaunch their
production.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Uige has 2,637 coffee-growers associated in eight
co- operative societies, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Angola used to be the fourth largest coffee-producing country
in the world. But at this moment, the country has to spend a lot
of money on the import of coffee, due to the rampant civil
conflicts which devastated most coffee plantations in the
country's northern and central areas.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Two Political Parties Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's two influential political
parties, the Union of Right Forces (SPS) and the liberal Yabloko
movement on Wednesday agreed to gradually unite their
organizations into a strong right-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
State Duma (the lower house of parliament) vice-speaker, SPS
deputy Irina Khakamada and Yabloko leader Vladimir Lukin signed an
accord.
</P>
<P>
The unification is aimed to "consolidate democratic liberal
forces in Russia and combine efforts to strengthen fundamental
common values such as a civil society, market economy and legal
state," says the pact.
</P>
<P>
The SPS, led by former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and
Yabloko, chaired by liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, will
nominate unified lists of candidates in the next Duma elections,
it says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two political organizations will support
commonly agreed upon candidates in all regional and local
elections after September 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two parties "will immediately begin to take steps at
regional and local levels to coordinate the actions of SPS and
Yabloko regional and local branches in an effort to complete
formation of unified organizations in most regions in 2001," the
document reads.
</P>
<P>
SPS and Yabloko will also immediately start the establishment
of a united political council on the basis of parity to coordinate
the work of their branches at federal, regional and local levels.
</P>
<P>
The organizational legal form of the united coalition is to be
defined no later than December 2000, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The move of the two right-wing organizations is of historic
importance, said Khakamada and Lukin.
</P>
<P>
SPS leader Boris Nemtsov, who attended the signing ceremony,
said the union is open for all of Russia's democratic liberal
forces to join. However, he said, an agreement has been reached
with Yabloko's leadership that "absolute consent" is necessary
when taking in new members in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said the nascent coalition "will refuse to discuss
the problems that separated us in the past " and "will look to the
future."
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the Yeltsin era, an opportunity has emerged to
shape Russia's political landscape in a different way," he said,
describing the union's prospects as "very solid."
</P>
<P>
SPS and Yabloko, which collected respectively about 8.7 and 6
percent of votes in December's Duma elections, ranked fourth and
fifth among the six parties in the State Duma. They hold 29 and 20
seats in the 450-seat Duma.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Issues Ban on Illegal Electronic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
has issued a circular on banning the production, sales, and use of
nearly 60 kinds of electronic games which are used for gambling.
</P>
<P>
The circular, jointly issued by local cultural, public security
and industrial and commercial bureaus, is aimed at eliminating the
sources of "electronic heroin," city government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the number of electronic game centers
has been mushrooming over the past few years in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of May, there were 492
registered electronic game centers, with 21,374 video game players.
</P>
<P>
But some of these centers have used video games for gambling
rather than entertainment.
</P>
<P>
This has negatively influenced youngsters, especially primary
and middle school students. The phenomenon has caught the
attention of the city government.
</P>
<P>
Since March, the local government has launched a campaign to
clean up electronic game centers. By April, 188 centers had been
closed and 74 others were ordered to suspend operation.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that those found still using electronic games
for illegal businesses will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Gambling is illegal in China.

<HEADLINE> High Yield Market Set to Expand in Asia, SSB Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Head of SSB's Asia-Pacific High Yield Capital Markets William
Clay told a debt conference held in Hong Kong today that with
improved mutual fund inflows, light corporate issuance and below
investment grade yields that are at their 10-year highs, the
current high yield market is an attractive asset class for
investors.
</P>
<P>
"Asian issuers will grow to understand the benefits of long-
term, non-amortizing debt which provides enhanced free cash flow
for growth," Clay noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the pool of capital is lower than pre-1997, Clay
believed it will return and investors will look for products with
attractive rates and spreads.
</P>
<P>
"Like in the U.S. and Europe, the Internet sector will become a
new high yield asset class in Asia," the SSB executive said. "New
media and telecom businesses, such as the new 3G wireless network
operators in Hong Kong, the Internet infrastructure providers in
China's mainland and the wireless operators in countries like the
Philippines will need substantial growth capital."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the development of an Asian high yield market
is not without challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Local funds are smaller than pre-crisis, and many investors
are not yet familiar with certain high yield issuance structures
such as senior subordinated notes and holding company notes which
are often used in the high yield market," Clay said.
</P>
<P>
He said that credit intermediaries have sometimes lent at below
rational levels and until recently, equity was very inexpensive
for issuers, so they tapped those markets instead of high yield.
</P>
<P>
According to Clay, the global high yield market, currently
valued at approximately 600 billion U.S. dollars, is set to expand
further as there are significant capital demands for non-
investment grade companies in developed and emerging countries,
particularly in the growing telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
With high yield being recognized by issuers and investors as a
viable source of financing, the market has grown significantly
over the past 10 years from 180 billion U.S. dollars in 1990 to
567 billion in 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Finnish Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua)-- Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee, met here today with a delegation of the
Finnish Social Democratic Party (FSDP) headed by its General
Secretary Kari Juhani Laitinen.
</P>
<P>
Wei said Finland is one of the first western countries to
establish diplomatic relations with China, and through concerted
efforts from both sides, bilateral ties have witnessed smooth
growth in the past 50 years. Especially during the past decade,
senior leaders have frequently exchanged visits, and cooperation
in the political, economic, trade, cultural and other fields have
also been expanded, he said.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrated that in spite of the differences in political
systems, historic and cultural background, economic development,
and viewpoints on certain issues, bilateral relations can also
continue moving forward so long as both sides respect each other
and stick to the principle of equality, mutual benefit, and
seeking common ground while preserving differences, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the FSDP has made important contributions to the
protection of national sovereignty and territorial integrity,
developing the national economy, and upgrading people's standard
of living.
</P>
<P>
The CPC highly appreciates FSDP's pursuit of the One-China
Policy and its efforts to push forward bilateral friendship, Wei
said. The CPC and the FSDP are both ruling parties shouldering the
heavy task of leading their people in developing their countries,
and they also face many common challenges, he said. To increase
contact between them would help benefit people of both countries,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is willing to further increase communication with the
FSDP based on the four principles governing party-to-party
relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laitinen said the delegation has learned about China's great
changes as well as its big development plans during their several
days here. He said that in recent years, the two countries have
cooperated successfully in the field of telecommunications
technology, and there is also potential in sectors like
environment protection and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have reached a high level, and both sides
should further strengthen friendly contact, he said, adding the
FSDP is willing to work together with the CPC to continue
stimulating cooperation in all fields.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes U.S. Interference in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China deeply resents and firmly
opposes U.S. interference in matters concerning Tibet, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on a meeting between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the Dalai Lama on June 20, Zhu said the fact that the
U.S. government allowed the Dalai Lama to visit the U.S. and that
the U.S. leader met with him violating the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and basic norms governing international relations, and
interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China has lodged solemn representations to the United States
and expressed deep resentment and firm opposition to that," he
said, calling the Dalai Lama not merely a religious figure, but
also a political figure in exile who engages in activities aiming
at splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out that Tibet has been a part of Chinese
territory since ancient times, and the Tibetan affair is purely
China's internal affair, which brooks no interference from foreign
countries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the U.S. government has clearly stated that the U.S.
recognizes Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, and does not
support Tibet's independence.
</P>
<P>
"China urges the U.S. to practice what it preaches, correct its
errors and earnestly honor its commitments," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Court Backs Project Hope Over Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- An official with the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF) said here today that Project Hope
has been vindicated, after the Hong Kong High Court found a local
weekly magazine guilty of defaming the project yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the CYDF, said the article,
published by Next magazine on January 21, 1994, damaged the
reputation of the foundation with its insinuation that the
foundation had misappropriated 70 million yuan (about 8.4 U.S.
dollars), and caused the charity to lose a large amount of
donations from Hong Kong that year.
</P>
<P>
Judge Andrew Chung said yesterday that the article in Next
magazine was malicious. He awarded 3.5 million Hong Kong dollars (
about 500,000 U.S. dollars) to the non-profit foundation.
</P>
<P>
Xu said at a press conference that though his foundation is not
totally satisfied with the compensation, it highly respects the
fairness of Hong Kong's law and will not appeal to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We sincerely welcome the media to keep a watch on us.
"
</P>
<P>
The foundation's counsel today read a statement that no
organizations or individuals unauthorized by the foundation are
allowed to collect or handle donations for Project Hope.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope, launched by the CYDF in 1989, has helped nearly 2.
3 million dropouts return to school and established more than 7,
800 Hope schools around China. One-third of its money comes from
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Commander Says 1988 U.S. Bombing of Iranian Flight on Purpose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military commander
said on Wednesday that the 1988 bombing of an Iranian flight over
the Persian Gulf by the United States Navy was an act on purpose.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. downing of the Iranian plane cannot be considered a
mistake but demonstrated the depth of its hostility to Iran," Rear
Admiral Mohammad Karim Tavakkoli told the Islamic Republic News
Agency on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
Iran Air Flight 655, while flying from Iran to the United Arab
Emirates, was shot down over the Gulf island of Hengam by two
missiles fired from the U.S. Vincennes warship on July 3, 1988,
killing all 290 passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. later apologized and agreed to pay financial
compensation to the families of the victims, saying the act was a
mistake, for the Vincennes had taken the plane to be a military
one.
</P>
<P>
Tavakkoli, however, said the Vincennes could not have made a
mistake in distinguishing a military plane from a passenger one, as
it was the most modern missile launcher equipped with four
computerized systems.
</P>
<P>
The incident resulted in an intensification of hostility between
the two states since they broke off ties in 1980 after Iran's
Islamic revolution and the hostage taking in the U.S. embassy in
Tehran by radical Muslim students.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there have been allegations that Iran was involved in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lokerbie, Scotland in
December 1988, killing 259 people in the air and 11 on the ground,
in retaliation for the U.S. act. But Iran has denied any
involvement in the incident.

<HEADLINE> UAE Internet Services Targeted by Hackers Updated with details of the suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A European computer programmer
living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was arrested recently on
suspicion of hacking the Internet services of the emirates, while
similar online attacks continue, local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly the first case in the Gulf Arab region that a
person was arrested on hacking charges.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest a week and a half ago, Leon Shurz was a senior
programmer in a Dubai-based European information company based.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 30-years-old suspect, who was carrying a
British passport, could face a maximum of 10 years imprisonment
under the UAE law if convicted, according to the UAE official news
agency WAM.
</P>
<P>
However, hacker attacks against the UAE net services did not
stop after Shurz was taken into custody, said Ali Salem Al Owais,
president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Emirates
Telecommunication Corporation (Etisalat), the UAE's sole telecom
service provider.
</P>
<P>
Etisalat was "attacked by a group of Internet criminals," he
said, adding that "Several attacks were reported by other
administrations and many sites are being compromised."
</P>
<P>
But he assured that "We have now sheltered and adequately
protected our system and network from such attacks by this and
other similar groups and individuals," the newspapers cited his
brief statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Owais denied the suspicion that the attackers might be rooted in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the hackers used a so-called "denial of service" attack
similar to that employed in a series of attacks on some world
leading e-commerce and portal sites, including Yahoo!, AOL, CNN.com
and eBay, in February, which caused billions of U.S. dollars of
losses.
</P>
<P>
Such attacks involve sending extremely large amount of traffic
at a Web site to overwhelm its route, thus blocking the access of
other users to the site. The method is similar to repeatedly
dialing a telephone number to block all other incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
UAE officials said it was the first time that such a large-scale
crippling of the Internet services occurred in the UAE, the second
most wired country in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, Internet users in the UAE have been
complaining about problems in accessing the international
information highway as their computers get no response from
Etisalat's server, which have authenticated users' names and
passwords.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates Internet and Multimedia (EIM), a specialized arm of
Etisalat, earlier claimed that only dial-up customers, including
over 140,000 subscribers and a total of nearly 500,000 users,
experienced the accessing problems.
</P>
<P>
The Internet services were reportedly introduced into the UAE in
August 1995.

Privatization Board, told the national news agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that besides reducing red tape over the
disinvestment process, the proposed law will allow the board to
sell units up to 250 million taka (4.8 million U.S. dollars)
independently.
</P>
<P>
The board, in the last three years, has already handed over
seven loss-making state-owned industries to private owners,
Zafarullah said, adding that 11 more units are awaiting immediate
handover.
</P>
<P>
Besides, disinvestment through off-loading of government shares
in 23 local, multinational and private companies and banks are
also going on in full swing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rights and benefits of workers in the
privatized units, the chairman said that apart from a plan to sell
10 industrial units to workers, the government is working to
provide retraining and social safety net support to the workers
through extending soft bank loans to them.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Import 137,000 Tons of Cereals From S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Namibia will have to import
more than 137,000 tons of cereals from South Africa to prepare for
a shortfall in the 2000-2001 farm season, the South African Press
Association reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disappointing harvest was caused by dry spells during the
rainy season, especially between January and March, the report
quoted Namibia's Early Warning and Food Information System as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a crop assessment conducted in major cereal
producing areas in northern Namibia, a wheat shortfall of 61,400
tons and a white maize shortfall of 75,700 tons can be expected.
</P>
<P>
Commercial mills in the southern African country have
reportedly imported 19,000 tons of wheat and 21,200 tons of white
maize.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, with an estimated population of 1.8 million, has an
average per capita cereal consumption of 135 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Most of World Unemployed Lack Social Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Three in every four of the 150
million people unemployed around the world lack any unemployment
insurance protection, said the latest report released here
Wednesday by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland provide the most generous unemployment protection
systems of all ILO member countries, said the ILO in its World
Labor Report 2000: Income Security and Social Protection in a
Changing World.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that even the world's richest countries in
Europe and North America reduced protection provided by
unemployment insurance in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
It identified Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom and the United States as belonging to "medium-
level type systems." Fewer of the unemployed in these countries
receive benefits, and the compensation that is provided is lower
than those available in the first tier of countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Canada and Britain are also rated low because "the
duration of unemployment benefit payments is short, with benefits
payable for less than 12 months." In addition, neither the U.S.
nor Canada has a second layer of unemployment assistance available
when the first layer runs out.
</P>
<P>
For low-income developing countries, "it is imperative to give
priority to schemes specially designed to meet the needs of
informal sector workers," the ILO said in the report, adding that
government support is deemed "indispensable" in the effort and a
possible starting point would be the extension of statutory social
insurance schemes "toward increased -- and possibly universal --
coverage."
</P>
<P>
The ILO made various proposals to extend social protection,
which now covers less than half of the world population. The three
main options toward meeting the goal include extension of existing
programs, creation of new programs which target informal sector
workers and the development of tax financed social benefit systems.

<HEADLINE> 15 International Federations Agree to Start Out-of-Competition Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Up to 15 international Olympic
sports federations (IFs) have agreed to start out-of-competition
testing, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced on Tuesday
in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting at the headquarters of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC), the WADA Executive Committee ratified the
cooperation agreement that WADA must sign with each IF in order
for WADA to conduct random out-of-competition tests on the
athletes under that IF's supervision.
</P>
<P>
WADA already has reached a number of signed and verbal
agreements with IFs. Two federations, FINA (swimming) and IWF (
weightlifting) signed the contract on Tuesday, and 13 others have
agreed in principle. One federation, FITA (archery) has allowed
the testing to commence already on the basis of its verbal
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The WADA committee also decided on its independent observer
role of the Sydney Olympic Games doping control result management
system.
</P>
<P>
During its earlier Board meeting, WADA announced its goal of
implementing 2,500 out-of-competition tests in 2000, of which it
hopes to have most completed before the Olympic Games. At the
conclusion of the program, WADA will publish the results of the
testing program by sport. One federation, WTF (taekwondo), has yet
to respond to WADA proposals.

<HEADLINE> Buckwheat-rich Diet Effective in Diabetes Control: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Eating buckwheat-rich food can
dramatically reduce the risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes,
according to a study made by Chinese researchers.
</P>
<P>
The average blood sugar level of people who eat buckwheat as
staple food is 3.9 millimole per liter, compared with 4.56
millimole per liter among the people who don't eat buckwheat,
revealed the study made among some 1,000 residents in Inner
Mongolia, one of China's major buckwheat production bases.
</P>
<P>
Detectable rates of high blood sugar and diabetes are
respectively 1.6 percent and 1.88 percent in buckwheat-eating
areas, compared with 7.33 percent and 3.84 percent in the regions
without the buckwheat-eating habit.
</P>
<P>
The researchers at Harbin Medical University also found that
the blood sugar level of lab rats dropped from 9.41 millimole per
liter to 7.57 millimole per liter as a result of a 15-day
buckwheat diet, said a Health News report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted researcher Zhang Hongwei as saying that
buckwheat contains much more chromium and alum than other foods,
which indicates that the elements might play the leading role in
lowering blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the buckwheat which is widely grown in north China
is rich in protein and cellulose, he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 50 million diabetics, and the incidence
rate for diabetes has reached 3.21 percent, almost five times the
level in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Resulting in more than 170 billion yuan (about 20 billion U.S.
dollars) in medical costs each year, the disease has become the
third most serious chronic disease in the country, following
cardio- and cerebral-vascular illnesses and cancer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Governor Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that Sabirin's detention was coincided with the
arrival of President Abdurrahman Wahid from his overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for overseas trip early this month, Wahid has
requested the governor to resign, but the latter rejected.
</P>
<P>
However, Spokesman of the AGO Yushar Yahya said that Sabirin's
detention was intended to "clear the way for further investigation
into his alleged involvement in Bank Bali scandal."
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we are worried that he will make evidences disappear
or running away," Yahya added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Sabirin's lawyer Mohammad Assegaf confirmed his
client's detention saying that the letter of arrest was signed by
Director of Investigation for Special Crime at the AGO, R.I.S.
Pandapotan Sihombing.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Sabirin underwent investigation at the AGO and
continued on Wednesday. He was allegedly involved in the country's
Bank Bali scandal and was named as suspect in early of this month
for allegedly violating the central banks prudential principle in
its policy to reimburse interbank loans guaranteed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around Bank Indonesia's reimbursement of
904 billions rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in defaulted loans
to other banks. Some 546 billions rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
of the money was then paid to PT Era Giat Prima for helping Bank
Bali recoup the money. There is suspicion that a large portion of
the money went to help bankroll then president B.J. Habibie
renomination bid.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Deploy More Troops in North Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If you ask me about 100 percent of security situation in (
North)Maluku islands, I will say that it is impossible to provide
security guarantee 100 percent there. Everything is very limited.
Number of our security personnel is limited as well as our fund,"
he told reporters commenting on the renewed communal bloodshed in
North Maluku province which killed at least 152 people on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The only possible thing we can do to ease violent action in
the restive Maluku is sending more troops. That is the most
possible way at the moment," Sudarsono said.
</P>
<P>
Renewed communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians on
Monday saw 152 people killed and another 160 wounded in Galela
subdistrict in Halmahera island, North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, situation in North Maluku as well as other restive
area in the country are deserved for the imposition of a state of
emergency. But we have not yet a legal basis to impose such a
state of emergency there, because we have not yet a bill on such a
thing," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
North Maluku and Maluku provinces have been witnessed nearly
two years of religious and ethnic violence involving Muslims and
Christians. The number of people killed and wounded in both
provinces now runs into thousands.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Arrests Nearly 1,900 Drug Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police has
arrested 1,897 suspected drug dealers between 1990 and 1999, local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly, or Parliament, in the
central town of Dodoma on Tuesday, Deputy Minister for Home
Affairs John Mgeja was quoted as saying that petty peddlers were
given suspended sentences or fined while the rest were jailed for
up to 20 years and their vehicles were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, so far no drug barons had been arrested
because of lack of sufficient evidence since the establishment of
the Anti-Drugs Unit in the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any one with reliable information that a certain
heavyweight or any person in the country involves in drug abuse,
the government will then deal with suspects irrespective of their
social status, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police officers have warned that East African region
has become a major illicit drug conduit connecting America, Europe
and other areas in the world due to the introduction of better
means of communication since the late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vexed Over Exclusion From EU-led Defense Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is angry over the European
Union (EU)'s decision to exclude it from a European defense
mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities in Turkey for
EU-led operations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday that Ankara was "not
satisfied with" the EU decision made Tuesday at the EU summit in
Portugal to exclude non-EU members from the so-called European
Security and Defense Identity (ESDI).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry called on EU members to
reverse its decision at its next summit in Nice, France, in
December.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ESDI envisages the establishment of a decision-
making structure over defense under the EU, which would be
independent of the United States-led NATO and would exclude non-EU
members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member and EU candidate, has endeavoured to join
the European defense mechanism with the support of the U.S., who
fears the ESDI will take the place of the NATO and reduce
Washington's role in the European security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turkish defense officials said Ankara has been an active
contributor, within the framework of NATO, to European security
since the Cold War and should not be excluded from a European
security and defense architecture.
</P>
<P>
When Javier Solana, commissioner for EU foreign and security
affairs, visited Ankara early this month, Turkey voiced objections
to the ESDI on the grounds that non-EU members, like itself, would
be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insisted that it wants to be involved in the decision-
making, rather than the decision-implementing, process.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had also sent a diplomatic note of warning at the end of
May to 11 EU countries which are also NATO members over their
approach to the ESDI.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which did not want to see its role reduced in the
European security with the evolving structure of the ESDI, stressed
that it was not like other non-EU NATO members and had contributed
much to European security both in the Cold War and post-Cold War
eras.

<HEADLINE> Annan in Israel for Lebanon Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
met Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Wednesday to discuss
ways of stabilizing the Israel-Lebanon border following Israel's
withdrawal last month.
</P>
<P>
Levy said at the start of the meeting that Israel is eager to
cooperate with the United Nations and will abide by the demarcation
line drawn by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"We will work according to the maps shown to us which we worked
on with U.N. experts," he said, adding "Cooperation with the U.N.
is very important."
</P>
<P>
Annan was due to hold talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak later
on Wednesday. He is reportedly to meet Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israeli conducted an early withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24, ending its 22-year occupation of the region. Last week, the U.
N. verified that the withdrawal had been fully implemented in
compliance with Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lebanese government claims that Israel is still
occupying some Lebanese territories and has threatened to block U.
N. plans to deploy its peacekeepers in the areas vacated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Beirut on Tuesday, Annan said Israel had met the
main conditions of long-standing U.N. resolutions demanding that it
leave Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He called on all parties to respect the Israel-Lebanon border
identified by his envoys.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued a statement at the start of the meeting,
saying that the prime minister has asked Annan to meet the families
of the Israeli soldiers missing in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Annan to meet representatives of residents of the
Alawite village of Ghajar, which U.N. cartographers threatened to
split as they demarcated the border between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
As the demarcation line stands, part of the village is now in
Lebanon, with the rest in Syria's Golan Heights, occupied by Israel
since 1967.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general arrived in Jerusalem for a two-day visit
after his visits to Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon and
Jordan. He is scheduled to visit Syria later in the week.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Declines by 29 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
fell by 29 percent in May from a year earlier to 582.4 billion yen
(5.4 billion dollars) as an upsurge in imports outpaced an
increase in exports, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The double-digit fall, which follows a 10.3 percent jump in the
surplus in April, stemmed from increased imports of crude oil and
petrochemical products, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose by 19.4 percent to 3,271.5 billion yen (30.5
billion dollars), while exports grew by 8.2 percent to 3853.9
billion yen (35.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States slipped by 9.8 percent to 467.7 billion yen (4.4 billion
dollars), the first downturn in four months.
</P>
<P>
With other Asian countries and regions, Japan registered a
trade surplus of 273.7 billion yen (2.6 billion dollars), up 23.4
percent from a year earlier, on the back of a recovery from the
1997-1998 Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asia rose by 22.6 percent while imports gained 22.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with the 15-member European Union (EU) fell
by 14.4 percent to 224.6 billion yen (2.1 billion dollars), down
for the second consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 107.32 to the dollar, up 12.0 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustments for
seasonal variations.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge For Third Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in Tokyo
for third consecutive day Wednesday, led by high-priced
information and technology issues, with the benchmark Nikkei index
closing above 17,000 for the first time in nine trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 302.53 points, or 1.79
percent from Tuesday's close to end at 17,210.08.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 24.16 points or 1.55 percent to 1,
583.95.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 696.06 million
shares from Tuesday's 655.39 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
High-priced information and technology issues were boosted
after New York's Nasdaq composite index rose for the fourth
straight trading day Tuesday and closed above 4,000 for the first
time in more than two months, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Expectations are growing that the Japanese government's current
economic stimulus measures will be maintained following newspaper
polls published Tuesday that showed the ruling coalition is likely
to gain a majority in Sunday's general election, making investors
feel good about buying stocks, they said said.
</P>
<P>
Gainers included retailers, glass makers and brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, electric power and gas firms, warehousing, banking
and real estate sectors lost ground.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers surpassed
losers 699 to 557, with 148 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China Has Huge Potential for Small Hydro-Electric Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China has built a total of 43,000
small hydro-electric projects for 300 million people living in the
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The 43,000 small hydro-electric power stations nationwide
produce 23 million kwh a year.
</P>
<P>
Tian Shen, an official with the Chinese Ministry of Water
Resources, said at the International Symposium on Renewable Energy
held recently in Guilin that China has 100 million kilowatts of
explorable small hydro-electric power resources in mountainous
areas, but only 29 percent of the resources has been used. And of
the untapped resources, 83 percent is in the western region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The small hydro-electric power stations now under construction
have a combined generating capacity of five million kw, Liu said,
adding that in the past six years, such stations with a total
generating capacity of over one million kw went into operation
each year and the government's annual input in such power projects
tops 13 billion yuan (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
China plans to increase the per-capita consumption in rural
China to 400 to 600 kwh by the year 2010 as against the current
280 kwh by adding more such small stations.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yong, an expert with the Rural Electrification Institute,
said that now in China's rural area, 75 million people still have
no access to power supply, and they still depend heavily on
burning timber and straw, which is equivalent to burning 600
million tons of standard coal a year.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's 100 key steel companies
registered a combined profit of 2.34 billion yuan (282 million U.S.
dollars) in the first four months this year, 7.3 times more than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the State Administration of Metallurgical
Industry said that steel output hit 50.75 million tons from
January to May, up 3.5 percent. But the increase rate was 3.2
percentage points lower than the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Exports of steel and steel products increased by 1.86 million
tons to reach 3.1 million tons in the first four months.
</P>
<P>
The positive change shows that the sector's efforts to reduce
output and restructure itself have begun to take effect, industry
observers commented.
</P>
<P>
The administration plans to shut down 103 small iron and steel
plants by the end of this year. The name list for the first 50
plants has been decided.
</P>
<P>
An official said that the price hike of steel products in

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- An official with the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF) today praised people of Hong Kong
for donating money to an education program, Project Hope, in the
past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the CYDF, said at a press
conference held here today that the project has received 1.8
billion yuan (217 million U.S. dollars) by the end of 1999. Some
500 million yuan (60 million U.S. dollars) came from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong donations have helped 235,000 dropouts return to
school and establish more than 1,600 "Hope Schools" around China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Hong Kong media has strongly supported the project.
Some newspapers and radios started raising funds in 1992 and Hong
Kong became the largest donor outside the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited went to the
mainland and made a series of TV programs to introduce the project
to Hong Kong people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that media including the Hong Kong media will continue
efforts in supporting the project.

<HEADLINE> UAE Internet Services Targeted by Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A European youngster living in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was arrested recently on suspicion
of hacking the Internet services of the emirates while similar
online attacks are still going on, local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly the first case in the Gulf Arab region that a
person was arrested on hacking charges.
</P>
<P>
However, hacker attacks against the UAE net service have not
stopped after the European suspect, whose name was not disclosed,
was taken into custody, said Ali Salem Al Owais, president and
chief executive officer (CEO) of the Emirates Telecommunication
Corporation (Etisalat), the UAE's sole telecom service provider.
</P>
<P>
Etisalat was "attacked by a group of Internet criminals," he
said, adding that "Several attacks were reported by other
administrations and many sites are being compromised."
</P>
<P>
But he assured that "We have now sheltered and adequately
protected our system and network from such attacks by this and
other such similar groups and individuals," the newspapers cited
his brief statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Owais denied the suspicion that the attackers might be rooted in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the hackers used a so-called "denial of service" attack
similar to that employed in a series of attacks on some world
leading e-commerce and portal sites, including Yahoo!, AOL, CNN.com
and eBay, in February, which caused billions of U.S. dollars of
losses.
</P>
<P>
Such attacks involve sending extremely large amount of traffic
at a Web site to overwhelm its route, thus blocking the access of
other users to the site. The method is similar to repeatedly
dialing a telephone number to block all other incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
UAE officials said this was the first time that such a large-
scale crippling of the Internet service occurred in the UAE, the
second most wired country in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, Internet users in the UAE have been
complaining about problems in accessing the international
information highway as their computers get no response from the
Etisalat's server, which have authenticated users' names and
passwords.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates Internet and Multimedia (EIM), a specialized arm of
Etisalat, earlier claimed that only dial-up customers, including
over 140,000 subscribers and a total of nearly 500,000 users,
experienced the accessing problems.
</P>
<P>
The Internet services were reportedly introduced into the UAE in
August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is not giving up the
efforts to keep the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in the coalition,
even though the party's four ministers tendered their resignations
to him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak said it was too early to talk about alternative
coalitions. According to the prime minister, the negotiations on
such central issues as Shas' education network and legalizing its
pirate radio broadcasts have produced agreement on "90 percent of
the problems."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that other proposals could resolve the two issues to
the satisfaction of Shas, within guidelines set by the professional
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has instructed the Peace
Directorate in his office to coordinate the preparation of a "
separation plan along the seam" -- the boundary line -- between
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority that will be
established as part of the permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
The plan is being formulated jointly by the Israeli Defense
Forces (IDF), the police, the office of the Coordinator of
Government Activities in the Territories, and the ministries of
Finance, Transport and Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Initial indications show that importing water from Turkey is
feasible, but it will be 11 months before the shipments can begin,
Mekorot water utility chief Amos Epstein said Tuesday, the first
day of Israeli-Turkish talks on the proposed imports.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Israeli delegation said they believed Turkish
officials would "go very far" to ease the water export to Israel,
keeping the price to a minimal 5-10 cents per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
The overall price of water imports would be far higher, however.
The cost of transporting the water, unloading it in Israel and
bringing it to the national water system could raise the final
figure to as much as a U.S. dollar per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to arrive in
Israel Wednesday for meetings with Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy. Annan arrives in Jerusalem after having visited Morocco,
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Barak will ask that additional U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) be deployed and that all be done to get Lebanese and
Syrian support for the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to officially confirm Israel's implementation
of Security Council Resolution 425 and tell Barak he has made it
clear to all parties that he expects the border identified by his
envoys to be respected.

<HEADLINE> Israel Plans to Build Fence Along Border With Palestinians: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
had ordered his aides to prepare for a plan to build border fence
along the future border between Israel and the Palestinians,
Israel's Ha'aretz daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Directorate in Barak's Office will take the lead to
organize the plan work, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the
police, the office of Coordinator of Government Activities in the
(Occupied) Territories, and the ministries of Finance, Transport
and Regional Cooperation jointly participating in, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The work is part of the preparations for a permanent peace
accord with the Palestinians, in which the two sides are supposed
to address the most thorny issues such as border, the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, security and
water.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are scheduled to declare their independence by
the end of this year, with or without a final settlement with
Israel. The two sides had set this September as deadline for
reaching a final accord, but the negotiations are proceeding at a
slow pace recently.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz quoted Shaul Arieli, head of the Peace Directorate, as
saying that according to the guidelines he received from Barak, the
underlying concept for the plan should be "separation between the
two entities together with possibilities of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Peace Directorate had decided to assign
different tasks to the joint team.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the IDF will be responsible for building fence,
trenches, and other engineering obstacles to prevent illegal cross-
border activities in the future.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Transport Ministry and the Civil Aviation
Authority will set up a number of passages along the border fence,
allowing interaction between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, The Regional Cooperation Ministry and the Office of
Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories will design
some arrangements encouraging economic and other cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposals is to establish industrial zones along the
future border, which can be entered freely from either sides. This
will provide employment opportunities for the Palestinians without
having to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the Israeli police will be deployed along the line and
coordinate their moves with the Palestinian security forces at the
other side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the report, a political source clarified Tuesday that
the separation concept had not reach an advanced stage to work with
a specific line, as the border with the future Palestinian entities
has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
He also added: "We are not talking about the Jerusalem region at
this stage."

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Holds Secret Talks With Foreign Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ongoing negotiations with foreign countries involved in the
hostage situation in Sulu may lead to an early release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado warned
of any foreign interference on negotiations as it may derail the
government's effort to resolve the Sulu crisis in a more practical,
effective way without sacrificing the national security.
</P>
<P>
The military, however, denied truth to such reports that there
is an on-going backdoor negotiations being conducted by the
extremist group Abu Sayyaf and the other foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
South Command (Southcom) vice-commander Alberto Braganza was
quoted as saying that as far as Southcom is concerned no reports
have been received that the terrorist group in Sulu are holding
secret talks with the foreign countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
However, Braganza said the military is gathering intelligence
information to check the veracity of such reports.
</P>
<P>
Reports on alleged back-door negotiations cropped up after the
Asian and European captives in Sulu were separated apart from each
group and kept a few kilometers away from the other.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that the extremist Abu Sayyaf in Sulu led by
Commander Robot is negotiating secretly with the Malaysian
government to facilitate the immediate release of the Malaysian
hostages.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that other foreign countries are also having
secret negotiations with the terrorist group in the hope that the
hostage crisis in Sulu would end soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military is optimistic that the government
negotiators will be able to come up with a peaceful resolution on
the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
" We ( military) are not meddling with the negotiations headed
by Secretary Robert Aventajado ", Braganza stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that military operations are being readied as

final option in case negotiations fail.

<HEADLINE> 3 Remaining Basilan Hostages Transferred to Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Three remaining Basilan-based all-
Filipino hostages consisting of two female teachers and a boy have
been transferred to Patikul, Sulu province by their Abu Sayyaf
captors, Philippine News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf spokesman was quoted as saying that
they brought teachers Teresita Manuel and Erlinda Academia
together with 15-year old Richard Sintos from Basilan to Patikul,
Sulu two days ago.
</P>
<P>
This came following the swapping of the five school children
abducted by the Abu Sayyaf with seven members of the family of Abu
Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani last Saturday in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaya said they would only release the three remaining
hostages if the government would implement their demand to have
big fishing trawlers kept out of the fishing grounds of Sulu, Tawi-
Tawi and Basilan.
</P>
<P>
"As it is, government appears to be insincere in implementing
this demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Basilan hostage-drama which started on March 20 in Sumisip,
has taken its toll of five hostages killed, including a priest, 17
rescued, while leaving three more to be freed from the Abu Sayyaf.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Urges to Stop Maize Price Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has urged farmers in the country to join primary cooperatives to
stop the continuous falling of maize prices as some small-scale
farmers are selling the crop at record low prices.
</P>
<P>
The president said on Tuesday that some maize buyers are paying
as little as 5,000 kwacha (about 1.6 U.S. dollars) for a
90-kilogram bag, which is not only below the production costs but
undermines the government's efforts to fight poverty in the
country, Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president urged farmers to strengthen their bargaining
power and consult district administrators and members of
parliament on the commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the maize buyers should not exploit small-scale farmers
simply because of their weak bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper on Tuesday, Ajay Vashee,
president of the Zambia National Farmer Union, said the situation
is bound to worsen if the Food Reserve Agency does not move in to
raise the floor price.
</P>
<P>
Vashee explained that in the absence of brokers and merchant
banks to buy maize, small-scale farmers are forced to sell their
produce at depressed prices.

LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Some companies in the member

Zambia's Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted COMESA
Assistant- Secretary Sondiso Ngwenya as saying that this will be

He said the fear expressed by some business sectors that major
companies will be relocated to healthier conditions is genuine,
but he denied that this will be due to the overall FTA impact.
</P>

"There is a possibility that some companies will be relocated
once the Free Trade Area comes into effect, but this will not be
because of the overall impact of the FTA, but policy distortions
in individual member countries," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Strict Measures to Curb Water Shortages In Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in north China's
Tianjin Municipality are taking a series of measures to restrict
water usage.
</P>
<P>
The city government set water restrictions for all enterprises
and institutions, including schools and army barracks. The water
usage limit for a three-member household is eight cubic meters per
month. Households that exceed the eight cubic meters will be
charged extra.
</P>
<P>
Toilet bowls and taps in households are to be changed to
conserve water. Recent regulations also demand closing all car
washes and public bathrooms that have no water-saving facilities.
</P>
<P>
The local government will intensify protection on the Hai and
Luan rivers, which are two main water suppliers for the whole city.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin hopes to decrease daily water consumption from 1.83
million cubic meters to 1.68 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive years of drought in the city has decreased the
per capita water resources to 160 cubic meters, one fifteenth of
the national average. The drought last year was the most serious
one since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, said
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is also taking measures to restrict water consumption.
Statistics show that per capita water resources in Beijing stands
at 300 cubic meters, about one-eighth of the national average.

<HEADLINE> WB Loans to Protect Beijing Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's Board of
Executive Directors today approved an environment loan of 349
million U.S. dollars to China that will bring enormous health
benefits to all residents in urban Beijing by providing air
pollution control and wastewater disposal.
</P>
<P>
A release from the World Bank's Resident Mission in China said
the loan is also partially supplemented by a 25 million U.S.
dollars equivalent grant from the Global Environment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The "second Beijing environment project" will add to the local
municipal government's efforts to alleviate air and water
pollution in Beijing by converting coal-fire boilers to natural
gas boilers, promote energy conservation heating systems, provide
wastewater collection and treatment to the entire Liangshi River
basin, and strengthen environmental management in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"This project is designed to support one of the most
significant programs of urban environmental improvement in the
world," said Principal Urban Economist Songsu Choi, the project
manager. "Beijing's new environmental improvement program and the
project will attempt turn around environmental deterioration."
</P>
<P>
If successful, the project will transform Beijing's air and
water quality from barely acceptable levels for industrial zones
to levels that comply with World Health Organization's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The overall project costs 1.255 billion U.S. dollars and will
be financed with 343 million U.S. dollars from the central and
municipal governments. The World Bank loan has a maturity of 20
years, including a five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> WB Grants Environment Loan to Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a loan
of 200 million U.S. dollars to protect drinking water and provide
wastewater management services to improve the living conditions of
three million people in urban Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB's Resident Mission in China, the Chongqing
Urban Environment Project will work to raise the quality of life
for people in southwest China's Chongqing, Fuling, Wanzhou and
Nanbin by supporting basic urban services of wastewater management.
</P>
<P>
The drinking water supplies in Chongqing and Fuling will be
protected and the water supply will be increased to cities of
Nanbin and Wanzhou, according to the WB.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to improve public health by creating a cleaner
environment with upgraded wastewater and solid waste management
systems, said the WB. Developing sustainable systems will
significantly reduce the current hazards facing the people of
Chongqing from water borne diseases and unsanitary environmental
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is the world's largest municipality, with a
population of over 30 million. Urban Chongqing, located at the
confluence of the Yangtze River and Jialing River, is home to over
24 million people. The urban area currently lacks a wastewater
collection and disposal system.
</P>
<P>
In order to finance the urban environment project, the
Chongqing Municipal People's Government has created financially
independent wastewater companies that will rely on user charges to
finance their operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The overall project cost of 536 million U.S. dollars will be
financed with 336 million U.S. dollars from local governments. The
WB loan has a maturity of 20 years, with a five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumer Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and growing
personal incomes have helped drive up the China's consumer
confidence for the fifth consecutive month in May, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures that the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS) released here today, the consumer confidence index rose by 0.
4 points over April to 95.2 points in May, reaching the highest
level so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The consumer expectations index rose by 0.4 points over April
to 96.5 points in May. The index was 0.8 points higher than that
for March.
</P>
<P>
The May consumer contentment index was 93.2 points, up 0.5
points from April. The bureau said that the consumer contentment
index has shaken off the doldrums of lingering around the 92
points level for the past year, reflecting consumers perception of
the improvement of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The NBS said that consecutive monthly rises of the consumer
confidence index indicated that the consumers are increasingly
optimistic about their incomes and the economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the consumer confidence index is yet to
climb back to the 100-point level that it reached in December 1997.
It said that existing problems in the economy leave little room
for optimism over the growing momentum.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, so far the consumer confidence index has
indicated a steady performance of the economy in the next few
months.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- In the final document of its summit in Portugal on Tuesday,
the European Union (EU) sent a serious warning to Turkey, urging
the EU candidate to step up reforms in human rights, justice
systems and the laws.
</P>
<P>
The document gave no encouraging words for Turkey's membership,
contrary to the other candidates, saying that being a candidate,
Turkey has relaxed and slowed down its reforms required by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- It was found out that the Marmara fault line is not a single
piece, thus there is no possibility for an earthquake measuring
more than 7 on the Richter scale, which would devastate Turkey's
biggest city Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the survey was revealed by the Marmara Seismology
Center, which was drawing a complete map of the fault line under
the Marmara Sea with the support of a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization submarine.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Osman Ocalan, brother of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK) chieftain Abdullah (Apo) Ocalan, criticized on Tuesday the
imprisoned PKK leader for sending orders from the prison via his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Osman said that Apo, who had ordered to kill thousands of people
in the past, now simply wanted democratic activities so that he
would not lose his influence.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- In the wake of the sudden wave of cold weather across Turkey,
temperatures in some northern mountain areas dropped 3 to 15
degrees, resulting in snow in the regions Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tuvalu Not in Immediate Danger: NZ FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rising sea levels caused by global warming have swept over some
parts of Tuvalu's nine atolls, threatening to make thousands of
people homeless in the small Pacific Island state. Tuvalu's Prime
Minister,Ionatana Ionatana, has asked the New Zealand Government
to consider a proposal to resettle around 3,000 of his country's
population in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand foreign minister was quoted as saying there is
no evidence the coral atolls are "sinking beneath the waves" and
granting residency for Tuvaluans to come to New Zealand is not a
priority for the New Zealand Government.
</P>
<P>
"If Tuvalu is to become uninhabitable, then of course New
Zealand,Australia and the Pacific and other countries would come
to their assistance as we must," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the situation there is "nowhere near at crisis
point".
</P>
<P>
At present, Goff said, Tuvaluans can enter New Zealand on a
work permit scheme but cannot get permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
Tuvalu has a population of 10,500, according to the latest
reports.

<HEADLINE> Big Gas Field Found in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pohokura is the biggest field discovery in New Zealand for 30
years. Even at the early estimates it could extend New Zealand gas
supplies by seven to 10 years, but it could be twice as big as
first thought, the Wellington-based newspaper quoted some analysts
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Operator Fletcher Energy said tests at Pohokura-2 showed flows
of up to 30.7 million cubic feet of gas a day, plus about 2,670
barrels of gas condensate, which is worth as much as a barrel of
oil.
</P>
<P>
But the flow rate during weekend testing was limited by the
equipment on the drilling rig and could be five to 10 times higher.
</P>
<P>
"These test results are fantastic news, they will lead to a
very significant upgrade in the Pohokura reserve estimates," Chief
Executive Greig Gailey of Fletcher Energy said.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher Energy initially estimated a field of 430 billion
cubic feet of gas for Pohokura. But some analysts said the field
could hold more than 1,000 billion cubic feet of gas.
</P>
<P>
The flow rates reported Tuesday mean the gas would flow easily,
which may mean fewer wells would be needed to produce from the
field, cutting the cost of the development.
</P>
<P>
The field can be brought into production within two to three
years.

private-sector commitment to new science and technology policy
directions; and enable coordination of government science and
innovation policies and community activities at the highest level.

research and innovation requires partnership between the
government and the community with the SIAC acting as an
intermediary.

<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
barred about 216 more observers from non-governmental
organizations with links to Britain, church organizations and
trade unions to observe the weekend's parliamentary elections, The
Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy officials in Zimbabwe were also barred from
officially observing the elections. The government has already
barred 17 Kenyan and Nigerian observers who were apparently being
sponsored by Britain from observing the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Tuesday, Chairman of the National
Election Directorate Mariyawanda Nzuwah said diplomats or
representatives of foreign governments already accredited to
Zimbabwe would not be re- accredited as observers.
</P>
<P>
He said accredited diplomats or representatives of foreign
governments were free to move around but would not be accorded
privileges given to official observers.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said observers from the Zimbabwe Council
of Churches and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice in
Zimbabwe were barred from observing the elections because they
were foreigners.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 southern African observers sponsored by German
organizations were also barred.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has barred the British from observing
the polls because of the heightened tension between the two
countries over the land issue.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has launched the manifesto of the ruling National Resistance
Movement (NRM) eight days ahead of the referendum on political
systems to be held on June 29.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily reported Wednesday that the manifesto,
entitled "Why Uganda Still Needs the Movement System of
Government," has no radical departure from the previous stand on
"no-party" system that the ruling party has pursued since 1986
when it came to power.
</P>
<P>
The draft manifesto was passed by the National Executive
Committee on April 29 and edited by a committee chaired by former
Premier Kintu Musoke.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally Tuesday in the country's southwestern
Masaka region, the president also assured Rwandans living in
Uganda that they would not be persecuted because of the
misunderstanding between the Ugandan and Rwandan leaders, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda is not an enemy of Rwanda. The differences are between
leaders and we will find a way of resolving them," Museveni was
quoted as saying.

NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has said that the 10 Kenyans who were barred from observing
elections by the Zimbabwean government should blame themselves for
"the shame which has befallen on them."
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Wednesday quoted the
president as saying that the rejected observers, including
reporters and political activists, were neither sent by the Kenyan
government nor did they represent Kenya's interests.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has barred 10 Kenyans and seven Nigerians from
monitoring its parliamentary elections this weekend, accusing them
of secretly working for Britain, Harare's former colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the Kenyans were "guided by fantasy" and did not
consult with him for proper advice.
</P>
<P>
Their decision to go to Zimbabwe as election observers without
consultations with the Kenyan government was likely to depict
Kenya in bad light, Moi added.

<HEADLINE> China's Sea Route To West Asia Begins In Xuwen: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese archeologists
and historians have found Xuwen in south China's Guangdong
Province the starting point of a sea route to central and west
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The sea route that existed some 200 years earlier than the "
Silk Road" is now known as China's oldest trading link to Europe
and middle and west Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bojian, a renowned historian with the Guangdong Literary
and History Museum, said that Xuwen lies in the southern tip of
the Leizhou Peninsula and was officially designated as an entry
port during the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
A few other cities in Guangdong and Fujian provinces in south
China, including Quanzhou and Guangzhou, were considered as the
beginning of the marine trading route.

The earliest official trade fleet sent by the Chinese imperial
government during the Western Han started in Xuwen, according to
the "History of Former Han Dynasty".
</P>
<P>
This was also the time that Chinese silk reached ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the silk trade may have started a lot earlier than
what textual records tell us because a lot of trade was done by
individuals rather than officials.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe these sea routes may have been explored as
early as the Warring States Period (475-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
Boats leaving from Guangdong Province would have sailed
southwestward along the coastline to load goods or obtained
freshwater at ports in Guangdong Province before departing from
Xuwen to parts of west or south Asia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Help Siberian Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Twelve children in northeast China'
s Heilongjiang Province and a work unit have adopted Siberian
tigers in the city zoo.
</P>
<P>
The children pay only 500 yuan a year, and are free to visit
their companion any time, said the zoo operator.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mengyi bought several packets of milk powder for her new
companion with her pocket money and she gave the little creature a
new name "Liu Meng'er".
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are among the top-ten most endangered species
in the world, with only around 300 remaining in the wild. China
set up the Harbin Siberian Tiger Zoo in 1985, the largest
reproduction center in the world to save the tigers from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 there were only eight Siberian tigers. There are now
130.
</P>
<P>
According to the zoo keeper, every tiger consumes around 10 kg
of beef a day and the zoo has to spend more than eight million
yuan (960,000 U.S. dollars) a year to run. However, the zoo only
sells slightly more than six million yuan a year in entrance
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The situation will probably worsen as another 30 tigers are
expected to be born this year.
</P>
<P>
The help from the children and society will help alleviate the
problem, said the zoo keeper.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges U.S. to Substantially Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) urged the United States to substantially lift
sanctions against the DPRK, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, the U.S. administration decided to partially lift
sanctions against the DPRK, though it made public its willingness
to do so on September 17 last year, said a spokesman for the DPRK
Foreign Ministry in an interview with KCNA Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the spokesman said, the "act of trade with
hostile states" the U.S. had enforced for half a century -- after
defining the DPRK as an "enemy state" -- was abolished and
sanctions against the DPRK were partially eased.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest move by the U.S. will have a positive effect
on Washington high-level talks now under consideration between the
DPRK and the U.S. and the settlement of other outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"With a view to creating an atmosphere favorable for Washington
high-level talks on September 24 last year," the spokesman said, "
We announced a moratorium on a satellite launch while high-level
talks were under way."
</P>
<P>
Preparations are going on for the Washington high-level talks
and the moratorium still remains in force.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. should not confine itself to a
symbolic partial lifting of sanctions on trade and investment, but
completely renounce the policy hostile toward the DPRK and turn to
a total and substantial lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. honors the DPRK's sovereignty and free choice, and
sincerely works toward improving bilateral relations and the
principle of equality and reciprocity, the DPRK will move in good
faith and work to clear the U.S. of its worries," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China Building Ecological Shelterbelt along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
inject 100 billion yuan in the next 10 years to recover the once
high vegetation coverage rate of 48 percent along the Yangtze
River valley from the present 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the central government issued regulations that not a
single tree could be cut down in the area and began to help
lumberjackers find other means of making a living, said Shi Liren,
an engineer at the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
From the 1960s, the eco-system along the river has deteriorated
due to decreasing acreage of forests. As a result, 470 million
tons of silt along the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze
River has washed away annually.
</P>
<P>
To raise the vegetation coverage, more than 6 million hectares
of trees have been planted along the Yangtze River over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government encourages farmers to return farmland
to forests. In return, farmers can receive 2,250 kilograms of
grain, 750 yuan of seedlings and 300 yuan in living expenses for
each hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The government has begun such pilot work in 174 counties along
the Yangtze River and the Yellow River this year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs New Measures to Boost Export: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs to take new
measures to develop export-oriented infrastructure and stimulate
investments in the export sector to reclaim the double digit
growth rates it achieved in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express Wednesday quoted economist Mustafizur
Rahman as saying that Bangladesh's external sector was under
considerable strain due to a decelerated export growth in 1998-99
fiscal and the country needs a "dynamic export strategy" since
foreign aid disbursement remains on the slide.
</P>
<P>
Mustafizur Rahman, Research Director of the Center for Policy
Dialogue, said the importance of exports and trade for the
Bangladesh economy, relative to that of aid, has grown
considerably over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 total aid disbursement was 163.2% of total exports; in
1990 it was 118.8%; in 1999 it was 28.9%. In 1990 aid
disbursement was 5.9% of GDP and in 1999 it was 3.3%. In 1990
export was 5% of GDP and in 1999 it was 11.6%.
</P>
<P>
As the country is graduating from an essentially aid-receiving
nation to a trading nation, the government's steps and policies
are needed to be consolidated to face the future challenges under
the new global order, Rahman said in his analysis on Bangladesh's
external sector performance in fiscal 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past years, Bangladesh's policies have
tended to focus on exchange rate management and promotional
incentives as major instruments to boost exports and to stimulate
export sector diversification.
</P>
<P>
The taka had been devalued 18 times during the tenure of the
present government while the export sector received substantial
amounts of financial help in the form of subsidies and other forms
of assistance.
</P>
<P>
This assistance amounted to 131.3 million U.S. dollars in 1999-
2000. The new budget for 2000-2001 fiscal allocates another 126.4
million dollars towards this and proposed to cut duty rates for
intermediate and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the budget provides for a number of incentives to
stimulate non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
However, Rahman said, lack of adequate infrastructure
facilities, absence of infusion of technology and weakness in the
management in the export sector have severely constrained its
performance and move towards diversified base.
</P>
<P>
Narrow export base and lack of diversification of exports have
led to a situation where the fluctuating fortune of Bangladesh's
export sector has become overwhelmingly dependent on the
performance of the Ready-made Garment sector, which earns most of
the foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The research director pointed out that technology in the export
sector was becoming a key factor in terms of Bangladesh's
continued competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's low wage-based comparative advantage needs to be
translated into productivity-based comparative advantage and it is
here that technology comes to play a crucial role, he said.

CANBERRA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Melbourne, hosts of the 2006
Commonwealth Games, will bid for hosting the 2005 world swimming
championships.
</P>
<P>
Ron Bongetti, executive director of the Victoria State Swimming
association, said Wednesday the Australian Swimming Federation had
endorsed the bid.

<P>
Melbourne last year beat Olympic city Sydney to stage the
Australian leg of the World Cup short-course series for the next
five years.

<P>
When speaking of competition by other possible bidders,
Bongetti said he thought two successful world championships at the
west Australian city of Perth in 1991 and 1998 would help their
bid.
</P>
<P>
Bongetti said if the bid was successful, the championships
would be staged at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre where
an an outdoor 50m pool with a 10,000 seating capacity was being
built to stage the Commonwealth Games swimming events.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Boxing
Federation (IBF) elected a former Michigan boxing commissioner,
Hiawatha Knight, as its new president, the organization announced
in Newark, New Jersey on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Knight would be the first woman to head one of boxing's major
sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
Knight, a longtime IBF vice-president, has been interim
president since January, a month after IBF founder and president
Robert W. Lee resigned.
</P>
<P>
Lee is now in the second month of a racketeering trial in
federal court, accused with other IBF officials of taking 338,000
U.S. dollars to rig the organization's world rankings.
</P>
<P>
A retired gym teacher and high school coach, Knight was a
member of the Michigan State Athletic Boxing Commission from 1978
to 1988, the last eight years as chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
She was elected over the Memorial Day weekend last month at the
IBF annual convention, held this year in Acapulco, Mexico
</P>
<P>
The IBF members also elected Marian Muhammad, of Wilson, North
Carolina, as executive secretary and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
Knight had been a vice-president in the WBA, where Lee was also
an official in the 1970s. In 1983, he left to form the IBF, and
Knight left with him, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, Bhutan to Sign New Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and Bhutan are set to
sign a ten-year trade and cooperation agreement shortly, The Daily
Star newspaper quoted Lhatu Wangchuk, Bhutan's Ambassador to
Bangladesh as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new agreement will renew, broaden and strengthen the
existing commercial and trading arrangements between the two
neighbors," said the ambassador, adding that it is likely to
include two land transit routes and provisions for increasing
trading items and promoting tourism between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The existing agreement which was signed in 1980 and later
renewed for ten years will expire on September 7. The new
agreement will be similar to the existing one in content, but "
more comprehensive in nature," said Lhatu Wangchuk.
</P>
<P>
A high-level trade delegation from Thimpu is expected to arrive
in Dhaka early next month for talks and signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan's Foreign Minister Lyonpo Jigme Thinley who visited
Dhaka last month had expressed the optimism that the new agreement
would increase the volume of bilateral trade and people-to-people
interaction "to a great extent."
</P>
<P>
The landlocked kingdom is also expecting opening of a second
overland transit route to Bangladesh through India for easier and
more economic movement of its cargo.
</P>
<P>
The present transit route between the two countries lacks
necessary infrastrutural facilities like warehouse, electricity
and even telecommunication arrangements, Thinley said.

MOSCOW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- New Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov
Tuesday called on all Chechen people, regardless of their ethnic
origins and religious faith, to make joint efforts to reconstruct
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian media reported that during his inauguration ceremony in
Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest city, Kadyrov said that his
major task is to draw all Chechen people together and help them
forget their long time enmity.
</P>
<P>
Appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the head of a
new temporary civil administration eight days ago, Kadyrov
stressed that Chechnya would not enjoy stability and peace unless
local Chechen residents could return to their homes without
worrying about their safety.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped those Russian experts, including his opponents,
who had worked in Chechnya, would return to continue their work.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Kazantsev, Putin's representative to the North Caucasus
Federal District, said Tuesday that the use of military means
could not fully eradicate all illegal armed rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the new Chechen government to win over those who
have yet to decide whether to collude with former Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov and Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev,
or to become honest citizens.

Four Austrian economists shared the same view when interviewed

</P>
<P>
The ECB's governing council, a body which sets interest rates
for the 11-country euro zone, is scheduled to hold its regular
fortnightly meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Since there is no sign of the economy overheating in euro-zone
countries, the rate might remain on hold until September," said
Stefan Bruckbauer with Bank Austria. "But there is a possibility
that it could increase another half percentage point within 12
months."
</P>
<P>
Karla Schestauber, an economist from the Credit Bank of Austria,
said while the current inflationary level is moderate, interest
rates are expected to raise another quarter to half percentage
point in one year.
</P>
<P>
She said while the strong half-point rise and the recent
recovery in the euro has taken the pressure off the ECB, close
attention should be paid to consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
"If crude oil prices remain high after OPEC member countries
increase their output, then we can expect higher inflation rates,"
she said

The depots were found in a weapon search operation by the
British-led peacekeeping troops in the Drenica Valley region in
central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The search on Thursday followed renewed ethnic violence that
killed several Serbs and also targeted at the peacekeepers,
especially British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday, a KFOR spokesman said that the
ammunition hidden in the two bunkers was powerful enough to
destroy nearly a thousand tanks and all the Pristina citizens.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers were still clearing up the other two storages full of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Richard Shireff, commander of the British forces in Kosovo,
said that these weapons were "almost certainly, almost entirely"
hidden by the ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
He said that "all evidence we got here suggests that it is
former KLA material," adding that it looked that some weapons had
been recently removed.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military
agreement signed last June by the Yugoslav authorities and NATO
following the latter's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia, the KLA
should be disbanded and turn in all their weapons by September 19,
1999.
</P>
<P>
But with the West's connivance, the former illegal military
group was reorganized into the Kosovo protection force and handed
in only a fraction of their arms.

<HEADLINE> Food Output To Decline in Poland This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Poland Tuesday affirmed that its
total annual food yield this year will drop to 25.7 million tons,
10 percent less than that of last year, because of the drought
that started in April.
</P>
<P>
The production will continue to decline if weather conditions
do not improve, said the newly-appointed government official
dealing with problems resulting from the drought. Abnormal cold
waves occurred in the country in early spring, followed by a
persistent drought.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that emergency measures are being taken to attempt
to stabilize the food market.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of June, wheat prices jumped by 20 to 50
percent, and bread prices by 10 to 40 percent, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Food was imported tariff free and put on the market while
national food stock are also allotted to meet the domestic need.
</P>
<P>
Through these measures, the government plans to control the
price increases of flour and bread to around 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Leading Romanian Opposition Party Wins Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The largest opposition party in
Romania has won the second round of local elections, according to
official results released Tuesday Night.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democracy of Romania Party (PDSR) led by former
president Ion Iliescu (1990-1996) won 1,051 of the over 3,000
contested municipal positions, or 35.54 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
PDSR also obtained 11,380 town council seats, or 28.65 percent
of all council seats contested.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), a member of the governing coalition,
ranked second to PDSR in the number of town council seats it
obtained.
</P>
<P>
As a sharp contrast, President Emil Constantinescu's Christian
Democratic National Peasants' Party (CDNPP), which easily won
municipal elections in 1996, only managed 147 mayoral positions
and 2,767 town council seats this time.
</P>
<P>
The leading ruling party lost favor because it failed to lead
the country out of economic difficulties, while the collapse of a
mutual fund, which involved government officials and ruined many
small savers, also drove voters away, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The mayoral race in the capital may be the biggest upset for
the Christian Democrats. The close fight there was between the
candidates of PDSR and DP, leaving no ground for the previous
victor.
</P>
<P>
It was almost certain that the mayorship of Bucharest would
belong to PDSR candidate Sorin Oprescu, who earned 41 percent of
the first round ballots, against 17 percent of his DP rival Traian
Basescu.
</P>
<P>
However, Basescu, a highly popular outspoken transport minister,
surprisingly won the second round in a narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 parties and coalitions, together with more than 8,000
independent candidates, competed in the third local elections
since the ex-communist country's political upheaval in December
1989.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was 50.85 percent in the first round and 46.93 in
the second round.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experiences Hottest Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- This spring was the hottest on
record for the United States, said a National Climatic Data Center
report.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was received here Tuesday, said that the
temperature during the meteorological spring from March through
May averaged 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13.06 Celsius degrees)
throughout the United States, higher than the previous highest
record of 55.1 degrees Fahrenheit (12.83 Celsius degrees) set in
1910.
</P>
<P>
The center noted that the United States experienced the hottest
spring in 106 years of record-keeping, with every state in the
continent warmer than normal during the first season of the year
and Texas being the hottest on record.
</P>
<P>
This is "unusual," climatologist Jay Lawrimore of the data
center said, noting that ordinarily some states are above normal,
some near normal and some below.
</P>
<P>
The abnormal climate was partially caused by the phenomenon
that jet stream has been further north than normal for much of the
year, pushing cooling storms into Canada, Lawrimore explained.
</P>
<P>
And a continuation of abnormal temperatures and insufficient
precipitation are expected this summer, the center said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Ukraine to Deepen Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has urged Ukraine to speed up the pace of privatizing its banking
and energy sectors, according to media reports here.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that a visiting IMF working group met Ukrainian
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Yekhanurov Tuesday. In the
meeting, the IMF group presented Yekhanurov with a draft list
demanding economic restructuring in Ukraine. An IMF official also
said that the International Community was looking forward to a
stronger signal of reform from the Ukrainian Government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yekhanurov briefed the group about the
progress in implementing the budget and privatization in the first
half of this year. He expressed the willingness of the Ukrainian
Government to strengthen financial discipline and supervision
over the government spending.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Ukrainian Government can put forth its
views on the IMP-proposed reform steps before it signs an
agreement with the IMF group which will conclude the trip to
Ukraine on June 28. The IMF Board of Executive Directors will then
decide whether to resume loans to Ukraine on the basis of the
signed document.
</P>
<P>
Last September, IMF suspended the implementation of a loan
scheme under which it should extend 2.6 billion U.S. dollars to
Ukraine. IMP believed that Ukraine had misused the loans and given
a false report about its foreign exchange reserves. Up to now,
Ukraine has received only 965 million dollars of IMF loans since
September 1998 when the scheme was put into effect.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Census Results Unsatisfactory, OSCE Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said a census
initiated in March by the OSCE U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
failed to elicit satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
The plan for a census in Kosovo was announced by UNMIK chief
Bernard Kouchner in February and strongly criticized by the
Yugoslav government as an infringement upon Yugoslavia's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Only 460,000 ethnic Albanians
registered in the census, compared with 1.6 million recorded in
the previous 1991 census.
</P>
<P>
In the six northern districts of the province, only 88,000
residents registered for the census, including 100 Serbs, while no
gypsies were recorded at all, said the spokesman at a press
conference in Kosovo's northern city of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the 1991 census, the total
population of Kosovo was 1.96 million, with 1.6 million ethnic
Albanians and 194,000 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Many Kosovars escaped from their homes in the past two years,
especially during the 78-day NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia. Most of them returned after the war.
</P>
<P>
Since Mid-June in 1999, about 360,000 non-Albanians fled from
Kosovo in fear of attacks by Albanian extremists.

<HEADLINE> Project HOPE Offering Free Treatment to Chinese Gaucher Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A Gaucher patient from north
China's Hebei province has recently been sent to Beijing Children'
s Hospital to receive free medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The patient is believed to be the 23rd patient suffering from
the Gaucher Disease whose medical treatment are covered by Project
HOPE, a U.S.-based charity institution.
</P>
<P>
Gaucher Disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease
and the most common genetic disorder among Ashkenazi Jews. It
occurs one out of every 100,000 to 400,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Children suffering from the disease grow much slowly than
ordinary children with enlargement of liver and spleen. Patients
normally find it difficult to swallow and face language barrier.
</P>
<P>
Gaucher patients will have to take a kind of U.S.-made medicine
to survive at an annual cost of one million yuan (120,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shell Xue, program director of Beijing Representative Office of
Project HOPE, calls on Chinese doctors to report all Gaucher cases
to the office so as to make it possible for the patients to
receive free medical treatment from Project HOPE.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that China now probably has a total of 60
Gaucher Disease sufferers.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Businesses Show Great Interest in Photoelectronic Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The photoelectronic development
plan of Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, has
interested a great number of foreign companies including Ericsson,
ABB, Alcatel and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
Ake Fahlen, deputy president of Ericsson (China) Co. Ltd.,
believed that Wuhan, situated in the middle reaches of the mighty
Yangtze River, has technological advantages, and this central
Chinese city's plan to build a photoelectronic valley will mean
more chances to enhance their presence in China's market on the
part of his company.
</P>
<P>
Photoelectronics industries consist of information
photoelectronics industry -- optical fiber and cable, optical
apparatus, optical telecommunications equipment -- and energy
photoelectronics industry -- laser devices, laser processing
complete plants, laser medical equipment and gauging equipment.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan last month announced a plan to build itself into a
photoelectronic information industrial center with the annual
output value exceeding 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S.
dollars) in five years.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel set up a branch organization in Wuhan last year. Liu Shi,
who is responsible for Alcatel's operations in central China, said
obviously, Alcatel would not be willing to lose this fine
opportunity of joining China's photoelectronic industrial
development drive.
</P>
<P>
Ernst H. Behrens, President of Siemens China Co. Ltd., said he
would make a trip to Wuhan this month and hoped to sign agreements
of cooperation over projects regarding photoelectronic information
industry within the year.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Schaumann, President of ABB China Co. Ltd., was confident
of the prospects of Wuhan's photoelectronic development plan. He
told reporters that Wuhan is one of the Chinese cities his company,
which has been shifting from specializing production of heavy
industrial products to development of high-tech industries, will
choose in expanding its business in China. Previously, ABB has
participated in the construction of the Three Gorges Project and
the hydroelectric project on Qingjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Half of China's optical fiber demand is relied on imports, and
overseas companies also occupy 68 percent of China's optical
telecommunications apparatus market.
</P>
<P>
While listing projects like laser processing equipment, IP
Internet and equipment as areas where overseas investment and
advanced foreign technologies are most welcome, Vice Mayor Yuan
Shanla noted that Wuhan planned to invest 30 billion yuan (about 3.
61 billion U.S. dollars) in financing construction of
infrastructure and improvement of investment environment each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a loan
of 349 million U.S. dollars Tuesday to help improve air pollution
control and wastewater management in Beijing, the capital of China.
</P>
<P>
The bank's loan is also partially supplemented by a grant of 25
million dollars from the Global Environment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the most critical environmental issue for Beijing
's 12 million people is air pollution, with water pollution not
far behind.
</P>
<P>
To stop and reverse the environmental degradation, the Beijing
Municipal government has started a "clean air program." The bank-
supported "Second Beijing Environment Project" will add to the
government's efforts by helping to convert scattered coal-fire
boilers to natural gas boilers, promote energy conservation
heating systems, provide wastewater collection and treatment to
the entire Liangshi River basin, and strengthen environmental
management.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the project and other parallel actions would
help Beijing's air and water quality comply with guidelines of the
World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the overall project is 1.25 Billion dollars. The
World Bank's loan is being made at the bank's standard interest
rate for LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single currency loans, with a
maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

project to turn itself into a garden city in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Bao Xuding said that the project will focus on air
pollution in the urban area, treatment of industrial waste water,
and turning hillside fields into forested land along the Yangtze
River where the gigantic Three Gorges Reservoir will be located.
</P>
<P>
Bao said that the city will build two shelter forests which are
300 to 500 meters wide in the eastern and western urban zones.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, covering 82,000 square kilometers and with a
population of 30 million, only has an afforestated area of 23
percent, but the soil eroded area accounts for 63 percent of its
total land area, 25 percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
According to Bao, the city will in the next decade turn 180,000
hectares of hillside fields into forest and grassland, plant trees
on 370,000 hectares of barren hills, and bring 20,000 sq km of
soil erosion under control.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the project will help raise the city's forest
coverage rate to 36 percent, expand the area of nature reserves to
eight percent of its total land area and improve the urban air
quality. Some 50 percent of the city's total soil eroded area will
be harnessed, Bao said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Insurance Company to Initiate Joint Venture with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yasuda Fire and Marine
Insurance Company of Japan is making preparation to initiate a
joint venture with the state-run Myanma Insurance (MI) following
the signing of a memorandum of understanding between them in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Yasuda company is determined to channel its experience,
expertise and financial resources into Myanmar, the latest issue
of the local Myanmar Times journal quoted a statement of the
company as saying.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, which will be the first of its kind in
Myanmar, is likely to positively change the face of the industry
in the country to help develop the sector, the statement predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company, which has a financially strong
reinsurance system, has been arranging in preparatory gesture a
series of seminars in Myanmar and personnel training for the MI
staff at its headquarters in Tokyo, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
The Yasuda company operated in Yangon during the period 1958-64
and reopened a representative office in 1995 participating as a
reinsurer with the MI.
</P>
<P>
The company is liaising with the MI for all major types of
insurance except for marine hull, aviation and life, and has
signed a facultative obligatory reinsurance treaty with the MI for
motor vehicles insurance business written by MI in foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Yasuda, there are also two other Japanese
insurance companies, the Mitsui and the Tokio, which have signed
MOUs with the MI to set up similar joint ventures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at developing its insurance market following the
liberalization of its financial market and banking, Myanmar
enacted its first Insurance Business Law in June 1996, granting
local private companies as well as foreign investors to run
insurance business in the country which cover life insurance, fire
insurance, cash-in-safe insurance and fidelity insurance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law emphasizes that
foreign firms buy insurance policies compulsorily from the MI.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Restructure Military Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian parliament Tuesday
passed a 10-year program aimed at reconstructing the country's
military forces.
</P>
<P>
The program, to cost the government 123 billion forint (about
447.3 million U.S. dollars), will be carried out in three phases,
the Hungarian news agency MTI reported.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase extending to 2003, the Hungarian military
will determine its new commanding system, the structure and the
size of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The priority of the second phase will be put on upgrading the
equipment of the military, and improving the living standard of
the officers and men. After the second phase ends in 2006, Hungary
will concentrate on achieving technical modernization in the last
years of the 10-year program.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, Hungary will cut the size of its armed
forces from 61,000 to 45,000, and enroll more contract soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Analysis here said the reform will pave the way for Hungary's
military to join the framework of NATO's integrated defense, but
its cost could also produce some impact on the Hungarian economy
which has just begun to grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The E.coli toll may rise to 18 in
southern Ontario, Canada, as four more deaths have been brought
under investigation, Canadian health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old man from Walkerton and an elderly man in nearby
Hanover were among the four reported to be dead lately.
</P>
<P>
Canadian health authorities have confirmed seven E. coli deaths
since the killer disease was first reported in May in Walkerton, a
small farm town of nearly 5,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are yet to determine whether or not the other
reported deaths are linked to the worst outbreak of the infectious
disease in Canada's history.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 people have been stricken by the E. coli infection,
which causes diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
Authorities link the disease to contaminated water supply in
Walkerton, where residents are still being warned not to drink tap
water until they boil it.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Giovanni Lombardi celebrated
his 31st birthday on Tuesday with a second consecutive stage
victory at the Tour of Catalunya cycle race. The sixth stage was
a 163.9 kilometers run to the Pyrenean town of Prades in France.
</P>
<P>
The Telekom rider burst ahead of three rivals in the last 50
meters to win the stage.
</P>
<P>
A group of 15 riders made their definitive break from the
peloton.
</P>
<P>
The leading group was soon whittled down to four including
Russia's Pavel Tonkov, Lombardi and a pair of Spaniards, Oscar
Sevilla and Jose Luis Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
The chasing group of three -- Belgium's Axel Merckx, Denmark's
Bo Hamburger and Italy's Roberto Sgambelluri -- began to close the
gap but could not get any closer than 21 seconds to the leading
quartet by the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
Tonkov's fourth-place finish gives him the overall lead, with a
21-second advantage over Merckx and, with a tough day in the
mountains to come on Wednesday, he will start the penultimate
stage as the favourite to win the Tour.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Become Ceramics Trading Center in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin Municipality
has risen to become the biggest trading center of ceramics
products in north China, with an annual ceramics trading turnover
of more than five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven wholesale markets have been set up in the
municipality for trading of ceramics and other building materials.
The markets have attracted more than 800 ceramics producers from
14 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales of ceramics in the 800,000 sq. m. marketplace
already exceeds five billion yuan in total and over 1000 varieties
of ceramics products are traded here and transported to Beijing,
Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, northwestern and
northeastern China regions.
</P>
<P>
The active trading in the seven markets also brings the
uncultivated alkaline land and old warehouses into full use, while
four abandoned cargo docks in the city were also reconstructed to
meet the surging demand, which handle a total of 8,000 tons of
ceramics and other building materials daily at present.
</P>
<P>
The flourishing ceramics markets in the municipality are
bringing Tianjin closer to its goal to become the biggest trade
and commercial center in north China, municipal officials said.

<HEADLINE> E-business Faces Bottleneck in China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The development of E-business in
China is facing bottleneck problems stemming both from traditional
industry and new industry, according to Deng Shoupeng, an official
with the Development Research Center under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Deng told the annual convention of the Information
Infrastructure and Economic Development Research Center under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in this north China port city
that the first problem is that online payment is still not
available, because of security worries, and so most consumers buy
goods on the net but pay for them in cash, said Deng.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that E-business dealers in China need to
establish their reputations, said the official, and the government
will further regulate their operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes that information services and goods
distribution via the net will make progress along with the
development of market competition.
</P>
<P>
Authentication is a key factor in the further development of E-
business, said Deng, as it covers the fields of information
security, technology and product quality. So it must be conducted
under government supervision.

<HEADLINE> Banks to Offer More Services to West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), two of the
country's four State-owned commercial banks, announced they will
provide full support for the development of western regions.
</P>
<P>
CCB is to offer high-efficiency and all-around financial
services. "The bank will not only increase loan input, but also
provide more varieties of financial services," today's "China
Daily" quoted an unidentified official with the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank's local branches in western China had offered
additional loans of 12 billion yuan (1.45 billion US dollars) by
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"The CCB will give special support to such projects as highways,
railroads, airports, natural gas pipelines, power grids and
telecommunications," said the official.
</P>
<P>
"ICBC will pay special attention to the funding of
infrastructure projects such as transportation, telecommunications,
energy and water supply," said ICBC President Jiang Jianqing.
</P>
<P>
The bank will extend loan terms for projects which demand a
large amount of money and require a longer time for construction,
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also make it easier for infrastructural projects
to receive loans, he said.

<HEADLINE> Massive Water Project Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Water experts are dusting off one
of China's most ambitious blueprints to divert water from the
flood-prone Yangtze River basin to the thirsty north which suffers
from chronic drought.
</P>
<P>
"The project could be completed within the next six to eight
years if construction is kicked off in the 2001-2005 period, the
government's Tenth Five-Year Plan," today's "China Daily" quoted a
senior official with the Ministry of Water Resources as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest announcement on the proposed project since
1995 when 200 experts last discussed it.
</P>
<P>
Following nearly 50 years of research, the 100 billion yuan (12.
1 billion US dollars) project, designed to channel water from the
water-rich south to parched lands in the north and northwest, will
hopefully be turned into reality in the coming years,, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoliang, director of South-to-North Water Transfer
Planning and Design Administration under the ministry, confirmed
that the Yangtze River water will be channeled through three
alternate routes in the west, middle and east regions.
</P>
<P>
An outline on the overall planning of north China's water
resources is expected to be submitted to the central government by
the ministry this September, Zhang said, adding that "the
compendium can provide a basis for decision-makers in the Tenth
Five-Year Plan."
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited plan, a controversial one second only to the
on-going Three Gorges project, is becoming urgent with the ever-
worsening crisis of water resources in the north, particularly
after this spring's blanketing sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
It is also a must for China to support its development in the
arid and semi-arid western region, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Annually, about 1,000 billion cubic meters of water from the
Yangtze runs into the sea while the Yellow River continues to dry
up.

<HEADLINE> World Anti-Doping Agency Interested in Tour de France EPO Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) said on Tuesday Lausanne, Switzerland that the
organization would be interested in a test for detecting EPO which
is being developed for next month's Tour de France cycle race.
</P>
<P>
"If they (International Cycling Union) have got anything that's
reliable, we're more than willing to come along on their coat-
tails," said WADA chairman Dick Pound at the end of the agency's
first executive board meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The French say they have it and want to apply it during the
Tour de France. If they do and they're satisfied it works, from
an IOC (international Olympic Committee) perspective all we need
is some independent varification of that methodology. Then we
might have something."
</P>
<P>
The UCI announced last month it would take the risk and push
through plans to use a new drug test capable of detecting the
banned hormone erythropoietin (EPO) during cycling's showcase
event.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by a French research laboratory, is being
fast-tracked through a validation process the UCI admits is far
less stringent then IOC requirements, in order to have the
procedure in place for the Tour starting from Futursocope theme
park, near Poitiers, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The French test has already been published in the journal
Nature and the findings are being examined by a panel of three
independent experts, who are expected to report their findings to
the UCI on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While WADA has no direct discussions with the UCI about their
tests, the IOC has made no secret that it is also anxious to find
a reliable test before the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If they have something, our scientific people will be all over
them," said Pound. "Tell us how it works, what the results were.
</P>
<P>
"But that exchange goes on all the time, we're all looking for
something reliable," he added.

list commercials. Sites who fail to meet the standard set in terms
such as asset volume and staff qualifications will be prohibited
from listing advertisements, effectively cutting off the site's
main financial source.
</P>
<P>
A lack of Internet laws and regulations has made it difficult
to conduct effective supervision of on-line advertisements, which
has damaged consumers' rights by deceptive and fake ads, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the administration launched a trial
registration program in several major Chinese cities including
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. It encourages websites to
register their advertising business, which facilitates regular
checks on the ads content and mode of operation.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the new regulations are not just designed to
tighten supervision, but also to encourage regular commercial
practices.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Olympic Medal Hope Banned for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Weightlifting
Federation (IWF) has handed down a two-year ban on Nigeria's
Olympic women's medal hope Bilkisu Musa after she was tested
positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
National champion in the men's over 100 kg weight division Mike
Raleigh was also tested positive and faces the same ban.
</P>
<P>
Musa will now miss the Sydney Olympics, where women will for
the first time compete in weightlifting competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Traces of the banned anabolic steroids norandrosterone and
noretiocholanolone were found in Bilkisu Musa and Mike Raleigh's
urine samples collected after a pre-Olympic test event held in
March in Sydney," a statement from the IWF said.
</P>
<P>
Musa is the African women's champion in the over 75 kg category
and won a bronze at last year's world championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing news because she is one of our hopes for an
Olympic medal. But we have warned our lifters about not making
such mistakes," national weightlifting federation secretary Luke
Olushola said.
</P>
<P>
Musa and six other Nigerian women made a clean sweep of the 21
gold medals on offer at last year's All-Africa Games in
Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Violent Chaos Follow Lakers Win Of NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Xinhua) - The celebration of the Los
Angeles Lakers' victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night
for the NBA championship has turned to violent chaos in downtown
Los Angeles at midnight and early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people among thousands celebrating the Lakers' first
NBA championship in 12 years set two police cars ablaze and
destroyed two other vehicles, including a TV news van. Several
bonfires also were set.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they saw police, on foot and on horseback, use
rubber bullets and billy clubs to break up crowds as rioters
pelted them with bottles and set trash cans ablaze. Firemen trying
to extinguish a burning police car were struck with flying debris,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Police kept fans, reporters and players inside the new Staples
Center arena in downtown Los Angeles long after the game ended as
they waited for disturbances and bonfires outside the facility to
subside.
</P>
<P>
Lakers forward A.C. Green, one of those remaining at the
Staples Center, said through interview with TV reporters to Lakers
fans outside the Staples Center, "This is crazy. It's no way to
celebrate."
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey described
the disturbance as "very localized," and said there had not been
any widespread trouble either downtown or in other areas of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 people gathered outside Staples Center by the end
of the Lakers' 116-111 win over the Pacers, with nearly 20,000
more still inside. As violence erupted, fans still inside the
arena were kept there as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
The outside crowd was mostly peaceful until about an hour after
the game. Several fans began jumping on top of a limousine trying
to leave the area, then began smashing the windows of a sport
utility vehicle and a television news van parked outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
No serious injures were reported, and CBS live covering the
developments inside and outside the Staples Center showed many
fans remained in the area in the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
CBS also said so far there had been no reports on what caused
the fans into unreasonable chaos, since the Lakers won the NBA
championship.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Deploy Troops in Northern State to Prevent Riots Over Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Troops and riot police have been
deployed on the streets of Kano, the largest city in northern
Nigeria, to prevent violence when the Islamic law Sharia comes
into effect in Kano state Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources reached here on Tuesday, thousands of
people have been fleeing northern states of Kano and Kaduna in the
past days for fear of another clash between Christians and Muslims
over the controversial law, as an earlier one in February in
Kaduna which left nearly 1,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Banks in Kano, the capital of Kano state, said there had been a
massive withdrawal of deposits by customers leaving the state and
heading south.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Christian Association of Nigeria in Kano
earlier expressed shock over the incoming Sharia because the
organization had gained the impression in discussions with state
officials that Sharia law would not be implemented in Kano.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims in Kano had reportedly threatened a showdown if the
Sharia did not come into force on Wednesday as promised by state
governor Rabiu Kwankwaso last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Christians in the two states have voiced
concern that the implementation of Sharia would mean disaster to
the country.
</P>
<P>
They accused the Muslims of using the law to drive them out.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are two most popular and influential states in
the northern part of Nigeria. Unlike other northern states, which
are dominated by Muslim population, the two states have a large
Christian population.
</P>
<P>
Two other northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already
introduced Sharia into their criminal code earlier in the year
despite the opposition from the Christian dominated southern
states and the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Reaches Quarterfinals by Trouncing Germany 3-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BURSSELS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese, backed by three goals
from Sergio Conceicao, trounced Germany 3-0 in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands on Tuesday to qualify the quarterfinalsand send the
defending champion home.
</P>
<P>
Portugal roamed free in the defensive holes left by a team
once prided for its organization and won a perfect record of nine
points in Group A. It will play Turkey in Saturday's quarterfinal
in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
"It is not every day you score three goals in national colors,
" said Portuguese coach Humberto Coelho, congratulating the
standout performance of Sergio Conceicao.
</P>
<P>
Romania also advanced after it beat England 3-2. The Romanians
ended with four points ahead of England with three and Germany
with one.
</P>
<P>
A crisp three-men move of Portuguese substitutes totally
dislodged the defense in the 35th defense. The cross from Pauleta,
lobbed over goalie Oliver Kahn, only needed to be bounced off
Sergio Conceicao's head to land high in the nets. Kahn's desperate
challenge knocked the Lazio striker into a daze and instead of
celebrating, he was carried off on a stretcher. He came back on a
minute later for more.
</P>
<P>
In the 54th minute, Sergio Conceicao faked his way past
Dietmar Hamann and drilled his right-foot shot from 16 meters (
yards) almost through Kahn.
</P>
<P>
In the 69th minute, Sergio Conceicao was on the loose again on
the right and now, his left foot gave Kahn no chance.
</P>
<P>
The only time Germany came close to capture some bygone glory
came in the 30th minute when a five-man move set Marco Bode free
on the left, but his angled drive was stopped by the post.
</P>
<P>
The result stunned German coach Erich Ribbeck. "There was no
fighting spirit, so it was there for all to see what happened,"
Ribbeck said.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't work and I accept full responsibility," said
Ribbeck, who is expected to step down on as coach on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany did not play regular starters Christian Ziege, Jens
Jeremies and Markus Babbel, who were all injured.
</P>
<P>
Portugal left Luis Figo and many of its other big name players
out of Tuesday's match with Germany, safe in the knowledge that it
has won Group A regardless of the final game's result.
</P>
<P>
In a disastrous three games Germany lost to England 1-0 and
could only draw 1-1 with Romania.
</P>
<P>
It was also a sad end for Lothar Matthaeus in his 150th
international as the German supporters booed and whistled their
team's lumbering display.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel Continue Bargaining over Water Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish officials and a high-level
Israeli delegation held talks here Wednesday in a bid to finalize a
deal whereby Turkey would sell water to the water-scarce Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, which came to Turkey on Monday to
discuss purchasing water from the Manavgat river near the country's
Mediterranean port city of Antalya, visited water facilities on the
river before arriving in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Following the morning session of the meeting, Turkish Energy and
Water Resources Minister Cumhur Ersumer told reporters that he
expected details of the deal, including the price, to be settled
within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"After our talks, it is understood that an inter-governmental
agreement between Turkey and Israel may well be made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer said that Turkey would deliver the water at floating
loaders mounted off the coast at Manavgat and that the
transportation would then be handled by Israel.
</P>
<P>
If the sale goes ahead, it is believed that it would be the
first major commercial transaction involving water between two
countries in the Middle East, which sees its water resources
becoming increasingly scarce in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Besides Israel, Turkey has been holding talks on selling water
to Jordan, saying that water from the Manavgat river could make a "
peace bridge" between arid Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks focused on water price, which is considered
high by the Israeli side. Turkey has been asking for 23 cents per
cubic meter, but when transportation and purification costs are
included, the price rises to 55-60 cents.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is offering Israel water from the Manavgat river where it
has built a 147-million-U.S.-dollar water purification plant, with
a total capacity of 180 million cubic meters of fresh water a year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel wants to buy 50 million cubic meters
of water from Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Turkey's main regional ally, has shown solid interest in
the project, but has yet to take a final decision because of
domestic objections.
</P>
<P>
As the bargaining between the two sides continues in Ankara,
some conservative and religious circles in Israel reportedly are
opposing the plans to import water from Muslim Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the price of importation is almost equal to
that of desalinization of their own sea water.
</P>
<P>
Water-rich Turkey is trying to play a major role in "water
diplomacy" in the Mideast, where experts claimed that competing for
water resources could become a flashpoint in the future.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan, along with many other regional countries,
have been suffering from serious water shortages due to depleting
resources and an acute drought over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Leaves for State Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
left here Wednesday night for Beijing on a six-day state visit to
China, the first since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Khatami told reporters at Tehran international
airport that China enjoys an important position in Iran's foreign
policy, and that expanding friendly relations with China tops the
agenda of the Iranian government to develop ties with world
countries.
</P>
<P>
Calling Iran and China as two important countries in the world,
Khatami said that they can play an important role in the world, and
the expansion of their relations serves stability and development
in the Mideast regions and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"My visit to Beijing indicates that the two countries can
promote cooperation in political, economic, cultural and defense
fields," Khatami said, expressing hope that officials of the two
sides will reach consensus in more areas during his stay in China.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of ties between developing countries such as Iran and
China will contribute to the formation of a multipolar world
instead of a unipolar one, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is the third Iranian president to visit China since the
1979 Islamic revolution, following his predecessors Ali Khamenei,
now the supreme leader, and Hashemi Rafsanjani, now chairman of the
powerful arbitral and advisory State Expediency Council.

</P>
<P>
Both the U.N. Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH),
whose mandate now runs until June 19, 2001, and the SFOR were
established to carry out provisions of the U.S.-mediated 1995
accord signed in Dayton, Ohio, that ended nearly four years of
fighting during the breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian permanent representative to the United Nations,
Sergey Lavrov, said before the vote that his country was forced
not to participate in the Peace Implementation Conference in
Brussels in May because "further isolating and having a blockade
against Yugoslavia," a signatory to the Dayton accord, was illegal
and could have "serious consequences for the whole Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said that his country "has been one of the main
participants in the Bosnia settlement. While it is in the interest
of the continuing peace process to pass the resolution, the
Russian Federation cannot do so because Russian amendments have
not been taken on board."
</P>
<P>
Russia was "compelled not to participate in the Brussels
meeting of the Peace Implementation Conference because of the
discriminatory approach adopted towards the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, which has not been admitted although it was one of the
signatories to the accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Brussels meeting has been conducted in violation of the
Dayton Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told the Security Council that excluding Yugoslavia "does
not help peace."
</P>
<P>
"China has always supported the peace process in Bosnia and
Herzegovina," he said. "However, the text of the resolution still
contained elements supporting the ministerial meeting of the Peace
Implementation Conference in Brussels. As a signatory of the Peace
Agreement, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should have been
invited to that meeting."
</P>
<P>
The SFOR comprises troops from 19 NATO countries and 17 non-
NATO countries while the police force is drawn from more than 40
nations.

<HEADLINE> Italian Employers See National Economy Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's GDP will expand by 2.8
percent this year and in 2001, employment should climb by around 1
percent a year, inflation will settle at 2.4 percent in 2000 and
then dip to 1,9 percent next year, the latest economic forecast
out from Confindustria studies center said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the think tank of Confindustria, the Italian
industrial employers association, the gap in GDP growth between
Italy and its Euroland partners will shrink but still remain in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
This year GDP in Europe will climb by 3.5 percent and then slow
to 3 percent in 2001 while the gap with Italy, which over the past
two years had been more than a full percentage point, should be
reduced to half a percentage point in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, experts at the Confindustria studies center warned
that the factors which caused the erosion of Italy's
competitiveness over the past years and are at the root of the
negative trend in Italy's trade balance remain and need to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Italy's inflation, at 2.4 percent, also remains above the
Eurozone average of 2 percent although the gap has diminished sine
1999, when there was a 0.6 point difference, while in 2001
inflation in Italy should run at 1.9 percent compared to 1.7
percent in the Eurozone.
</P>
<P>
The close to 1 percent rise in employment, the Confindustria
said, was thanks to "the progress made, modest as it may have been,
towards greater flexibility. Employment is expected to rise also
in the poor South where the think tank said it saw "some signs of
activity in the manufacturing sector."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Confindustria said, the gap will remain
between the South and the rest of the country given that the
economic recovery is being fueled by higher exports which benefit
the center-north above all.

The German-Polish relationship at present is the best in 10
centuries, said Buzek, while Schroeder echoed that Poland could
count on its neighbor's help while it moved to the EU.

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn on Wednesday electronically launched the Global
Development learning Network (GDLN), a telecommunications network
that connects distance learning centers in cities across the globe.
</P>
<P>
"What we are participating in today is a result of
technological advances, and another example of globalization at
its best," Wolfensohn said at the launch, and added that "we are
using technology to ensure that everyone has equal access to
knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Via video conferencing, Wolfensohn was joined across many time
zones by leaders from 16 other countries, including China and
France.
</P>
<P>
"Using interactive video, electronic classrooms, satellite
communications and the Internet facilities to help break down the
digital divide, the Network allows people everywhere to share
their knowhow and experience, regardless of time-zones, distance
or national boundaries," the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
GDLN members, including governments, international, civil
society and private sector organizations, academia and research
institutions, joined to embrace the creation of GDLN and its
knowledge sharing capacity in support of sustainable development,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the GDLN is aimed to provide
decision-makers and agents of change with access to partners who
face similar challenges in other parts of the world, and harness
expertise in a wide variety of disciplines and connect knowledge
centers around the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the GDLN will enable people to learn in their home
environments without costly travel or work disruptions, the bank
said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Ruling Party Candidate Leads in Recent Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential candidate Francisco
Labastida has a slight advantage over his closest rival,
conservative National Action Party's standard-bearer Vicente Fox,
for the July 2 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The results of two independent probes published Wednesday in
the Mexican capital give ruling party candidate Labastida an
advantage of approximately three points.
</P>
<P>
The "Reuters/Zogby" poll gives Labastida 43.6 percent of the
votes, against 40.7 percent the candidate of the Alliance for
Change, Vicente Fox, would get.
</P>
<P>
A second polling made by the "Consultores y Marketing Politico"
polling group gives the PRI a 3.5 percent advantage, with 41.2
percent of the votes, against 37.7 percent for the Alliance for
Change.
</P>
<P>
Left-winger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Alliance for Mexico gets
14.5 percent in the  voting, and 18.4 percent in Consultores'.
</P>
<P>
The "Zogby" poll admits a margin of error of three percent,
which confirms that Fox and Labastida are running almost neck-to-
neck in the race for the presidency.

<HEADLINE> 56 Million Homes Worldwide Expected to Switch on Digital TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 56 million homes
around the world will be watching digital TV by the end of this
year, a U.S. market analyst firm reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 34.4 million homes worldwide were watching
digital TV, 77 percent using a direct-to-home satellite service,
21 percent cable and 2 percent terrestrial, according to Strategy
Analytics' report.
</P>
<P>
Competition from satellite operators is now forcing cable
operators to rapidly roll out digital services, particularly in
the United States, and cable is expected to have become the
leading provider of digital TV services by 2005, with a 55 percent
global share.
</P>
<P>
Terrestrial services continue to face a difficult future.
According to the report, limited capacity puts these operators in
a weak position relative to cable and satellite, and technical
difficulties with digital terrestrial television, particularly in
the U.S., are stalling market growth.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, consumers installed over 17 million digital set-
top boxes in order to access the new services. This year, the firm
said, global set-top box sales are forecast to reach 28 million
units. By 2005, annual sales are expected to have reached nearly
92 million units.
</P>
<P>
According to Strategy Analytics, the UK is now the world's most
advanced market, with an expected 29 percent of homes having
switched to digital, followed by the U.S. with 24 percent, and
France and Spain both with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leading digital TV operators in France, the UK and Denmark
are now offering interactive and online services such as e-mail,
home shopping and banking, and games, providing new competition
for PC-based Internet service providers, the report said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Leaders Move to Expand Cooperation, Plan Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States leaders at a regular summit here Wednesday made terms to
enhance the cooperation in the commonwealth and to speed up the
progress of establishing a common free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
CIS leaders approved a joint statement to support international
stability at a closed meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin's
press service told reporters after today's plenary session of the
CIS Council of Heads of State at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The CIS countries favor keeping the 1972 Soviet-U.S. Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty intact and inviolable, said the
statement,calling for making additional efforts to preserve the
treaty "through its strict and full compliance."
</P>
<P>
The treaty should remain "the foundation of global strategic
stability, international security and world peace," the CIS
leaders stressed.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Russia's ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty-II, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the 1997
package of agreements on ABM treaty, they urged the United States
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided to establish a CIS Anti-terrorist Center,
and Boris Mylnikov, first deputy chief of the Russian Federal
Security Service's (FSB) protection of the constitutional system
and anti-terrorist department, was appointed as chief of the CIS
Anti-terrorist Center at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the center is "a significant step forward
in combating religious extremism and terrorism in the post-Soviet
area,"Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The summit also adopted a document concerning the
implementation of the agreements on the creation of a free trade
zone in the CIS, said the Russian presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
The document sets as top priority measures the completion of
interstate export and import procedures within a year and a
transfer to indirect taxes to be levied in "the country where a
commodity is shipped."
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Prime Minister Vladimir Yermoshin, also chairman of
the Council of the CIS Prime Ministers, predicted that the free
trade zone within the CIS may be set up from January 1, 2002, as
the session has decided to solve all relevant procedural questions
in the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Russian Premier Mikhail Kasyanov told reporters that Russia
will complete negotiations with its CIS partners before the end of
the year on the problems involved in creating the free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Russia began talks with five CIS countries on preparing the
pertinent agreement in June and will speed up negotiations with
other CIS nations, because setting up a free trade zone is "one of
the key issues" in developing cooperation in the CIS, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CIS presidents agreed to hold an informal meeting on
August 18-19 in the Crimea peninsula and set next CIS summit for
late November or early December in Belarus capital of Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The CIS Council of Heads of State, the top power organ of the
commonwealth, holds two sessions annually.

Speaking at the welcoming luncheon hosted in London by China-
Britain Business Council, Wen said China is implementing the
strategy of large-scale development of China's west, which covers
more than half of the country's total land area.
</P>
<P>
"But in economic development, the west lags far behind other
parts of the country due to historical and other reasons," he said,
adding that the development of the western region will help the
coordinated development of local economy and sustained development
of China's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said the focus of such development was on building the
infrastructure, preserving the ecological environment and
promoting science, technology and education.
</P>
<P>
On China's economic development, the Chinese vice premier said
China has scored remarkable achievements in economic and social
development since the founding of the People's Republic of China
in 1949. "Never before had China enjoyed a growth in its economic
development and aggregate national strength as fast as in the past
20 years since the introduction of reform and opening-up."
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1999, China's gross domestic product (GDP)
increased 5.8 times with an average annual growth rate of 9.6
percent, making China the seventh largest economy in the world in
terms of economic aggregates and ensuring its people a relatively
comfortable life in general, he said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
Wen noted China is a developing country and the situation it
now faces is economic globalization and the increasingly rapid
development of science and technology in the world. "We must seize
the opportunities and speed up our development to keep up with the
trends of the times."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also said economic restructuring would
be China's main task in seeking economic development and China
would depend on the progress in science and technology,education
and the development of human resources for our economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Chinese government would press ahead with
reform, gradually improve the socialist market economy and open
wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
On China-UK relations, the Chinese vice premier said in recent
years, the exchange of visits by the heads of government of the
two countries, and particularly Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
successful visit to Britain, have greatly promoted the exchanges
and cooperation between the two governments and peoples.
</P>
<P>
The China-UK friendly relations have reached a new stage of all-
round development, and their exchanges and cooperation in the
economic, scientific, technological, cultural and other fields
have entered a new dynamic era, with UK becoming China's second
largest trading partner among the European countries,he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier arrived here on Tuesday for a six-day
official visit to Britain. He will also visit Switzerland and
attend the World Summit of Social Development and Beyond:Achieving
Social Development for All in a Globalized World, a special
session of the U.N. General Assembly to be held in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Northern State Celebrates Adoption of Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Muslims
Wednesday celebrated the adoption of Sharia, the Islamic law, in
Nigeria's most populous northern state of Kano.
</P>
<P>
People began gathering from dawn, chanting Islamic slogans and
the dusty streets of Kano city, capital of the state, were
congested with exciting young Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Kano Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso said on Wednesday that although
Sharia had been adopted, its actual implementation would not begin
for several months whilst the necessary structures were put in
place.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Sharia said it will bring peace to Kano and force
corrupt politicians to reform their ways, but in the eyes of
Christians, Muslims are using the law to drive them out. They
threatened that the implementation of Sharia would mean disaster
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the authorities have given assurances that Sharia will
not apply to non- Muslims, many Christians still abandoned Kano
city, which has a history of religious violence.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have been fleeing the state in the past few
days for fear of another clash between Christians and Muslims over
the controversial law, as an earlier one in February in Kaduna,
another major northern state, left nearly 1,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Many shops in the Kano state have been boarded up and banks
seen a massive withdrawal of deposits by customers leaving the
state and heading south.
</P>
<P>
Troops and riot police have been deployed on the streets of
Kano. A local garrison officer had vowed earlier that his soldiers
would use violent equipment against violent actions.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are two most popular and influential states in
north Nigeria. Unlike other northern states, which are dominated
by Muslim population, the two states have a large Christian
population.
</P>
<P>
Two other northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already
introduced Sharia into their criminal code earlier in the year
despite opposition from the Christian dominated southern states
and the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Ranks as Africa's Most Competitive Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia ranks as the most
competitive nation in Africa in the World Economic Forum's (WEF)
latest competitiveness report for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The report was released on the first day of the three-day WEF's
Southern African Economic Summit in Durban, South Africa, on
Wednesday. The summit is being attended by more than 800 political
and business leaders from African and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Madagascar, which enters the list of over 30 countries for the
first time, is in the last place while Kenya slipped eight places
to 22nd position.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the top performer two
years ago, was rated the second most competitive state.
</P>
<P>
Botswana remained in the third position, followed by Namibia,
Morocco and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, widely viewed as the economic powerhouse of the
sub- Saharan Africa, is listed the seventh most competitive
nation, while Zimbabwe fell two positions in the latest ratings to
second from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was rated the most improved country, followed by
Morocco and Mozambique, while Nigeria topped the optimism index,
followed by Tanzania and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Schwab, president of the WEF, said while economic growth
had been experienced in many African countries and in the region
as a whole, news from much of Africa was bleaker than two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The shocking extent of the AIDS epidemic has become clearer.
Africa is now home to around two-thirds of the HIV infected
individuals in the world," the report stated.
</P>
<P>
"Civil strife also continues to ravage the region, from
Ethiopia and Eritrea, through the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, and on to Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Political unrest grips several countries such as Zimbabwe, and
this unrest translates strongly into a decline of international
competitiveness in those countries," it noted.
</P>
<P>
A piece of good news, it added, was the progress in debt relief
for the highly indebted poor countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
"While the main creditors can't quite bring themselves to the
obvious step of debt cancellation, they have all acknowledged the
eventual need to write off the unpayable debts.
</P>
<P>
"When this happens, it will mark an important financial turning
point for sub-Saharan Africa," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was aimed at opening African horizons to global
decision- makers and stimulating debate on economic reforms in
African countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Re-take Strategic Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone rebels have re-taken
the strategic town of Lunsar from pro-government forces, according
to a report from the war-torn West African country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U.N. military spokesman Lieutenant Commander
Patrick Coker as saying in the capital Freetown that "the
information we have is that Lunsar is under the control of the
Revolutionary United Front."
</P>
<P>
Lunsar is located about 80 kilometers northeast of Freetown on
a major highway leading from the capital to the rebel-held town of
Makeni and the rest of the diamond-rich east.
</P>
<P>
According to Coker, the pro-government forces, which took the
town on June 7, appeared to have pulled out without any fight
with the rebels, after a dispute between different factions of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The loss of control of Lunsar may present a serious setback for
the efforts by the pro-government forces to push the rebels
further away from Freetown, international observers said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Oil Output Rise Not To Affect Prices: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ecuador exports some 280,000 barrels of crude every day,
especially to the United States, where the price of the West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) oil has fluctuated in the last weeks between
30 and 32 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian oil maintains a supply with a price of five
dollars below the WTI quotation to improve its sale in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports are the main income source for Ecuador and
represents more than 30 percent of the financing of its state
general budget.
</P>
<P>
Leading oil producers Wednesday agreed to raise their output
ceiling to 25.4 million barrels per day from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the accord amounted to an increase of 708,000
barrels per day, but taking into account current over-production
would only supply an extra 191,000 barrels.

<HEADLINE> Security Council, ECOWAS Condemn Rebel Detention of U.N. Soldiers in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
and the Economic Community of the West African Countries (ECOWAS)
here Wednesday voiced their condemnation of the rebel's "continued
detention" of U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, and demanded the
"immediate and unconditional release of all United Nations
personnel detained or surrounded."
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was contained in a joint statement read to
the press by the president of the Security Council, Jean-David
Levitte, at the end of the day-long meeting with an ECOWAS
delegation behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS delegation, which groups six West African foreign
ministers representing the ECOWAS Mediation and Security Council
Committee, was headed by Malian Foreign Minister Modibo Sidibe.
</P>
<P>
"Council members and the ECOWAS Committee condemned the
continued detention by the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) of
United Nations peacekeepers of the Indian contingent" in Sierra
Leone, and "the denial of freedom of movement to a large number of
other United Nations personnel in the east of the country," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all
United Nations personnel detained or surrounded," and "called upon
all the leaders in the region to ensure this is brought about
speedily," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL,
currently has some 12,400 peacekeepers in the West African country.
In May, the Security Council increased UNAMSIL's authorized
strength to 13,000 from 11,100.
</P>
<P>
A group of 21 Indian peacekeepers are still being held hostage
by RUF, which has another contingent of more than 230 U.N.
personnel surrounded in the eastern diamond town of Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
"It was the common position of members of the Security Council
and members of the ECOWAS delegation that the terms of the Lome
Agreement have been flouted by the violation of the cease-fire,
the attacks on UNAMSIL and the taking of hostages," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of appropriate inquiries, those identified as
responsible should be brought to justice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued as Sierra Leone has asked the United
Nations to set up a special court to try the RUF leader, Foday
Sankoh, and other rebels for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, currently in the Government custody, was arrested on
May 17 with members of the RUF after his fighters attacked U.N.
peacekeepers, took hundreds hostage and marched on the capital of
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Their action breached the 1999 Lome Agreement which granted
Sankoh and everyone else involved in the eight-year civil war an
amnesty for past atrocities which included the deliberate severing
of the limbs of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Members of the Security Council and the ECOWAS
delegation expressed their concern about the humanitarian
situation in Sierra Leone and called upon all parties to ensure
safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those in
need in Sierra Leone, in particular the refugees and displaced
persons, women and children," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They called upon all States, international and other
organizations to provide urgent and substantial humanitarian
assistance to the people of Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the ECOWAS delegation look to the United
Nations to continue providing the Government of Sierra Leone with
the necessary assistance to restore law and order in the country
and resuming security control throughout the territory," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, the Malian foreign minister said that
he hoped that the United Nations would offer necessary resources
to West African countries, which are ready to contribute their
troops to the single UNAMSIL, for the restoration of peace and
security in Sierra Leone.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wen
Jiabao met here on Wednesday with Britain's Secretary of State for
International Development Clare Short and they discussed issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier briefed the British secretary on the
achievements China has made in poverty alleviation in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government attaches importance to poverty
alleviation. In 1978, the population living in poverty in the
rural areas reached 250 million, accounting for 30 percent of the
total population. After 20 years of hard struggle, the population
living in poverty has reduced to 34 million, only accounting for 3.
7 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Short said the international communities should exert more
joint efforts to poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Without China's participation and efforts, the global object of
alleviating poverty could not be reached, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier arrived here on Tuesday for a six-day
official visit to Britain. He will also visit Switzerland and
attend the World Summit of Social Development and Beyond:Achieving
Social Development for All in a Globalized World, a special
session of the U.N. General Assembly to be held in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Passes Year 2001 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet Wednesday
afternoon passed Finance Minister Hans Eichel's year 2001 budget
that aimed to sharply cut state deficit by sparing the social
welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
The bill plans a total spending of 478.7 billion marks (230
billion U.S.dollars), 100 million marks less than that of year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The biggest cut lies in jobless help that was directly paid by
the government. Berlin plans to pay 21.1 billion marks as
unemployment help, 1.1 billion less than this year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's annual deficit will be lowered by 3.4 billion marks
to 46.1 billion in year 2001. And Germany will approach a"balanced
budget" in year 2004, when the new state debts will be cut to 20
billion.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, 15.4 billion marks will be allocated for
education and research, a 5.3-percent jump from this year's level.
</P>
<P>
The government will pay more for colleges and research
projects in biological technology, molecular medicine, and
information technology, said the bill.
</P>
<P>
Germany's defense budget will increase, too, said the bill.
Firstly because of its forces' deployment in the Balkan region,
Berlin will pay 46.8 billion marks for defense, or 3.2 percent
more than that of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The support of cabinet members for that bill meant the red-
green coalition cabinet under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had
passed a "critical round", a government spokesman said after the
cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
The bill, a key step in the sweeping financial reform plan of
Schroeder and Eichel, will be sent to the parliament for vote this
Autumn, he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Different Attitudes Toward Online Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Americans currently account
for half of the world's 50 million online banking customers, but
they are relatively lukewarm in adopting the services, according
to a global survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 21 percent of American Internet users described
themselves as "very likely" to bank online in the next 12 months,
while the world's most enthusiastic Internet bankers are in South
Africa with 46 percent of Web users saying so, Germany with 42
percent and Sweden with 33 percent. Least enthusiastic are those
in Egypt and Russia, with 2 percent each.
</P>
<P>
The survey of online banking and trading intentions was
conducted by U.S. research company Augus Reid Group in November
and December 1999 and January 2000. The findings were based on
more than 28,000 interviews with Internet users in 30 countries
and general consumers in 34 countries.
</P>
<P>
While Americans appear to have been slower to adopt online
banking, the firm said, this could be a result of the wide range
of delivery options open to them.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found a somewhat more moderate attraction to
online stock trading and other Internet-based investing services.
About one in 10 American Internet users say they are "very likely"
to trade or make other investments online in the near future. The
figure was similar in Canada, while Internet users in South Korea,
18 percent, Singapore 14 percent, and Germany, 14 percent, ranked
highest among the countries surveyed.

<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns U.S. It May Pull Out of Medium-Range Missile Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military officer
warned here Wednesday that his country may withdraw from the
Medium-Range Missile Treaty and resume the development of medium
and medium-short range missiles If the U.S. builds missile defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
Russia will strongly react to the deployment of the U.S.
national missile defense (NMD) system, said Col. Gen. Vladimir
Yakovlev,Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Strategic Missile Force
(SMF) at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The step (Russia's pullout of the Medium-Range Missile Treaty)
is possible as part of Moscow's asymmetrical response to
Washington's withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has the technological potential for developing a medium
and theater missile group. It's very simple because their
production is a component of the existing production of missile
carriers," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
"The production of such missiles will come much cheaper than
that of intercontinental ballistic missiles," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that it is necessary to unite Russia's
nuclear triad of land, sea and air components under one command
for rapid and effective reaction to possible steps by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"This issue has already been coordinated: all the necessary
scientific, economic, military and technical grounds have been
prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the third and next SMF regiment equipped with ten of
the newest intercontinental ballistic Topol-M missiles will enter
combat duty in 2000, Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
The first two such missile regiments have come into combat duty
respectively in 1998 and 1999, he added.
