Court Keeps Elian in U.S. For Now
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Chastising the government for ignoring the wishes of a
6-year-old boy, a federal appeals panel on Wednesday ordered that Elian Gonzalez
must remain in the United States until the court decides whether he should get
an asylum hearing. The court action, extending an earlier stay granted by one of
the judges, marked the latest in a series of victories for Elian's Miami
relatives, who have been battling his Cuban father in an international
tug-of-war over the child. The order, however, does not prevent the government
from reuniting father and son in the United States.

   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- On a day of sad memories, President Clinton today knelt
among 168 empty chairs memorializing each victim of the Oklahoma City bombing
and declared the site ''sacred ground'' in the soul of America. Five years after
the deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history, Clinton helped dedicate the
Oklahoma City National Memorial at the site where a bomb ripped off the face of
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 19 children and 149 men and
women.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco will test-market a reduced-smoke
cigarette with advertising that for the first time claims it is safer than other
cigarettes. At its annual meeting Wednesday in Winston-Salem, N.C., the nation's
second-largest cigarette-maker called its Eclipse brand ''a cigarette that
responds to concerns about certain smoking-related illnesses.'' Eclipse, which
heats instead of burns the tobacco, lowers smokers' risk of cancer, chronic
bronchitis and possibly emphysema, according to the company's testing.

At Least 9 Columbine Suits Filed

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A police sharpshooter was refused permission to shoot
Columbine High School gunman Dylan Klebold through a library window during the
rampage, a lawsuit alleged Wednesday. A second lawsuit alleged one student was
killed by police gunfire. The lawsuits were among at least nine that have been
filed against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department alleging deputies
mishandled the rescue and ignored advance warnings of the attack. The lawsuits
were filed one day before the anniversary of the April 20, 1999, attack in which
Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded about two
dozen before they committed suicide.

U.S. Prison Population at New High
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of imprisoned American adults hit a record high
of 1.86 million, the Justice Department said today. With this latest increase of
nearly 60,000 prisoners, the United States may have matched or even surpassed
Russia as the country with the highest rate of incarceration. As of June 1999,
prisons and jails held 1,860,520 people, according to a Bureau of Justice
Statistics report. That's an increase of more than a million people since 1985,
when the figure was less 800,000. Last year's total included more than 1.1
million state prisoners, about 606,000 men and women in local jails, and about
118,000 federal inmates.

Crash Follows Call for 737 Redesign
</SUBHEAD>

   SAMAL, Philippines (AP) -- Wednesday's crash of an Air Philippines Boeing 737
comes days after a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration panel recommended
redesign of the rudder assembly of the jetliner. The 737 rudder system, which
controls left-right movement of the plane, came under close scrutiny after the
crash of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1994, which killed all 132
people aboard. The Davao-city bound flight was carrying 131 passengers when it
crashed early Wednesday in what was the Philippines' worst air disaster. The

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party leaders says Bush can't make dinner  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush won't attend the
Conservative Party's May 17 fund-raising dinner in New York City
where he was to have been the main speaker, but the head of the
third party says he's gotten a rain check.
</P>
<P>
   State party Chairman Michael Long said Wednesday that the
development was the result of a scheduling conflict and not the
rift between Long and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Bush's
favored candidate in the New York Senate race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has nothing to do with the Senate thing,'' Long said after
several telephone conversations with top Bush adviser Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   And, Long said, Rove has assured him that Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, would instead attend a
Conservative Party event in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are considering a later date. We're taking a look at the
schedule,'' Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said when asked
about the governor's inability to attend the May 17 dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Long is courting Giuliani alternatives to run on the
Conservative Party line in large part because the mayor is an
abortion rights supporter. No Republican has won statewide office
in New York without Conservative Party backing since 1974. On
Tuesday, Long and millionaire New York philanthropist Virginia
Gilder said they were in discussions about a possible Senate run by
her.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, Long had announced that Bush was coming to
the May 17 dinner only to have aides to the Texas governor say that
while the invitation was under consideration, no decision had been
made on attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Long sent out 12,000 invitations to the party's
annual fund-raising dinner listing Bush as the guest speaker. The
party leader said Wednesday he must now decide whether to postpone
the event until Bush can make it or go ahead with a Bush surrogate
for the dinner and plan a separate event with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is a legitimate screw-up,'' Long said. ''He's going
to be on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the Conservative Party dinner presents several
problems. In addition to helping raise money that could then be
used by the Conservative Party to help a candidate who could hurt
Giuliani, the Conservative Party dinner comes at a time when Bush
is seeking to move toward the political middle as he prepares for
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Long said none of that will keep Bush away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a firm commitment,'' he said. ''They will come in here
for me, for the Conservative Party, in either June or July.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's coming in because he wants our endorsement, he wants to
be on our (ballot) line and I play hardball,'' the party chairman
added.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also run on third-party ballot lines and add the votes up.
</P>
<P>
   Not having the Conservative Party line could make things even
tougher for Bush in New York than they already are. Democrats enjoy
a 5-3 edge in enrollment and no GOP presidential contender has
carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. In fact,
some GOP strategists have said they don't expect Bush to even
contest New York. The Bush camp denies that.

<HEADLINE> Budget to include funding for farm energy aid, barn preservation  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Farmers will get some relief from the recent
hikes in energy costs under a new program that state legislators
have agreed to include in the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million Farm Energy Assistance Program would help offset
rising gas, diesel and electricity costs farmers have to pay to
keep farms running, said state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann,
chairwoman of her chamber's agriculture committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers don't have the luxury of being able to milk in
off-peak hours. Cows have a regular schedule,'' said Hoffmann, a
Syracuse-area Republican and beef cattle farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, eligible farmers will be able to submit
their energy bills to the state and receive a percentage of their
payment back. Specific eligibility requirements and the exact
percentage to be refunded are still being worked out, but Hoffmann
said that for large farms, ''that could mean many hundreds of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Energy and Research Development Authority will
administer the funds in conjunction with the state Department of
Agriculture and Markets. The aid will take effect in May and
farmers will receive quarterly checks. If the program is
successful, Hoffmann said she expects the program to continue in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture and
Markets, said high energy prices come at an especially bad time as
the spring planting season begins. Most of the trucks and tractors
run on diesel fuel and ''they suck up a lot of fuel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers are even harder hit, he said, because milk prices
are extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   ''Income is a third of what it was six months ago and now their
fuel costs twice as much. I'm certain that the math is not on their
side,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also have to pay for transporting their goods, meaning
more dollars spent on fuel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coventry Transport Services, which hauls milk for dairy farmers
in upstate New York, has added about 10 cents per 100 pounds of
milk in surcharges to its customers since January to cover rising
fuel costs, owner Tom Tripple said. The company, based in Chenango
County, had previously charged farmers $1 for every 100 pounds of
milk transported.
</P>
<P>
   Tripple said an average-size farm transports about 10,000 pounds
of milk every two days.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reed of the New York Farm Bureau said it's too early to
tell what impact the program will have on farmers, but added,
''Anything to help farmers is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   The new budget would also include $3 million for a new Historic
Barn Preservation Program, Hoffmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide financial aid mostly to farmers who
are making structural repairs on old dairy barns that are a part of
the rural New York landscape. The barns, which used to store hay on
top and house cattle below, can no longer accommodate new farming
technology, but Hoffmann said they should still be preserved for
their historic and tourism value. While many programs exist for
preserving historical districts in urban areas, ''rarely has there
been a program designed to do something in the historic
preservation vein in rural areas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These barns are like cathedrals. They're built by craftsmen
with ingenuity ... long before there were cranes,'' she said.
''They have an incredible amount of history embedded within them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann said with farmers already struggling to make ends meet,
many don't have the resources to make capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide funds to eligible farmers under a
cost-sharing structure and the renovated barn could be reused for
agricultural purposes. A point system will be established to
determine eligibility, Hoffmann said. That system would take into
account the barn's historic value, architectural uniqueness,
vulnerability to the effects of weather and proximity to other
tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
and the Department of Agriculture and Markets will oversee the
program.
</P>
<P>
   New York's budget, for the fiscal year that began April 1, is
late for the 16th straight year. On Wednesday, state lawmakers
began what amounts to a 10-day spring vacation. Despite not having
completed work on the state budget, they aren't due back at the
state Capitol until May 1.

<HEADLINE> Leaders and governor fail to finalize agreement on budget  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki and the state
Legislature's top Democrat were on the verge of announcing a
tentative agreement for a new state budget until the devil in the
details got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   New York's budget, for the state fiscal year that began April 1,
is late for the 16th straight year.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of activity, Pataki's office announced the governor
would hold a Wednesday morning news conference on the budget. State
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver scheduled his own news conference
to follow the governor's, also to talk about the tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But just before the scheduled 10 a.m. start of the governor's
event, it was postponded, as was Silver's. Later, both news
conferences were canceled. Republican Pataki flew off to the
Southern Tier to announce that Nucor Corp. would build a $50
million steel plant in Chemung and create 300 jobs. Democrat Silver
left for the Jewish Passover celebrations that began at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the tentative agreement had appeared set after
legislative leaders agreed with the governor on a package to reform
New York's borrowing practices. The plan called for adoption of a
state constitutional amendment that would limit how much debt the
state could take on.
</P>
<P>
   But in drafting the language for the agreement, snags developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start and you stop. You start and you stop,'' state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Republican, told Albany's WROW-AM
radio.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, state lawmakers began what amounts to a 10-day
spring vacation. Despite not having completed work on the state
budget, they aren't due back at the state Capitol until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of legislation adopted at the end of 1998, lawmakers
aren't getting their paychecks until the new budget is adopted.
Last year, the paycheck suspension lasted until Aug. 4 when the
budget was finally approved. The base salary for New York's
lawmakers is $79,500 a year, although most receive extra pay for
committee work or other duties. They get the paychecks they missed
once the new budget is approved. They missed their first checks on
Wednesday of last week because of the pay suspension law. Their
next payday is April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving town, lawmakers passed a temporary bill to keep
state government operating and other checks flowing through April
30.

<HEADLINE> New York's lieutenant governor divorced  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After more than 15 years of marriage, Lt.
Gov. Mary Donohue and her second husband have divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor's chief of staff, Eileen Long, said
Wednesday that the uncontested divorce was granted April 6 and was
based on an earlier separation agreement. Donohue's first marriage
also ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor and Troy attorney Brian Donohue have
been separated since January of last year when state police
responded to what they said was an emergency 911 call about ''an
active domestic dispute'' at the couple's rural Brunswick home
outside Troy. Police said the dispute had been resolved by the time
they arrived at the home.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor subsequently moved into a house in Troy
and is now renting a house in Brunswick. She has a 21-year-old
daughter from her first marriage and a 12-year-old son from her
second marriage. The Donohues share joint custody of their son.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Donohue and the future lieutenant governor met when they
were both students at Albany Law School. They were married in 1984,
a year after they graduated. Their fathers were both prominent
judges in Troy, which is just a few miles north of Albany and
across the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor is a former state Supreme Court justice
and former Rensselaer County district attorney. As district
attorney from 1993-96, Donohue made domestic violence a priority of
her office.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Donohue was selected by Pataki to become his running mate
after he had a very public falling out with then-Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross. McCaughey Ross eventually switched parties and
after losing a Democratic primary for governor in 1998 stayed in
the race against Pataki as the Liberal Party's candidate. Pataki
easily won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross is in the midst of divorce proceedings against
Wall Street financier Wilbur Ross. Her first marriage ended in
divorce.

<HEADLINE> Va. Child Stabbed in Front of Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy was stabbed to death
Wednesday while playing with other children in front of his
great-grandmother's home in what police described as a random
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The great-grandmother and another woman also were stabbed while
trying to help the boy before the suspect, a man in his 20s, fled.
He remained at large Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Shifflett was killed in an ''apparently random attack,''
police Lt. John Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know the suspect's identity, the motive or if the
child and his assailant knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old woman who tried to help was hospitalized in
guarded but stable condition at Washington Hospital Center. The
great-grandmother, 80, suffered cuts to her hand and was at
Alexandria Hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening.
The identities of both were withheld.

<HEADLINE> Court Keeps Elian in U.S. For Now  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Chastising the government for ignoring the wishes
of a 6-year-old boy, a federal appeals panel on Wednesday ordered
that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States until the
court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court action, extending an earlier stay granted by one of
the judges, marked the latest in a series of victories for Elian's
Miami relatives, who have been battling his Cuban father in an
international tug-of-war over the child. The order, however, does
not prevent the government from reuniting father and son in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, a tense vigil quickly became a celebration,
with people dancing, crying and chanting ''God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Gonzalez family continues to believe in the laws of the
United States,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who so
publicly defied Attorney General Janet Reno's demand to turn the
boy over last week after his custody was revoked. ''We will
continue to pray ... that (Elian) may remain where his mother
wanted him to be, in the life of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian played on his beloved swing set and high-fived his second
cousin, Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in Oklahoma City for the dedication of a memorial to the
victims of the federal building bombing five years ago, said she
would abide by the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it does not disagree with my determination, it does not
say that the boy cannot be reunited with his father,'' she said.
''I believe Elian should be reunited with his father and I said
that all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno canceled her Thursday visit to a Montana Indian reservation
to return to Washington and work on the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's order came from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government could seek to
have the stay lifted by the full circuit court or by a U.S. Supreme
Court justice. Or it could wait until a scheduled May 11 hearing
before the federal appeals court on the asylum request by the Miami
relatives. The Immigration and Naturalization Service had denied
that request.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department still could forcibly remove the boy from
the home. Yet another option would be mediation, an avenue the
judges encouraged the parties to follow. They did not order
mediation, however.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, state television reported that the Cuban Interests
Section in Washington has sent a message to the U.S. State
Department warning that armed men have been seen outside the Miami
house where Elian is staying and that anti-Castro groups plan to
use force to resist any handover of the boy. The duty officer at
the State Department Wednesday night said he had heard nothing
about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami police spokesman Delrish Moss said no armed men have been
sighted and that a home near the Gonzalez house was checked for
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We checked those rumors and they're untrue,'' he said. He also
said federal officials have not given any indication that they are
going to do anything in the ''next few days or the next few
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father has been waiting in Washington since April 6. He
wants to return to Cuba, though he has promised to remain in the
country until the custody suit is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the American attorney of Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
said in Washington the boy should be reunited with his father in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call upon the United States government to take immediate
action. It is unconscionable to wait one day longer. To do so will
only cause more harm to Elian,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges had harsh words for the government's handling of
Lazaro Gonzalez's effort to win an asylum hearing for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to the record, plaintiff -- although a young child --
has expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba,'' the judges
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes,'' the ruling said. ''It
is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the
only proper representative, considered all of the relevant factors
-- particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel cited a landmark 1985 case involving a minor seeking
asylum -- that of Walter Polovchak, who fought being returned to the
Soviet Union. In that case, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court ruled that a
12-year-old was ''presumably near the lower end of an age range''
of maturity to assert rights separate from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel were: James Larry Edmondson, appointed by
President Reagan; Joel F. Dubina, appointed by President Bush; and
Charles R. Wilson, appointed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, Cuban-Americans keeping a vigil for weeks had
worried that federal agents would swoop in and try to remove Elian
from his relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruling was issued Wednesday, Reno said taking the boy
by force was an option but she was trying to avoid any violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may come a time when there is no other alternative. But
we've got to do it in a careful, thoughtful way,'' Reno had said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by two fishermen while clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida Coast on Thanksgiving Day. He and two others
survived, but his mother and 10 others fleeing Cuba drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez was awarded temporary custody and the boy's
Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since. They insist
Elian will be better off living with them, and argue that the boy
would be psychologically harmed and face persecution if he is
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Reno and the government have repeatedly extended
the deadline for Lazaro Gonzalez to surrender the boy. Last week,
the nation's top law officer took the extraordinary step of flying
to Miami to meet with family members.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides have failed to agree on details of a reunion. The
government insists that Lazaro Gonzalez -- referred to by federal
attorneys as ''a mere distant relative'' -- surrender custody of the
boy, while the family has sought a meeting with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez without conditions.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Orel Hershiser tied a modern-day National
League record Wednesday by hitting four batters -- in just 1 1-3
innings -- in Los Angeles' game against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, pitching despite a slight groin muscle pull, matched
the record of four hit batters in one game shared by seven others,
the last the Dodgers' Tom Candiotti in 1997, also against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pitcher hit Richard Hidalgo and pitcher Shane
Reynolds in the first inning, then hit Jeff Bagwell and Hidalgo
again in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser gave up seven runs on four hits and two walks, and he
also threw several pitches into the dirt and several others to the
backstop during his brief stint.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Astros he hit remained in the game, and none
made threatening gestures toward the pitcher.

<HEADLINE> Clippers 114, SuperSonics 106  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rookie Lamar Odom scored a career-high 33 points
and the Los Angeles Clippers ended the NBA's longest losing streak
this season with a 114-106 victory over the playoff-bound Seattle
SuperSonics on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski added 27 points for the Clippers, who finished
their season with 15 wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, who clinched the No. 7 seed with an overtime triumph
in Sacramento on Tuesday night, did not play All-Star point guard
Gary Payton after the opening quarter, when he scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Shammond Williams paced the Sonics with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers ended an 11-game losing streak to the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers took an 82-81 lead on a 3-pointer by Piatkowski
with 42 seconds left in the third quarter after Piatkowski had a
fastbreak layup and Odom sank a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth period, Los Angeles ran off 11 unanswered points
to grab a 92-83 lead with 7:39 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers got 23 points from Tyrone Nesby, 15 points and 12
rebounds from Michael Olowokandi and 13 from Jeff McInnis, their
other three starters.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy added 15 points for the Sonics, who started Vin
Baker after he came off the bench for four games in a row. Baker
played 24 minutes, scored 10 points and had five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers outrebounded the Sonics 49-35.
</P>
<P>
   With Payton in for the opening quarter, Seattle led by as many
as nine points and took a 36-34 lead into the second period. Payton
had 33 points a night earlier in Seattle's win over Sacramento that
moved the Sonics into the playoffs against Utah instead of the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Horace Grant of the Sonics missed the game because of
tendinitis in his left knee. ... The Clippers' previous win came on
March 14 over Denver. ... The last time the Clippers defeated the
Sonics was on Jan. 23, 1997. The last time they won in Seattle was
on Jan. 25, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 96, Trail Blazers 95  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nick Van Exel sank a 21-foot jumper with
1.7 seconds left as the Denver Nuggets completed a strong finish to
a poor season by defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 96-95
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel scored 22 points and hit five 3-pointers, and Antonio
McDyess also had 22 points for the Nuggets, who won their fourth
straight and eighth in 13 games after a 1-11 stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells scored nine of his 18 points in the final six
minutes to lead the Blazers, but missed a 23-foot jumper with five
seconds left that set up Van Exel's winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game meant virtually nothing to both teams, it was
surprisingly close and well-played.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers took an 87-82 lead on Wells' 18-foot jumper with
5:45 to play, but Denver went on an 8-0 run to take a 90-87 lead
with 3:23 left. The Blazers went up 95-94 on Wells' free throws
with 50.8 seconds left, but that was their last lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had a chance to win with 1.7 seconds left, but
Detlef Schrempf's driving shot bounced off the back of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith had 15 points and Jermaine O'Neal had a season-high
11 rebounds for the Blazers, who missed a chance to reach 60 wins
for just the second time in the franchise's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers finished 63-19 in 1990-91, when they had the NBA's
best record yet lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western
Conference finals. This season Portland's 59-23 mark trailed only
the Lakers' 67-15.
</P>
<P>
   All the Blazers' starters played at least 20 minutes, with the
exception of center Arvydas Sabonis, who spent the night on the
injured list with a sore right foot. He is expected to be ready for
the start of the playoffs against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Denver and Portland played, it was before
Christmas, and the Nuggets pulled off a 97-88 home victory to
improve to 13-11. The Nuggets fell below .500 in mid-January and
kept on falling, but they showed grit the last 3{ weeks of the
season, beating playoff-bound teams Portland, Seattle and Utah
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Denver made 11 of its first 16 shots and all five 3-pointers in
the first quarter, but the Blazers came back from 10 points down to
take the lead with a 15-2 run late in the first and early in the
second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Blazers finished the season tops in the NBA in
field-goal shooting at .469. Minnesota was second at .467. ... The
Nuggets made all five of their 3-pointers in the first quarter --
with Van Exel making three -- but went just 1-for-12 the rest of the
way. ... Portland had won five of six after an 8-9 stretch. ... The
Blazers finished 16-6 on the second night of consecutive games, but
they lost their last three.

<HEADLINE> Israel Frees 13 Lebanon Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel used to argue that as a country under
siege, it could not always play by the rules. But the Supreme Court
set a new standard Wednesday, freeing 13 Lebanese detainees who
were held without trial.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came despite the tearful pleas of the mother of an
Israeli MIA who hoped the detainees might be traded for her son.
After a decision last fall to outlaw torture, the order was another
milestone in the court's search for a new balance between security
concerns and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Aharon Barak himself is perhaps the best example
of the change. In 1997, Barak ruled that Israel has the right to
keep holding the Lebanese, seized by Israeli commandos over the
past 14 years as bargaining chips in future negotiations on the
release of missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
   However, after agreeing to have a larger panel of nine judges
rehear the case, Barak changed his mind last week, reportedly after
much agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blow to liberty and dignity is so deep and genuine that it
cannot be countenanced in a state which honors freedom and
dignity,'' Barak wrote in ordering the detainees released.
</P>
<P>
   As a bus carrying the freed detainees rolled through an army
checkpoint in southern Lebanon, it was showered with rice,
rosewater and flower petals in a traditional Arab welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The freed men were greeted by a crowd of some 2,000 relatives
and supporters who covered them with hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as if I was born again,'' Youssef Sourour, 31, one of
those freed, told the Associated Press. Sourour said he was 17 when
he was captured, and was ready to join the guerrillas to fight
Israel again.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Barak's resolve to free the men was tested by a
last-minute plea by Arad's mother, Batya.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before Barak and two other judges, her voice wavering,
Mrs. Arad said her son, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986, has
already been held for 4,969 days. ''Look into my eyes,'' she said,
staring at the judges. ''Look straight into my eyes. What would you
do if your son or grandson was in this situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Barak listened respectfully, but upheld the release order. He
said he felt Mrs. Arad's pain and assured her the government would
do everything in its power to bring her son home, but only within
the framework of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mrs. Arad's argument probably would have carried
the day. One of the tenets of the Israeli army was never to abandon
soldiers in the field, and no price was considered too high to
bring them home. In 1985, Israel traded hundreds of suspected
Palestinian militants for three Israeli POWs.
</P>
<P>
   In the conflict with the Palestinians, house demolitions and
detentions without trial were seen as acceptable practices, upheld
again and again by the Supreme Court. In 1993, the justices backed
the deportation of 415 suspected Islamic militants from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to Lebanon, accepting the government's security
arguments and ignoring worldwide criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The watershed came in September.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the Shin Bet security service can no
longer torture Palestinian detainees who, according to human rights
groups, had been systematically mistreated to extract confessions
of anti-Israeli activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The security threat, which has always been used as a cover for
anything not according to the rule of law, was put in its proper
place,'' said human rights lawyer Andre Rosenthal. ''The judges
decided that the rule of law was more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But change has been incremental, Rosenthal said. While the Shin
Bet no longer tortures his clients, he said it keeps them
incommunicado for longer periods in hopes of getting a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Israel, including Prime Minister Ehud Barak, an
ex-commando and army chief, feel the courts have gone too far,
complaining that the torture ruling hampers the Shin Bet, and that
new ways have to be found to extract information.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister was equally critical of the high court's
decision to free the Lebanese detainees. In an interview published
Wednesday in the Yediot Ahronot daily, Barak said the judges have
no business second-guessing security professionals.
</P>
<P>
   However, even the high court seems in no hurry to free Israel's
remaining trump cards -- Mustafa Dirani and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid,
leading figures in the Amal and Hezbollah guerrilla groups that
have fought Israeli forces in Lebanon. Obeid was seized by Israel
in 1989 and Dirani in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice suggested Wednesday that parliament find a
solution and pass legislation to create the legal basis for holding
Dirani and Obeid. The detainees' lawyer, in the meantime, is trying
to get a lower court to free them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, times have changed in Israel. ''We are no
longer saying we are special,'' said Rosenthal, the human rights
lawyer. ''The rules of law apply, even if they are not particularly
nice for us.''

Appeals Court Keeps Elian in U.S. For Now
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Chastising the government for ignoring the wishes of a
6-year-old boy, a federal appeals panel on Wednesday ordered that Elian Gonzalez
must remain in the United States until the court decides whether he should get
an asylum hearing. The court action, extending an earlier stay granted by one of
the judges, marked the latest in a series of victories for Elian's Miami
relatives, who have been battling his Cuban father in an international
tug-of-war over the child. The order, however, does not prevent the government
from reuniting father and son in the United States.

<HEADLINE> An Oddity in a Time of Prosperity  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a profound irony, this happens to be National
Savings Month 2000, so declared by broker Merrill Lynch to raise
public awareness of the need to develop good financial habits.
</P>
<P>
   Need you be reminded it is the same month in which some small
investors lost their savings in the stock market? And the same
month, of course, in which many people had to borrow to pay their
taxes?
</P>
<P>
   It also used to be the month when Americans could feel relieved
of their tax burdens, having worked long enough and earned enough
to cover their federal, state and local tax liabilities for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   That latter pleasure is not, however, to be enjoyed in April
anymore, with the so-called Tax Freedom Day having been pushed back
all the way to mid-May, at least as the Tax Foundation calculates
it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the savings rate bobs just a bit above or below zero,
the latter rate being a consequence of borrowing rather than
saving. Your grandparents couldn't possibly understand it.
</P>
<P>
   The vital question for policy-makers and others involved in this
situation is whether it is a just a bad habit that must be
corrected -- or is it a sign of stress on the modern American's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The bad-habit theorists contend that the problem goes way back
to childhood and poor parental training. Advertisers develop and
promote the habit, they say, and moneylenders make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Plausible arguments can be developed to support such views, but
debaters can develop equally convincing positions that suggest
saving, not spending, is inborn or developed early in many people.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch survey suggests there is some truth in this,
citing the findings in a study of 515 youngsters aged 12 to 17. It
showed 59 percent saved half of what they earned, either in jobs or
through allowances for duties performed, and spent the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on any standard, a 50 percent savings rate is quite good,
but teen-agers don't have the financial obligations of adults. They
aren't, for example, faced with the adult-size tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes now claim a greater share of the median two-income
family's taxes than the combined total of money spent on food,
clothing, housing and transportation -- all necessities.
</P>
<P>
   And the tax portion is rising. Nobody yet is making the claim
that it is in direct proportion to the slowdown in savings, but it
is probably only a matter of time before they do.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Tax Foundation studies, families in 1958 saved a
greater percentage of their incomes than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier year, federal taxes accounted for 14.2 percent of
incomes, and state and local taxes 3.7 percent. And the savings
rate was 6.5 percent. In 1998, federal taxes represented 25.9
percent of incomes and state and local taxes were 13.1 percent. The
savings rate was under 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The comparability of such numbers is lessened by social changes.
Workers do save more now than before with contributions to Social
Security. And they have 401(k)s and corporate pension not included
in savings rates.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to deny taxes have something to do with the lack
of savings in conventional formats, and why, according to Merrill
Lynch, half of American families have less than $1,000 in net
savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bad habits or early training or some other cause,
the answer to that perplexing question of why Americans do not save
might be an inability to save, odd as that might seem in an age of
incredible wealth and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> White Zimbabwe Farmers Feel Alone  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- With their president excoriating them
and the police unwilling to help, Zimbabwe's 4,000 white farmers
feel abandoned and nearly defenseless as the two-month occupation
of hundreds of their farms turns increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe has called the occupations a legitimate
protest against the ownership of one-third of the country's
productive farmland by white farmers. He also has said that
Britain, the country's former colonial ruler, reneged on an
agreement to help pay for land reform in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which pledged nearly $55 million for land reform at
independence, delivered nearly 90 percent of that money before
freezing the fund in 1990 when it said Zimbabwe violated the
agreement by forcing unwilling farmers to sell to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Violence on occupied farms throughout the country has flared in
recent days, with two farmers killed, at least six others badly
beaten and several farmhouses burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're scared. We've got nobody to look after us,'' farmer
Martin Pereira said. ''We are totally alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about threats of violence on his farm 40 miles east of
Harare, Pereira, 52, and his wife, Jan, left their house Tuesday
night and sat in the bush for about an hour -- just to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no police. There's no support from the president at
all,'' said Pereira, whose farm has not been occupied. ''We just
have to trust in what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders of the occupation promised to end the
violence, though not the occupations, after meeting with Mugabe and
farm leaders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed hostilities should cease and we should work
toward a solution,'' said Chenjerai Hunzvi, the militant leader of
a group of veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war, who are among
the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe blamed the farmers for provoking the violence and said
they behaved as ''enemies of Zimbabwe'' who tried to ''reverse our
revolution and our independence'' with their opposition to a failed
constitutional referendum that would have allowed the government to
seize their farms without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party-dominated parliament subsequently passed the
law on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have repeatedly ruled in favor of the farmers and
ordered the police to remove the squatters. But the police have
appealed those rulings, arguing that they do not have the resources
to carry them out and fear violence if they tried to evict the
armed men.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers lost their remaining faith in the police after
militants on Saturday abducted five farmers, reportedly from a
police station. The farmers were later found alive, but badly
beaten. A sixth farmer who they had been trying to rescue was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also reported that the scores of attackers armed with
Kalashnikov rifles who killed farmer Martin Olds on Tuesday were
allowed to drive through police roadblocks on their way to and from
his farm in western Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Farm union officials have advised farmers to evacuate their
wives and children from the western province of Matabeleland, where
Olds was killed, and the neighboring province of Midlands, David
Hasluck, director of the Commercial Farmers Union, said Wednesday.
Another 80 families remained evacuated from the Macheke area, where
the Saturday attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can keep on like this. There's a limit to how
well you can run a farm when you can't get onto the farm,'' said
Hamish Turner of Mount Hampden, 10 miles northwest of Harare.
''Sooner or later you have to say, 'We can't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 70,000 whites who make up 0.5 percent of Zimbabwe's
population, 20,000 are eligible for passports from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Pereira, who could get a passport because his father is
British, said it's nearly inconceivable that he would leave
Zimbabwe. ''I have a life here,'' he said. ''What can I do in
England? Live on the dole?''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers have rejected the use of weapons for fear that the
killing of a squatter could spark far greater violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's worse than the Wild West, frankly, because they can't
even defend themselves,'' said David Coltart, an official with the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Calif. Decreasing  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG WILLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California's soaring economy has
reduced unemployment to its lowest level in 31 years and state
revenues are expected to be $10 billion greater than fiscal experts
estimated just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But economists warn that California's good fortune is overly
dependent on the increasingly volatile stock market, and that the
extra revenue could evaporate if the ''new economy'' slows down
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern is, when consolidation in e-commerce happens, when
there are shakeouts or that part of the economy slows down, income
tax revenues are going to mirror that trend as well, which could
sharply reduce revenues, or at least reduce revenue growth,'' said
Jean Ross, who directs the California Budget Project, a fiscal
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Economists raised similar warnings a decade earlier about
California's excessive dependence on the defense industry. When
post-Cold War military cutbacks finally hit in the early 1990s, the
impact rippled outward from aerospace and other defense-dependent
industries throughout the state's economy, eliminating jobs and
slashing earnings in construction, manufacturing and service
sectors as well.
</P>
<P>
   Other states' revenues also are increasingly dependent on
companies based in California, which would be the world's
seventh-largest economy if it were a nation, and is home to leading
Internet commerce, biotechnology, entertainment and communications
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of the estimated $36.3 billion the state will
collect this year in personal income taxes -- California's biggest
revenue source -- is tied to the stock market. That includes capital
gains on stock investments, employee bonuses and stock options,
venture capital investments and initial public offerings of stocks
which are cashed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent years, capital gains have done nothing but go up,''
said Brad Williams, a senior economic forecaster for the state
Legislature. ''No other source of revenue has quadrupled in four
years, and they're almost all taxed at the highest marginal tax
rate, which is very key to the importance of capital gains in the
overall revenue picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The same phenomenon has occurred nationwide, but no other state
is as exposed as California.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent comparison, which doesn't reflect the state's
surge in tax revenues during the past 18 months, shows California
was 40 percent above the national average in the importance of
capital gains on state revenues, said Elizabeth Davis, senior
policy analyst at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, capital gains accounted for just 8 percent of state
personal income tax receipts, $1.5 billion out of $18.6 billion,
compared to about 30 percent of personal income tax revenue this
year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Nasdaq Stock Market's recent gyrations have had no
direct effect on state tax coffers, which are filling up from the
1999 gains. But a long bear market for the Nasdaq could lead to a
chill in investments, and ultimately cause the flow of capital
gains revenue to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   California has seen economic booms end suddenly before -- such as
10 years ago, when defense contracts were cut back and military
bases closed following the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate recession nationwide was a major economic
catastrophe in California. More than 400,000 Californians lost
their jobs, and those who kept them suffered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment -- which is 4.6 percent today -- rose by two-thirds
to 10.1 percent statewide during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a $10 billion deficit in a $50 billion operating
budget, the state increased sales, income, vehicle and other taxes,
doubled college fees and cut services from health care and welfare
grants to library hours.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated $10 billion of the state's $84 billion in
total revenues this year coming from taxes on stock transactions,
California is as dependent on the rich continuing to get richer
today as it was on defense spending 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, political leaders of both parties have been
cautious about increasing the permanent level of state spending.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leiser, executive director of UCLA's Anderson School
economic forecasting program, also urges caution in spending
increases, even though he forecasts the state economy to expand
through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take some encouragement from the fact that people seem to
have their eyes open,'' Leiser said. ''We haven't had a stock
market boom like this before, particularly one in which
California's role was so prominent. I think it's generally
recognized that this is a risky thing, that it's not long-term
money.''

<HEADLINE> How the Eclipse Is Designed  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   RJR Reynolds Tobacco is test-marketing a
reduced-smoke cigarette
that it claims is safer for smokers than other cigarettes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It says the Eclipse heats tobacco to produce smoke, while most
cigarettes burn tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   RJR said its uses heated air in this process:
</P>
<P>
   When a smoker lights an Eclipse, a carbon heat source at the tip
of the cigarette is ignited. The heat source continues to burn as
the cigarette is smoked, transferring heat and heated air through
the cigarette as the smoker puffs.
</P>
<P>
   RJR compared the process to a coffee maker, in which hot water
releases the flavor and aroma of the coffee grounds as it passes
through them. With Eclipse, the heat passes through the tobacco and
forms smoke by releasing glycerin and natural and added flavors
from the tobacco.

<HEADLINE> RJR To Test Reduced-Smoke Cigarette  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics aren't buying the latest pitch from R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco that for the first time claims a reduced-smoke cigarette is
safer than other cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest cigarette-maker called its Eclipse
brand ''a cigarette that responds to concerns about certain
smoking-related illnesses.'' The company's plans to promote the
cigarette were announced at its annual meeting Wednesday in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eclipse, which heats instead of burns the tobacco, lowers
smokers' risk of cancer, chronic bronchitis and possibly emphysema,
according to the company's testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which wants government regulation of
tobacco, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not at all clear that a sufficient science base exists
to support a bold claim that this tobacco product may reduce the
risk of cancer. Nor is it clear what advice doctors should give
their smoking patients who wonder if they should switch to a
product like Eclipse,'' Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services Secretary, said in a statement released in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society said it wanted the government to
substantiate claims that Eclipse is a safer cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tobacco industry's long history of deception should give
the American public pause,'' said John R. Seffrin, the group's
chief executive officer. ''But the bottom line is that the cancer
risks associated with tobacco use are still undeniably great.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Schindler, the chairman and chief executive of R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., told shareholders Eclipse will be
test-marketed in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Sales will be by mail
and over the Internet to customers verified as 21 or older. The
cigarettes later will be sold in retail outlets there.
</P>
<P>
   The ads promoting Eclipse will say: ''The best choice for
smokers who worry about their health is to quit. But Eclipse is the
next best choice for those who have decided to continue smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said much more needs to be known about whether reducing
exposure to toxins actually significantly reduces the overall risk
of smoking. ''Until then, smokers should be very careful about
assuming that products like Eclipse are in any way safer than
cigarettes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   RJR has test-marketed Eclipse since 1996 in Chattanooga, Tenn.;
Atlanta and Lincoln, Neb., claiming the cigarette reduced
secondhand smoke. Now, the campaign will discuss the reduced-risk
claims, RJR officials said.
</P>
<P>
   RJR's marketing literature said tests showed Eclipse smokers
will get 80 percent less of many carcinogens than from other
cigarettes and that Eclipse causes less bronchial and lung
inflammation. The company said tests were inconclusive regarding
Eclipse's potential cardiovascular effect.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, which also makes Doral, Winston, Camel and Salem,
several years ago test-marketed a no-smoke cigarette named Premier,
but consumers didn't like the taste.
</P>
<P>
   It typically takes smokers about a week to become used to
Eclipse, said David N. Iauco, Reynolds' senior vice president of
marketing. But many smokers who switched ''say they'd never go back
to their old brand.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Chairman Focuses on Diversity  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Discussing his company's prospects after
a dismal financial year, Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive
Douglas Daft told shareholders ''it's a new day'' at the beverage
giant.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been describing the company's new public stance on
diversity and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as Daft led his first annual shareholders meeting
at the Playhouse Theatre here, Coke executives stressed their
resolve to improve the diversity of the company's ranks and to make
Coke's corporate culture friendlier for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must respect, value, celebrate and connect with local
people and cultures wherever we operate,'' said Daft, an Australian
who spent much of the 1970s overseeing Coke's Asian and Pacific
operations. ''Not only is diversity an important value, it's an
indispensable value.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Coke's black U.S. employees say the Atlanta-based
company -- which has only one black senior executive and one black
board member -- discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   Eight current and former black Coke employees sued the company
last year alleging they had been denied fair pay, raises,
promotions and performance reviews because of their race. The
plaintiffs are seeking to add 2,000 Coke workers as class members.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies those allegations, but Daft reiterated
Wednesday that Coke is working to resolve the suit quickly. He said
he could not predict when a resolution might occur.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Larry Jones, a former Coke human resources
manager who led a five-day protest bus journey from Atlanta, called
for an international boycott of all Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who told shareholders
that Coke's board and executive offices must match the diversity of
its consumers, said his Rainbow PUSH coalition said the ''justice
riders'' had been ''pushed to the brink'' by their frustration. He
said Coke should be given more time to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But without a settlement, inaction on the groups' concerns
''will grow into a boycott,'' he said. Also on Wednesday, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume called on Coca-Cola officials to settle the
lawsuit. He did not endorse a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said the company was disappointed by
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe that call reflects the aggressive actions
taken by Doug Daft and his management team to equitably and fairly
resolve the lawsuit,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour meeting, Coke chairman Douglas Daft allowed
Jackson and Jones to address shareholders at length.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is great hope in this new team. You inherit the burdens
of history and culture,'' Jackson told Daft, who was joined on the
stage by President Jack Stahl and Carl Ware, Coke's vice president
of global affairs; and other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his group had ridden to the meeting to call attention
to their plight and to publicize their desire to share leadership
with Coke executives in a new spirit of equal partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much longer do we wait?'' Jones asked. ''Three more
months? Five more months? Until the lawsuit is settled?''
</P>
<P>
   In other business, shareholders re-elected Daft to a two-year
board term and re-elected five other directors to three-year terms
on the board.

<HEADLINE> Fox, MSNBC Learn From CNN Troubles  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox News Channel and MSNBC began operating
within months of each other in 1996, at a time many people wondered
if there was room for one, much less two, networks to compete with
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, CNN has yet to conquer its longtime bugaboo:
its failure to attract an audience consistently when there's no
big, breaking story. Viewership fell a precipitous 31 percent in
the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's two news rivals have taken completely different lessons
from those problems and, after a few years of bitter competition,
are following separate paths.
</P>
<P>
   Fox senses a vulnerable CNN, and is attacking directly with
breaking news and political talk. Its ratings are steadily rising,
with prime-time talk shows ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''Hannity &AMP;
Colmes'' leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC believes it needs an identity separate from breaking news
and must bring in a younger audience. The network is producing
biographies, documentaries and reality programming that can air
repeatedly during slow periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're diverging in terms of strategy,'' said Erik
Sorenson, vice president and general manager of MSNBC. ''We're
definitely diverging in terms of audience.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's average audience of 365,000 during the first quarter of
this year still dwarfed its rivals. MSNBC's average of 161,000
viewers was down 3 percent from 1999, while Fox News Channel had
135,000 viewers, an 11 percent increase. CNN is available in 78
million homes, MSNBC in 55 million and Fox in 47 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for CNN have sunk partly due to the slow news period --
President Clinton's impeachment drama was ending during the same
period last year -- and because CNBC has eaten away at many of its
business-focused viewers during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the most audience so we have the most audience to lose
during slow news periods,'' CNN spokeswoman Christa Robinson said.
She noted that prime-time ratings are up since the last three
months of 1999, and that CNN has launched eight new programs in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In prime-time, Fox's audience is slightly bigger than MSNBC's.
But an MSNBC viewer is more likely to be younger than 55.
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, Fox News Channel's vice president for news, keeps
the three television sets in his office pointedly tuned to Fox
News, CNN -- and CNBC. People at Fox are fond of saying they don't
consider MSNBC competition anymore; their eyes are on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Despite CNN's 15-year head start, bigger staff and reputation as
the place the public will turn to in a crisis, Moody said Fox is
growing faster than CNN at a comparable point in its development.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have respect for what CNN does,'' he said. ''I don't scorn
them in any way. I think, though, that they are tired, they are not
innovative, and the innovations they have tried have not been
particularly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox strives for a more flexible daytime schedule than its rivals
to respond to stories, and brags when it has beaten them -- if only
by seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're succeeding because we're sticking to news, we're
sticking to hard news,'' he said. ''We're sticking to topics that
people really want to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has shown the most growth in the evening, when talk is king.
Political shows with Brit Hume and Bill O'Reilly have grown in the
ratings while similar fare on CNN and CNBC haven't.
</P>
<P>
   That's a savvy strategy, since Fox doesn't have nearly the
resources of CNN for covering news, said Ed Turner, a former CNN
executive. Fox's weakness is evident when a major story breaks
internationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's Sorenson commends Fox for the loyalty of its audience.
But he said he's not jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had Fox's audience pattern, I wouldn't be sitting here
right now,'' Sorenson said in an interview in his office. ''(NBC
President) Bob Wright and (NBC News President) Andy Lack would be
showing me the door.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC is after youth, because it's what advertisers crave and
provides opportunity for future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising money has helped MSNBC turn a profit faster than it
expected, despite lackluster ratings. And it partly explains why
MSNBC's New Jersey office is filled with contractors, hurriedly
making room for new employees.
</P>
<P>
   The cable network has added 150 people in the past year, none
more important than Mike Cascio, who used to oversee the
''Biography'' series on A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cascio's direction, MSNBC is churning out news
documentaries, like a two-hour look at airline safety dramatically
titled, ''Why Planes Crash.'' It has retrospectives on the Vietnam
and Persian Gulf wars in the works. A new series, ''Crime Files,''
will look back at dramatic criminal cases, and ''Missing'' will
focus on children and adults who are lost. The ''Today'' show's
Matt Lauer is host of a ''Biography''-like profile series.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson sees the strong ratings that cable networks like
Discovery and VH1 get for non-fiction programming, and he wants
some of those numbers at MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to smooth out the traditional peaks and valleys in
cable news network ratings. ''I would rather not be held hostage by
waiting for the world to conspire to do something awful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be CNN when there's big, breaking news,'' Sorenson
said. ''But we want to be Discovery and A&AMP;E when there's not a big,
breaking story.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger in this strategy was evident on the nights of the New
Hampshire and Super Tuesday presidential primaries this year. On
these competitive evenings for news networks, Fox had a bigger
audience than MSNBC, even though MSNBC had the entire NBC News team
at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC runs the risk of clouding its image by trying to be
different things at different times.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got to be careful they don't lose their news edge,''
Turner said. ''If you're calling yourself a news channel and have
that mantle, you better be damn sure you're doing news.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenson said the strategy is clear. ''No one's ever done
this before so there is understandably some discomfort. Will it
confuse the audience? Will they know to come to us for breaking
news? So far, they've been coming.''

<HEADLINE> Farmer Vets May Not Get Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN BIEMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Military veterans who are land-rich but
cash-poor farmers are concerned that they may be disqualified from
veterans benefits because of their land assets.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans officers from Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska and
Minnesota and officials from the Veterans Administration have met
with Sen. Charles Grassley to discuss the limitations, which could
affect whether farmers with $50,000 in assets are eligible for
veterans' pensions and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''That asset test keeps them out of the veterans hospital even
though their income is low enough that they'd otherwise get into
that hospital,'' said Grassley, R-Iowa. The asset level is so low
it may not even cover the cost of farm machinery, let alone land,
he said Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   The VA representatives have a better understanding of the issue
now and made a commitment to research possible solutions, Grassley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The farm crisis precipitated the concern, which is most likely
to affect veterans of World War II and the Korean War who are
between the ages of 70-85.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're at the peak of their medical needs, but ... their
assets are running out,'' said Larry Sundall, an Iowa veterans
officer. ''They're very nervous about whether or not the VA will be
there for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Figures are not available for how many farmers may be affected,
but Sundall said in his rural county of 12,000 there are about
1,200 veterans, 700-800 of whom have agricultural backgrounds. Per
capita, Iowa has the highest number of retired farmers who are also
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the real rural parts of Iowa it will run as high as
two-thirds having an ag background because that was the way of life
back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sundall says farmers are more affected by the asset barrier than
people with businesses such as hardware stores because they don't
incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The farmer puts out all that money to own the land to operate
the land and then he's penalized for having that as an asset,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said if the VA is amenable, changes in pension
regulations could come in four to six months. He said changing the
health care requirements may require legislation, which he would be
willing to sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has faced similar problems in the past, Grassley said,
as the children of farmers vying for guaranteed student loans were
ruled out because of assets, even though they qualified by income.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a farmer you just can't sell off your assets to send
your kids to college just like you can't sell off your assets to
get into a veterans' hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Congress raised the asset requirement for
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said most veterans say they received commitments to
guaranteed health care when they entered the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about the federal government keeping a
commitment that it made when people went into the military to put
their life on the line for the freedoms that we all enjoy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bales, executive director of the Iowa Office of Veterans
Affairs, said the way current veterans are treated may have an
impact on recruiting new people to the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to know that this country can take care of them,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Sign St. Jean To Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Golden State Warriors have signed
general manager Garry St. Jean to a multiyear contract extension,
the team announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really pleased to have signed this extension and look
forward to focusing exclusively on my duties as general manager,''
said St. Jean, who coached his last game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean, 50, has been Golden State's general manager since the
1997-98 season. He took over as coach when he fired P.J. Carlesimo
on Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean announced Tuesday that assistant coach Dave Cowens, a
Hall of Fame center and former coach of the Boston Celtics and
Charlotte Hornets, will take over as Warriors head coach.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean said Warriors owner Chris Cohan ''has always been
extremely fair and generous to me and my family. It is my job to
reward him for his confidence in me, which will be accomplished by
building the Warriors into a competitive, contending team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors were 6-21 when Carlesimo was fired in late
December, and the losing continued under St. Jean, who was 13-42
after Wednesday's loss to the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean served as an assistant under Don Nelson in Milwaukee
(1980-86) and Golden State (1988-1992) before being hired May 22,
1992, to coach the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four years with the Kings, going 159-236 before being
fired midway through the 1996-97 season.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 95, Kings 86  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jeff Hornacek concluded the final regular
season of his 14-year NBA career by scoring 18 points, and Karl
Malone also had 18 as the Utah Jazz beat the Sacramento Kings 95-86
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 49-47 at halftime, the Jazz seemingly buried the
Kings with a 21-0 spurt for a 70-56 lead in the third quarter. But
Sacramento rallied against the Utah reserves and the Kings led
75-74 after the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz regrouped in the fourth quarter, with Armen Gilliam
scoring nine points and Utah outscoring Sacramento 21-11 in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell and Greg Ostertag added 10 apiece for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Darrick Martin led the Kings with 16 points. Lawrence
Funderburke had 14, Jon Barry scored 12 and Predrag Stojakovic 11.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Utah outlasted Sacramento in a dramatic first-round
playoff series. Even earlier this week, it appeared the regular
season finale might be a playoff preview between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   But with a loss Tuesday to Seattle, Sacramento was locked as the
No. 8 seeded team in the Western Conference. Utah already had won
the Midwest Division title and the No. 2 seeding, so this game was
inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Kings starters Chris Webber (strained right calf) and Nick
Anderson (sore left knee) didn't play. In the second quarter
Ostertag, a center, found himself open from 3-point range and shot
an airball.
</P>
<P>
   The action was left to Hornacek, who scored 10 points in the
first quarter. Jazz fans cheered wildly with every shot, groaning
for each miss and screaming when the ball went in.
</P>
<P>
   A sponsor handed out Hornacek posters, showed a video tribute
and held a halftime ceremony. Yet while Hornacek made it clear
before training camp that this season would be his last, a flyer
distributed Wednesday by the Jazz said he would be honored by the
team ''at a later date if he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek has said repeatedly in recent weeks he doesn't plan to
return next season. He'll leave the NBA with the third-highest
free-throw percentage in league history.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3-of-3 from the foul line against the Kings,
Hornacek finished the season 171-for-180 (95.0 percent) from the
line. Houston's Calvin Murphy holds the record of 95.8 percent in
1980-81.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gilliam went 0-for-6 in the second quarter, missing a dunk
and a layup. He also had a basket taken away on an offensive foul.
... A small but vocal group of Kings fans attended. ... Sacramento
lost seven of its last eight. ... Utah closed with four games in
five nights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cliff Robinson scored 23 points as the
Phoenix Suns ran away from Golden State in the fourth quarter and
completed a sweep of the season series with a 99-88 victory
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (53-29) will open the first round of the playoffs at San
Antonio. Golden State (19-63) concluded a miserable campaign, their
second 19-win season in three years. The Warriors lost their four
games against the Suns by an average margin of 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors trailed just 72-71 early in the fourth quarter
before a decisive 11-2 run keyed by successive 3-pointers by Todd
Day and Rodney Rogers put Phoenix up 83-73 with 7:00 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Rogers with 5:30 remaining made it 88-77, and
consecutive 3s by Toby Bailey and Day gave the Suns a commanding
97-79 lead with 2:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway added 17 points for Phoenix, while Larry
Hughes topped the Warriors with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The Warriors have scored fewer than 100 points in 11
straight games against Phoenix. ... The Suns have won 17 of their
last 19 over the Warriors. ... Phoenix finished with a road record
of 21-20, worst among the Western Conference playoff teams. ...
Gary St. Jean, who will turn over the head coach duties to Dave
Cowens next season and return as general manager, finished 13-42 as
interim head coach. P.J. Carlesimo went 6-21 before being fired.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: U.S. Team Beats Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- The United States used strong serving
and equally impressive passing to beat the combined Korean national
team 26-24, 23-25, 25-15, 25-23 at Moby Arena on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the U.S. team's fourth victory in its five-match tour
with the Korean team, which represents North and South Korea. The
U.S. team qualified for the Sydney Olympics in January at the
Continental Cup in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Korea is as good as any team in the world (at)
passing and we outpassed them,'' U.S. coach Doug Beal said. ''I
think we served so much better than they did and did again in this
match.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hayden, who had 12 kills, and Phil Eatherton, who had 10
for the match, set the tone in the first game. Each had three
kills, with Eatherton accounting for the final two points.
</P>
<P>
   Korea came back to tie the match in Game 2, as Se-Jin Kim had
three blocks for points.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Witt had six of his 12 kills for the match in the third
game, one the United States never trailed after taking a 2-1 lead.
Game 4 was tied at 23-23, but the United States earned a point on
Jin-Sik Shin's return error. Captain Lloy Ball closed the match
with a winner off a feed from Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been working hard to find a three-man block as often
as we can and I thought it was pretty good tonight,'' Beal said.
''I wish everything we work on in the gym is as good when we play
international matches.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 8, Rockies 7  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tony Womack hit his first home run of the season
and drove in the go-ahead run with an eighth-inning single as the
Arizona Diamondbacks rallied from four runs down to beat the
Colorado Rockies 8-7 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley tied it at 7 with his sixth home run of the season,
a two-run, 414-foot shot to center off reliever Gabe White with two
outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive run was unearned because Colorado third baseman
Jeff Cirillo couldn't handle Kelly Stinnett's grounder to lead off
the eighth. Pinch-hitter Bernard Gilkey walked, then Womack lined
one off reliever Julian Tavarez (1-1) past Cirillo to drive in
pinch-runner Hanley Frias.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shumpert tripled twice, once with the bases loaded, for
four RBIs to help Colorado take a 6-2 lead. Larry Walker was
4-for-5 with an RBI for the new-look Rockies, who have scored their
last 33 runs without a home run.
</P>
<P>
   After Womack's homer gave Arizona a 2-1 lead in the third
inning, the Rockies tied it on Shumpert's RBI triple with two outs
in the fourth, then scored four times in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing led off the sixth with a single, then Walker was
safe on the first of two errors by second baseman Jay Bell. After
Cirillo lined out to center, Arizona starter Brian Anderson walked
Todd Helton to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert followed with a base-clearing triple to deep
left-center, then scored on a grounder to Womack. The shortstop
made a tough stop, but his throw to the plate was not in time.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cut it to 6-4 in the sixth on RBI singles by Erubiel
Durazo and Andy Fox. Walker's RBI single made it 7-4 in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning to get the
victory, and Byung-Hyun Kim got the final two out for his first
save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kim came into the game with a runner at second with one out.
Catcher Damian Miller threw out pinch-runner Brian Hunter at third
for the second out. After Lansing walked and Walker singled under
Fox's glove at third, Kim got Cirillo to bounce out to Fox to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   After he called Travis Lee out on a check swing third strike to
end the seventh, umpire Ed Montague threw third base coach Brian
Butterfield out of the game. Butterfield had to be restrained from
coming at Montague after the ejection.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With his 1,448th hit, a leadoff single in the fourth,
Walker surpassed Jeff Heath (1936-49) as Canada's career hit
leader. Walker has 23 career four-hit games. ... Colorado placed
catcher Scott Servais on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained
right ankle and recalled catcher Ben Petrick from Triple-A Colorado
Springs. ... Fox played third base for Arizona in his first start
of the season after coming off the disabled list Monday.

<HEADLINE> Census Response Rate Hits '90 Level  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau is turning its attention to
a massive door-to-door effort to reach uncounted Americans now that
the mail response has tied its 1990 return rate.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt proclaimed the 65 percent
mailback rate ''a serious achievement,'' on Wednesday, and noted
that forms are still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now our job is cut out for us: We will make every effort,
beginning on April 27, to contact all those who did not return
their forms so we can achieve a 100 percent count of our nation's
population,'' Prewitt said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   He said equaling the 1990 return rate reverses a ''decades-long
decline in meeting our civic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 rate was matched despite controversy in recent weeks
about questions on the long form which some people felt were
intrusive. Prewitt said he believed that has hurt the overall
response.
</P>
<P>
   Returns of the short form have are better than 1990, 66.8
percent compared with 66 percent, he said. But the long form is
lagging with just 54.1 percent returned so far, compared with 60
percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal statistics are not about individuals, therefore they
are not about privacy,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate, however, on whether people who
received the long form would be more likely to resist Census takers
when they come to the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau budgeted for a 61 percent mail response rate
this year because the rate has declined each decade since 1970 --
from 78 percent to 75 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now a half-million Census workers go into the field in follow-up
operations scheduled last until July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The better-than-expected mail return could result in some
savings for the agency, but that may be balanced by the extra work
needed to makeup for the low return rate on the long form, which
was sent to one household in six.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires the count every 10 years in order to
reapportion seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, billions of dollars in federal money are
distributed based on population formulas calculated from the
information collected in the Census.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a good response vital to local officials who conduct
campaigns to encourage their citizens to cooperate. Indeed, some
communities reportedly have gone so far as to offer their residents
cash to complete their Census forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau itself relies on encouraging people to do
their civic duty to get them to respond but it is also looking for
new ways to improve that cooperation. One method scheduled for a
limited test includes offering the incentive of a calling card
worth 30 minutes of long-distance calls in return for their
response.
</P>
<P>
   In March, about 120 million census questionnaires were mailed or
hand-delivered to homes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau launched a promotional campaign challenging
communities to top their 1990 response rates by 5 percent and about
15 percent of cities and towns have done so, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   While detailed figures being posted on the bureau's Internet
site show the current response nationally at 64 percent, Prewitt
said the overall total has now reached the 65 percent mark of a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said forms are expected to continue coming in slowly and
final response figures should be available in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest showing this year is in the upper Midwest with
return rates of more than 70 percent in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,
South Dakota and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of these were below their 1990 rates. Minnesota
was down 4 percentage points, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest return rates were recorded in the South, with under
60 percent returns in New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama and South
Carolina. Vermont, Maine, Alaska and Hawaii also fell under 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Rhode Island had the biggest improvements, up
three points, Prewitt noted.

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Family Makes Ends Meet  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With their modest stucco home turned into a
fishbowl, surrounded by hundreds of supporters and the media, the
daily task of making a living has come to a virtual standstill for
the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear is how much help the family receives or whether
anti-Castro groups are pitching in as the custody fight dominates
headlines at home and in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But if those close to the family are correct, the Gonzalezes are
turning down offers for money. Last Christmas, they even gave away
gifts intended for the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said the Gonzalezes are
relying on relatives for help, but neither he nor anyone else will
discuss details of the family's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Rent alone for the small two-bedroom home in Little Havana with
the big-screen TV is $600.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are as tight as they can get,'' Gutierrez said of the
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, has recently stopped
working as a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Marisleysis, often described as the 6-year-old
boy's surrogate mother, is on leave from her job as a bank loan
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Angela, Lazaro's wife, works as a seamstress at a factory,
bringing in some money, though she has not been at work recently.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, meanwhile, is being kept out of school and is being
taught at home by a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardo Perez Sr., who owns the Ford dealership where Lazaro
Gonzalez works, said he stills gives some money to the man he hired
just three months ago. Perez estimates that Gonzalez could earn
$45,000 annually, but he is not receiving his regular salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I help him personally,'' said Perez, who also is an executive
board member of the Cuban American National Foundation. ''I do it
as a Christian and a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation spokeswoman Ninoska Perez said the Cuban exile group
arranged two trips for family members to Washington, D.C. Other
than that, the foundation has not given money to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We offered to help them ... they said no,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by two fishermen while clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida Coast on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10
others fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the family has turned down offers for donated
food and money and also has rejected offers for book and movie
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not here to make money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A legal fund for the Gonzalezes has collected more than
$200,000. Family attorneys are working pro bono -- the money has
been used for legal expenses including lawyers' trips, phone calls
and court costs, not for personal expenses, trustee Dulce Cuetara
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most contributions are $10, $5, $30, $20, we even have
contributions for a dollar,'' Cuetara said. ''We have hundreds of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives aren't the only ones carrying the financial
burden of the custody struggle: The cost to taxpayers has hit at
least $1 million, not including expenses for federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Pay to Miami police -- the city's biggest single expense --
reached nearly $800,000 in overtime and compensatory time as of
Wednesday, said Lt. William Schwartz.

   The 6-year-old has Goldenhar's syndrome, a birth defect which
gained attention in the last decade after an alarming number of
Gulf War veterans' children were born with deformities.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kenny's left ear should be, he has a tiny flap of skin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' he proclaims, ''is my baby ear.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of his head, he has cartilage, the framework
for an ear, but no opening to his eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   To hear, Kenny wears a headband device that vibrates his skull
and produces a distant, echoing sound similar to what an average
person hears underwater. When that doesn't work, he reads lips.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenny's parents, Lori Barringer and Timothy Willis Sr., want
their son to have plastic and reconstructive surgery. If the
surgeries are successful, Kenny could have hearing in at least one
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say it could take five to eight operations costing
as much as $125,000. Cigna, Kenny's insurance provider, vows to
cover all of the surgeons' bills, and most of the hospital bills.
Kenny's family must pay the $250 co-pays for his hospitalization
and follow-up care, along with thousands of dollars in travel
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The first procedure will be next month at the University of
Virginia Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenhar's is marked by asymmetrical faces, receding jaws,
deformed palates, milky white cysts in the eyes and misshapen
organs. While an estimated five in every 100,000 children are born
with Goldenhar's, the rate in infants born to Gulf War veterans is
20 per 100,000, according to the Association for Birth Defect
Research for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Mekdeci, founder of the association, believes there is
evidence linking Goldenhar's to exposure to certain toxic chemicals
and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny's parents did not serve in the military, but Kenny's
mother wonders if paints and chemicals she used in her home before
she knew she was pregnant harmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always tell him how proud I am that he's my boy,'' said
Willis, Kenny's dad. ''I try to concentrate on what he can do,
rather than what he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny plays T-ball, after years of physical therapy improved his
muscle tone and coordination. His classmates at Osborne Hill School
in Fairfield have also embraced him. His teacher wears a microphone
around her neck to amplify her voice for Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenny's parents want the surgeries to ensure the boy will
remain comfortable as his classmates get older and become more
aware of his defects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will they taunt him? Or tease him? Kids can be so cruel,''
Barringer said. ''If there is anything that I can do to improve his
life, I'm gonna do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Donations toward Kenny's medical expenses can be sent to The
Kenny Willis Fund, account number 9425262920 at Fleet Bank, 2574
East Main St., Bridgeport, CT 06610.

<HEADLINE> Judge to rule on Peeler's motion to dismiss murder charge  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Lawyers for a man charged in the
killings of an 8-year-old witness and his mother are hoping a
change in the story of the state's star witness will be enough to
persuade a judge to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler Jr., 28, faces the possibility of the death
penalty in the Jan. 7, 1999, slayings of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr.
and his mother, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Peeler masterminded the killings to prevent the
boy from testifying against him in an earlier murder case. Peeler's
brother, Adrian, 25, is also charged in the murders, accused of
gunning down mother and son in their Bridgeport home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Peeler's lawyers argued that the charges should be
dismissed because the state's key witness appears to have recanted
at least some of what she originally told police.
</P>
<P>
   In statements to police and in a videotaped deposition she gave
in November, Josephine Lee said she acted as a lookout and
witnessed the murders. But in December, she wrote a letter to her
lawyer, claiming she lied. At the same time, Lee wrote three
separate letters to Bridgeport police officers in which she
apologized for her role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Superior Court Judge G. Sarsfield Ford
rejected defense requests for a mistrial, adjournment or
continuance in the case based on Lee's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers argued Wednesday that the charges should be
dismissed because the arrest warrant for Peeler was based largely
on Lee's version of events, which they claimed had changed
substantially in three earlier interviews with police.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who signed the arrest warrant did not know she had
given three inconsistent statements, Peeler's lawyers argued. They
said that her most recent statements -- in the letter to her lawyer
-- erode whatever probable cause originally existed to support
Peeler's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said Lee's varying
statements do not destroy the basis for the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is complained of here is no more than a prior
inconsistent statement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he would rule on the motion today, when jury selection
is scheduled to continue. Twelve regular jurors and five alternates
have been chosen. Ford has said he wants to pick one additional
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he will set a date today for when testimony will
begin.

<HEADLINE> Another New Milford police officer convicted of a serious crime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- This has been a year of unwanted
''firsts'' for the police force in this small community: the first
Connecticut police officer ever tried for murder in the line of
duty and the first officer ever charged with negligent homicide in
the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, former officer Scott Smith was convicted of
manslaughter for having fatally shot an unarmed suspect at
point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the police department suffered another blow when a
popular 14-year veteran of the police force was convicted on a
negligent homicide charge stemming from the June 1998 death of a
teen-ager whose car was struck by his speeding cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Arthur Peitler could not be reached for comment Wednesday
evening. Colin McCormack, the acting police chief, issued a brief
statement saying he feels sympathy for the victims of the cruiser
crash, but is not happy with the outcome of Officer William
Scribner's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we as citizens are disappointed by the jury's decision
to convict Officer Scribner, we as members of a law enforcement
agency must respect and abide by our system of justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury deliberated for less than two days before
returning the verdict against Scribner, 39, of Bethel. He is
scheduled to be sentenced on June 14 and faces up to six months in
prison and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, 17-year-old Angela D'Aquila, a girl known by many
town residents, was killed when Scribner's cruiser, its lights
flashing and siren screaming, raced through a New Milford
intersection and smashed into her car. Caroline LaVoie, 18, a
passenger in D'Aquila's car, suffered a collapsed lung, broken
ribs, a fractured clavicle and a sprained spine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely been a long 2{ years,'' LaVoie said outside
Litchfield Superior Court where the trial was held. ''I think we're
all happy that this is done and over with and justice is served.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, Scribner's attorney, said his client had hoped the
jury would recognize the officer was only doing his duty when the
accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a man with 14 years on the job, with an unblemished
record, legitimately responding to an emergency and a tragic
accident occurs and now he's convicted of a motor vehicle
offense,'' Kelly said. ''So he's very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scribner was responding to a disturbance call when his cruiser
struck D'Aquila's car. Prosecutors conducted a yearlong
investigation and finally concluded that Scribner hadn't slowed
down before going through the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had maintained Scribner followed police procedure.
Scribner's attorney argued that D'Aquila caused the accident by
making an improper left turn into the path of the cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Trombetto, a New Milford convenience store clerk, said her
customers were all discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some feel one way, some feel the other, but they all have an
opinion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner turned down the state's offer to place him on a special
one-year probation, after which his record would have been wiped
clean. He remains free on a promise to appear pending sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is scheduled to be sentenced on May 5. This week,his
attorney filed a motion asking that his conviction be overturned
because the jurors acted improperly.

<HEADLINE> Band drops Yale as defendant in lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale University is being dropped as a
defendant in a lawsuit filed by the heavy metal rock band
Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after Yale agreed to block access from its
computer network to a Web site that allows people to trade
copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   Yale blocked access to the site last week after Metallica filed
a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and
California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music
sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said that some months ago Yale blocked
access to the Napster Web site during business hours in an effort
to relieve congestion on the school's network. In February, the
school ''alerted'' students to federal copyright laws as they
applied to Napster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, at the time of the lawsuit, we notified students that we
were blocking access to Napster continuously, until we could
clarify the legal issues surrounding Napster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica said Wednesday it would drop Yale from the lawsuit,
and would not seek any damages against the university.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the prompt and responsible reaction by Yale
University in dealing with the gross violations of copyright laws
and the protection of intellectual property,'' the band said in a
news release. ''We thank them for their quick response to the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for
and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, Metallica alleged Yale, the University of
Southern California and Indiana University allowed free trade of
copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the
Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The band filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
on April 13.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes in Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A bomb exploded Thursday outside the
headquarters of Pakistan's right-wing religious party, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or damage in the explosion in
Mansura, 10 miles south of Lahore, officials said. No one took
responsibility for the bombing, and police refused to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaat-e-Islami is a small, but powerful religious party that is
considered the best organized of the religious parties in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Pakistan has been wracked by religiously
motivated violence involving attacks on the country's minority
Shiite Muslims, who have blamed militant Sunni Muslims, the
majority Islamic sect here.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence, however, to link the bombing to these
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Regulators set down rules for sale of nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Interested buyers can bid on Northeast
Utilities' Connecticut nuclear plants individually or as a group,
state regulators have ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Public Utility Control on Wednesday set
ground rules for the sale of the Millstone nuclear power plants, as
required under the electric deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   NU subsidiary Connecticut Light &AMP; Power Co., the majority owner
of the plants, asked regulators to require all three plants to be
sold as a package, including Millstone Unit 1, which is being
decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven-based United Illuminating Co.. which owns 3.7 percent
of Millstone 3, did not want Unit 1 included in the auction for
Unit 3.
</P>
<P>
   CL&AMP;P said a potential owner would prefer to control the entire
Waterford campus, instead of having sections owned by different
companies. CL&AMP;P also said a new owner could save money by operating
Unit 2 and Unit 3 together.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC, however, ruled that buyers may see Unit 1 as a
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The value of Millstone Unit 1 to prospective buyers is
uncertain. No decommissioned facilities have been sold in the U.S.;
therefore, there is no market that the Department can evaluate to
determine the value of the unit to prospective buyers,'' the DPUC
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's ruling allows bidders to include Unit 1 if they
wish. The plant is owned by CL&AMP;P and the Western Massachusetts
Electric Co., another subsidiary of Berlin-based NU.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence McIntosh, a spokesman for NU, said the company accepted
the ruling despite its initial request that the units be sold
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just going to see what the market has to say about it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are designed to get the highest price for the plants,
while generating the lowest possible expense for ratepayers of
Connecticut Light &AMP; Power and United Illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC also said it would review potential buyers' safety
record and ability to run nuclear plants, although the license to
operate the plants is issued by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Northeast Utilities, the parent company of CL&AMP;P,
said Wednesday they were satisfied with the ruling. The Connecticut
Coalition Against Millstone, which has lobbied for the closure of
the Waterford complex, protested the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Burton, the group's lawyer, said the state's promise of a
safety review was meaningless because it did not set down specific
health or environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without standards, there's nothing to measure up against,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1998 law, the plants must be auctioned by Jan. 1,
2004. Regulators and the plants' owners hope to complete a sale
well before then. A consultant will be hired to run the auction.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC also decided that the sale of CL&AMP;P's interest in
Seabrook Station, a nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, should
not be included in the Connecticut auction.
</P>
<P>
   NU is working through a settlement with New Hampshire regulators
over their deregulation law. The DPUC said it does not want to hold
up the Connecticut sale while the New Hampshire issues are worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut attorney general and the Office of the Consumer
Counsel wanted to delay the auction until the Seabrook interest
could be included. They argued the Seabrook interest would be
attractive to bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Waiting to sell the plants probably would have meant a higher
price because the market for nuclear plants is improving as
deregulation is implemented,'' Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency adopted additional protections for nuclear plant
workers when the plants are sold. The law requires new plant owners
to offer jobs to existing non-managerial workers at the same pay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CL&AMP;P got the DPUC to agree that a new owner must
offer to keep on employees for a year at comparable salaries and
benefits. Any workers laid off after that first year of new
ownership would get a help finding a new job and a $3,000 education
or training stipend.
</P>
<P>
   To address nuclear safety concerns, the DPUC agreed to have the
auction consultant screen bidders' safety records. Such information
will be considered when the DPUC reviews the winning bid for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner of the plants must get licenses from the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani trade barbs over campaign donations, environment  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, N.Y. (AP) -- On a day when polls showed Rudolph
Giuliani's approval rating at its lowest level ever, the Republican
senatorial candidate sparred with Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton
over campaign financing and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign issued press releases questioning Clinton's
environmental record, as well as fund-raising tactics, while the
first lady held a Long Island press conference where she sought to
deflect questions over returning a $22,000 campaign donation to a
woman with ties to a drug smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   A new Quinnipiac College Poll released Wednesday showed that
just 37 percent of New York City voters approve of Giuliani's
performance while 57 percent disapprove and six percent are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll surveyed 816 registered voters and has a margin of
error of 3.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's poll numbers have dropped over the past two years
from an approval rating of 74 percent in February 1998, shortly
after his November 1997 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brushed aside questions about Wednesday's poll, saying
''I'm only focusing on what I'm doing. ... I have a lot of work to
do to earn the trust and the vote of every New Yorker that I can
possibly reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she sought to shift the focus of questions about her
campaign's refund of a questionable $22,000 donation by suggesting
that Giuliani give back $100,000 from a man she called ''the
biggest polluter in America.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the mayor's Washington-based Giuliani Victory
Committee, set up to accept soft money donations which legally
bypass federal fund raising restrictions, should return $100,000
from the Renco Group.
</P>
<P>
   Renco is run by Ira Rennert, who has caused an uproar on eastern
Long Island by building the largest house in the Hamptons -- a
100,000-square foot beachfront complex in Sagaponack that features
29 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, two bowling alleys and a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Among Renco's holdings is the Utah-based Magnesium Corporation
of America, which was cited in a 1998 federal Environmental
Protection Agency report as the nation's top dumper of toxic
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want him to answer a simple question: Is he going to
keep or is he going return $100,000 from the biggest polluter in
America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign, declined
comment, saying, ''The contribution was given to the NRSC and
you'll have to call them for comment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the national Senate fund-raising committee,
Stuart Roy, said because it was a corporate contribution it was
immediately transferred from the Giuliani Victory Committee to the
NRSC. As for returning the money, Roy said, ''I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, another Giuliani campaign spokeswoman, Juleanna
Glover Weiss, noted that Rennert had been a visitor to the Clinton
White House and that he had donated $25,000 to the Democratic
National Committee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really shouldn't surprise New Yorkers that Mrs. Clinton
will take any position, pander to every group, and cash any check
from any source in her quest to reinvent herself,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton said a $22,000 check had been returned to
Vivian Mannerud, whose Airline Brokers Co. runs charter flights
between Cuba and Miami. Mannerud has been linked to Jorge Cabrera,
who in 1995 made a $20,000 contribution to the Democratic National
Committee from a bank account in which he kept profits from drug
trafficking. The DNC eventually returned that donation.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera later pleaded guilty to smuggling 6,000 pounds of
cocaine into the United States and was sentenced to 19 years in
prison and fined $1.5 million. Mannerud was never charged with any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns also sparred over the environment, with Clinton
claiming that New York City was guilty of polluting the East River,
Long Island Sound and Jamaica Bay. Clinton also suggested that
Giuliani had been lax about protecting New York City's watershed in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton's environmental record consists of protecting
Tyson Chicken from government efforts to end its pollution of the
waterways in Clinton's home state of Arkansas,'' said Caroline
Nolan, another Giuliani campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Tyson accusations, Clinton said, ''I don't
recall being the mayor of Tyson chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said her former law firm had represented the chicken
company in Arkansas, but when she was asked if she was ever
personally involved in that litigation, she said: ''No, I wasn't.
You know this is 25 years ago. To the best of my memory, no.''

<HEADLINE> Bombing Families Welcome Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- In the last remaining moments of daylight,
Glenna Rusch stood at the west end of a reflective pool taking
photographs of the Oklahoma City National Memorial
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of others, she seemed to be in no hurry to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting to see the memorial ever since they started
building it,'' the Tulsa resident said Wednesday. ''It's amazing
how something so beautiful came out of something so tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building, 168 sculpted chairs sat filled with flowers and
other mementos as families of the victims made their way onto the
memorial site that marks the most deadly terrorist attack on
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never forget our loved ones who died that day,'' said
Jeannine Gist, the mother of bombing victim Karen Gist Carr.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton walked with representatives of families,
survivors and rescuers through the 168 chairs, stopping to touch
the calm water of the reflecting pool that flows where a truck bomb
carved a crater into the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are still days when tears fill your eyes, when
you think your heart will surely break,'' Clinton said. ''On those
days in the future, I hope you can come here and find solace in the
memory of your loved ones, in the honor of your fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you can find the strength to live a full and loving
life, free of hatred, which only cripples.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Rogers, former president of the Federal Employees
Credit Union, said the memorial proves ''that acts of terrorism
will not dampen the American spirit -- not in Oklahoma City, not
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A bronze entrance gate inscribed with 9:01, the time just before
the blast, glowed in the evening sun as Clinton officially opened
the memorial by untying symbolic colored ribbons: white for
innocence, purple for courage, yellow for hope and blue for
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, bells tolled at 9:02 a.m., the exact moment
when the fuel-and-fertilizer truck bomb exploded and stripped the
face from the building, turning its nine floors into a tomb of
concrete and steel.
</P>
<P>
   After the names of the victims were read, family members,
survivors and rescuers stepped through one of two golden gates
marking the entrance to the memorial. There were 149 big chairs for
the adult victims and 19 little ones for the children who died.
</P>
<P>
   Joyous music was carried on a gentle Oklahoma breeze as people
made their ways onto the site.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said she was thankful for the towering bronze gates that
stand at the memorial's entrances for ''telling the world why we
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was thankful for the so-called Survivor Tree, an
American elm across the street from the federal building that
survived the bombing, ''for watching over this place and for being
the symbol of continuing life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who lost 18 employees in the blast, said she was most
thankful to have known the victims as well as survivors and rescue
workers who are honored by the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for the opportunity we had to know you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing with Attorney General Janet Reno, called the
bombing an ''attack on all America and every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Oklahoma City residents showed Americans ''how to
stand up to evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the face of evil, an evil that staggers the soul, you've
demonstrated the triumph of the human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks away, Terry Nichols sat isolated in an Oklahoma
County Jail cell awaiting an August preliminary hearing on 160
state counts of first-degree murder in the attack. Nichols and
Timothy McVeigh were convicted in federal court. McVeigh, who was
sentenced to death, is in a federal prison in Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Want Trigger Locks  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three-fourths of Americans, including a
majority of gun owners, favor requiring guns to be sold with
trigger locks, an Associated Press poll found. People had mixed
feelings about whether tougher gun laws or stricter enforcement was
the most effective way to cut violence.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 43 percent thought stricter enforcement was
more likely to cut gun violence, while 33 percent said enacting
tougher gun laws was a better approach. A fifth of those polled
said neither option was best.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more enforcement of existing laws,'' said Donna Mesa,
a reservation agent from Honolulu who was roaming the National Mall
on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. ''We need more law enforcement at
the local level.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   An AP poll taken immediately after the Columbine High School
shootings, which occurred a year ago today, showed that more people
at that time thought tougher laws were the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for better enforcement of current gun laws often is
used by gun control opponents to fight more laws.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Joyce Bell, who was with her 11-year-old daughter near
the Washington Monument on Wednesday, said she wanted better
enforcement and stricter laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want new gun laws. There shouldn't be any guns, in my
opinion,'' the Wilmington, Del., resident said.
</P>
<P>
   The AP poll taken immediately after the shootings a year ago at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., showed just over half of
Americans said more gun laws were more effective, while four in 10
picked tougher enforcement. But by late August, people had shifted
to thinking stricter enforcement was a better way to reduce
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the new poll, six in 10 said they supported stricter gun
control laws, a number that has remained relatively constant in
most polls before and after the Columbine shooting on April 20,
1999, that left 15 dead, including two student gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 women favor tougher gun control laws, while half the
men said they felt that way in the AP poll of 829 people taken
Friday through Tuesday. It had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of those polled said background checks for gun
purchases help reduce the number of crimes committed with guns,
while four of 10 said they do not.
</P>
<P>
   More than four of five women support requiring trigger locks,
while two-thirds of men said they favored the idea. Seven of 10 gun
owners in the poll said they backed trigger locks, while gun owners
were split on the overall question of more gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland enacted a law earlier this month requiring that,
beginning in October, all guns sold in the state must have external
trigger locks. After 2003, new handguns will have to be equipped
with built-in locks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maryland is the only state to have passed such a law,
the trigger lock movement has been gaining momentum nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Teasdale, a printing plant supervisor from Baraboo, Wis.,
was for requirement of trigger locks, saying: ''It would prevent a
lot of kids from getting hurt.'' But he also wants better
enforcement. ''I don't think the laws right now are being
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   While gun legislation has been stymied on Capitol Hill,
President Clinton has been encouraging a growing move in the states
to deal with firearms safety questions.
</P>
<P>
   In March, New York's Republican governor, George Pataki, called
for mandatory trigger locks for all guns. Days later, Smith &AMP;
Wesson -- the nation's largest gun manufacturer -- agreed to provide
external safety locks on all its handguns within 60 days and
internal locks within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Al Gore and George W. Bush, the likely Democratic and
Republican presidential nominees, respectively, support requiring
that trigger locks be sold with guns.
</P>
<P>
   The gun debate was something of a mystery for a young man from
London, visiting Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we read about Columbine and other shootings,'' said sound
engineer Chris Burdon, ''we didn't understand the massive pressure
to maintain this freedom to own guns.''

<HEADLINE> Education Sec. Urges Study Abroad  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department is urging lawmakers
and colleges to promote international education -- U.S. college
students going overseas and foreign students studying here.
Increasing those numbers is essential to future global cooperation
and understanding, said Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many more American college students need to see the world with
a new set of eyes. And the best way for them to see the world as it
really is, is to study overseas,'' Riley said, urging a stronger
national policy on international education. ''The United States has
much to learn, as well as gain, by such an engagement with the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 9 percent of U.S. college students -- about 114,000 --
head abroad each year to study in foreign universities. Riley told
an audience of diplomats and educators at the French Embassy on
Wednesday that he wanted to at least double that number.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the Education and State departments, President
Clinton on Wednesday issued an executive memorandum directing
federal agencies to promote study abroad by U.S. students with
scholarships and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Riley called for more funding for various international efforts:
educating U.S. youngsters in foreign languages, sending more
minority students to study overseas, enlisting volunteers for the
Peace Corps, starting e-mail exchanges with K-12 schools in other
countries, and examining how and why other countries outperform the
United States in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ''By advancing education at all levels -- from teaching a child
to read in Africa or sending a young American off to Paris on a
Fulbright scholarship -- we enrich our world and our nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While many colleges offer students semesters or years of study
abroad, just a few send more than 20 percent of their enrolled
students on such trips, Riley said, urging colleges to raise their
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., sends more than 90
percent of its students overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students may have trouble studying overseas because of
travel costs and the time such study takes away from earning
credits toward dual degrees and specialized programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Cooper, a St. Olaf spokesman, said its students have
little problem receiving credits for graduation because the
college's professors accompany them abroad: ''A lot of our faculty
lead these programs, teach the courses and provide students full
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States should also promote programs that attract
foreign undergraduate and graduate students, Riley said. In
1997-98, their ranks rose just by 2 percent -- to nearly 500,000 --
after growing by nearly 5 percent the previous year. The decline in
the growth prompted worry that the United States might lose
promising students to competing countries such as Australia,
Britain, Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
   ''These students bring at least $9 billion per year to our
economy, and they enrich our campuses and communities in
non-economic ways, too,'' Riley said. ''Other nations are working
very hard to make their exchange opportunities more attractive,
more accessible and less costly. We should not be resting on our
laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said his ideas are based on several overseas trips and
meetings with foreign education ministers. He learned, for example,
that Singapore's students lead the world on international math
tests in part because ninth and 10th graders there do the same work
as 11th and 12th grade students in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could also learn from nations such as France
and Italy where nearly all toddlers attend preschool programs; just
half of 3- to-5-year-olds in the United States do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United States can show other nations how
to educate children with disabilities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Reno Faces Challenge in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- April again is presenting Janet Reno with
tough choices now that a federal appeals court has dumped the
volatile issue of who should care for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
back into her lap.
</P>
<P>
   On her first April 19 as attorney general, in 1993, some 80
people died as the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas,
burned after an FBI tear gas assault she ordered. Two years later
on the same date, two men angered by Waco bombed the Oklahoma City
federal building, killing 168 in the most deadly terrorist attack
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Five years to the day later, Wednesday, Reno was en route to
Oklahoma City to help dedicate a memorial to the bombing victims
when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered her Justice
Department to keep Elian in this country while it considers an
appeal by his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Justice will obey, Reno said. After all, the government and the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, already had offered to keep the
boy here until the court rules next month, even though Juan Miguel
came to the United States to take Elian home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the court in Atlanta ducked the separate issue of who has
custody of Elian in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   So now Reno must decide whether or when to use force to reunite
Elian and Juan Miguel at the risk of triggering violence by Cuban
exiles in Miami, where she grew up and served 15 years as an
elected prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno canceled a planned visit today to a Montana Indian
reservation so she could return to Washington for the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did offer its mediators to help settle the
dispute -- a new option that may attract an attorney general who
earlier Wednesday signaled her willingness to use force -- but only
as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Cuban exiles who fled to Miami from Fidel Castro are
the relatives who have cared for Elian since he was found in the
Atlantic last Thanksgiving. His mother had drowned when the boat on
which they escaped Cuba sank.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Thursday, those relatives have defied Reno's order to
return Elian to Juan Miguel. Earlier they spurned Reno's
face-to-face entreaties to turn over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court order does not preclude me from placing Elian in his
father's care while he stays in the United States,'' Reno said,
promising to ''consider all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   She provided clues to her thinking earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She is ''dead set and determined'' to enforce immigration law
and reunite father and son ''the right way, the safest way, the
least violent way and the soonest way I possibly can under the
law,'' Reno told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was willing to use force to extract the boy from
his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez's Miami home and hundreds of angry
Cuban exiles surrounding it but only ''when there is no other
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the 11th Circuit encouraged both sides to try
another peaceful alternative -- using its mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Mediators try to find common ground to reach voluntary
settlements, so Reno could accept them without the problem of
subordinating federal law that might be posed by arbitrators, who
decide cases. By agreeing to mediation, Reno would put the ball in
the relatives' court.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel's attorney, Gregory Craig, demanded Wednesday
afternoon that she act immediately to end Elian's stay in what
Craig and a pediatrician working for the government called an
abusive environment.
</P>
<P>
   She could do that now. A sketchy government plan calls for U.S.
marshals and immigration agents in minimum force and civilian
clothes, with no drawn guns, to go to the house to get Elian. But
the crowd of exiles motivated by hatred of Castro has vowed to form
a human chain to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could ask a federal court to reinforce her order to Lazaro
to give up the boy, but she already asked the three 11th Circuit
judges to do that and they declined to get into the question.
Justice officials say her order has the force of law anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She could just delay as she did when Lazaro refused to obey her
order to turn the boy over to immigration officers last Thursday.
She could hope that time or an appeals ruling in May changes the
atmosphere in Miami's streets or persuades Lazaro and his family to
negotiate a peaceful transfer.
</P>
<P>
   She bristled when a reporter asked if memory of the Waco deaths
had stayed her hand too long in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Waco, you had people who had killed federal officers and
who had injured others,'' Reno said. ''There's a lot of
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ''If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to
avoid that little boy being hurt or being snatched in a way that
can scar him further, I plead guilty. But at the same time ... I'm
going to enforce the law.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 3, Kings 0  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lights in Staples Center went out for 25
minutes, and the Los Angeles Kings' power play never came on. The
Detroit Red Wings' penalty-killing unit made certain of it.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Verbeek and Larry Murphy scored power-play goals 1:57 apart
late in the first period and Chris Osgood earned his eighth career
playoff shutout as the Red Wings beat the Kings 3-0 Wednesday night
to sweep their first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Fedorov scored an empty-netter on a breakaway with 51
seconds remaining. Some of the numerous red-and-white-clad Red
Wings fans tossed octopuses entwined with strips of red cloth onto
the ice after Fedorov's third goal of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings clinched the Western Conference series in Scotty
Bowman's 100th playoff game as coach. His playoff record of 67-33
in seven seasons with Detroit includes consecutive Stanley Cup
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood made 25 saves for his second 2-0 shutout of the series.
Detroit won the first game by the same score. Stephane Fiset
stopped 25 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were swept out of the playoffs for the seventh time in
franchise history and second in three years, having lost four
straight to St. Louis in 1998. They have lost 12 consecutive
playoff games since winning Game 1 of the 1993 Stanley Cup finals
against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the third period was delayed for 25 minutes when a
computer glitch knocked out the arena's halogen lights, and both
teams were sent back to their dressing rooms. The game's first
delay occurred in the second period when two plexiglass panels
broke, resulting in a seven-minute stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles went 0-for-23 on the power play in the series --
including 0-for-7 Wednesday -- against a Detroit penalty-killing
unit that is tied for first in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were done in by bad penalties once again. They lost
2-1 after two high-sticking penalties led to Detroit power-play
goals in Game 3 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With Jozef Stumpel off for crosschecking Chris Chelios, Verbeek
gave Detroit a 1-0 lead with his only goal of the series at 17:10
of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Mattias Norstrom was called for holding Fedorov's stick, which
set up Murphy's first goal of the series that put Detroit ahead 2-0
at 19:41.
</P>
<P>
   A shot by Brendan Shanahan hit the post, resulting in a wild
six-player crease scramble that caught Fiset at the bottom. With
his legs blocked, Fiset wasn't able to get up and Murphy, a former
King in the playoffs for the 17th consecutive season, fired a
sharply angled shot from the left side into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Kings had power-play chances in the second period, but
never seriously threatened when they failed to get traffic in front
of Osgood and wasted precious seconds setting up shots that went
awry.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0, one of the Kings' few scoring chances in the third
came at 16:27. Osgood made a kick save of Nelson Emerson's shot,
then smothered Emerson's rebound attempt while falling on his back
to force the whistle.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Blues 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Gary Suter's shot from just inside the
blue line skipped into the net with 8:37 remaining and the San Jose
Sharks beat the St. Louis Blues 3-2 Wednesday night to take a 3-1
lead in their playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-seven series moves back to St. Louis on Friday for
Game 5 with the top-seeded Blues, who finished the regular season
with the NHL's best record, on the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, 0-4-1 in five regular season meetings against the
Blues, is one win from duplicating its 1994 feat, when it ousted
Detroit in a first-round series as a No. 8 seed.
</P>
<P>
   The winning shot was set up when Alexander Korolyuk threw the
puck across the ice and it bounded off the boards to Suter, who
wound up for a slap shot near the blue line. The puck took a bounce
off the ice and shot between goalie Roman Turek's stick-side arm
and his leg.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis pulled its goalie with 1:26 left to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-0, the Blues tied it by scoring twice in a 36-second span
of the second period. With the Blues on the power play, Pierre
Turgeon got off a pass to the unguarded Jochen Hecht and Hecht
wristed the puck past goalie Steve Shields from just outside the
crease at 12:54 for his third goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few seconds later, St. Louis evened the score. Jamal
Mayers got off a shot that Shields stopped but before he could
cover up the rebound, Mike Eastwood skated in and put the puck in
the net for his first goal of the series.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had a chance to take the lead in the final seconds of
the period, but Scott Young's shot at the end of a breakaway hit
the right post and bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose went up 2-0 on Mike Ricci's second goal of the series
1:37 into the second. Stephane Matteau picked up the puck in St.
Louis' zone after a Blues turnover and dished off to Ricci. He
skated toward the goal and faked a cross-ice pass to Niklas
Sundstrom, getting Turek leaning toward the opposite end before
slipping the puck into the corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's first goal was set up by a battle along the boards.
Mike Rathje and Chris Pronger both were scrambling for the puck
when it popped loose and dribbled into the left faceoff circle.
Rathje spun around the defender and knocked the puck toward Sturm,
who got enough of his stick on it to drive the puck past Turek for
the score 6:08 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams managed only five shots during the opening period,
with the Sharks going 0-for-3 on the power play and St. Louis
failing to get a shot until 7:04 left. Shields stopped Turgeon's
shot from up close by throwing out his left leg to block it.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles' Orel Hershiser tied a modern-day
major league record by hitting four batters in the Dodgers' 10-3
loss to the Houston Astros on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It took Hershiser, pitching despite a slight groin muscle pull,
just 1 1-3 innings to equal the mark shared by 19 others and last
matched by Omar Olivares of Anaheim on June 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' Richard Hidalgo was hit twice by Hershiser and a
third time by reliever Matt Herges, also tying a major league
record. It was the 20th time in major league history one batter was
hit three times in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously unable to control his throws, Hershiser hit Hidalgo
and Shane Reynolds in the first inning, then hit Jeff Bagwell and
Hidalgo again in the second. Hershiser (1-1) gave up seven runs on
four hits and two walks, and also threw several pitches into the
dirt and several others to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be no animosity toward the 41-year-old pitcher,
and Hidalgo, Reynolds and Bagwell all remained in the game after
being hit.
</P>
<P>
   The five hit batters on one team tied a modern National League
record. The 1969 Atlanta Braves also had five batters hit by
pitches in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey had a two-run double and RBI single for Houston
in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his third RBI on a single, Meluskey left the game
after the top of the second with a mildly sprained left ankle. He
injured his ankle on a freak play where he was looking toward the
outfielder and slowing as he approached third and appeared to bump
his left foot on the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Ken Caminiti went 3-for-3, drove in one run and scored
two. Roger Cedeno also had three hits, with one RBI and one run
scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' only run off Reynolds (3-0) was Gary Sheffield's
homer, his sixth, leading off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds held Los Angeles to four hits in six innings, with two
walks and three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles added a run in the ninth on Chad Kreuter's homer off
Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The all-time record for hit batters is six, by John Grimes
in 1897. ... Hidalgo, hit three times, was the only Astros starter
without a hit. ... Larry Dierker became only the fifth manager in
Astros history to be at the helm for 500 games. The others were
Bill Virdon (1,066), Art Howe (810), Harry Walker (708, and Bob
Lillis (537). Dierker's record is 289-211. ... The Dodgers already
have a rainout and a ''snowout'' to make up. They will make up the
game lost to snow April 9 at New York with a contest against the
Mets on Monday. Monday's rainout against the Astros in Los Angeles
will be made up June 8. ... Houston's Julio Lugo had his first
major league hit, an infield single in the eighth inning. ... The
Dodgers' Eric Gagne, recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque earlier
this week, gets his seventh major league start Friday at
Cincinnati.

   The Avalanche still hold a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 Western
Conference series and could close it out by winning Game 5 Friday
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But the fourth game was sweet redemption for the Coyotes, who
followed coach Bob Francis' advice and improved their play each
game after a 6-3 debacle in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't pay off until this one, easily the best effort by
Burke and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had a 3-0 lead early after goals by Trevor Letowski,
Travis Green and Renberg.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Hogue assisted on the first two scores.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's inspired goaltending helped the Coyotes hang on despite
intense pressure after the Avs had to abandon their series-long
strategy of sitting on a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Deadmarsh, who scored the winner in Game 3, made it close
by scoring with 3:58 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped the puck with his chest while crossing the slot and
flipped a back-hander to beat Burke on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took 19 shots in the second period, but only managed a
power-play goal by Dave Andreychuk, who deflected a slap shot by
Adam Foote 6:03 into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Burke recovered to make several spectacular stops, including a
glove save on a shot by Stephan Yelle on a 3-on-1 late in the
second and a chest rejection against Andreychuk during another
power play 8:00 into the third.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Burke's first in the postseason since April 24,
1998, when he was with Philadelphia, and improved his career record
to 11-17.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy, the NHL career leader with 113 wins, had 28 saves
but was stunned by Phoenix's early onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes vowed to come out strong, and outshot Colorado 15-6
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive intensity seemed to changed their luck, too. After
complaining about strange bounces for three games, the Coyotes got
just their second lead in the series on an unusual score by
Letowski.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie center, battling for the puck behind the net, fired a
hard pass out toward the slot. But it hit the back of Roy's stick
at the edge of the crease and angled in 3:31 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Green made it 2-0 -- the first time Phoenix enjoyed the luxury of
a two-goal lead -- when he scored with 2:28 left in the period after
a beautiful display of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Drake took the puck from Joe Sakic along the boards and
back-handed a pass to Hogue, who sent it to Green for a one-timer
in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Renberg also scored from the slot after a pass from Keith
Tkachuk.

<HEADLINE> IOC Set To Shell Out More Money  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Summer Olympic sports are due for a
sizable increase in their share of revenues from the Sydney Games,
with track and field again taking the biggest slice.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 sports federations represented on the program in Sydney
were to meet with International Olympic Committee leaders today to
find out how much money they will get from television and marketing
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1996 Atlanta Games, the federations -- then numbering 26
-- received $88.6 million from the IOC. This time, the figure will
be well over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-2000 period covering the Sydney Games has generated
more than $3.5 billion in revenues from television rights,
sponsorships and other marketing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the total goes to the Sydney organizing
committee, with the rest divided among the IOC, national Olympic
committees and sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all sports are equal.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta, $56.6 million in TV revenue was divided equally
among the 26 sports. But $32 million in marketing funds was split
into four categories based on television ratings, ticket sales and
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's
world governing body, was in the premier category and received
$8.675 million from the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball, soccer, gymnastics, swimming and volleyball were in
the second group, with each getting $4.675 million.
</P>
<P>
   The third bracket consisted of rowing, cycling, equestrian,
handball, tennis and field hockey. Each was given $3.175 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sports in the fourth and last tier got $2.675 million each. They
were badminton, baseball, boxing, canoeing, fencing, judo,
wrestling, modern pentathlon, sailing, softball, table tennis,
archery, shooting and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon and taekwondo are the two new sports for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the Association of Summer Olympic Federations
(ASOIF) was led by Primo Nebiolo, the autocratic Italian who was
president of the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo lobbied aggressively for more money for the federations
and particularly for track and field, considered the marquee sport
at the summer games. He described the IAAF's share from Atlanta as
''peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo died last year. His elected successor as ASOIF
president, rowing federation president Dennis Oswald of
Switzerland, has taken a much more conciliatory approach in
negotiations with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   According to Olympic sources, the increases for Sydney will
range from 56 percent for sports in the bottom group to 100 percent
or more for the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC announced that independent observers will
monitor drug testing during the Sydney Games in a move to eliminate
suspicions of coverups and faulty procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The observers will be appointed by the new World Anti-Doping
Agency to watch over the entire drug testing system during the
Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games.
</P>
<P>
   The observers will be present at all stages, including the
collection and analysis of urine samples and disciplinary hearings
for athletes who test positive.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time that independent delegates will
observe testing at the Olympics. Until now, the IOC has been the
sole overseer of drug controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Athletes want controls to be fair,'' said Jacques Rogge, vice
chairman of the IOC medical commission. ''They feel that doping
controls are generally not correct. They fear cover-ups. There is a
general suspicion among athletes and part of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also promised to speed procedures to introduce blood
tests in Sydney if a reliable method for detecting the banned
endurance-boosting hormone EPO is developed.
</P>
<P>
   Australian researchers have told the IOC they can produce a
reliable test by early July. If that's the case, there could still
be enough time to complete scientific and legal validation of the
test before the start of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The odds are 50-50 we'll have an EPO test for Sydney,'' Rogge
said. ''It's a race against time.''

<HEADLINE> Love: Wins Will Come With Patience  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Davis Love III has been so close to
winning on the PGA Tour the last two years that pressing for a
victory has become part of his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are always one swing or one putt that I'm not 100
percent thinking about,'' Love said prior to teeing off in today's
first round of the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic. ''I am
thinking maybe if I made a birdie, I will be in good shape.
Thinking about winning is maybe popping into my head a little too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Love figured his career would take off after winning the 1997
PGA Championship, shedding the title of the best golfer who hadn't
won a major.
</P>
<P>
   But Love has won just once (MCI Classic in 1998) since that
major title and is in the midst of a 24-month stretch without a
victory -- his worst drought since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am the most experienced mid-30s guy out here, and guys seem
to win a lot in their mid-30s, and around 40 seems like when guys
hit their prime in the majors,'' said Love, second to Tiger Woods
on the career money list with $13.7 million. ''Hopefully, I'm
hitting my prime. But I just happen to be hitting it when there are
a couple of young guys hitting it early.''
</P>
<P>
   During his recent slump, Love has seen younger players like
Woods, David Duval, Justin Leonard and Phil Mickelson pass him by.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like the fact that Tiger has won more tournaments than
me and I've been out here this long,'' Love said of his 13 wins in
14 years on tour. ''Phil Mickelson has won more tournaments than
me. I want to get some wins, and each week is very, very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's problems appear more mental than physical. He has four
top four finishes this season, is third in scoring average and
birdies, and 10th in driving distance and putting. But there have
been no strong finishes and no wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mind game is the biggest part of things out here,'' Tom
Lehman said. ''If he would just let himself be Davis Love, he would
win more. A lot of it has to do with expectations -- from the fans,
from the media. Most of the time you can handle the expectations
you place on yourself. Davis will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Love said he planned to call sports psychologist Bob Rotella
this week to try to get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what he's going to say, but it's good to hear him say
it,'' Love said. ''It's like going in with a runny nose. The doctor
will say, 'Well you've got a cold.' I am thinking way too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Love is also 0-4 against the game's No. 1 player in recent
head-to-head competition, and he lost to Woods in a playoff at Las
Vegas in 1996 that gave Woods his first tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave Tiger his first event with a very unlike Davis Love
shot by missing the green with a 9-iron,'' Frank Nobilo said.
''Since then, everybody is putting the monkey back on Davis. I
think it has affected a lot of players who think they've been
demoted for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players on the tour criticized Love last month when he said
Woods was nearly impossible to beat. Others were surprised the
talented Love would make what they viewed as defeatist comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just kept saying, 'Show me who has put four good rounds up
against him,''' Love said. ''Hal Sutton. Darren Clarke played a
nice stretch to beat him. But not many guys have put four good
rounds up against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods last beat Love a month ago at the Bay Hill Invitational,
shooting a final-round 70 while Love shot a 72 and lost by four
shots. Woods is not playing in this week's event at Forest Oaks
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think those (NASCAR) teams last year were going, 'OK,
whatever Jeff Gordon is doing, we won't worry about that. What is
the guy that's 15th doing?''' Love said. ''No, it's what do you
have to do to beat the No. 1 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Love, he believes it's saying patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible to dominate for bursts, but not for extended
periods -- there is too much attention, too much pressure,'' Love
said. ''But Tiger has done the best job in a long time of
sustaining it.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs, Hornets Clinch Homecourt  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs and Charlotte Hornets will open the
playoffs at home, and the Detroit Pistons will get the postseason
matchup they wanted -- Miami rather than Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, Hornets and Pistons were among the few teams with
something to gain on the final night of the regular season, and all
of them did.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio overcame a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to beat
the Los Angeles Lakers 103-98 in overtime despite the absence of
Tim Duncan. The defending champions will open the best-of-five
first round at the Alamodome against the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets also needed a victory to clinch homecourt advantage
for their series against Philadelphia, and the Hornets got it by
defeating the Miami Heat 83-73.
</P>
<P>
   It was Charlotte's 30th home win of the season against 11
losses, and coach Paul Silas said he hoped to continue that
dominance in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too many teams won 30 games at home this year,'' he said.
''Getting the homecourt advantage is good, but you still have to
play. We've got to maintain a homecourt edge that we have right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons needed only to beat the Chicago Bulls to lock up the
seventh seed, and they did it with ease, 112-91.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we wanted -- a trip to Miami,'' said Jerry
Stackhouse, who led Detroit with 21 points and seven assists.
''We've got some guys who are banged up, and they will feel a lot
better hanging out in the sun than in the cold. Hopefully, that
will be enough to give us a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (42-40) went 2-2 against Miami and 1-3 against
top-seeded Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons wanted the matchup with Miami because Heat point
guard Tim Hardaway is expected to miss the series with a foot
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we can start concentrating on Miami,'' Pistons coach
George Irvine said. ''That's a great team. You have to focus on
Alonzo (Mourning), but I respect the whole team. Their bench can do
a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs begin Saturday with Heat-Pistons, SuperSonics-Jazz,
Suns-Spurs and 76ers-Hornets. Sunday's games are Lakers-Kings,
Trail Blazers-Timberwolves, Pacers-Bucks and Knicks-Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   None of the statistical races was up for grabs on the final
night.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal won the scoring title going away over Allen
Iverson of Philadelphia, finishing with a 29.7 average to Iverson's
28.4. The two had been neck-and-neck in the scoring race through
March, but Iverson's production was limited over the last several
games by foot and elbow injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter scored only 13 points in Toronto's game at Orlando
to drop from third in the scoring race to fourth -- one-tenth of a
point behind Detroit's Grant Hill's 25.8 average.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek of Utah finish with the third-highest free-throw
percentage in league history behind Calvin Murphy's .958 in 1980-81
and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's .956 in 1993-94, going 3-for-3 against
Sacramento to finish 171-for-180 (95.0 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Davis of Dallas did not attempt a 3-pointer in the
Mavericks' final game and finished with a league-leading percentage
of .491.
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo of Atlanta won his first career rebounding
title, while Jason Kidd led the league in assists, Eddie Jones in
steals and Alonzo Mourning in blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Charles Barkley made one last appearance for the
Rockets and had two points, one rebound, one assist and a blocked
shot in six first-half minutes. He suffered what was thought to be
a career-ending knee injury in early December, but recovered
quickly enough to go out on his own terms -- standing up rather than
being carried off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad day for me, I've been playing basketball since I
was nine years old and now I'm not going to be playing anymore,''
Barkley said.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the sidelines for the second half, a fluffy
recliner awaited him.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills One in Arizona  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who feuded with a retirement
community association barged into the group's meeting armed with a
rifle and handguns and opened fire Wednesday, police said. A woman
was killed and four others injured.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Richard Glassel, 61, a former resident at
Ventana Lakes community in suburban Phoenix. Neighbors and
witnesses said Glassel had past run-ins with the community
association, which was meeting Wednesday afternoon at the community
recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel was tackled and subdued by people in the center when his
gun jammed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't holler or anything, he just started firing,'' said
Sheldon Stover, who helped restrain Glassel.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the community association said Glassel had
feuded with the group over the way groundskeepers took care of
shrubs and other plants. He didn't want the bushes around his house
neatly manicured, said attorney Penny Koepke.
</P>
<P>
   The association sued and obtained a restraining order in 1998 to
keep Glassel from harassing or intimidating the groundskeepers
after he allegedly shoved a property manager, Koepke said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Glassel also picketed the builder's sales office daily
during part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another association attorney, Curtis Ekmark, said a bank had
foreclosed on Glassel's Ventana Lakes home last year and court
records show the house was auctioned. He said Glassel had been
quiet for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just a total shock,'' Ekmark said.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents said Glassel vandalized his home after the
foreclosure, though police would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Russ Scarborough also said community residents
reported they hadn't seen Glassel's wife, Susan, in about eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Glassel pulled up to the Ventana Lakes Yacht Club in
a U-Haul truck, went into the community association meeting and
began firing.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Dorsch, a 67-year-old resident of Ventana Lakes, said she
was at the pool behind the club with her grandchildren when people
came out of the building screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were fighting with each other, but then they
said a man had a gun,'' she said. ''I heard the shots, 'Pop, pop,
pop.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nila Lynn, 69, who suffered a gunshot wound to the back, died at
John C. Lincoln Hospital-North Mountain, said Scarborough.
</P>
<P>
   Esther LaPlante, 75, was in extremely critical condition at St.
Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center. Paul Ettinger, 69, was in
serious condition at St. Joseph's with a bullet wound to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yankowski, 69, was treated at Lincoln Hospital and
released. Gilbert McCurdy, 63, had surgery on his foot and was
listed in fair condition at Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The community has about 1,400 homes amid man-made lakes, tennis
courts and grassy common areas.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came a day after a man opened fire at a senior
citizens apartment complex in Michigan, killing two women and
critically wounding another. In that case, authorities said, the
gunman opened fire during a meeting called because the man had been
accused of using vulgar language.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nuclear Cleanup Costs Rise  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department says it now has a better
idea how much it will cost to clean up the environmental damage
from America's nuclear weapons program: Between $168 billion and
$212 billion through 2070.
</P>
<P>
   That's up to 44 percent more than the department estimated two
years ago. Seventeen of the 113 sites nationwide will take as much
as a decade longer to clean up, while the department hopes to
finish work at five sites more quickly than earlier forecast,
according to a new agency report.
</P>
<P>
   DOE officials say the changes in cost and time occurred because
they now have a better handle on the scope of the contamination and
what is required to clean up the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers this year were more accurate and realistic. That
was the difference,'' department spokesman Tom Welch said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The current and former nuclear weapons sites include some of the
most highly radioactive areas in the country -- Hanford in
Washington state, Savannah River in South Carolina, Rocky Flats
near Denver and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   DOE is responsible for cleaning up 1.7 trillion gallons of
contaminated groundwater, 100 million gallons of highly radioactive
liquid, 2,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel and 18 metric tons of
weapons-grade plutonium at the sites.
</P>
<P>
   The increased cost estimates contained in the report, which was
released Friday, are not surprising, said David Adelman, a lawyer
for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DOE has had to admit some failures ... and be a little
more realistic about the complexity of the problem,'' said Adelman,
who monitors the nuclear cleanup for the environmental group. Those
failures, he said, included attempts to use new cleanup technology
at Hanford and Idaho that did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Adelman also noted the cleanup schedules do not include the
long-term monitoring and security needed at the sites after the
department's planned cleanups are finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way we look at it, the dates for cleanup have been
absurdly optimistic given the complexity of the issues and the
magnitude of the problems,'' Adelman said.
</P>
<P>
   New estimates for some of the major sites include:
</P>
<P>
   -- $55.6 billion to clean up Hanford, up from a 1998 estimate of
$54.8 billion. The estimated end of the cleanup in 2046 was
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   -- $36.8 billion to clean up Savannah River, up from $29.7
billion in 1998. The cleanup deadline of 2038 was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   -- $21.4 billion to clean up the Idaho laboratory, up from $16.3
billion. The deadline of 2050 was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   -- $7.7 billion to clean up Rocky Flats, where the plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons were made until 1989. The latest
estimate is up from $7.3 billion in 1998. The department hopes to
finish the cleanup by 2006 instead of 2010.

<HEADLINE> Marbles Dream Team Seeks World Cup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Md. (AP) -- Ben Nelson can do wild things with a
marble. With a flip of his wrist and a snap of his fingers, the
small ball zooms away. Then, it rolls right back as if tethered by
elastic cord.
</P>
<P>
   That psychs out other players, says Ben 16, the 1998 U.S. boys
national champion. He gets down on all fours to demonstrate his
mastery of the backspin technique: Twist, flip, snap. Twist, flip,
snap.
</P>
<P>
   Ben will need all his tricks Friday in London at the World
Marbles Cup when the U.S. team -- nine teen-agers and a 35-year-old
man -- go knuckle-to-knuckle with British men in their 40s and 50s
who have honed their skills outside pubs.
</P>
<P>
   Will the kids be all right? Coach Jeff Kimmell hasn't a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the English team might be a little shy at first,
playing with a bunch of kids. But once they lose a couple matches,
they'll be shocked at how good the kids are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They're good, all right. The U.S. shooters -- from Maryland,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- include six national champions and
three from a team that beat the Brits in 1996 at an international
tournament in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But the cup is the granddaddy of marbles tournaments in a
country where the game dates back to when Julius Caesar's soldiers
brought it from Rome. The last Americans to win the cup were from
Kentucky, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A German national team also will compete in the tournament
outside the Greyhound Pub in Tinsley Green. The English regard the
Americans as more serious contenders, but they aren't losing any
sleep over it, according to Sam McCarthy-Fox, a tournament
official.
</P>
<P>
   ''What, them Yanks?'' he said. ''Good luck to them, that's what
I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmell's players have been practicing for months on the English
game, which differs substantially from Ringer, the official game of
the U.S. National Marbles Tournament held each June in Wildwood,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ringer is played in a ring 10 feet wide with 13 marbles. The
English ring is just 6 feet wide, and the game uses 49 marbles. The
objective is the same: to knock a majority of marbles out of the
ring by bumping them with a larger shooting marble -- called an
agate by Americans and a tolley by the Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the biggest difference: Ringer is played on a smooth
cement surface whereas the English game is played on sand, a
quarter- to a half-inch deep. The sand presents resistance,
requiring players to use brute force as well as finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to control your marble. It's a power game,'' said
U.S. team member Bob Darr, a 35-year-old bakery truck driver who
was chosen partly for his expertise in the English style.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy-Fox said the home court and its typically drizzly
conditions should give the Englishmen an edge: ''Basically, they're
used to the rain, they're used to the cold weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup winner receives no cash. But Kimmell hopes
publicity about the tournament will boost recognition of marbles,
which he is proposing as a demonstration sport in the 2004 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the coach isn't worried about his lads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember the U.S. dream team of men's basketball in the 1992
Olympics?'' he asked. ''This is the dream team of marbles.''

<HEADLINE> Arab Nations Urged To Pressure Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has urged
Arab countries to keep up pressure on Iraq to account for the 605
Kuwaitis missing since Baghdad invaded the small state in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The recent exchanges of Iraqi and Iranian prisoners of war
''gives a beam of hope that similar developments may happen in
regard to those missing in the aftermath of the Gulf War,'' Annan
said Wednesday in a report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The report was Annan's first since he appointed a special
coordinator on the issue, former Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov,
in February to try to energize efforts to account for the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Vorontsov visited Kuwait this month and met with families of the
605 people still missing from Iraq's seven-month occupation. Iraq
has not responded to Vorontsov's requests to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad maintains that it has released all war prisoners, but
lost track of 127 in an uprising after the war. It has withdrawn
from an international committee looking into the issue, accusing
Kuwait of failing to account for 1,150 missing Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait says it has received case files on only 70 Iraqis and is
investigating those, even though the government does not consider
itself legally responsible for Iraqis who disappeared while Kuwait
was under occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Annan noted that Arab officials told Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein ''that progress in solving the issue of Kuwaiti missing
persons would improve Iraq's stance in the world and, in
particular, ameliorate the political climate among the Arab
states.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan urged the Arab states to ''continue through
all available channels their efforts aimed at the speediest
resolution of the humanitarian issue of missing persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan also said Wednesday that he had urged Iraqi officials to
meet with the new chief weapons inspector, but they refused, saying
it would signal acceptance of a U.N. plan to resume arms searches.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general said he raised the issue during talks last
week with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf in Havana,
where both were attending a summit of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Annan noted that Iraq has ''rejected'' the December resolution
creating the new weapons inspection agency, headed by Hans Blix of
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of U.S.
and British airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq for failing to
cooperate with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Top Iraqi officials have said Baghdad would not accept new U.N.
weapons searches, but others have left open the possibility of
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council created the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission to replace the U.N. Special Commission,
which was tarnished by allegations that its inspectors spied on
Iraq on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Commission had been verifying the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait cannot be lifted until Iraq is reported free of its
banned weapons.

Reno Takes Center Stage in Elian Saga

   MIAMI (AP) -- For the first time in days, the next step in the Elian Gonzalez
custody dispute belongs to Attorney General Janet Reno. In the latest victory
for Miami relatives of the 6-year-old boy, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said Elian must remain in the United States until the
court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing. The order, however, does
not prevent the government from reuniting Elian with his father in the United
States. The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has been waiting in Washington since

   ROME (AP) -- Emboldened by gains in local races and eager to parlay those

early elections now that Premier Massimo D'Alema has quit. The decision belongs
to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who accepted D'Alema's resignation Wednesday.
Ciampi, however, has said he wants a May 21 referendum on changing the electoral
system to go forward. Since a national election would block the referendum,
Ciampi is expected to search instead for a new premier. The president plans to
spend Thursday and Friday consulting with Italy's political leaders.

<HEADLINE> Black DAR Member Challenges Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A black member of the Daughters of the
American Revolution says the organization has reneged on an
agreement she made with it nearly 16 years ago to document black
veterans of the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it is, 16 years and they haven't finished the job,'' Lena
Santos Ferguson said as the DAR opened its annual ''Continental
Congress'' in the capital this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson and the organization agreed that the DAR would complete
research on black veterans of the Revolution when she joined in
1984. The DAR was supposed to identify the estimated 5,000 black
American soldiers who served during the war but it has identified
less than 30 percent of them, said Maurice A. Barboza, Ferguson's
nephew and spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The DAR said it was working on bringing about greater awareness
of black contributions to the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the publication project is still ongoing, the
National Society of the DAR has genuinely attempted and continues
to promote the awareness of the contributions of black patriots,''
DAR lawyer Christine Kearns said. ''The NSDAR has met each and
every one of its commitments to Ms. Ferguson.''
</P>
<P>
   The DAR has published nine booklets on the military service of
blacks in the revolution. A tenth, covering the state of
Pennsylvania, goes to print soon, and one will be completed soon on
New York state, Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1890, the DAR brings together women whose ancestors
served in or helped George Washington's army win independence from
Britain more than a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The British also used black troops, recruited with a promise of
the freedom they only won in the United States in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, a retired parochial school administrator from
Washington, was denied membership when she first tried to join in
1980 and says it was because she is black.
</P>
<P>
   Her great great great great grandfather -- ''four greats,'' she
says -- was Jonah Gay, who died in 1795, a member of the Committee
of Correspondence in Meduncook, Maine. These committees kept up
contacts before the Revolution among resisters to British rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was white -- my grandfather was white,'' she said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She was admitted to the DAR after media reports of her failed
attempts to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The DAR has 172,000 members, but officials say they do not know
how many are black. Applications for membership have no question
about a candidate's race, said Mary Ann Wright of the DAR
Development Department. Officials noted that black members took
part in this week's Congress and call Ferguson a ''valued'' member.
</P>
<P>
   The DAR's headquarters near the White House includes a museum, a
genealogical library and Constitution Hall, where the current
meeting is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 the DAR refused to let contralto Marian Anderson sing in
Constitution Hall because she was black. First lady Eleanor
Roosevelt resigned from the organization in protest and Anderson
gave her recital to an audience of 75,000 at the Lincoln Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Mark U.S. Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO ZUNIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They came to the bombing range with
a white wooden cross and the certainty that the U.S. Navy would
evict them in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, the civil disobedience campaign on Puerto Rico's
Vieques Island continues -- and its leaders are savoring their
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really thought the Navy was going to get us out of here. But
it seems they thought that we were going to leave in two or three
days, and that was their mistake,'' said fisherman Carlos Zenon,
who helped found one protest camp on the range with his sons
Casimar, 20, and Yabureibo, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Four other groups occupy camps on the range to stop bombing.
They include Puerto Rico's Independence Party, church leaders and
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began after two 500-pound bombs dropped by a Marine
Corps jet missed their target and killed civilian security guard
David Sanes Rodriguez on April 19, 1999. The Navy suspended its
exercises on Vieques after Sanes' death.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the anniversary of Sanes' death, mourners laid
flowers on his grave and demanded the Navy's eviction. Elsewhere in
Puerto Rico, protesters held vigils and church services.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy held a church service and observed a minute of silence
at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, the sprawling base in eastern
Puerto Rico that administers the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   The militants have refused to leave despite an agreement between
President Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello to allow the
Navy to resume exercises for at least three more years using
''dummy'' bombs. Under the agreement, Vieques' residents will
decide in a referendum whether the Navy can resume live fire
training or must abandon the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy warns that without Vieques -- used to prepare for every
U.S. military conflict since World War II -- lives could be lost in
this age of precision bombing. It's the only place where the
Atlantic Fleet can hold simultaneous air, land and sea operations
with live munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Zenon moved in on April 21, 1999, setting up camp in a
bombed-out tank with a couple of hammocks on a scrubby hill
protesters have christened Mount David, in Sanes' memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-four hours a day from April 21 there have been people
here,'' Zenon said. The number can reach into the dozens, depending
on weather conditions that can stop fishing boats bringing in
supplies and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I usually take advantage of holidays to come,'' university
professor Jose Aponte said as he washed a cup with rainwater
collected for daily chores.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters can see the entire bombing range from their perch: a
dry lagoon pockmarked with craters and bombed-out vehicles, a
turquoise blue bay, and the observation post where Sanes died. At
the post, military officials using binoculars watch the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy offered us another place for the camp because Mount
David was their main target, at the heart of their exercises,''
said Zenon, 63, who has been fighting for the Navy to leave since
the 1970s. Protesters rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed concerned about the risk of being arrested. ''I
will believe in the arrests when the helicopter lands and the
federal marshals come out,'' Aponte said.
</P>
<P>
   What does worry some is their health. No one seems to know for
sure what hazardous materials have been used at the decades-old
bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Zenon said his son Casimar has developed a rash-like skin
infection at the camp -- but plans to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''He says that if he has to pay with death for Vieques, he will
do it,'' Zenon said. ''That makes me feel very proud.''

<HEADLINE> Food Stamp Eligibility Changes Urged  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Army official suggested pushing some of
the country's lowest-paid soldiers off of food stamps -- by making
their incomes look higher on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen rejected the proposal
Wednesday, saying it had ''sent mixed signals ... to men and women
in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   In a three-paragraph statement, Cohen said he will work with the
Agriculture Department to try to get a change in the way soldiers'
income is calculated -- a move that could make more eligible for the
help. The announcement followed a howl of disapproval by soldiers
and others over an earlier idea that would have recalculated the
income of service members already getting foods stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The recalculation would make their income look higher on paper,
and so get them kicked off assistance rolls. Critics suggested the
discounted idea was intended to paper over a problem that has
caused embarrassment for the military -- the specter of having
uniformed people in the service of the country forced to seek
outside help in feeding their families.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cohen had never approved the earlier proposal, he said
Wednesday that he wanted ''to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I support military men and women receiving every federal
benefit to which they are entitled,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says about 6,300 people in the military were on
food stamps in 1998, compared with 12,000 in 1995. It says the base
salary going into effect in January for a sergeant with six years
in the service will be $1,691 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a suggestion by Bernard Rostker, the army
undersecretary nominated to become the Pentagon's top personnel
official. Rostker said in a Senate committee confirmation hearing
last week that methods for calculating income were different for
those living off-base and those living on-base -- an inequity he
wanted to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, people who live off-base get a housing
allowance and that money is added onto their pay to calculate their
income. Those living on-base get free housing; there is no housing
allowance given, so none calculated on their income -- making them
look poorer on paper than their counterparts, and eligible for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Rostker said he wanted to start counting the value of on-base
housing as income -- a move that would have knocked most of those
on-base and receiving food stamps into a higher income level and
made them ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he didn't know Cohen's position on Rostker's
idea, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon sought in a briefing with
reporters Tuesday to defend the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue here is equity,'' said Bacon, explaining in detail
that 60 percent of food stamps go to those living on base as part
of the current system.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said Wednesday he would ask the Agriculture Department
to change the rules so housing allowances paid to people off-base
would not be counted in their income.
</P>
<P>
   If such a change were approved, which is far from certain, some
soldiers will appear to be lower paid than they now appear on
paper, and so become eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy swirled Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore
weighed in, saying he opposed reducing the number eligible but
planned to make his own recommendations to ''eliminate the kinds of
conditions that require soldiers to make ends meet by relying on
food stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has deplored
the idea that any U.S. soldier would have to receive such
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Panel: US Needs New Security Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Changes in U.S. security strategy are needed
to prepare America for new threats in the 21st Century, an
independent advisory panel told the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are far less secure today than they believe
themselves to be,'' former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire,
co-chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security, said in
releasing the report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It said U.S. forces need to be able to deploy quickly and be
able to handle missions ranging from humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief to major wars.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Pentagon strategy for fighting two wars at
once, such as in the Persian Gulf and in Korea, is outdated and
leaves America unready to deal with those '''varied and complex
contingencies now occurring and likely to increase in the years
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is changing fast and if the U.S. government does not
change with it, it may find itself forced into one bewildered
reaction after another,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''America must not exhaust itself by limitless commitments,''
the report said. In particular, the United States must use ''a
finer calculus'' to decide whether the benefits of military
intervention abroad make the action worth it, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's defense policy has been under
attack in Congress from those who feel that the increasing use of
U.S. troops on overseas humanitarian or peace-keeping missions has
sapped the military's readiness for waging war.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the United States needs:
</P>
<P>
   --Nuclear capabilities to deter and protect the United States and
its allies from attack.
</P>
<P>
   --Conventional forces for major wars.
</P>
<P>
   --Rapidly deployable, lighter forces for smaller conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   --A homeland security force.
</P>
<P>
   --Units trained for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the second in a three-phase study on security for
the 21st century. Last year the commission outlined a vision of the
future and next year it is to give specific recommendations on how
U.S. security structures should be changed to meet future needs.
</P>
<P>
   Established by Congress in 1998, the panel also includes former
senator Gary Hart of Colorado, former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger, former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young and retired Army
Gen. John Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   They made several dozen policy suggestions, including that the
United States make nonproliferation of weapons a high priority,
strengthen cooperation with other nations against terrorism, build
a domestic defense against missile attacks and draw other nations,
especially China, Russia and India, more into the ''mainstream of
the emerging international system.''
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, the report said the nation ''must make it a
national priority to improve the quality of primary and secondary
education, particularly in mathematics and the sciences.'' And the
National Guard must be trained and equipped to assume ''a
significant role in defending the homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The strategy outlined here ... differs from the strategic
habit of the past half-century,'' the commission concluded. ''It
attempts to clarify U.S. strategy and purposes and to match them
with a prudent sense of limits.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population at New High  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with falling crime rates and slowing
prison population growth, the number of Americans behind bars will
likely surpass 2 million by the end of next year, Justice
Department officials say.
</P>
<P>
   At the middle of last year, prisons and jails held 1,860,520
adults, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. With an
increase of 60,000 prisoners over the previous year, the United
States may have matched or even surpassed Russia as the country
with the highest rate of incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   The growth rate of state and federal prison populations slowed
to 4.4 percent in 1999, the lowest since the 2.3 percent growth in
1979. Much of the decline was at the state level, since the growth
rate for federal prisons actually increased to 9.6 percent last
year from 7.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the federal system, growth is being driven by drug law
violators and immigration violators coming in,'' said statistician
Allen J. Beck, author of the bureau report issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. prison population has grown steadily for more than a
quarter-century, helped by increased drug prosecutions and tougher
policies against all offenders. Beck said that if the current
growth continues, the total prison and jail population would likely
hit 2 million in the second half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the latest figures in light of the current U.S.
population, one of every 147 residents was an inmate in an adult
jail or prison at the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, one of every 146 people was behind bars in 1998, the
last year for which figures were available, according to The
Sentencing Project, a private group that advocates alternatives to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's U.S. total included more than 1.1 million state
prisoners, about 606,000 men and women in local jails, and about
118,000 federal inmates. Prisons and jails held fewer than 800,000
people in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons usually hold convicted criminals sentenced to terms
longer than one year, while jails generally keep inmates with
shorter sentences or awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates have been declining since 1993, but longer
sentences, especially for drug crimes during the 1980s and for
violent crimes in the 1990s, have driven prisoner populations. More
mandatory minimum sentences and less generous parole have also
contributed to the increase. The prisoner population last declined
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the report:
</P>
<P>
   --The number of women in U.S. prisons doubled since 1990 to more
than 87,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --Among black men in their 20s or early 30s, about 11 percent
were in prison or jail. For the same age group, 4 percent of
Hispanic men and 1.5 percent of white men were prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   --About 12 percent of the people supervised by local jail
authorities were monitored outside of jail cells in programs like
home detention and community service.
</P>
<P>
   --Louisiana had the highest total incarceration rate, with more
than 1 percent of the state's population imprisoned. Texas and
Georgia followed closely behind.
</P>
<P>
   --California had the highest total number of prisoners, with more
than 239,000, while Vermont had the fewest, with only about 1,200.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills Two in Arizona  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who feuded with a retirement
community association barged into the group's meeting armed with a
rifle and handguns and opened fire Wednesday, police said. Two
women were killed and four others injured.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Richard Glassel, 61, a former resident at
Ventana Lakes community in suburban Phoenix. Neighbors and
witnesses said Glassel had past run-ins with the community
association, which was meeting Wednesday afternoon at the community
recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel was tackled and subdued by people in the center when his
gun jammed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't holler or anything, he just started firing,'' said
Sheldon Stover, who helped restrain Glassel.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the community association said Glassel had
feuded with the group over the way groundskeepers took care of
shrubs and other plants. He didn't want the bushes around his house
neatly manicured, said attorney Penny Koepke.
</P>
<P>
   The association sued and obtained a restraining order in 1998 to
keep Glassel from harassing or intimidating the groundskeepers
after he allegedly shoved a property manager, Koepke said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Glassel also picketed the builder's sales office daily
during part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another association attorney, Curtis Ekmark, said a bank had
foreclosed on Glassel's Ventana Lakes home last year and court
records show the house was auctioned. He said Glassel had been
quiet for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just a total shock,'' Ekmark said.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents said Glassel vandalized his home after the
foreclosure, though police would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Russ Scarborough also said community residents
reported they hadn't seen Glassel's wife, Susan, in about eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Glassel pulled up to the Ventana Lakes Yacht Club in
a U-Haul truck, went into the community association meeting and
began firing.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Dorsch, a 67-year-old resident of Ventana Lakes, said she
was at the pool behind the club with her grandchildren when people
came out of the building screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were fighting with each other, but then they
said a man had a gun,'' she said. ''I heard the shots, 'Pop, pop,
pop.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nila Lynn, 69, who suffered a gunshot wound to the back, died at
John C. Lincoln Hospital-North Mountain, said Scarborough.
</P>
<P>
   Esther LaPlante, 75, who was shot in the head and shoulder, died
late Monday night at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, said
spokeswoman Catherine Menor. Paul Ettinger, 69, was in serious
condition at St. Joseph's with a bullet wound to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yankowski, 69, was treated at Lincoln Hospital and
released. Gilbert McCurdy, 63, had surgery on his foot and was
listed in fair condition at Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The community has about 1,400 homes amid man-made lakes, tennis
courts and grassy common areas.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came a day after a man opened fire at a senior
citizens apartment complex in Michigan, killing two women and
critically wounding another. In that case, authorities said, the
gunman opened fire during a meeting called because the man had been
accused of using vulgar language.

increase of nearly 60,000 prisoners, the United States may have matched or even

<HEADLINE> Diet's Anti-Cancer Benefits Doubted  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two large studies cast doubt on the widely held belief that
eating low-fat, high-fiber food will lower the risk of colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Such a diet is recommended by health groups for many reasons,
but evidence of the anti-cancer benefit has been unclear.
</P>
<P>
   To help resolve doubts, researchers conducted two large
experiments, putting people on different diets and counting
potentially cancerous growths in their colons and rectums for up to
four years. The researchers were disappointed to find no apparent
effect from the low-fat, high-fiber diet or high-fiber supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies were published Thursday in The New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were reported in a study published in the
journal in January 1999. That study tracked the colon and rectal
health of 88,757 women who participated in the Harvard-based Nurses
Health Study over 16 years. It found that the risk of cancer of the
same regardless of how much fiber the participants ate, and
researchers said they believed those findings apply to men as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue is still not settled. Animal experiments and
some studies of large populations suggest that fruits, vegetables
and fiber do indeed help ward off such cancers. And even if they do
not, experts maintain that this kind of food clearly carries other
benefits, including preventing obesity, heart disease and possibly
some other kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a case of choosing the disease you don't want to
get,'' said Melanie Polk, a dietitian at the American Institute of
Cancer Research in Washington. ''If we eat a diet that is high in
vegetables, fruits, grains and beans we ... will protect our
overall health.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 cases of colon and rectal cancers were diagnosed
last year in the United States. About 56,600 people died from the
disease, which is second only to lung cancer in causing cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new studies, conducted at the National Cancer
Institute and eight other health centers, watched 1,905 patients
for recurring adenomas, or polyps, which are precancerous growths
in the colon, or large intestine. One group of patients limited fat
to 20 percent of total calories and ate five to eight servings of
fruit or vegetables daily; a virtually identical group kept up its
usual eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Polyps were removed from both groups at the start. Over four
years, they came back in 39 percent of patients in both groups. The
average number per patient and size were about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very disappointing,'' said Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, a lead
researcher at the National Cancer Institute. ''A positive result
would have been a very strong statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, of 1,303 patients, University of Arizona
researchers also found no lower risk of colorectal cancer from a
diet heavy on a high-fiber, wheat-bran cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have theorized that a low-fat, high-fiber diet
chemically neutralizes cancer agents, makes protective changes to
cells, or curtails bile acids that irritate intestinal lining and
promote polyps.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies did not consider actual cancers partly
because doctors can readily remove polyps and do so under the
accepted standard of good medical care. If undetected, only 5 to 10
percent of polyps turn cancerous within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said low-fat, high-fiber diets could conceivably
act on colon cancer in the later stages of development. Such diets
may work only when eaten for more than just four years.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an accompanying editorial, Dr. Tim Byers, at the
University of Colorado School of Medicine, was not as hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be many reasons to eat a diet that is low in fat and
high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables ... but preventing colorectal
adenomas, at least for the first three or four years, is not one of
them,'' Byers said.

<P>
	   MALONE, N.Y. (AP) -- An upstate prison doctor is charged with
third-degree sodomy and has been suspended without pay after
allegedly having sexual relations with an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waqar A. Farooqi, 35, of Malone, worked at Bare Hill
Correctional Facility, a medium-security state prison about 40

<HEADLINE> Tremor shakes parts of upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWCOMB, N.Y. (AP) -- A strongest earthquake in years shook life
in parts of eastern New York from the Adirondacks to the Mohawk
Valley this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was incredible,'' said John Alden of the Adirondack town of
Indian Lake. ''It scared the hell out of me. At first I thought it
was a logging truck, but then the whole building started shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like being next to a shuttle launch,'' said Alden, who
used to live in Florida not far from the launch site. He was at his
computer working before his Snowy Mountain Inn restaurant opened
when the quake hit. In eight to 10 seconds, he leaped to his feet
and ran outside because he feared the furnace below him was about
to explode. Yet he sees no damage to his home or business.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or major damage was reported in the quake that was
greater than usually felt in upstate New York. Aftershocks today
are possible, a researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor was recorded at about 4:45 a.m., with the epicenter
in the town of Newcomb in Essex County, about 95 miles north of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The quake shook homes in an area stretching from northern New
York to Fulton and Montgomery counties along the Mohawk River and
counties around Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say the quake was strong enough to crack wall
paint and shake items off shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The National Earthquake Information Center says the quake that
measured 3.7. A researcher at the State University of New York at
Potsdam said earthquakes in this area between 2.0 and 4.0 are
common and happen about 10 or 12 times a year. A magnitude of 4.0
can cause moderate damage and 5.0 can cause considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pretty normal,'' said Frank Revetta, a geophysicist
and professor and director of the Seismic Network at the State
University of New York at Potsdam 63 miles northwest of the
epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   His initial recordings show a quake with a magnitude of 3.7 to
4.2 centered in the central Adirondacks near Long Lake and Saranac
Lake, one of the areas that attracts the most tourists in warmer
months.
</P>
<P>
   Revetta said an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 was recorded
in northern New York in October 1983. Today's quake appears to have
been the strongest in several years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said what would probably be minor aftershocks are possible
today.

<HEADLINE> Teen son charged in father's death after shallow grave uncovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VASS, N.C. (AP) -- Results of an autopsy on a man authorities
believe was killed by his teen-age son and buried in a shallow
grave for two years are expected next week, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moore County Sheriff's Department on Friday unearthed Paul
Purvis' body from a grave behind a camper where his family lived.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death will help determine the severity of the
murder charge brought against William Purvis, said assistant
district attorney Alan Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators first tried to find Paul Purvis in January 1999
after his wife, Elizabeth McCracken, shot herself at the home. They
were suspicious and searched the isolated, wooded 25-acre property
near Vass for his body, but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   William Purvis was charged Monday in New Jersey with killing his
father in April 1998. He is confined to a youth detention center in
Monmouth County, N.J., while authorities in North Carolina seek
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his sister have lived with their grandmother in New
Jersey since their mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   McCracken shot herself in the chest with a handgun on New Year's
Eve 1998 while talking to a friend on the phone. Investigators said
the gun she used was the same one that killed Purvis, but that they
have no reason to reexamine McCracken's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Purvis and McCracken moved their family to Vass around 1997
after pleading guilty in New Jersey to possession and distribution
of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Colts Neck, N.J., who found the plants in a backyard
garden in 1991, also accused the couple of endangering the welfare
of children. Investigators found animal feces throughout the house,
which contained 21 dogs, seven parrots and rats.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said McCracken had inherited a large amount of money and
that neither she nor her husband worked. The couple raised
Australian terriers and traveled around the country for dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Reignier, a friend and fellow breeder from Green Bay,
Wisc., said McCracken told her Purvis had abandoned the family in
April 1998. Reignier said she was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it wasn't like him,'' she said, adding that she thinks
McCracken knew her husband was dead.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Outlook Improves  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The financial outlook for Medicare is a little
better than the Clinton administration previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare will now have until 2025 before cash runs short to pay
benefits. A report issued March 30 by trustees of the program said
Medicare would start running short on cash by 2023.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year difference can be explained by a computational
error recently discovered by trustees of Medicare, the health
insurance program for the elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers informed House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., of the computational error in a
letter Wednesday. ''We are investigating how best to correct the
previously transmitted report and will forward the result to you
when it becomes available,'' Summers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo Summers forwarded to Gephardt, Richard Foster, chief
actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services, explained:
''This error resulted in a substantial underestimate of future
interest income and caused the estimated year of exhaustion for the
(Medicare Hospital Insurance) trust fund to be shown as 2023,
instead of the correct date of 2025.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actual earnings on (hospital insurance) assets were not
affected, only our estimates of future interest,'' Foster wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, in the memo, said a more refined methodology for
projecting future interest income was used for the March 30 report.
But a programming mistake resulted in an erroneous projection of
interest earnings.

<P>
   ''The estimated amounts of interest are understated by $2.1
billion in calendar year 2000 and by gradually increasing amounts
through 2014,'' Foster wrote. ''The understatement increases
substantially in 2015 and later to roughly $20 billion annually.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Recalls '95, '96 Sentras  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDENA, Calif. (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. has announced a safety
recall on about 14,500 Nissan Sentra vehicles because a front coil
spring is susceptible to corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   The spring could deteriorate on some of these vehicles if they
are operated in areas where a significant amount of salt is used to
rid streets of snow, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosion of the spring causes it to break and possibly puncture
a tire, which could cause the driver to lose control of the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The recall affects only 1995 and 1996 model year Nissan Sentras
built in 1995 between May and November. The repair is free and
takes about two hours to perform.
</P>
<P>
   The springs do not need to be replaced unless the car has been
used on salty roads, Nissan officials said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 17; Nasdaq Off 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, with
blue-chips getting a lift from the string of strong first-quarter
earnings that have come out this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 17.07 at 10,692.03.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.30 at 1,430.77, but the
Nasdaq composite index was down 7.01 at 3,699.40.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the focus was on earnings reports. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and most companies have
reported strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service gained 2 11/16 to 61} after the company
reported earnings that topped expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One, which provides electronic-commerce software and
services, rose 8 13/32 to 56[, also on better-than-expected
results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were lingering concerns about whether the economy
is growing too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported today that unemployment benefits
plummeted last week to the lowest level in nearly 27 years,
indicating that businesses are scrambling to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concerns that the tight labor market will spur
higher inflation because employers have to recruit workers with big
increases in wages and benefits, increasing costs that companies
could pass along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers, fearful that too-rapid economic
growth could revive, have raised interest rates five times since
June. Many investors worry that continued signs of brisk growth
will spur the Fed to raise rates a number of times more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 142.72 million shares
in the early going, up from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was expected to slow as the day progressed ahead of the
holiday weekend. Financial markets will be closed Friday for the
observance of Good Friday, and bond markets close early this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.35 at 487.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.66 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.59 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.85 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Columbine TV Restraint Sought  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With the wounds still fresh for many victims and
their families, television networks returned to Colorado today to
mark the first anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the community had pleaded with the media to show
restraint, and producers of this morning's news shows said they
tried to weigh the need for compassion with the need to cover the
story.
</P>
<P>
   After some debate, NBC's ''Today'' show producers sent Katie
Couric to anchor the show today from Littleton, Colo., this
morning. CBS's ''The Early Show'' sent co-host Jane Clayson.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' which sent Charles Gibson to
Oklahoma City on Wednesday for the fifth anniversary of the federal
building bombing, decided not to send an anchor to Columbine. It
did have a reporter on the scene for stories.
</P>
<P>
   Clayson interviewed attorneys who alleged, in a lawsuit, that
one of Columbine's victims was killed by a law enforcement
officer's bullet. Couric did five Columbine segments, including one
where she revisited last year's emotional interview with the
parents of a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of some of the Columbine victims told the media that
some of their stories would be painful. Students and school
officials in Littleton, Colo., had asked that cameras and all
outsiders be kept away from Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of sensitivity and a lot of care and concern
for these families from this show,'' said Shelley Ross, executive
producer of ''Good Morning America.'' ''These are tough decisions
to make. I'm sure there are a lot of people who just wish we would
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Littleton persuaded a homeowner near
Columbine not to allow ''Good Morning America'' to set up a camera
on his property. Ross said she didn't know about the request.
</P>
<P>
   CNN is ''not trying to wallow in what happened a year ago'' and
decided against a prime-time special on the anniversary, said Sid
Bedingfield, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   But the network is airing an interview with shooting survivor
Patrick Ireland and will include the wrenching footage of his
bloody escape through a school window.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today'' show decided to send Couric after debating whether to
go, said Jeff Zucker, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided that we could be both respectful of the day and the
people and still be there,'' Zucker said. ''This is probably the
story that has gripped the country the most within the past year.
So it's important to take another look at what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS won't speak to anyone who doesn't want to be on camera, but
it can't ignore the story, said Marcy McGinnis, the network's vice
president of news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Networks also had to decide how much file footage of the
massacre to show. Fox News Channel, for example, will show
terrified children fleeing the school but won't air footage with
bodies, said Alicia Acuna, a correspondent based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of difficult to mark an anniversary without showing
what it is you're marking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS sorted through its footage to determine what to show,
McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In television, the way you tell a story is with pictures,''
she said. ''I know it brings back a lot of memories, but we're in a
medium that is picture-oriented.''

<HEADLINE> Tornados Destroy Kansas Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARSONS, Kan. (AP) -- A line of severe storms stretching from
Kansas to Missouri unleashed at least four tornados that destroyed
homes, flattened a carnival and caused several minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to get the sirens off in time and that made a big
difference,'' said Keith Stammer, public information officer in
Labette County.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 homes were demolished when a tornado hit Parsons on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing like we've ever seen in Parsons,'' said Martha
Walters, an administrative assistant. ''We've never had damage like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored Thursday morning in the town of 13,000 about
150 miles south of Kansas City. The storm also destroyed a
carnival, scattering Ferris wheel parts. No serious injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Other tornados touched down in Walnut, Cherryvale and Eire in
southeastern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The severe weather included heavy rain, large hail and
straight-line winds, according to the National Weather Service.

<HEADLINE> All-Century Baseball Stamps Near  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now pitching, Cy Young. Babe Ruth is at bat
with Jackie Robinson on deck followed by Honus Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the lineup for baseball fans as the U.S. Postal
Service issues a new set of 20 stamps remembering players honored
on Major League Baseball's All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps will be unveiled May 4 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis
and will go on sale July 6 as part of baseball's all-star
festivities in Atlanta. They will be available nationwide starting
July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The post office plans to print 200 million of the self-adhesive
33-cent stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the set are stamps honoring:
</P>
<P>
   --Roberto Clemente, who helped the Pittsburgh Pirates to two
world championships and became the first Hispanic elected to the
baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   --Ty Cobb, the ''Georgia Peach,'' who won nine straight American
league batting titles in his 24-year career, 22 with the Detroit
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   --Mickey Cochrane sparked the Philadelphia Athletics'
championship teams of 1929-1931 with his bat and skill behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   --Eddie ''Cocky'' Collins played for 25 seasons, a 20th century
record for nonpitchers. His baserunning and batting helped four
teams win world championships.
</P>
<P>
   --Dizzy Dean, fastball-throwing member of the St. Louis
Cardinals' Gas House Gang, once held the modern single-game record
of 17 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   --Jimmie Foxx, one of the top sluggers of all time, hit 30 or
more home runs for 12 seasons in a row. Playing for the
Philadelphia Athletics in 1933, he led the American League in home
runs, batting and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   --Lou Gehrig, first baseman for the New York Yankees, played in
2,130 consecutive games. In 1934 the ''Iron Horse'' led the
American League in batting average, home runs and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   --Josh Gibson was among the biggest draws in the Negro leagues
and is generally considered one of the most prodigious power
hitters in the history of professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   --Lefty Grove, one of the finest left-handed pitchers in history,
went 31-4 for the 1931 Philadelphia Athletics. In the process, he
put together a 16-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   --Rogers Hornsby won seven batting championships and managed the
1926 St. Louis Cardinals to their first world championship.
</P>
<P>
   --Walter ''Big Train'' Johnson used a sweeping sidearm motion to
fire fastballs over home plate. In 21 years with the Washington
Senators he fanned 3,509 batters, won 417 games and pitched a
record 110 shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   --Christy Mathewson won 20 games for the New York Giants in 1901.
With his ''fadeaway'' pitch, he posted three consecutive 30-victory
seasons and in the 1905 World Series threw three shutouts in only
six days.
</P>
<P>
   --Satchel Paige, a legend after two decades in the Negro leagues,
signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1948. At age 42, this
''veteran-rookie'' helped his team win the American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   --Jackie Robinson broke the major league color barrier when he
came to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Two years later, he hit a
league-leading .342, drove in 124 runs, and was voted the most
valuable player in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   --Babe Ruth was the most celebrated athlete of this time. Before
beginning play with the New York Yankees in 1920, the ''Sultan of
Swat'' was a successful pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   --George Sisler won two batting titles while playing for the St.
Louis Browns and produced a 41-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   --Tris Speaker revolutionized outfield play by positioning
himself in shallow center field. As a result, this Cleveland Indian
recorded more assists than any other outfielder in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   --Pie Traynor of the Pittsburgh Pirates was one of the finest
third basemen of all time. His defensive prowess often overshadowed
his strong hitting.
</P>
<P>
   --Honus Wagner, the Pirates' star shortstop, also was a
league-leading batter and base stealer. The ''Flying Dutchman''
enjoyed 15 consecutive .300 seasons, eight as the National League
batting champ.
</P>
<P>
   --Cy Young, christened Denton True Young, was nicknamed Cy for
Cyclone. He won 511 games in his 22-year career -- almost 100 more
than any other pitcher.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- The 6-year-old boy accused of killing his
first-grade classmate is attending a special program at a home for
children who have been neglected, abused or have emotional
problems, a prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is accused of fatally shooting Kayla Rolland at Buell
Elementary School in February. State officials placed him in the
school and covered the expenses, said Sam Riddle, a spokesman for
Tamarla Owens, the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has obviously benefited from this wonderful place,''
Genesee County Prosecutor Arthur A. Busch said in e-mail sent this
week. ''He has progressed in a fashion that all of our community
has hoped would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney J. Dallas Winegarden, who represents the victim's
parents, said the move angered the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked, appalled and outraged that they would put him
back in any school, and we're concerned about the safety of other
children who would be around this 6-year-old boy,'' Winegarden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla's mother, Veronica McQueen, has transferred her other two
children to private schools in the Flint area, Winegarden said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' two other children, a third-grade boy and a girl in
kindergarten, also are attending a different private school at
state expense, Riddle said. All three have lived with the woman's
sister since the Feb. 29 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all glad to be back in school,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Thompson of the Family Independence Agency, which placed
the children in the private schools, said she could not comment on
the specifics of the case.

   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

   Technology shares came under some selling pressure as investors
cashed in on the market's recent gains. On Monday and Tuesday, the
Nasdaq rose a total of 472 points, with record point gains each

lingering concerns about whether the economy is growing too fast.

<P>
   The Labor Department reported today that unemployment benefits
plummeted last week to the lowest level in nearly 27 years,
indicating that businesses are scrambling to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concerns that the tight labor market will spur
higher inflation because employers have to recruit workers with big
increases in wages and benefits, increasing costs that companies
could pass along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
</P>

   Federal Reserve policy-makers, fearful that too-rapid economic
growth could revive, have raised interest rates five times since
June. Many investors worry that continued signs of brisk growth

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Squibb delays launch of highly touted blood pressurepill  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb has withdrawn its
application for federal approval of a high blood pressure
medication that was expected to be the industry's next blockbuster,
after regulators raised questions about severe reactions in a small
number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The company made the surprising decision Wednesday in response
to the Food and Drug Administration's concerns that the drug,
Vanlev, might cause severe swelling in the face, throat and lips.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't have been more shocked,'' said Barbara Ryan, a
managing director at Deutsche Bank in New York. ''The fact that
it's delayed is going to put a lot of questions in physicians'
minds. ... It puts the growth rate of the company in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ryan said, the resulting stock plunge Wednesday has left
shares ''grossly undervalued right now, and I would be a buyer,''
expecting the price to move up modestly and recover within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares tumbled 22 percent on the news. Today, the
stock fell another $1 to $49.93}, despite the company's
first-quarter earnings beating Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers reported earnings of $1.22 billion, or 61 cents
per diluted share, on revenue of $5.26 billion, up from $1.07
billion, or 53 cents per share, on revenue of $4.85 billion last
year. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
expected earnings of 60 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev has been studied in nearly 7,000 patients, with some
staying on the drug up to two years, Bristol-Myers said. A little
more than 1 percent of patients experienced the swelling problem,
including four patients who needed to have a tube inserted down
their throat because they had trouble breathing, the company said.
All four survived.
</P>
<P>
   While the swelling problem, known as angioedema, is a rare side
effect of some blood pressure drugs, the FDA seemed more concerned
with the severe cases in which intubations were needed, the company
said. The swelling problem was mainly seen in black people, it
added.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had been reviewing the drug since December and had been
expected to approve it by June.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers now says it will conduct more studies on the drug,
and wait until early next year to reapply for federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain bullish on this drug,'' said Richard Lane, the
president of the company's Worldwide Medicines Group, based in
Princeton, N.J. ''We hope to show the four cases of severe
angioedema were statistical anomalies, and not a signal of
increased risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The swelling problems occurred with patients shortly after they
started taking the pill, the company said. As a result, the company
will look into starting patients on a lower dosage to reduce the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Butler, senior pharmaceutical and biotechnology analyst at
Lehman Brothers in New York, said that if that strategy works and
the data Bristol-Myers presents next year to the FDA shows Vanlev
doesn't have worse side effects than existing hypertension drugs,
Vanlev's sales potential might not be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers, which has its corporate headquarters in New York,
had gone to great lengths to promote Vanlev in the past year,
including touting the results of earlier studies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had estimated Vanlev could make more than $2 billion in
sales by 2004, projecting it would be the company's top-selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers was counting on Vanlev sales to make up for
falling sales of its current top drug, Pravachol, a
cholesterol-lowering pill. It also was hoping that revenues from
Vanlev would help offset anticipated lower sales of its cancer drug
Taxol, which is facing patent challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The delay with Vanlev also gives a boost to rival Pfizer Inc.,
which makes Norvasc the top-selling hypertension drug. Norvasc had
sales last year of more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev was designed to simultaneously inhibit two key enzymes
which regulate blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   At a medical meeting last fall, studies found Vanlev
outperformed two mainstays of blood pressure control, a top-selling
ACE inhibitor and a calcium-channel blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev appeared to do a better job of lowering both systolic and
diastolic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Systolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats,
while diastolic is the pressure between beats. Systolic is the
first and larger of the two numbers. Ideal blood pressure is less
than 140 over 90.
</P>
<P>
   Like standard ACE inhibitors, Vanlev blocks angiotensin
converting enzyme, which raises blood pressure. However, the
medicine also stops another enzyme called neutral endopeptidase. By
doing this, the medicine protects the body's supply of other
helpful substances that make blood vessels relax and prevent
dangerous overgrowth of heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, affects more than 600
million people worldwide. Three of four people with high blood
pressure in the U.S. are not at or below the recommended target
goal, which puts them at increased risk of heart attack, stroke,
heart failure, and kidney disease.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills Two in Arizona Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Richard Glassel's anger was well-known to
his former neighbors at Ventana Lakes, a suburban retirement
community with man-made lakes, several tennis courts and grassy
common areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, 61-year-old Glassel's dispute over the
quality of the landscaping in the manicured common areas had grown
increasingly heated, neighbors said. The association was so
unnerved by Glassel that they obtained a restraining order against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that anger boiled over Wednesday when Glassel
allegedly stormed into a homeowners association meeting with a
rifle and handguns and opened fire, killing two women and leaving
three others injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just came in, stood in the rear of the room and started
firing,'' said Sheldon ''Smokey'' Stover, 76, who shouted warnings
when the gunshots erupted.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people dropped to the floor, scurried under chairs or
huddled together as the bullets tore through the Ventana Lakes
Yacht Club, where the homeowners meeting was under way.
</P>
<P>
   When Glassel's gun jammed, Sheldon and five others tackled him,
holding him on the floor until police arrived. Two more loaded guns
were found in his jacket and a large stash of ammunition in the
rental moving truck he had driven to the meeting, police Sgt. Russ
Scarborough said.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel was being held today on first-degree murder and
attempted murder charges at a Maricopa County jail, Scarborough
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Nila Lynn, 69, died from a gunshot wound to the
back. Esther LaPlante, 75, died after being shot in the head and
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ettinger, 69, was shot in the chest. He was in serious
condition. Charles Yankowski, 69, was treated and released. Gilbert
McCurdy, 63, underwent foot surgery late Wednesday and was in fair
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventana Lakes shooting came a day after a tenant of a
Michigan senior-citizen apartment house allegedly shot two people
to death during a meeting called to resolve neighbors' complaints
about his use of vulgar language.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Ventana Lakes homeowners association said they
hadn't seen Glassel in more than a year and that they didn't
recognize him at first.
</P>
<P>
   The association sued Glassel and obtained a restraining order in
1998 to keep him from harassing or intimidating the groundskeepers
after he allegedly shoved a property manager, said Penny Koepke, an
attorney representing the Ventana Lakes community association.
</P>
<P>
   Koepke said Glassel wanted the bushes around his property to
grow lush and full instead of having them neatly cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ''He ordered the landscape committee not to take care of his
yard, and you're not allowed to do that,'' said Phyllis Deal, who
lives across the street from Glassel's former home. ''He decided to
take charge and take care of his own yard. Then he got so mad and
everything just snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Ekmark, another community attorney, said a bank
foreclosed on Glassel's Ventana Lakes home last year. Court
documents show the house was auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   But before Glassel left, neighbors and others said, he destroyed
its interior.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took a chain saw to the doors, took a chain saw to the
plastic tub and the plastic shower stall. He also etched big X's on
the Arcadia doors, pulled down the sheetrock, cut the wiring in the
walls,'' said Donald McLean, a former association vice president.
</P>
<P>
   New owners Bruce and Peggy Spangler said the interior was
trashed -- Glassel also had sawed through cabinets and had removed
the dishwasher and kitchen sink -- but that they planned to fix it
up.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he moved, I was glad he trashed his house and didn't take
his frustrations out on us. Now, we feel especially lucky,'' said
Art Rausch, who lived across the street from Glassel.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Lawsuits Blame Police  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT W. BLACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- One lawsuit contends police had a chance to shoot
one of the teen-age gunmen during the rampage at Columbine High
School. Another claims a victim died from an officer's bullet.
</P>
<P>
   With at least nine new lawsuits accusing the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Department of mishandling the Columbine shootings, one
legal analyst says it's too early to dismiss the litigation as mere
finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already we've seen this week that these lawsuits have forced
into the public domain some information that wasn't yet public and
in and of itself that's a good thing,'' said Denver legal analyst
Andrew Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies are accused of mishandling their response and
ignoring advance warnings of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that the claims are without any legal merit
and we will defend them vigorously,'' Jefferson County Attorney
Frank Hutfless said.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuits were filed Wednesday, a day before the one-year
anniversary of the tragedy in the suburb of Littleton. Teen-age
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a
teacher before killing themselves in the April 20, 1999, massacre.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that lawsuits against government agencies be
filed within one year of the disputed action. Thursday was the
deadline for suits related to the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders, daughter of slain teacher Dave Sanders, contends
a sharpshooter on the roof of a nearby house had a ''clear view''
of Klebold through a library window, but was denied permission to
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit also states sharpshooters witnessed the suicides of
Klebold and Harris through high-powered binoculars and rifle scopes
about an hour after the first shots were fired, but sheriff's
commanders for nearly four hours prevented ''anyone from taking any
action directed at rescuing or saving the life of Dave Sanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 47, was shot twice as he shepherded students out of the
cafeteria and into hiding places when the shooting began. He ran
upstairs and was pulled into a science room, where he remained for
four hours before rescue crews arrived. Some officials have said
Sanders' wounds were so severe he would have died even if he had
been reached earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a second lawsuit, filed by five families, lawyers contend
Daniel Rohrbough was killed by police, not the gunmen. The claim is
based on reports from a police officer and teacher, the position of
his body and the trajectory of the fatal bullet.
</P>
<P>
   They also alleged sheriff's deputies failed to rescue the
students in a timely manner and failed to properly train deputies,
dispatchers and 911 operators.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the lawsuit said that an unidentified person
within the sheriff's department was a friend of Harris' father,
Wayne Harris.
</P>
<P>
   That person, the lawsuit said, ''effectively terminated''
procedures prior to the shootings that would have resulted in a
search of the Harrises' home after deputies became aware that the
father found a pipe bomb made by his son and exploded it in a
vacant field.
</P>
<P>
   A search ''would have discovered additional bomb-making
materials and bombs,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrbough was killed outside the school. Families of Matt
Kechter, Lauren Townsend, Kyle Velasquez and Kelly Fleming, who
died in the library, were included in the Rohrbough suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have been filed in both state and federal court by
families of slain student Isaiah Shoels and injured victims Richard
Castaldo, Lance Kirklin, Mark Taylor, Kacey Ruegsegger, Valeen
Schnurr, Evan Todd, Jeanna Park and Sean Graves.

Detroit-area Islamic high school to cost $8 million
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit-area Muslim community is
spending about $8 million to build a high school to teach their
children about Islamic heritage and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Islamic High School, slated to open this fall, will
teach conservative Middle Eastern culture along with core
curriculum classes, said Ahmad Moussa, a board member for the
Islamic Institute of Knowledge, which is planning and financing the
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a strong demand from the community,'' he told The
Detroit News. ''Parents wanted their kids to attend a school that
stresses morals and values.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 Islamic elementary and middle schools already are
located in the Detroit area. Most programs at the schools avoid
music and sex education. Girls must wear head scarves, long sleeves
and pants or skirts that reach their ankles. Boys wear dark-colored
pants and white dress shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Arabic is taught as a second language, largely so students can
understand the Koran. Muslim prayer services are mostly in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 750 students are expected to enroll in the high school,
where tuition will range from $3,000 to $3,600.
</P>

Disciples of Christ, United Church of Christ plan ecumenical
future
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The ecumenical agencies of the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ) and United Church of Christ have held their
first-ever meeting to discuss future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the two similar denominations, which have 2.3
million members between them, have shared clergy and mission work.
The April 6-8 meeting of their ecumenical agencies was to explore
further areas of common practice.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies also discussed a plan, now being negotiated with
other denominations, to form a joint body to be known as ''Churches
Uniting in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disciples' General Assembly and the United Church's General
Synod will meet jointly in Kansas City, Mo., next year.

Reports: Malaysian state passes law against deviant teachings
</P>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A remote northern state has become
the first in Malaysia to impose a law to curb deviant teachings
among Muslims by detaining offenders in rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Perlis state assembly passed the Islamiah Faith Protection
Bill 2000 empowering Islamic courts in the state to prosecute
Muslims who practice or spread deviant teachings, The Sun and
Sunday Star newspapers reported on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Those found guilty will be detained for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Perlis Chief Minister Shahidan Kassim, quoted by local media,
denied that the law was passed to ''trap'' opposition politicians
whom the government has accused of abusing Islam for their own
political purposes. Government leaders have singled out the
opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS, for allegedly
promising a place in heaven for Muslims in the country who support
the party. PAS has denied such claims.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalist party has repeatedly clashed with the federal
government by advocating death for apostasy and the amputation of
limbs for certain crimes. Malaysia's Parliament has vetoed such
punishments as too extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Malays comprise more than half of Malaysia's 22 million
people. But the Southeast Asian nation's minority Buddhists, Hindus
and Christians are allowed relative freedom to practice their
faith.

Church group wants probe into donation
</P>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The National Council of Churches will
ask federal officials to investigate what happened to its $100,000
donation to rebuild the burned Inner City Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eileen W. Lindner, the council's associate general
secretary, said Thursday the New York-based organization has
decided against pursuing a civil lawsuit but wants the U.S.
attorney's office to investigate whether any fraud took place.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church received hundreds of thousands of dollars in
donations and insurance settlements after the January 1996 fire, it
was never rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   The church's former pastor, Jerry Upton, 45, was sentenced to 10
years in prison last month in a plea agreement to federal drug and
weapons charges. During his sentencing hearing, Upton said the
National Council of Churches gave $50,000 to Inner City, a racially
mixed church which burned in a race-related arson, one in a series
of church fires across the South.

Holocaust studies reach rural Pennsylvania
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The lessons of Nazi oppression and murder of
Jews have long been taught in Pennsylvania's larger school
districts. But in recent years, there has been a dramatic increase
in the number of rural school districts that are incorporating
Holocaust studies, says Michael A. Sand of the Harrisburg-based
Holocaust Education Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   A Beaver County school district is adding Holocaust studies to
its required curriculum after a high school student, citing
revisionist historians, questioned the number of Jews who died in
concentration camps. And in Somerset County, three small school
districts last year teamed up to sponsor a visit from a Holocaust
survivor who talked about her experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say interest has been heightened by movies such as
''Schindler's List,'' the opening of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum and news headlines about ''ethnic cleansing'' and hate
crimes.

Top leadership set for Catholic bishops' U.S. staff
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future top leadership of the Roman
Catholic bishops' national staff has been set with appointment of
Msgr. David J. Malloy to become associate general secretary next
January.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was made by Msgr. William P. Fay, who was
elected by the bishops last November as their next general
secretary, or chief staff executive. Fay will succeed Msgr. Dennis
Schnurr next February for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Fay is currently an associate general secretary along with two
others who will continue in that position, layman Bruce Egnew and
Sister Sharon Euart. Fay supervises public policy, Euart pastoral
matters and Egnew finance and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fay, 51, a priest in the Boston archdiocese, was a philosophy
professor and dean at St. John's Seminary in Massachusetts for 14
years before joining the bishops' national staff.
</P>
<P>
   Malloy, 44, from the Milwaukee archdiocese, has served as
secretary with the Vatican missions to Pakistan, Syria and the
United Nations, and currently works in the Prefecture of the Papal
Household.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Remnants of a biblical-era staircase jut from
the landscaped lawn at the base of Jerusalem's Old City wall.
Today, the steps go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 2,000 years ago, they may have led to the paved
platform where Jesus was tried and sentenced to death by Pontius
Pilate, the Roman ruler of the city, says Shimon Gibson, a
Jerusalem archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's theory, based on a new interpretation of 1970s
archaeological finds, opens yet another chapter in the debate over
which path Jesus took to his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Most scholars agree on the endpoint, marked by the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher, but they argue over where Jesus began his walk with
the cross.
</P>
<P>
   The route proposed by Gibson -- one of three raised as
possibilities -- doesn't even overlap with the traditional Via
Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, a half-mile stretch of crowded alleys
that run east to west in the Old City. Most pilgrims don't seem
bothered by the uncertainty, though, saying they come for spiritual
enrichment, not historical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mulcahy, a software salesman from Traverse City, Mich.,
held back tears recently as he carried a 6-foot-tall wooden cross
up steep steps along the traditional path whose points of
veneration, or stations, are marked by small chapels or simple
reliefs adorning outdoor walls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will furnish my mind with just enough elemental building
blocks to reconstruct more of the Gospel,'' said Mulcahy, 51.
</P>
<P>
   In time for the Holy Land pilgrimage of Pope John Paul II last
month, the Via Dolorosa was given a $1 million facelift, with
workers replacing some broken pavement stones and sandblasting
facades.
</P>
<P>
   The Via Dolorosa tradition first emerged in the 13th century and
only became firmly established several centuries later. Five of the
14 stations -- including those marking Jesus' three falls, his
meeting with his mother and his encounter with Veronica, the woman
who wiped his face -- are rooted in legend, not the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the procession route was determined by politics, not
theology. In the 14th century, three Florentine pilgrims reported
that it was customary to make the trip in reverse, setting out from
the Holy Sepulcher well before dawn so that the faithful could be
out of the city by daybreak and avoid provoking the Muslim rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gospels are vague about the venue of Jesus' trial, the
starting point of his final walk. Matthew, Mark and John write that
Jesus was taken to the praetorium, traditionally the residence of
the Roman governor, but don't give an exact spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus
forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in a place that is called
the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha,'' says John 19:13.
</P>
<P>
   Pilate, who was based in Caesarea on the Mediterranean and only
came to Jerusalem on special occasions, such as the Jewish feast
days -- in this case, Passover -- could have chosen several places as
his residence in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
   The Via Dolorosa tradition assumes that Pilate governed
Jerusalem from Antonia's Fortress, erected by Herod the Great on
the eastern edge of the walled city, near today's Lion's Gate, and
just north of the Jewish Temple compound.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Hanswulf Bloedhorn, head of the German Protestant
Institute of Archaeology in Jerusalem, said Pilate likely chose the
Hasmonean Palace of earlier Jewish kings, closer to today's Dung
Gate and just west of the Temple. Bloedhorn bases his assumptions
on early Christian traditions and pilgrims' accounts from the
Byzantine era.
</P>
<P>
   A third option was Herod's Palace, near today's Jaffa Gate, a
lavish compound on the city's highest hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''John tells us that the Hebrew name was Gabbatha, which means
the highest point in the city, and that's what the palace was,''
said Jerome Murphy O'Connor, a researcher at Ecole Biblique in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the archaeologist, said he may have found a clue about
the trial venue while reviewing material from a 1970s excavation
along the western stretch of the Old City walls, which also would
have been the outer fortification of Herod's Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, mounds of soil rose halfway up the wall and
volunteers dug more than 39 feet deep to uncover first-century
stones at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   They laid bare remnants of a wide flight of steps that
approached the palace from the west. People walking up the steps
would have come to a large gate flanked by two guard towers, then
entered a paved area about half the size of a tennis court, before
walking through another gate into the palace itself, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   This antechamber would have been an ideal spot for Jesus' trial,
said Gibson, who participated in the dig and now conducts digs for
the Houston-based Jerusalem Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was the Roman governor, I would want the rabble assembled
in an area where I could easily confine them,'' Gibson said. ''As
soon as you have tried Jesus, you whisk him into the city and the
rabble have been dispersed out of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy O'Connor said it would have made more sense for Pilate to
hold court on the eastern side of his palace -- in a spot visible
from inside the city, so that his verdicts would be known to all.
</P>
<P>
   Both scholars said the argument over the Via Dolorosa will
probably never be settled.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old City, where every grain of sacred soil is jealously
guarded by Jews, Muslims and Christians, it is becoming nearly
impossible to excavate without violating someone's religious
sensibilities. And even if more finds were unearthed, they might
not deliver a final answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stones are stones,'' Murphy O'Connor said. ''They don't say
that this is the place where Jesus walked.''

<HEADLINE> Bank One's CFO To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp.'s chief financial officer Robert
Rosholt has become the latest executive to leave the company, which
is completing a turnover of top managers after months of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fourth-biggest bank holding company said a search
is under way to replace Rosholt, who it said has decided to resign
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rosholt, 50, has served as chief financial officer of Bank One
since the 1998 merger of Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One Corp. and
First Chicago NBD Corp.
</P>
<P>
   His departure follows by four months the resignation of chairman
and chief executive officer John McCoy, who was succeeded in the
post last month by James Dimon.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy was under fire for problems that caused Bank One's stock
to start plummeting last August when it acknowledged it was losing
credit-card customers due to flawed strategies.

<HEADLINE> Patient Deaths Inquest Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- A coroner wants to hold inquests into
the deaths of 23 more suspected victims of a doctor convicted of
murdering 15 female patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Shipman, whose one-man practice was in Hyde, near the
northwest England city of Manchester, was sentenced in January to
15 life terms for injecting the women with lethal doses of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   John Pollard, the coroner for South Manchester, has written to
the British government seeking permission to open inquests into the
deaths of 23 more patients. Pollard said he was unable to proceed
with inquests without permission because the bodies had all been
cremated.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the inquests were not intended to determine
liability, but rather exactly what caused the women's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   During Shipman's trial, investigators said they feared the
doctor -- already among Britain's most prolific serial killers --
might be responsible for many more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not be unreasonable to say a figure of 150 would be a
realistic, possible estimate,'' Pollard said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In February, police announced they had enough evidence to
prosecute Shipman for the deaths of 23 more patients, but the Crown
Prosecution Service advised them not to bring further charges
because Shipman could not be guaranteed a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard said Thursday he decided to write to Home Secretary Jack
Straw because ''the families and relatives of these deceased are
anxious for the evidence related to their deaths to be heard and
tested by way of inquest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue McAlpine, whose mother, Irene Heathcote, is one of the 23
women, said she would be happy for an inquest to be held.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not wholly satisfactory, but at least it would help me
find out what happened to my mother,'' McAlpine said.

<HEADLINE> BBC Can't Televise Lockerbie Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- The High Court on Thursday rejected
an appeal by the British Broadcasting Corp. to broadcast the trial
of two Libyans accused of blowing up a Pan Am jet in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC had asked the panel of judges to overturn last month's
decision by High Court Judge Lord Donald Macfadyen, who ruled that
the Libyans' right to a fair trial outweighed the media's right to
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC's bid was backed by eight other broadcasters, including
Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Am airliner exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec.
21, 1988, killing 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC had argued that private, closed-circuit footage of the
trial, to be arranged for relatives of the victims in Britain and
the United States, meant the trial was effectively being televised
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, former Libyan secret servicemen Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, 48, and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, 44, are charged with
conspiracy, murder and a breach of the 1982 Aviation Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   Libya handed the men over only after an agreement the case would
be heard in the Netherlands. They will be tried under the Scottish
legal system, which bans cameras in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin on May 3 at Camp Zeist in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC said it was seeking permission to appeal Thursday's
decision to the Privy Council, the final court of appeal under
Scottish law.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with blue-chips getting
a lift from the string of strong first-quarter earnings while
technology shares fell to profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 111.77 at 10,786.73.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.62 at 1,428.09, but the
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 54.75 at 3,651.66.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the focus was on earnings reports. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and most companies have
reported strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service gained 4 3/16 at 63\ after the company
reported earnings that topped expectations. Commerce One, which
provides electronic-commerce software and services, rose 5 9/16 at
53 5/16, also on better-than-expected results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strong earnings have been a very pleasant surprise to this
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Those companies with the
best earnings prospects is where the money is going now.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares came under some selling pressure as investors
cashed in on the market's recent gains. On Monday and Tuesday, the
Nasdaq rose a total of 472 points, with record point gains each
day, and the Dow average gained 461.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise earlier this week wiped out a portion of the
crushing losses sustained during last week's devastating selloff.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase was down 6 15/16 at 84 9/16 today, while Intel lost
3 5/16 at 115}.
</P>
<P>
   While stocks have generally moved higher this week, lingering
concerns remain about whether the economy is growing too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported today that unemployment benefits
plummeted last week to the lowest level in nearly 27 years,
indicating that businesses are scrambling to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concerns that the tight labor market will spur
higher inflation because employers have to recruit workers with big
increases in wages and benefits, increasing costs that companies
could pass along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers, fearful that too-rapid economic
growth could revive, have raised interest rates five times since
June. Many investors worry that continued signs of brisk growth
will spur the Fed to raise rates a number of times more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 423.55 million shares
at midday, down from 450.46 million shares on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was expected to slow as the day progressed ahead of the
holiday weekend. Financial markets will be closed Friday for the
observance of Good Friday, and bond markets close early this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.27 at 481.96.

<HEADLINE> Reno Meets Advisers on Elian  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Faced with a court ruling criticizing the
government's actions in the Elian Gonzalez case, Attorney General
Janet Reno huddled with advisers today as the boy's relatives
sparred through their lawyers over whether, and where, they might
arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest victory for the Miami relatives of the 6-year-old
boy, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta said Elian must remain in the United States until the
court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The order, however, would not prevent the government from
reuniting Elian with his father in the United States. The father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has been waiting in Washington since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in Oklahoma City on Wednesday for the dedication of a
memorial to the victims of the 1995 federal building bombing, said
she would abide by Wednesday's court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it does not disagree with my determination, it does not
say that the boy cannot be reunited with his father,'' she said.
''I believe Elian should be reunited with his father and I said
that all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno later returned to Washington, canceling a trip planned
today to a Montana Indian reservation. She held one meeting with
her advisers on the Elian case and others were anticipated, but
there was no word on when she might decide her next step.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton and
Reno spent about 45 minutes discussing the Elian Gonzalez case
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He supports the approach the attorney general has taken here
to try to reunite the boy with his father in a way that is prompt
and orderly,'' Lockhart said. ''There's obvious tension between the
prompt and orderly. These are issues the Justice Department is
working through and I'm not going to speculate on what they may or
may not do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Justice Department was looking forward to making its
arguments before the appeals court next month, but declined to
speculate on any actions that might be taken before then. A hearing
was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami relatives today repeated their offer to
bring the boy to a meeting with his father. They said it could be
anywhere in the country, but also said the boy was reluctant to get
on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time that the family got together to deal with this as a
family -- no preconditons, no government, no lawyers,'' family
attorney Kendall Coffey told ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' He
said the family still preferred to meet within close driving
distance of Miami because Elian is frightened about being returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than insist that the boy go to Washington to see the
father, why can't a grown-up get on a plane and come down to south
Florida. ... Maybe he should come down this Easter? It's time that
the family got together to deal with this as a family -- no
preconditons, no government, no lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Craig, an attorney for the father, said any meeting
must begin with Juan Miguel being given custody of the boy. ''It is
long past time for this boy to be reunited with his father,'' Craig
told NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only meeting that we really care about is the reunion with
the son.'' After that occurs, the family can talk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, decided to offer to
bring the boy to a meeting with his father after being assured by
the court ruling that the boy could stay in the country, attorney
Linda Osberg-Braun said Wednesday. Previously, the Miami relatives
had said they would meet the father only if it was without the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision issued Wednesday, the appeals court judges had
harsh words for the government's handling of Lazaro Gonzalez's
effort to win an asylum hearing for the boy. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service had argued that Elian was too young to speak
for himself and that only his father, as the sole surviving parent,
could request asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to the record, plaintiff -- although a young child --
has expressed a wish that he not be returned to Cuba,'' the judges
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that never have INS officials attempted to
interview plaintiff about his own wishes,'' the ruling said. ''It
is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to be the
only proper representative, considered all of the relevant factors
-- particularly the child's separate and independent interests in
seeking asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel cited a landmark 1985 case involving a minor seeking
asylum -- that of Walter Polovchak, who fought being returned to the
Soviet Union. In that case, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court ruled that a
12-year-old was ''presumably near the lower end of an age range''
of maturity to assert rights separate from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Several options are open to Reno. The government could seek to
have the stay lifted by the full circuit court or by the U.S.
Supreme Court, but Reno pointed out that it only ordered what the
government and Juan Miguel had already offered to do, let the boy
stay in the country for now.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could ask some federal court to order Lazaro Gonzalez to
comply with her instructions to transfer the boy, but she already
asked the three 11th Circuit judges and they didn't want to get
into that question. Or Reno could wait until the May 11 hearing
before the appeals court on the family's asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option would be mediation, an avenue the three
judges encouraged the parties to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and the Justice Department still could forcibly remove the
boy from the home and return him to his father, who has said he
would remain in the United States while court action is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Miami police spokesman Delrish Moss said federal officials have
not given any indication that they are going to do anything in the
''next few days or the next few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was rescued by two fishermen while clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day. He and two others
survived, but his mother and 10 others fleeing Cuba drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez was awarded temporary custody and the boy's
Miami relatives have cared for him ever since. They insist Elian
will be better off living with them, and argue that the boy would
be psychologically harmed and face persecution if he is returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Reno and the government have repeatedly extended
the deadline for Lazaro Gonzalez to surrender the boy. Last week,
they revoked the great-uncle's custody of the boy when he ignored a
deadline.

<HEADLINE> State Officials To Plot EPA Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State environmental officials disgruntled with
the Clinton administration's tough air quality standards for
industry plan to meet next week to plot strategy for dealing with
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of regulators struggling with current
Environmental Protection Agency air pollution standards was
arranged by Michigan Gov. John Engler's top environmental official,
Russ Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Engler is a top supporter of Republican George W. Bush's
presidential bid. But Ken Silfven, spokesman for the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality, said the meeting is not
connected to any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the planned gathering as a policy discussion
among officials who believe the EPA's air quality standards are too
cumbersome for industries to comply with or for states to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't a G.W. or an Al Gore meeting,'' Silfven said today.
''The fact is that there is an upcoming election and there will be
new members of Congress, regardless of party, and a new
administrator, regardless of party, obviously the timing is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is the
administration's point man on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Harding invited top regulators from 17 other states involved in
major policy fights with the EPA to the April 27 conference in
Detroit. Representatives of auto makers, utilities, paper and oil
industries plan to meet at the same hotel on the same day, then
come together for a brief meeting with the state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, spokesman for Bush's campaign, said they were not
involved in planning the meeting or even aware of it until they got
a call from The Detroit News, which disclosed the meeting in
Tuesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation calls for ''a framework for this reform that can
be considered by the next U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Administration and/or the next Congress.'' The invitation list
includes officials from seven Democratic and 10 Republican state
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Silfven said representatives of Iowa, Kentucky, South Carolina,
Texas and West Virginia had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Harding had suggested the utility industry help pay for the
meeting, but backed off after several states expressed concern
about the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fenech, a senior vice president at Detroit-based Consumers
Power Corp. who is coordinating the industry representation at the
meeting, said the proposals would have a better chance if Bush were
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to come up with a plan that will work under a Bush or
a Gore administration,'' he told the Detroit News. ''A Republican
administration probably would give it a broader look.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have been critical of the meeting. The
Washington-based Environmental Working Group sent a letter to
Harding, requesting that citizens and public interest groups be
allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are going to talk about how you are going to undermine
critical health standards on behalf of polluting industry
lobbyists, you wouldn't want to exclude members of the public,''
said Mike Casey, a spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Delays Blood Pressure Pill  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb has withdrawn its
application for federal approval of a highly touted blood pressure
medication that was expected to be the industry's next blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The company made the surprising decision Wednesday in response
to the Food and Drug Administration's concerns that the drug,
Vanlev, might cause severe reactions, such as swelling in the face,
throat and lips, in a small number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers now says it will conduct more studies on the drug,
and wait until early next year to reapply for federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain bullish on this drug,'' said Richard Lane, the
president of the company's Worldwide Medicines Group, based in
Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares tumbled 22 percent on the news Wednesday.
In early afternoon trading today, the stock was down an additional
$1 to $49.93}, even though the company's first-quarter earnings
rose to $1.22 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts. Last year,
first-quarter earnings were $1.07 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had been reviewing Vanlev since December and was
expected to approve it by June.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been studied in nearly 7,000 patients, with some
staying on the drug up to two years, Bristol-Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 1 percent of patients experienced the
swelling problem, including four patients who needed to have a tube
inserted down their throat because they had trouble breathing, the
company said. All four survived.
</P>
<P>
   While the swelling problem, known as angioedema, is a rare side
effect of some blood pressure drugs, the FDA seemed more concerned
with the severe cases in which breathing tubes were needed, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The swelling problems, which were mainly seen in black people,
occurred with patients shortly after they started taking the pill,
the company said. As a result, the company will look into starting
patients on a lower dosage to reduce the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to show the four cases of severe angioedema were
statistical anomalies, and not a signal of increased risk,'' Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev was designed to simultaneously inhibit two key enzymes
which regulate blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Studies released last fall showed Vanlev outperformed two
mainstays of blood pressure control, a top-selling ACE inhibitor
and a calcium-channel blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev appeared to do a better job of lowering both systolic and
diastolic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Systolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats,
while diastolic is the pressure between beats. Systolic is the
first and larger of the two numbers. Ideal blood pressure is less
than 140 over 90.
</P>
<P>
   Like standard ACE inhibitors, Vanlev blocks angiotensin
converting enzyme, which raises blood pressure. However, the
medicine also stops another enzyme called neutral endopeptidase. By
doing this, the medicine protects the body's supply of other
helpful substances that make blood vessels relax and prevent
dangerous overgrowth of heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, affects more than 600
million people worldwide. Three of four people with high blood
pressure in the United States are not at or below the recommended
target goal, which puts them at increased risk of heart attack,
stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers, which has its corporate headquarters in New York,
was counting on Vanlev sales to make up for falling sales of its
current top drug, Pravachol, a cholesterol-lowering pill. It also
was hoping that revenues from Vanlev would help offset anticipated
lower sales of its cancer drug Taxol, which is facing patent
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had estimated Vanlev could make more than $2 billion in
sales by 2004, projecting it would be the company's top-selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers rival Pfizer Inc. makes the leading hypertension
drug, Norvasc, which had sales of more than $3 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Counterfeiting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANTATION, Fla. (AP) -- Two teen-agers and their 20-year-old
friend were arrested after they allegedly used their computers to
make $2,000 in counterfeit bills for an undercover Secret Service
agent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a string of counterfeiting arrests
nationally involving children as young as 13 and their personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a substantial increase in these
computer-generated cases in the last few years,'' said Secret
Service spokesman David Zimmerman. ''These high-resolution
scanners, copiers and printers have become more affordable and are
in more and more homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the suburban Fort Lauderdale suspects, agents say
the fake bills were produced in a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover agent contacted Omar Mustafa, 20, about making a
deal and was met Friday in a supermarket parking lot by Emad Hasan,
17, a high school senior and Mustafa's cousin, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   With Hasan in custody, agents went to the home of David Bethel,
18, a prep school honor student and football player. When agents
told Bethel they needed to talk to him, he ''responded by putting
his head down and saying, 'I know,''' a Secret Service affidavit
said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents say Bethel showed them the equipment he used to make the
money.
</P>
<P>
   All three pleaded innocent to counterfeiting charges and have
been released on bonds up to $50,000. No trial date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Daft Declares 'New Day' at Coke  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Discussing his company's prospects after
a dismal financial year, Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive
Douglas Daft told shareholders ''it's a new day'' at the beverage
giant.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been describing the company's new public stance on
diversity and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as Daft led his first annual shareholders meeting
at the Playhouse Theatre here, Coke executives stressed their
resolve to improve the diversity of the company's ranks and to make
Coke's corporate culture friendlier for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must respect, value, celebrate and connect with local
people and cultures wherever we operate,'' said Daft, an Australian
who spent much of the 1970s overseeing Coke's Asian and Pacific
operations. ''Not only is diversity an important value, it's an
indispensable value.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Coke's black U.S. employees say the Atlanta-based
company -- which has only one black senior executive and one black
board member -- discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   Eight current and former black Coke employees sued the company
last year alleging they had been denied fair pay, raises,
promotions and performance reviews because of their race. The
plaintiffs are seeking to add 2,000 Coke workers as class members.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies those allegations, but Daft reiterated
Wednesday that Coke is working to resolve the suit quickly. He said
he could not predict when a resolution might occur.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Larry Jones, a former Coke human resources
manager who led a five-day protest bus journey from Atlanta, called
for an international boycott of all Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who told shareholders
that Coke's board and executive offices must match the diversity of
its consumers, said his Rainbow PUSH coalition said the ''justice
riders'' had been ''pushed to the brink'' by their frustration. He
said Coke should be given more time to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But without a settlement, inaction on the groups' concerns
''will grow into a boycott,'' he said. Also on Wednesday, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume called on Coca-Cola officials to settle the
lawsuit. He did not endorse a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said the company was disappointed by
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe that call reflects the aggressive actions
taken by Doug Daft and his management team to equitably and fairly
resolve the lawsuit,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading today on the New York Stock Exchange,
Coca-Cola shares were down 18} cents at $49 a share.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour meeting, Coke chairman Douglas Daft allowed
Jackson and Jones to address shareholders at length.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is great hope in this new team. You inherit the burdens
of history and culture,'' Jackson told Daft, who was joined on the
stage by President Jack Stahl and Carl Ware, Coke's vice president
of global affairs; and other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his group had ridden to the meeting to call attention
to their plight and to publicize their desire to share leadership
with Coke executives in a new spirit of equal partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much longer do we wait?'' Jones asked. ''Three more
months? Five more months? Until the lawsuit is settled?''
</P>
<P>
   In other business, shareholders re-elected Daft to a two-year
board term and re-elected five other directors to three-year terms
on the board.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Mourns Columbine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's been one year since the tragic shooting
at Columbine High School, but time has not softened the grief,
President Clinton said Thursday in a statement in which he told
citizens of Littleton, Colo.: ''You do not mourn alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the spirit of Americans -- the outpouring of
compassion for the victims -- has helped the community recover from
the events on April 20, 1999, when two teen-age gunmen fatally shot
12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the grieving process is not over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts have not yet fully healed, but today America stands
together as one to keep faith with all those who lost their lives
at Columbine -- and all those whose lives were forever changed that
day,'' Clinton said. ''We must continue to honor their memory and
your courage by resolving to make America a safer place for all our
children.''

Thursday on
the first anniversary of the April 20, 1999, shooting at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''It is written in Scripture: ''Blessed are they that mourn, for
they shall be comforted.'' Hillary and I are with you in the spirit
of comfort and prayer as you gather to remember those who lost
their lives one year ago today.
</P>
<P>
   ''You do not mourn alone. What happened in Littleton pierced the
soul of America. Though a year has passed, time has not dimmed our
memory or softened our grief at the loss of so many, whose lives
were cut off in the promise of youth. It has not caused us to
forget their gallant teacher -- a man whose character and values
brought so much strength to the school, sports teams and community
he served.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, in the midst of the heartbreak and devastation of
the Columbine tragedy, we saw the American spirit at its best -- in
the spontaneous outpouring of support for the Littleton community
and in the determination to prevent such tragedies in the future.
Our hearts have not yet fully healed, but today America stands
together as one to keep faith with all those who lost their lives
at Columbine -- and all those whose lives were forever changed that
day. We must continue to honor their memory and your courage by
resolving to make America a safer place for all our children.

<HEADLINE> Black Student Held in Race Threats  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- A black dental student was charged today
in a string of racist e-mails and threats against minority
classmates at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry.
Authorities said she confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Tarsha Michelle Claiborne, 23, of Baton Rouge, La., is accused
of using a computer inside the Dental Science Building to send
e-mails warning of violence and a bomb over the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was arrested shortly after midnight at her home and
made her initial appearance in Johnson County District Court this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The dental building reopened this morning after being closed all
day Wednesday following the bomb threat. No bomb was found.
</P>
<P>
   The threatening e-mail was sent from a computer in the dental
building's pathology laboratory, court records said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was seen on videotape leaving the area, and confessed
to sending the e-mail, the papers said. University spokeswoman Ann
Rhodes said she did not know of any motive or of any past
disciplinary problems involving Claiborne, a second-year student.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with a felony count of threats in violation of
individual rights, related to the bomb threat, and misdemeanor
charges for three previous e-mail threats.
</P>
<P>
   She also was charged with one count of criminal trespass-hate
crime for an April 4 incident in which red noodles were left on
another black student's doorstep with a note referring to a dead
black man's brains.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, a lab coat caught fire at the Dental Science
Building and e-mails were sent to students, asking, ''Are you going
to take us seriously now?'' Authorities said today they do not know
if Claiborne set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some 1,000 people gathered at a rally to condemn the
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The dental college has an enrollment of 381 students, of which
49 are minorities, or 12.8 percent, the school said. Thirteen of
the 49 are black.

<HEADLINE> Blood Thinner Linked to Disease  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A widely used new blood thinner that is routinely
given to heart patients after angioplasty appears in rare cases to
trigger a deadly blood disease.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called Plavix, prevents blood clots and has been taken
by more than 3 million people worldwide since its introduction two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, doctors have linked the medicine to
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or TTP, a dangerous form of
anemia. A report to be published June 15 in the New England Journal
of Medicine describes 11 cases among Plavix users.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the benefits of the drug still far outweigh this
risk, which appears to be remote. But they say doctors should watch
their patients closely for signs of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is that this will be a relatively rare complication,
but it's so important that everybody has got to know about it,''
said Dr. Rodman Starke, research director of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its medical importance, the New England Journal of
Medicine released the study early on its Web site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix is frequently given for a month after angioplasty, in
which a tiny balloon is inserted into a blood vessel to clear a
blockage. The medicine is used especially in angioplasty patients
who get wire mesh tubes called stents to keep their heart arteries
from clogging up again. It is also given longer term to victims of
mini-strokes to help prevent full-blown strokes, especially if they
cannot take aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a great drug. It should be used,'' said Dr.
Charles L. Bennett of Northwestern University, who discovered the
connection. ''In the past, patients got the drug but did not have
close monitoring. Our hope is doctors will be aware of this
potential side effect and follow up after a week or two to see how
they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plavix, which is known generically as clopidrogrel, was designed
specifically to avoid this problem. It replaced an older drug,
ticlopidine, that caused TTP in about one of every 1,600 users.
That was 100 times more frequent than in the general population,
and one-third of these patients died.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix is chemically almost identical to ticlopidine. But in
extensive testing, it appeared to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic said that more than
30,000 people took Plavix in carefully conducted studies and not a
single case of TTP was seen.
</P>
<P>
   While the new report ''substantiates that it probably does occur
with clopidrogrel, the incidence is very rare, and the true
incidence is unknown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Topol noted that another case, not counted by Bennett, happened
in Cleveland last week. A stent patient in her late 60s died a few
days after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   TTP destroys red cells and the blood clotting cells called
platelets. Victims can have a wide array of seemingly unconnected
symptoms, including anemia, kidney failure, abnormal heart beats
and a variety of neurologic problems that mimic strokes.
</P>
<P>
   If the disorder is not recognized, about 80 percent of victims
die. Patients can be saved by a blood-filtering process. Bennett
said some cases may be missed because doctors mistake them for
strokes and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is a blood cancer specialist who first documented the
frequency of TTP among patients taking ticlopidine, Plavix's
predecessor drug. He became interested in the question after a
friend of his father developed the complication.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seeming safety of Plavix, he decided to look for TTP
by calling those who might come across occasional cases, such as
blood specialists and directors of blood banks.
</P>
<P>
   His search turned up 11 cases among Plavix users, including 10
that began within two weeks of starting the drug. Still, this does
not definitely prove that the medicine actually causes the
complication.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Gent of Hamilton Civil Hospitals Research Centers in
Ontario questioned whether Plavix is truly the cause, since TTP
does occasionally occur for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's been seen so far is entirely consistent with what you
would see in the general population,'' Gent said.
</P>
<P>
   Gent headed the largest study of Plavix, an experiment involving
more than 19,000 people in 16 countries. It showed that Plavix is
somewhat better than aspirin at preventing strokes and new heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix's makers, the drug companies Sanofi and Bristol-Myers
Squibb, say new technical descriptions of the drug mentioning the
possibility of TTP are being written for doctors with the approval
of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he hopes to get financial support from the makers
to conduct a larger study to see whether the drug actually does
cause the complication and calculate how often it happens.

<HEADLINE> Columbine: Fact Vs. Fiction  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   In the months after the Columbine High attack,
investigators
determined some early reports were inaccurate. A look at the facts
and the fiction:
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIRD GUNMAN: Some students told police they saw a third gunman.
Investigators now say there is no evidence a third person was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   TRENCH COAT MAFIA: Some of those who knew the killers said they
were members of the Trench Coat Mafia, a group of students who
joined a clique to defend themselves from athletes. Investigators
say they determined Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris did not belong to
the loosely knit group.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TARGETS: An early report said Harris and Klebold wanted
to kill athletes, Christians and blacks. Investigators now say
Klebold and Harris claimed to hate everyone and did not target any
specific groups.
</P>
<P>
   WHO SAID YES: Early witness statements indicated one gunman
asked Cassie Bernall if she believed in God. When the teen-ager
replied yes, she was killed. Investigators now say witnesses and an
examination of the area indicate Valeen Schnurr, who was wounded,
made the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBS: Initial but unconfirmed reports said the teens had spread
explosive devices around the school days before the attack.
Investigators now believe the teens brought all the gear in on the
day of the bloodbath.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Jet Data Recorder Found  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVAO, Philippines (AP) -- The pilot of an Air Philippines jet
reported poor visibility minutes before the plane crashed
Wednesday, killing all 131 people aboard, airport transcripts
obtained Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts from the Philippines' worst aviation disaster
also indicated air traffic controllers tried at least twice to
hurry another plane off the runway so Flight 541 could land.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot of the doomed airliner reported that the other
plane, Philippine Airlines flight 809, remained on the runway, so
he circled and tried to put down from the opposite direction,
slamming into a coconut grove on Samal Island near Davao city in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said the Boeing 737-200 hit the top of a coconut tree
and lost a wing. The plane then roared its engines and tried to
climb, but fell to earth and exploded, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers on Thursday recovered the battered and charred remains
of more victims, as well as the flight data recorder of the
22-year-old jet.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving relatives identified only 17 of the remains at a
military base where 89 bags of body parts were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole family was on that plane,'' said Patrick Mallari,
standing in a drizzle at a military camp in Davao where soldiers
lined up 23 body bags.
</P>
<P>
   Mallari lost his sister, Luisa Hall; her Australian husband,
Martin, and the couple's two daughters. The family was arriving to
celebrate her mother's birthday, a brother's wedding, and the
baptism of her 3-month-old daughter on Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ''All (events) have been canceled,'' Mallari said.
</P>
<P>
   Elnora Marciano said her sister, Evelyn de la Fuente, took the
plane with her husband and three of her four children for a family
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''She left a son to watch the house,'' Marciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Hill, a 27-year-old nurse went to the airport to pick up her
longtime boyfriend, Anil Diswani, and saw the plane circle the
airport and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''He asked what wanted for a present,'' Hill said. ''I told him
just come home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said skies were foggy at the time of the
crash. According to the tower transcript, as the pilot approached
the airport, he reported that visibility was only three miles --
considered marginal for visual landings, according to Philippine
aviation officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Davao airport does not have full equipment for instrument
landings. Visibility was reportedly worse over Samal island, 610
miles southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Air Philippines, the country's second-largest airline, began
operations in 1996 and is one of a number of new airlines created
after the industry was deregulated several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new airlines use older planes and have been
dogged with safety and maintenance problems. Air Philippines'
operating permit was temporarily suspended in 1998 because of
lapses in safety and maintenance.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After months of searching, director Gina
Prince-Bythewood finally found just the right actress to star in
her debut movie.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one hitch: Sanaa Lathan couldn't dribble.
</P>

up a ball before,'' says Prince-Bythewood. ''I was, like, 'I can't

''Black and White.'' He had to turn a couple of athletes -- New York
Knicks star Allan Houston and boxer Mike Tyson -- into actors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to give them something that feels close to the way
they would talk and the way they would think,'' says Toback.
''You're basically just asking them to respond the way they would
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocks memorizing dialogue? Actors practicing three-point shots?
It can mean only one thing: Hollywood's love affair with sports is
at fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And watch out: It's getting harder to tell the two worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about sports and Hollywood, you really have a
marriage of two truly central American institutions. America is a
society that likes to watch things,'' says Charles E. Marskie, a
St. Louis University sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in an era where people are flush with money. Enormous
amounts of that money are pouring into entertainment and sports.
And it seems to me that sports has become almost indistinguishable
from entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and Houston are only the latest in a wave of jocks hitting
the screen. Football legends Dick Butkus, Johnny Unitas, Barry
Switzer and Jim Brown recently appeared in ''Varsity Blues,'' while
former linebacker Lawrence Taylor snagged roles in ''The Waterboy''
and ''Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball stars Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael
Jordan have each made films, while Kobe Bryant has dipped his toe
in the world of entertainment with a debut CD. Can a Tiger Woods
cameo be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder actors are becoming jocks. This summer, Keanu
Reeves runs the fictional gridiron in ''The Replacements.''
Boxing's especially hot among filmmakers: On the heels of ''The
Hurricane,'' ''To the Bone'' and ''Price of Glory,'' this summer
brings ''Girlfight,'' while Will Smith has been hitting the heavy
bag to play Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   (At the box office, sports movies have found both victory --
''Rocky'' -- and defeat -- ''Price of Glory''.)
</P>
<P>
   Before Ali, though, Smith plays a golf caddy and spiritual guru
for Matt Damon in a summer flick, ''The Legend of Bagger Vance,''
directed by Robert Redford (''Downhill Racer'' and ''The
Natural'').
</P>
<P>
   ''The infatuation with athletes among people from all walks of
life is at a high point. It's the ultimate form of celebrity,''
Toback says. ''Essentially, they are at the center of the whole
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's attraction to athletes is nothing new, of course.
One of the earliest films ever was a real 1897 prize fight in Las
Vegas between James J. ''Gentleman Jim'' Corbett and Robert
Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next century, sports lent its built-in drama and
symbolism to hundreds of films, from ''The Pride of the Yankees''
to ''The Longest Yard'' to ''Chariots of Fire,'' from the triumph
of Rocky Balboa to the brutality of Jake La Motta.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the small screen -- which turned mere athletes into
celebrities in the first place -- is changing the way athletes are
portrayed on the big screen. With ESPN and a smorgasbord of sports
on the airwaves 24 hours a day -- even spilling over into fictional
behind-the-scenes shows like ABC's ''SportsNight'' -- how can
Hollywood compete?
</P>
<P>
   Sports on the big screen now has to look even more authentic to
audiences reared on up-close, instant-replay sports coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That's why actor Jon Seda, a former Golden Gloves boxer, was a
natural to cast for ''Price of Glory;'' it's why Ray Allen, a pro
basketball player, anchored Spike Lee's ''He Got Game''; and why
Kevin Costner threw fastballs until his arm ached in ''For Love of
the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the reason Sanaa Lathan had to spend hours pounding a
gym floor before the cameras could roll on ''Love and Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But films also have to aim for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much pure sports on cable that to produce a movie
that's simply a replication of sports on the field doesn't seem to
me to add much,'' says Marskie.
</P>
<P>
   Prince-Bythewood agrees: ''There seems to be a little less
sports involved in the actual movie itself. That's probably
because, especially with basketball, you've got the NBA on every
single day. And how can you make your footage that much different
than what people are actually seeing on their televisions?''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her movie's opening this weekend, the critics she
feared most weren't film critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My scariest screening actually was for the women's Olympic
team and the WNBA's veterans' camp,'' she says. ''If there's anyone
out there that will diss her basketball -- if they see any little
thing -- it will be them.''

<HEADLINE> Another Zimbabwe White Farm Attacked  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Black squatters wielding whips, sticks
and rocks tore through another white-owned farm today, smashing
windows, setting workers' homes ablaze and beating dogs to death.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe, who has voiced support for the
squatters, said earlier today that he had no plans to deploy police
or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters' leaders had promised Wednesday that they would
halt the growing violence but would not leave the hundreds of farms
they have occupied since February.
</P>
<P>
   In today's unrest, nearly 200 youths rampaged at a farm in
Arcturus district, 35 miles northeast of Harare. Farmer Alan
Windram had fled the property earlier after receiving threats,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers smashed windows, hurled rocks into the farmhouse
and attacked Windram's six dogs, according to an Associated Press
Television News report from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   APTN filmed groups of attackers beating the dogs with sticks and
throwing rocks at the dying animals.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants rampaged through a workers' village, kicking down
doors, smashing windows and burning down about 30 houses as
dismayed workers looked on.
</P>
<P>
   A man directing the attackers who identified himself as David
Mazhandu described the farm as a headquarters of the main
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said militant squatters also marched onto a nearby
farm, forcing the owners to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Two white farmers and a black police officer have died in the
recent violence, and two opposition party activists were killed in
a firebomb attack last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the killings, several white farmers have been assaulted
by ruling party supporters who accused them of backing growing
opposition to two decades of rule by Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, the head of the opposition party, Morgan
Tsvangirai, said his party would not be intimidated by recent
political killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not retreating,'' said Tsvangirai.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mugabe is history,'' he said shortly after arriving home from
a weeklong trip to Britain -- Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler --
South Africa and the United States. He called Mugabe ''a deranged
dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
Mugabe said the country was generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many houses broken into in Britain and it doesn't
mean there's no law and order,'' he said from Harare, Zimbabwe's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about the lack of police intervention, Mugabe retorted:
''The police want to give time for people to act on their own -- and
that's wisdom, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and other presidents in the region were preparing today
for a summit in Zimbabwe on the civil war in the Central African
nation of Congo. The farm deadlock in Zimbabwe will also be
discussed in the summit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence comes a day after landowners agreed to hold
fresh talks on demands by squatters that farmers sign over land
they have claimed on more than 1,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ruling party militants chased reporters away from a
gathering of mourners preparing for the funeral of an opposition
party official killed in a firebombing on Saturday. Men chanting
ruling party slogans slashed the tire of a media car.
</P>
<P>
   Farm union officials advised white farmers to evacuate their
families from the western province of Matabeleland, where farmer
Martin Olds was killed Tuesday, and the neighboring province of
Midlands, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 80 families remained evacuated east of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has called the occupations a legitimate protest against
the ownership of one-third of the country's productive farmland by
4,000 white farmers. He also said that Britain reneged on an
agreement to help pay for land reform in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> John Paul II Washes Feet of Clergy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II bathed the feet of 12
priests in a Holy Thursday ceremony recalling Jesus' Last Supper
with his apostles, when he instituted the sacrament of the
priesthood and communion.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff used the Mass to draw attention to the plight of
flood-stricken Mozambique, dedicating the offering collected at the
ceremony to their aid.
</P>
<P>
   The New Testament says Jesus washed the feet of his 12 disciples
when they ate one last meal together on the day before he was
crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Evoking that event, John Paul poured water from a golden beaker
on the right foot of each priest, dried it with a white cloth and
kissed it before moving on to the next clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   The priests, one shoe on and one shoe off and robed in white and
pale gold, sat on a row on a flower-bedecked platform in St.
Peter's Basilica as a choir sang.
</P>
<P>
   On Good Friday, John Paul is to carry a cross in a traditional
procession around the Colosseum, symbolically tracing Jesus' path
to his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Week culminates in an Easter Sunday Mass at St. Peter's.

<HEADLINE> Budget to include funding for farm energy aid, barns  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators negotiating the 2000-01
budget have agreed to provide $2 million in a new program to help
relieve farmers from hikes in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Energy Assistance Program would help offset rising gas,
diesel and electricity costs farmers have to pay to keep farms
running, said state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, chairwoman of her
chamber's agriculture committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers don't have the luxury of being able to milk in
off-peak hours. Cows have a regular schedule,'' said Hoffmann, a
Syracuse-area Republican and beef cattle farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann said another $3 million will be spent on a new Historic
Barn Preservation Program, which would provide financial aid mostly
to farmers who are making structural repairs on old diary barns
that are part of rural New York landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The barns, which used to store hay on top and house cattle
below, can no longer accommodate new farming technology, but
Hoffmann said they should still be preserved for their historic and
tourism value. While many programs exist for preserving historical
districts in urban areas, ''rarely has there been a program
designed to do something in the historic preservation vein in rural
areas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Farm Energy Assistance Program, eligible farmers will
be able to submit their energy bills to the state and receive a
percentage of their payments back. Specific eligibility
requirements and the exact percentage to be refunded are still
being worked out, but Hoffmann said that for large farms, ''that
could mean many hundreds of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Energy and Research Development Authority will
administer the funds in conjunction with the state Department of
Agriculture and Markets. The aid will take effect in May and
farmers will receive quarterly checks. If the program is
successful, Hoffmann said she expects the program to continue in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture and
Markets, said high energy prices come at an especially bad time as
the spring planting season begins and fuel consumption increases.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers are even harder hit, he said, because milk prices
are extremely low. Farmers' incomes are now a third of what they
were three months ago while fuel cost nearly twice as much, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certain that the math is not on their side,'' Gregg said.
''It's a harsh kick in the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also have to pay for transporting their goods, meaning
more dollars spent on fuel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coventry Transport Services, which hauls milk for dairy farmers
in upstate New York, has added about 10 cents per 100 pounds of
milk in surcharges to its customers since January to cover rising
fuel costs, owner Tom Tripple said. The company, based in Chenango
County, had previously charged farmers $1 for every 100 pounds of
milk transported.
</P>
<P>
   Tripple said an average-size farm transports about 10,000 pounds
of milk every two days.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reed of the New York Farm Bureau said it's too early to
tell what impact the program will have on farmers, but added,
''Anything to help farmers is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann said with farmers already struggling to make ends meet,
many don't have the resources to make capital improvements such as
restoring old barns. That's where the Historic Barn Preservation
Program comes in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It would provide funds to farmers under a cost-sharing structure
and the renovated barn could be reused for agricultural purposes. A
point system will be established to determine eligibility, taking
into account the barn's historic value, architectural uniqueness,
vulnerability to the effects of weather and proximity to other
tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''These barns are like cathedrals. They're built by craftsmen
with ingenuity ... long before there were cranes,'' Hoffmann said.
''They have an incredible amount of history embedded within them.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
and the Department of Agriculture and Markets will oversee the
program.

<HEADLINE> Documents: S. Koreans Shot 2,000  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOKCHON, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean soldiers and police,
observed at times by U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000
political prisoners without trial in the early weeks of the Korean
War, according to declassified U.S. military documents and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur became aware of at
least one of the mass shootings, according to documents originally
classified ''top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The new information, detailed in reporting by The Associated
Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some historians
have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
by the right-wing regime were secretly killed as its forces
retreated before the North Korean army in mid-1950, apparently to
keep them from collaborating with the communist invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, during their brief occupation of the south, the
North Koreans executed many suspected rightists. Those killings,
once discovered, were widely publicized in the Western press.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the South Korean government's mass executions
was suppressed for decades under this country's former military
rulers. Relevant South Korean records were destroyed, researchers
believe. But victims' families recently began speaking out, and
human bones have been unearthed at mass burial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses describe brutal mass shootings. A retired South Korean
admiral told the AP that 200 people, never put on trial, were taken
offshore to be shot and dumped into the sea. Villagers in the
Dokchon area remembered truckloads of civilians, trussed together,
brought to the hills here and executed by South Korean military
police.
</P>
<P>
   The AP learned it was a U.S. Army account of those Dokchon
killings that reached MacArthur. Although the legendary U.S.
general also commanded the South Korean military at the time, he
referred this report on its actions to American diplomats ''for
consideration'' and ''such action as you deem appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador, John Muccio, later reported back that he
urged President Syngman Rhee and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo to
end summary executions deemed illegal and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urged Captain Shin to see that the Korean Army, Police and
Youth Groups carry out executions of captured members of the enemy
forces, including guerrillas, only after due process of law has
been observed and that when carried out they should be in a humane
manner,'' Muccio wrote in an Aug. 25, 1950, letter to MacArthur's
top subordinate, the U.S. 8th Army commander Lt. Gen. Walton L.
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean soldiers had shown ''extreme cruelty'' toward the
condemned prisoners at Dokchon, a U.S. military police
investigator, Sgt. 1st Class Frank Pearce, said in a written report
to his company commander on the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He and other American witnesses reported that 200 to 300
prisoners, including women and a girl 12 or 13 years old, were
killed by South Korean military police on Aug. 10, 1950, on a
mountain near this hamlet 155 miles southeast of Seoul, South
Korea's capital.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korean officer told the Americans the prisoners were
''spies'' -- not North Korean soldiers or guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, who went to the scene after hearing gunfire, said the
Korean soldiers placed 20 prisoners at a time on the edge of a
cliff and shot them in the back of the head. Because of poor aim,
some did not die immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''At about three hours after the executions were completed, some
of the condemned persons were still alive and moaning. The cries
could be heard coming from somewhere in the mass of bodies piled in
the canyon,'' Pearce wrote in his one-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Local Korean witnesses today echo Pearce's description of cruel
treatment. Several times in mid-1950, military trucks loaded with
people in white peasant clothing drove up the winding mountain
pass, and shooting later echoed through the valley, villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A truck pulled up with seven or eight people. They were all
tied together, so they had difficulty getting off the truck. The
soldiers kicked them and hit their heads with the butts of their
rifles,'' Bae In-soo, 83, told the AP. ''They dragged the poor
people in the gully and shot them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we heard the shootings,'' recalled Bae Choon-dal, 79,
''police came later and press-ganged us to bury the bodies. We
hastily threw some dirt over the bodies and ran away as quickly as
possible. It was a dreadful time.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents found by the AP consist of two brief U.S. Army
reports on the Dokchon shootings and the high-level correspondence
that resulted. In one note, Muccio's top aide, Everett Drumright,
told the ambassador he had protested previous such shootings -- in
the city of Taejon in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier executions are recounted in other declassified
documents, accompanied by photographs, found by researcher Lee
Do-young at the U.S. National Archives and published in January in
the Seoul newspaper Hankook Ilbo.
</P>
<P>
   In that material, which was reviewed by the AP, the U.S. Army
attache at the embassy, Lt. Col. Bob E. Edwards, reported that
1,800 political prisoners were executed over three days at Taejon,
93 miles south of Seoul. A U.S. Army major took photos of the
killings with Edwards' camera. The report and photos were sent to
the U.S. Army intelligence staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards wrote that he believed ''thousands of political
prisoners were executed within few weeks after fall of Seoul to
prevent their possible release by advancing enemy troops. Orders
for execution undoubtedly came from top.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Hankook Ilbo stories, Seoul's Defense Ministry said it
would investigate reports of mass executions.
</P>
<P>
   The AP located the declassified documents on Dokchon while
investigating what happened at No Gun Ri, South Korea, July 26-29,
1950, when witnesses say U.S. forces killed about 400 South Korean
refugees. American veterans acknowledged to the AP that their unit
killed many civilians there. Both Washington and Seoul are
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's No Gun Ri report last September spurred South Koreans
to go public with other painful episodes from the 1950-53 war,
including accounts of mass killings of fellow citizens by soldiers
and police.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee's government had fought a guerrilla war with indigenous
left-wing elements in the late 1940s. In mid-1950, it feared
leftists would collaborate with the North Koreans sweeping down the
peninsula. Tens of thousands were arrested, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no time for trials for them. Communists were
streaming down. It (summary execution) was a common practice at
that time,'' said retired Rear Adm. Nam Sang-hui, 74, now living in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Following orders as a navy commander in early July 1950, Nam
said, he authorized three ships to carry 200 people out to sea off
the eastern port of Pohang, where they were shot by police and
their bodies were thrown into the sea, weighted with stones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened during a critical situation for South Korea. We
should not judge these incidents through the standards of
peacetime,'' Nam said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives say many execution victims had nothing to do with
communism and were not convicted of any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot kill people just because you think they were
unreliable or there is something wrong with their ideology,'' said
researcher Lee, a U.S.-educated psychologist who said his father, a
government official, was among 210 people killed by policemen and
soldiers on Aug. 20, 1950, on the southern island of Cheju.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said those executed included children, students, teachers
and even rightist youth leaders against whom local policemen bore
grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, citing the Taejon killings, blames U.S. authorities as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans cannot escape the charge that they condoned, if
not supported, the massacres. After all, those soldiers killed
these people with rifles and bullets the Americans gave them, while
American officers stood behind their backs taking pictures,'' Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of such mass shootings appear to have circulated
routinely among U.S. Army staff officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South Korean police have been quite busy in the Yunchon,
Sangju, Hamchang vicinity disposing of South Korean communists,'' a
secret U.S. intelligence report said matter-of-factly on Aug. 22,
1950. It said U.S. officers declined a South Korean invitation to
witness one mass execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Muccio's August intervention apparently had little
impact. Scattered news reports of the time, along with Korean
witnesses and U.S. war veterans today, tell of many instances in
which scores of alleged communist sympathizers or collaborators
were summarily executed by South Korean forces sweeping back toward
Seoul in September 1950. By April 1951, South Korea's top
commander, Lt. Gen. Chung Il-kwon, felt compelled to order his
troops to stop ''physically assaulting civilians'' in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans also carried out large-scale killings. One
U.S. Army report said they slaughtered thousands of anti-communist
South Koreans, and some captured American GIs, before their
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   After Rhee's government was toppled in 1960, the South Korean
Parliament began investigating alleged summary executions during
the war, but the inquiry ended abruptly in 1961 when the military
seized power. It remained a taboo subject through decades of
military rule, until the liberalization of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families have petitioned the South Korean government
for investigations of at least 10 alleged civilian massacres by
South Korean police and soldiers. They led local journalists to two
abandoned mine pits where piles of bones were discovered, including
skeletal remains of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first goal is simple, to let the world know that this
massacre of a gigantic scale really took place,'' said Lee
Bok-ryong, 71, who lost his father in the national purge.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Mideast Commitment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Thursday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as the State
Department expressed confidence that Israel and the Palestinians
are committed to meeting a September deadline for a final
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin also reaffirmed that the United States
is prepared to play a more active role in recognition not only of
the September deadline but also of others that are approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is agreed that we will play a more involved role by
being at the table, trying to be creative, trying to help each side
figure out what its needs are,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met with Albright over lunch at her residence. He planned
a meeting later in the day with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Palestinians
and Israelis face very difficult issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a very tight time line,'' he said. ''I think the
president thought it would be useful and effective to use this time
to meet directly to see what we can do to keep these (talks) on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last
week, the discussion focussed on the need for an accelerated pace,
and that appeared to be at the center of Arafat's talks here as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on a treaty framework are to begin after the Jewish
Passover holiday, which ends April 26. Negotiators will meet in
Israel and the Palestinian areas, rather than in Washington, as
they have done in two previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have said no progress has been made since talks
on a blueprint for a peace treaty began in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he was not aware that there are any new U.S. ideas
that were being presented on Thursday or any time soon. This did
not rule out the possibility of ''creative suggestions'' at some
point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians face a May deadline for a treaty
framework, and a September target for a full accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Sunday he would turn over West Bank land that would
give the Palestinians the territorial contiguity they need for
statehood, and assured his hard-line Israeli critics that Jerusalem
would remain united under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Palestinian suburbs just outside the city, claimed
by both sides as their capital, would be handed over.

<HEADLINE> Art Director Carmen Dillon Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Art director Carmen Dillon, who won an Academy
Award in 1948 for her work on Laurence Olivier's ''Hamlet,'' has
died at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, who created sets for many memorable British films for
more than 40 years, died April 12 in Hove, southern England, the
family said. No cause of death was given, nor were any survivors
named.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman art director in the British film industry,
Dillon joined the art department at Fox Studios north of London in
the 1930s after six years of training as an architect and an
unsatisfying stint with an architecture firm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, she moved to Pinewood Studios, where she worked on the
films ''The Mikado'' and ''French Without Tears.''
</P>
<P>
   When she created the set for ''The Demi-Paradise'' in 1943,
Dillon was an art director in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   She worked with Paul Sherriff on the Academy Award-nominated
design for Olivier's 1944 classic ''Henry V,'' but it was her work
on Olivier's ''Hamlet'' that won her the Oscar -- for set direction
on a black-and-white film.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon designed the films ''The Way to the Stars'' in 1945,
''The Browning Version'' in 1951, ''The Importance of Being
Earnest'' in 1952, Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' in 1967, ''The
Go-Between'' and ''Lady Caroline Lamb'' in 1972, and ''The Omen''
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Oct. 25, 1908, in Cricklewood, northwest London,
the youngest of six children, and was educated at a convent in
southern England.
</P>
<P>
   A Requiem Mass will celebrated April 28 at The Sacred Heart
Church in Hove.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sticks to S.C. Flag Position  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPLE, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush stuck to his stance on South
Carolinians making up their own minds on the Confederate flag
Thursday, the day after an about-face by former primary rival John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who took a similar position during his campaign,
reversed field and said the flag should come down from the South
Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Thursday, Bush said anew, ''It's the right of the
state of South Carolina to make the decision on the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Wednesday that he had taken a similar position in
February because ''I feared that if I answered honestly I could not
win the South Carolina primary.'' Bush won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday that McCain's words hadn't changed his view
of the Arizona senator as a possible vice-presidential candidate, a
post McCain has said he's not interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opinion doesn't change one way or the other,'' Bush said.
''He made the decision to go down there and give a speech.'' The
two men will meet for the first time since the primaries on May 9
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Asked further about a running mate, Bush said ''I have no lists,
short or long lists. ... There will be an appointed time we'll talk
about the process and I'll be screening and eventually selecting a
vice presidential nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would be named to
develop a list of candidates, Bush said, ''I'm not going to make
any announcements; there are a lot of rumors about a lot of
different things. I'll make the appropriate announcement at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also refused to be drawn into Vermont's proposal on civil
unions, which would grant to same-sex couples some 300 state
benefits of marriage, including medical decision-making, tax breaks
and inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has opposed recognizing same-sex unions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a right to pass a law,'' Bush said. ''It's the right
of the state to make that decision just like it's the right of the
state of South Carolina to make the decision on the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush met with a group of gay Republicans last week in Austin and
said he was ''a better person'' for hearing their stories but still
disagreed with them on gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor answered questions after making an elementary
school appearance to promote ''character education'' on the
anniversary of the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he sat with a group of first-graders learning
about sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sincerity means honesty to me,'' Bush told them. ''It's
incredibly important to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of the current administration has let the country
down, Bush told reporters. ''The president has disappointed us.
He's disappointed a lot of Americans.''

<HEADLINE> 28 Alleged Terrorists' Trial Begins  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A trial opened Thursday for 28 men charged
with plotting to attack U.S. and Israeli tourists in Jordan over
the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who are allegedly linked to accused terrorist Osama bin
Laden, ''plotted to destabilize public security,'' military
prosecutor-general Lt. Col. Mahmoud Obeidat told the State Security
Court. Reading the indictment, Obeidat said the defendants
possessed and manufactured explosives to be used against U.S. and
Israeli targets during Millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen defendants -- 13 Jordanians of Palestinian descent, an
Iraqi and an Algerian -- were in court and have been in custody
since December. The others are believed to be outside Jordan and
are being tried in absentia. They include Jordanians, Palestinians
and a Yemeni.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Obeidat told the three judges that the suspects were
''affiliated with an outlawed group'' involved in a ''conspiracy to
carry out terrorist attacks'' in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He did not name the group in court. Earlier, though, he told
reporters the suspects were linked to al-Qaida -- ''the base'' -- a
terrorist organization allegedly headed by bin Laden. The Saudi
dissident is wanted for the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials have said the 28 suspects planned to attacks
U.S. and Israeli tourists at sites such as Mount Nebo, where
tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land, and at the spot by the
Jordan River where some believe Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   An appointed defense lawyer, Jawad Yunis, said after the hearing
that the prosecution's case would not stand up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants have nothing to do with Osama bin Laden,'' he
said. ''The government is sending a message to the Americans and
the Israelis that it is protecting them to get help from the
world's No. 1 power.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants -- most with long beards and wearing blue prison
uniforms -- were escorted into court by soldiers armed with
automatic weapons. They embraced each other once police had removed
their handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   During the 75-minute hearing, most of the defendants refused to
enter pleas. They frequently interrupted the proceedings with the
Muslim cry of ''Allahu Akbar,'' or ''God is great.'' They accused
Obeidat of ''falsifying'' the charges and said the justice system
was ''infidel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You are guilty because you shunned God's doctrine,'' defendant
Khader Abu Hosher, 36, said when the presiding judge asked for his
plea.
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant, Issam Barqawi, 40, shouted: ''We are not
terrorists as you claim. We are the followers of God and want his
Sharia (Islamic) laws to replace those you enforce which are
submissive to Americans, Jews and Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lt. Col. Tayel Raqad, ruled the defendants had
entered pleas of innocence. He referred one defendant, a
17-year-old student, to a juvenile court because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accused said they were not interested in appointed
lawyers to represent them, but the tribunal went ahead and assigned
lawyers anyway. The court then adjourned the hearing until May 7.

<HEADLINE> 30-Yr., 15-Yr. Mortgage Rates Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rates on 30-year and 15-year mortgages crept
up this week after having edged down two weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose
to 8.16 percent for the week ending April 21 from 8.12 percent the
previous week, according to a survey released Thursday by Freddie
Mac, the mortgage company. This time a year ago, 30-year mortgages
averaged 6.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year
high of 8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent
rate for the week ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also
ticked up this week to 7.82 percent from 7.76 percent. This time a
year ago, 15-year mortgages were at 6.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.76 percent this week, down from 6.86
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the rise in 30-year and 15-year mortgage rates,
Freddie Mac's deputy chief economist, Frank Nothaft said: ''The
recent rise in the Consumer Price Index spooked the financial
market, pushing interest rates a little higher this week.'' Last
week, the government reported that the CPI shot up 0.7 percent in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending April 14
decreased 4.5 percent from the previous week and were down 23.6
percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Buys Back $2B of Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, its coffers filled because of
budget surpluses, bought back $2 billion of the national debt
Thursday, the latest in a series of debt repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   Because the outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds carry higher
yields than the current market yield on comparable securities, the
Treasury Department paid sellers $431 million in premiums to cash
in early.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bought back 12 issues of 30-year bonds maturing between
February 2020 and August 2025. The bonds carried yields ranging
from 6.250 percent to 8.750 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the saving in interest payments will be more
than the costs of buying backing the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped along by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenue -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase debt.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Treasury posted a budget deficit of $35.4
billion in March but the government remains on track to produce a
surplus for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The March deficit -- 58 percent higher than the deficit reported
for the same month last year -- reflects a calendar quirk. Benefit
payments for Social Security, Medicare, veterans and other payments
were shifted to March 31 because April 1 fell on a weekend. That
had the effect of boosting the government's outlays in March, thus
pushing the monthly deficit up.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for March 2000 totaled $135.6 billion, while
expenditures came to $171 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's deficit was bigger than the $32 billion shortfall
the Congressional Budget Office projected.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, President Clinton said that the
government remains ''on track to pay down a record $300 billion of
debt over three years.'' Clinton also welcomed Treasury's latest
buy back of debt. ''If we maintain our fiscal discipline, we can
make America debt free by 2013 for the first time since Andrew
Jackson was president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.69 billion
surplus for fiscal 2000, while the CBO sees a $179 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   If a surplus materializes for fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept.
30, it would be the first time the government reported three
consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bought back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices. Offers must be
submitted in increments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Treasury bought back $1 billion of the debt, the
first time it has done so in 70 years. That was followed one week
later with another $1 billion repurchase. In the two operations,
Treasury paid sellers around $613 million in premiums to cash in
their bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far is a tiny fraction of the $5.7
trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Families Mark Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- As a gentle breeze blew, Coloradans
hugged, wept and observed a poignant moment of silence today to
remember the 13 people slain at Columbine High one year ago and, in
the words of one survivor, to ''let go of the anger.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is about the angels who are watching over us, helping us
to heal and helping us to remember,'' Gov. Bill Owens told a crowd
gathered at the state Capitol in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came through that tragedy with a stronger sense of
community and with a resolve to ensure that the deaths of the
victims will not be in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens presided over a moment of silence at 11:21 a.m., the time
the Columbine attack began one year ago today. As distant church
bells tolled 13 times and a bagpipe played, the governor and his
wife planted columbines, the state flower that gave the school its
name, beneath a flagpole outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At a later community remembrance service near the school in
suburban Littleton, at least 2,500 students, teachers, parents and
residents gathered, listening as each student's name was read aloud
as a bell tolled.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Frank DeAngelis told the crowd he has drawn strength
this year from his memories of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   He often thinks of them as he sits on a deck outside his home,
looking at the sky as he searched for inspiration. ''Their loving,
caring souls never let me down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said a Columbine student, Matt Varney: ''On this anniversary
today, don't forget to remember. It is in the act of remembering
that we give dignity to our suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Patti Nielson, who was wounded, recalled being holed up
in the library, where most of the students died. She said she
''prayed for the children who were being shot and for the children
who were shooting them.'' Her 911 call is apparently the only
recording of the massacre there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want today to also mark the day I let go of the anger,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and loved ones had their private moments, too. Earlier
in the day, about 1,000 students, staffers and alumni attended a
closed assembly at the school, while about 500 parents were at a
separate service in the auditorium. Many wore T-shirts with
blue-and-silver lettering, ''We are Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there's a lot of crying and a lot of hugging, a lot
of solemn remembering,'' said Rick Kaufman, a Jefferson County
School District spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Separate graveside services were held at two cemeteries where
some victims were buried.
</P>
<P>
   At Chapel Hill cemetery, family and friends hugged and cried
softly as an angel windsock adorning victim Rachel Scott's cross
blew in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Creek High School student Sam Mamtherne, 17, was friends
with Scott. ''It's hard just remembering it, the good times and
then remembering how it all ended,'' she said, tears falling from
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Chapel Hill cemetery, where Scott, Corey DePooter and teacher
Dave Sanders are buried, has 13 wooden crosses to honor them and
their fellow victims in an area called Columbine Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre, which left 15 dead, including the two student
gunmen, has left an indelible mark on Colorado, but it should be
easier for residents to deal with the effects of the deadly rampage
once today's anniversary has passed, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Columbine will be with us forever just as the Oklahoma
City bombing,'' Owens said this morning as he stood in Clement Park
near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at the school were canceled and attendance at the
memorial service was optional. In addition to the various daytime
ceremonies, an evening candlelight vigil in Clement Park was
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Workers unloaded barricades at the park Wednesday, preparing for
thousands of mourners bringing flowers, handwritten messages and
teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Branson of Thornton, a Denver suburb, visited the park
early this morning to give give ''a visible sign of support to the
students.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You think about Oklahoma City and you are remorseful for them,
but it's not in your back yard. This is in my back yard,'' said
Branson, who wore a blue and silver ribbon -- the Columbine school
colors -- on his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington today, President Clinton told survivors that
Americans ''must continue to honor their memory and your courage by
resolving to make America a safer place for all our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's attendance has dropped steadily this week, and 624
students were absent Wednesday -- about a third of the school,
district spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Wooten, a freshman, said Wednesday there was little talk
about the anniversary among Columbine students.
</P>
<P>
   ''They care, I know that,'' said his friend Brad Bootsma, a
sophomore. ''I guess they're just trying to go on with their lives.
I know I am.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybean Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean prices fell on Thursday for the
first time in three sessions on the Chicago Board of Trade as
heavier-than expected rains in the Midwest brought relief to dry
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Grain and soybean prices sank in early dealings after
heavier-than-expected overnight rains that soaked much of the
Midwest led to a selling surge as soon as trading opened. Although
most of the corn and soybean crops won't be planted until May and
June, traders fretted that drier weather conditions would return to
the Midwest in the next few weeks and hurt production.
</P>
<P>
   While a couple of storm systems are expected to pass through the
Great Plains next week, wheat prices lagged amid concerns over
anticipated instability in corn and soybean futures.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery declined 2 cents to close at $2.51 cents
a bushel; May corn fell 1 cent to close at $2.26} cents a bushel;
July oats rose 1 cent to close at $1.23\ cents a bushel; July
soybeans fell 1} cents to $5.49 cents a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures were on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pork bellies dropped from a 3{-year high amid expectations for
fewer slaughters.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .45 cents to 69.07 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .28 cents to 84.02 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .65 cents to 76.70 cents a pound; and May pork bellies fell
.55 cents to 97.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Congo Airport Bomb Funerals Held  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- In a drizzling rain, several thousand
mourners gathered at a state funeral Thursday to pay tribute to 109
people killed in a series of mysterious airport explosions last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Caskets of the victims lay covered in flags and wreaths in the
back of 40 military trucks outside the Palace of the People.
Government officials and Western diplomats were among the 1,000
people packing the hall, while thousands more huddled outside under
umbrellas and listened to the ceremony on loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage then crept through Kinshasa bound for a cemetery
some 25 miles outside the city center, where family members and
officials threw flowers and clods of dirt on the caskets after
short sermons were delivered by clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Most shops were closed in keeping with President Laurent
Kabila's declaration of Thursday as a public holiday. Religious
music played on the state radio, furthering the somber mood.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for Friday's blasts at the army's fuel and
munitions depots at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport range
from sabotage to a soldier dropping ammunition while unloading a
planeload of weapons destined for battlefronts in Congo's 20-month
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Tearful relatives appealed to the government for financial
compensation or government housing to make up for the loss of
relatives in the explosions, which shattered windows and ignited
stockpiles of rockets, shells and other weapons and flung debris
for miles.
</P>
<P>
   David Kabila, the brother of a customs official who was killed,
said his brother had spoken of the danger of storing large stocks
of arms and ammunitions at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother warned the military of the danger but they ignored
him,'' said Kabila, who is not related to Congo's president. ''Now
it is too late to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people were also injured in the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Ambassador Frank de Conninck said his country -- Congo's
former colonial ruler -- was investigating reports that a Congolese
dissident group in Brussels known as the Army of Public Salvation
may have been responsible for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged dissidents were also allegedly planning to attack
the president's residence, Radio France-Internationale reported,
citing unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that the disaster originated in Belgium but we
are investigating,'' De Conninck said.
</P>

   Congolese Planning Minister Badimanyi Mulumba Dilembu, who
represented Congo's president at the funeral, said: ''This misery
that has struck us can't be explained. It is God that wished it
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Air force chief Gen. Faustin Munene said the military had not
determined whether saboteurs were involved, but he said munitions
had been removed from the airport.

<P>
   ''This human error will not be repeated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Not Favored for Protection  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Elephants, whales, tigers and turtles will
continue to enjoy international protection, but basking sharks will
have to fend for themselves following a 10-day meeting on trade in
endangered species that wound up Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After often impassioned debate, delegates from 151 nations
agreed to retain the ban on international trade in elephant ivory,
to deny a Cuban request to sell hawksbill turtle shells and to keep
the meat of minke and gray whales off international shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Norway hunt both whales for domestic consumption but
failed to open up international trade in the seagoing mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the United States and Australia failed to get basking
sharks added to Appendix II of the U.N. Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, where their capture would
have come under strict quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest marine fish are prized for their
fins, which can reach more than 6 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bad day for sharks,'' said Stuart Champman of the
World Wildlife Fund. ''For some of the most vulnerable,
slow-breeding species, continued unregulated fishing will fast
erode their vulnerable populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven delegations voted in favor of a British proposal to
add the sharks to the CITES list, 42 voted against, and eight
abstained. But the proposal failed to muster the required
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most emotional agenda items were attempts by four
southern African nations to sell elephant ivory under strict quota,
as well as hides and live animals.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya objected, arguing that such sales would only encourage
poaching among its struggling herd.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe reached
a compromise with Kenya and India under which no ivory would be
sold until an effective system is in place to monitor poaching. But
the southern Africans said they wanted to review the decision in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there had been no consensus, it would have been a real
battle here, which is not good for conservation,'' said Edwin
Bradley Martin of the East Africa Wildlife Society.
</P>
<P>
   Indian delegates went home happy after fending off a CITES
recommendation to have all financial assistance to tiger
conservation halted until the Indian government accounts for funds.
</P>
<P>
   But World Wildlife Fund director Sheperd Gordon criticized
developed nations for failing to support the CITES budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not giving enough, and this is not good for
conservation,'' he said. The current CITES budget is $3.65 million.
The secretariat had asked for a 35 percent increase, but delegates
only agreed to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was elected to chair the CITES standing
committee that handles the convention's business until the next
conference in two years. Chile has offered to hold the conference,
but no decision has been made on the location.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only did we accomplish our objectives for the big,
high-profile species like whales, elephants and sea turtles, but we
re-established our leadership role within the international
conservation community as a whole,'' said U.S. delegation head Don
Barry.

<HEADLINE> New Mutual Funds Cater to Muslims  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A stock portfolio brimming with shares
of Citigroup Inc., General Electric Co., America Online Inc., The
Seagram Co. and the Philip Morris Cos. would seem like a pretty
solid investment for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily for devout Muslims, whose purse strings are
governed by the tenets of their religion. Such companies violate
Islamic law because of their product lines or business practices,
such as selling alcohol or charging interest on loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of these restrictions, most practicing Muslims were
hesitant to invest their money in the international stock
markets,'' said Nizam Yaquby, an Islamic law scholar in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing as Europe's big banks roll out new lines of
mutual funds aimed at Muslim investors, a small market once the
domain of only niche players.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Germany's No. 4 lending institution,
Commerzbank, launched its AlSukoor European Equity Fund targeting
Muslims in the Middle East first, and later those living in Europe.
Looking to hit a volume of 100 million euros ($94 million) by the
end of the year, AlSukoor raised 25 million euros in its first
three weeks alone.
</P>
<P>
   Britain-based IslamQ.com went online last month as the first
Islamic Internet bank. Other big investment houses such as
U.S.-based Citibank, Britain's HBSC, Swiss-based UBS and Barclays
also have their own small funds mainly targeting customers in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic banking has strong roots in the Middle East and
southeast Asian nations such as Malaysia and Indonesia, but even
there only about 10 percent of the assets held by banks are
invested according to Muslim law, or Shari'ah. In Europe, it's less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The world's 1 billion Muslims have roughly $100 billion to
invest, an amount growing by an estimated 15 percent a year,
according to Rushi Siddqui, who tracks the performance of
Koran-safe companies for Dow Jones financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge market demand for Islamic investing and a very
small supply,'' said Paul Brett, an executive with IslamiQ. ''There
are a lot of Muslims in the world and they control a lot of money.
Basic economics tells you that's a good position to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is finding companies in compliance with Islamic law,
or Shari'ah. Committees of Islamic scholars decide what companies
are safe by interpreting Islam's holy book, the Koran. But because
their interpretations sometimes differ, what one fund considers
acceptable may be rejected by another.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ruling out alcohol, pork products and tobacco, Shari'ah
also governs how much debt a company can carry and how much it can
earn from interest.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of IslamiQ, it won't offer interest-bearing bonds,
certificates of deposit or money market funds. Non-financial
companies are also ruled out if their debt is more than 33 percent
of total assets, if interest makes up more than 9 percent of their
income or if outstanding revenues are more than 47 percent of total
assets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Citigroup is usually ruled out because it charges
interest, which violates Islamic law. The same goes for General
Electric, which also has a powerful financial arm.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric is further suspect as the parent company of
NBC, the U.S. broadcaster that sometimes has racy and violent
television shows. That's also a problem for America Online, whose
Internet services can allow users access to pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram would be out for its whisky business, while Philip
Morris is a no-no for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Also off-limits are companies dealing in weapons, human cloning,
abusive animal testing and abortion -- as well as those dealing in
derivatives and futures, which are considered forms of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves most Muslim investors to focus on higher-risk
holdings in stocks and venture capital, which are balanced against
low but reliable returns in commodities, trade finance and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Islamic investments is growing fast, with Dow Jones
launching its own Islamic Market Index to track Shari'ah-safe
companies in February 1999. Last year, its Islamic index for U.S.
stocks climbed 26.35 percent, outpacing both the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Components of the Dow Jones indexes include many well-known
companies, including Internet network company Cisco Systems Inc.,
telephone equipment maker Lucent Technologies Inc. and the online
auctioneer eBay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   High performance isn't always guaranteed, especially with the
tech-heavy portfolios typically held by Islamic investors. Over the
last week when markets fell around the world, those funds took a
heavy bruising like other technology-rich funds.
</P>
<P>
   But to the devout Muslim investor, that shouldn't matter, said
Yaquby, himself an avid investor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some years when you make gains, some years when you
take losses,'' Yaquby said. ''But most Islamic investors expect
that. They are in it for the long run. We consider Islamic
investing ethical investing.''

<HEADLINE> Realtors Sue Over 'Sold' Signs Ban  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Real estate agents are suing to force the
city to lift a civil rights-era ban on the posting of ''Sold''
signs outside homes -- a law that was aimed at countering ''white
flight'' as neighborhoods became integrated.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-member Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors
filed the lawsuit in federal court last month after a five-year
effort to repeal the law died in the City Council. The lawsuit asks
a judge to declare the ban unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're the last big city with that law on the books and
still being enforced,'' said Kevin Vaughan, executive director of
the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, which supported the
ordinance three decades ago and now favors its repeal.
</P>
<P>
   During the tumult of the 1960s, with federal civil rights laws
opening up traditionally white neighborhoods to blacks, authorities
feared an exodus of whites afraid of falling property values. They
said such fears were sometimes fanned by unscrupulous real estate
agents trying to get whites to sell out fast -- a practice dubbed
''blockbusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in 1970 passed an ordinance banning ''Sold''
signs outside homes.
</P>
<P>
   '''Sold' signs were targeted because that was the clincher for
people to kind of say, 'Look, the Browns are selling their house
because African-Americans are moving in. Maybe we should sell, too,
before the property values go down,''' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   Other municipalities such as Willingboro, N.J., went even
further, banning both ''Sold'' and ''For Sale'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Willingboro's
ban, ruling that the community was violating the First Amendment by
''restricting the free flow of truthful commercial information.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, undeterred, asked real estate agents to choose:
They could put up ''Sold'' signs, or they could put up ''For Sale''
signs, but not both. Agents decided to continue putting up ''For
Sale'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman James Kenney introduced a bill for the real estate
agents to try to repeal the ban, but support evaporated after some
neighborhood groups opposed the repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Realtors organization president Frank Jacovini said
the ban on ''Sold'' signs is unnecessary because of stronger
fair-housing laws. His group also believes ''Sold'' signs actually
serve an important public purpose by informing people homes are
selling and the community is viable.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Artur, a longtime Philadelphia broker, said he
doesn't see any benefit from the signs and changing it in the
current strong housing market would be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I put up six sold signs on one block, what does that tell
you?'' he asked. ''That people are selling and people are
fleeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Holmen, associate general counsel of the National
Association of Realtors, said some areas still restrict or ban
''For Sale'' or other real estate signs, but Philadelphia's ban on
only ''Sold'' signs may be unique.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions or bans are usually directed at ''For Sale'' signs,
sometimes to counter ''white flight.'' Once challenged, they fare
poorly in the courts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Holds 500-Year Fest  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- When much of the Americas
celebrated the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' 1492
discovery voyage, Brazil, the hemisphere's only Portuguese-speaking
nation, paid no attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Brazil is holding its own 500-year fest honoring the
arrival of navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral on April 22, 1500. But
nationalist pride is mixed with frustration at the country's
unfulfilled potential, and for many of Brazil's have-nots --
including Indians and descendants of slaves -- the anniversary will
be a day of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 330,000 Indians survive in Brazil, down from as many
as 5 million in 1500.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 500 years that our land has been taken away, our people
killed and turned into alcoholics and prostitutes,'' said Leonardo
Macuxi, a Macuxi Indian from the northern Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   He is among more than 3,000 Indians from 186 tribes gathered to
protest what they call ''the invasion'' near Porto Seguro, the
seaside town 500 miles northeast of Rio where Cabral landed. They
want to forge a united front to pressure the government to protect
their lands, now under siege by farmers, loggers and prospectors.
</P>
<P>
   Landless farm workers also have seized the occasion, pledging to
occupy 500 rural properties across the country this week to call
attention to the need for land reform. In a country larger than the
48 continental United States, 90 percent of the land is in the
hands of 20 percent of the people, while the poorest 40 percent own
just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Black rights groups see no reason to celebrate, either. They say
the myth of racial democracy disguises discrimination, and that
Afro-Brazilians on the average earn and study less than whites and
rarely hold top positions in business and government.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a celebration, it's a symbolic moment for the
country,'' said Kebengele Munanga of the Center for African Studies
at the University of Sao Paulo. ''If anyone should commemorate it's
the Portuguese. They discovered, colonized and plundered'' Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio on Wednesday, police battled students and labor groups
who vandalized a ''500 Years Clock'' near Copacabana beach. Set up
in 28 cities by the Globo TV network, the clocks have spent the
last three years counting down the days to the 500th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The protests seemed to surprise the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 500 years celebration should not be an invitation to a
wake,'' presidential press spokesman Georges Lamaziere said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is to
inaugurate a Discovery Museum and tourist center at Porto Seguro
and welcome a fleet of wooden ships that retraced Cabral's route.
Pope John Paul II is expected to telephone with congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the recent unrest, Cardoso shortened his
planned visit and called for tighter security.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration springs from a sense that Brazil could have been
much better off. Its potential was evident from the first.
</P>
<P>
   ''The land itself is ... so generous that, wishing to exploit
it, everything will it yield,'' Pero Vaz de Caminha, the scribe of
the first expedition, wrote nine days after arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the world's eighth-largest economy, Brazil still
takes prides in its size and promise. It has the world's biggest
rain forest, the biggest river, the biggest hydroelectric dam, the
biggest soccer stadium, the most iron, the most coffee, the best
carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the distribution of its riches is among the most unequal
anywhere. With 165 million people, nearly half of officially
employed Brazilians earn $170 a month or less. More than a fifth of
greater Rio's 10 million people live in slums.
</P>
<P>
   A popular joke has it that ''Brazil is the land of the future --
and always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to suppress a national pride that comes
naturally to Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment is traumatic, but it will pass,'' said best-selling
author Paulo Coelho. ''I'm very proud to be Brazilian. It taught me
to see the world without the barrier between the magic and the
real, and that helped me to grow as a writer and a human being. And
because it's always in crisis, it prepared me for the battles of
life.''

<HEADLINE> Coors Earnings Up 23.7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Adolph Coors Co.'s profit increased nearly
24 percent in the first quarter as it sold more beer at higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's third biggest brewer beat Wall Street's
expectations, and Coors shares rose $1.12{ to $50 a share in
trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For the 13-week quarter that ended March 28, the company
reported net income of $14.8 million, or 40 cents per share,
compared with $12 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results beat the 36 cents a share that analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $464.5 million from $439.9 million a
year ago. Sales volume rose 2 percent to 4.82 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Coors, vice chairman and chief executive of Coors
Brewing Co., Adolph Coors Co.'s principal subsidiary, said the
strong first quarter results were achieved through its domestic
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Modest price increases, cost disciplines and lower interest
expense also contributed to increases,'' Coors said.
</P>
<P>
   Coors' beer products include Coors Light, Original Coors,
Killian's Red and Zima.

<HEADLINE> Guard killed at prison where another was beaten by inmate lastweek  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YARDVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- The death of a prison guard who suffered
a heart attack while subduing an inmate has union officials
pointing the finger at the state Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   They say cutbacks at the Garden State Youth Correctional
Facility are to blame for two incidents in less than a week in
which guards were injured or died.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Michael Price, 44, collapsed Wednesday while attempting to
handcuff an inmate who had become disruptive, according to union
officials.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, an inmate beat a guard over the head with a pipe.
The guard survived.
</P>
<P>
   Garden State, a minimum security prison with about 1,900
inmates, has about 365 guards, 21 less than is called for in the
Department of Corrections' own staffing analysis, according to
Donald Dudich, vice president of the New Jersey Law Enforcement
Supervisors union, which represents sergeants at Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   When planned staff cuts are completed, 328 guards will work
there, Dudich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The staff is doing the best they can to deal with what they
have. But when you reduce the staff and you give inmates more
liberty, this is what happens. The inmates get more aggressive,
they think they don't have to respect the law as much,'' Dudich
said. ''This department wants us to do more with less, and that's
not a good way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was serving the unidentified inmate with a disciplinary
charge when the man assaulted him, Dudich said. Struggling to
handcuff the man, Price was being helped by another officer when he
collapsed, according to Dudich.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Carden would not
discuss the circumstances of Price's death except to say it
happened while he was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The department's special investigations division is
investigating, he said. Carden wouldn't respond to the union's
criticisms about staffing, saying he would not engage ''in a tit
for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the two incidents occurring so closely, he said:
''You will find that corrections officers have the most difficult
job in the world. They do a yeoman's job in protecting the state
from its worst criminal offenders. Understandably, there are
incidents that occur that are unfortunate. This one is among the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Carden said no one has been charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident last week, guard Claude Nix, 54, suffered a
fractured skull and a broken jaw when he was attacked by one or
more inmates. He was hospitalized for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Price, of Burlington Township, was a 10-year veteran who worked
at Garden State the whole time. For his family, it was the second
tragedy in less than six months. In December, his 16-year-old
daughter died in a traffic accident.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Want Trigger Locks  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans say they want tougher gun
controls, including a big majority who favor a law requiring that
guns be sold with trigger locks, an Associated Press poll finds.
But people are split on the best way to reduce violence: better
enforcement of current laws or passage of tougher ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need better enforcement,'' said Jeff Teasdale, a printing
plant supervisor from Baraboo, Wis. ''I don't think the laws right
now are being enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also favored the requirement for trigger locks, saying:
''It would keep a lot of kids from getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Joyce Bell from Wilmington, Del., who was with her
11-year-old daughter near the Washington Monument on Wednesday,
said, ''I want new gun laws. There shouldn't be any guns, in my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 42 percent thought stricter enforcement was
more likely to cut gun violence, while 33 percent said enacting
tougher gun laws was a better approach. Neither option was best for
one-fifth of those in the poll conducted for The AP by ICR of
Media, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The survey reflected a shift from an AP poll taken immediately
after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo., a
year ago Thursday when more people said tougher laws were the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier poll showed just over half of Americans said more
gun laws would be more effective, while four in 10 picked tougher
enforcement. But by late August, people had shifted to thinking
stricter enforcement was a better way to reduce violence.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gun control who are trying to block the enactment
of more laws often call for better enforcement of current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   When not asked to make a choice between the two options, six in
10 in the new poll said they supported stricter gun control laws, a
number that has remained relatively constant in most polls before
and after the Columbine shooting that left 15 dead, including the
two student gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 women favor tougher gun control laws, while half the
men said they felt that way in the AP poll of 829 people taken
Friday through Tuesday. It had an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of those polled said background checks for gun
purchases help reduce the number of crimes committed with guns,
while four in 10 said they do not.
</P>
<P>
   More than four of five women support requiring trigger locks,
while two-thirds of men said they favored the idea. Seven of 10 gun
owners in the poll said they backed trigger locks, but gun owners
were split on the overall question of more gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland earlier this month became the first state to enact a
law requiring that all guns sold in the state must have external
trigger locks, starting in October. After 2002, new handguns will
have to be equipped with built-in locks.
</P>
<P>
   Even as gun legislation has been stymied on Capitol Hill, the
trigger lock movement has been gaining momentum nationally and
President Clinton has been encouraging a growing move in the states
to deal with firearms safety questions.
</P>
<P>
   In March, New York's Republican governor, George Pataki, called
for mandatory trigger locks for all guns. Days later, Smith &AMP;
Wesson -- the nation's largest gun manufacturer -- agreed to provide
external safety locks on all its handguns within 60 days and
internal locks within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Al Gore and George W. Bush, the likely Democratic and
Republican presidential nominees, respectively, support requiring
that trigger locks be sold with guns.
</P>
<P>
   The gun debate was something of a mystery for a young man from
London, visiting Washington this week.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Seeks Americans' Help  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An anguished Juan Miguel Gonzalez, impatient
after a two-week wait on U.S. soil without seeing his 6-year-old
son Elian, called on the American people Thursday to contact
President Clinton and urge immediate action to reunite father and
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them continue to abuse my son,'' Gonzalez said,
referring to the Miami relatives who have been taking care of Elian
since he was found in late November floating off the Florida coast,
a shipwreck survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Spanish, Gonzalez made his plea a day after a
three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
Elian must remain in the United States until the court decides
whether he should get an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wish to be with my son,'' Gonzalez said through a
translator, speaking outside the Cuban diplomat's home where he has
been staying. ''He belongs with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the American people should contact both Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has vowed to take steps to reunite Elian with his father
and spent Thursday conferring with Justice Department aides on the
case, but there was no immediate word on what action she might take
next.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts me a lot to see what they are doing to my son,''
Gonzalez said, declining to be more specific in his brief
appearance. Afterward, he returned to his temporary residence
without answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Elian's Miami relatives and the
government expressed some interest in resolving the impasse though
mediation, but neither side moved immediately to take up a
mediation offer by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the relatives,
said they had previously requested mediation and, in light of the
11th Circuit offer, ''we'll probably be pursuing that a little bit
further.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez' attorney, Gregory Craig, said he sees no
possibility for mediation of a father's claim to his son and urged
Reno to ''take immediate action'' to reunite the boy with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''She should take whatever action is necessary to enforce the
rule of law,'' he said in an interview with CNN. He repeated the
assurance that his client is willing to stay in the United States
pending federal court action on an asylum appeal filed on Elian's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said the
government has ''always been open to the family members talking
about how to achieve an orderly transfer of Elian and if they
wanted mediation for that, we would help facilitate it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the department has not taken a position on whether
or not mediation should be the next step in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said their fax machines had been
inundated by printed forms faxed by supporters of the Miami
relatives. These faxes have been headlined either ''Father, I do
not want to go back!'' or ''Papa, I don't want to go back.'' Their
texts are virtually identical and tell Reno in part: ''We will not
allow you to send Elian Gonzalez into bondage.''

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hostage Rescue Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Top military officials Thursday
were considering a response to a Muslim extremist group's claim
that it has beheaded two hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said that the military and
police ''have been preparing'' a response to the group Abu Sayyaf,
which has been holding 29 hostages for a month in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The government has rejected the group's demands to facilitate
the release of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of that and other demands -- including for the
release of two Abu Sayyaf members being held in a Basilan jail --
prompted the group to behead two of its hostages, both male
teachers who were former soldiers, on Wednesday, Abu Sayyaf
spokesman Abu Ahmad said in radio interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The killings drew widespread condemnation among residents of
Basilan and the southern port city of Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as human shields after
attacking an army outpost. Some of the hostages have since been
freed.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. It has been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians,
including the abduction of foreign missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado said the government will not permit attacks against the
group by vigilantes who have been holding 11 relatives of Abu
Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani in an effort to force the
extremist group to release its captives.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes have threatened to kill the relatives if the
hostages are not freed.

<HEADLINE> No Proof Yet in Osprey Crash Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators so far have found no proof
pointing to human error, maintenance or equipment problems in this
month's fatal crash of a Marine Corps Osprey aircraft, but still
have ruled out nothing, the corps' top aviation official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And he dismissed the idea that there could be a cover up if
problems are found with the MV-22 Osprey, a hybrid airplane and
helicopter that critics say is technologically troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that we're doing everything that we can to
make sure that the cause of the accident is found out and that our
Marines and sailors and Air Force that fly this airplane are all
going to learn from this misfortunate accident, '' said Lt. Gen.
Fred McCorkle, assistant chief of staff for Marine aviation.
</P>
<P>
   In an update on the investigation into the April 8 crash that
killed 19 Marines, McCorkle said it has been determined so far that
the aircraft's major systems -- propellers, engine and drive shaft --
all appeared to be operating normally at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, investigators so far have found nothing to indicate
pilot error or a problem with maintenance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The MV-22 Osprey crashed during a nighttime training mission
over the Marana Northwest Regional Airport in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The military is conducting the final evaluations of the Osprey,
an innovative aircraft. At a Pentagon press briefing Thursday,
McCorkle was asked for assurances there would be no cover-up to
blame the crash on human error so Marines could move ahead with
plans for producing and using the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about integrity and you talk about the Marines
... I think Marines have as much integrity as anybody around,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that you could ever cover up,'' McCorkle added
when pressed, saying there are over 100 experts from industry and
government working on the probe.

<HEADLINE> CSX OKs Better Track Inspections  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- CSX agreed to maintain its tracks
better in a settlement Thursday with federal inspectors who found
deteriorating conditions on East Coast rail lines used by freight,
commuter and Amtrak trains.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors recently found 47 violations, ranging from
insufficient repairs after a derailment to spreading rails that
could cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, effective May 1, the freight railroad
pledged to conduct more-frequent track inspections and pay
penalties for unacceptable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our collective goal here is to make a safe CSX safer through
preventive actions,'' said Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the
Federal Railroad Administration.
</P>
<P>
   John Snow, CSX Corp. chairman and president, said: ''We all
recognize we can do better. And what this agreement is all about is
doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Over two weeks, the railroad agency checked 15 percent of CSX's
23,000-mile rail network in response to a series of derailments on
CSX-run tracks in suburban Philadelphia in February. Three
derailments near residential areas caused no major injuries or
deaths, but one knocked out power.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with CSX tracks have outraged Darby, Pa., Mayor Paula
Brown, who was spared a jail sentence Thursday for allegedly using
her car to block tracks that run through the community. The mayor
has battled CSX for months, complaining about the derailments,
malfunctioning crossing gates and freight trains parked for hours,
blocking traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're irresponsible, very irresonsible. They've no regard
for human life,'' Brown said. But she promised not to block the
tracks again.
</P>
<P>
   Snow said Thursday that 97 percent of the defects discovered,
including the most dangerous, have been fixed and the rest would be
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Molitoris would not say whether CSX would face fines for the
unsafe tracks, saying it was still being considered.
</P>
<P>
   CSX, the largest Eastern railroad, has faced the federal agency
before over similar findings. In 1996 and 1997, the agency cited
numerous safety violations on the network, which was considerably
smaller because the company had not yet bought 42 percent of
Conrail.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that investigation, CSX reworked some of its
tracks, instituted new safety programs and paid a fine.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Transportation, with its headquarters in Jacksonville, has
35,000 employees and serves 23 states, the District of Columbia and
two Canadian provinces.

<HEADLINE> Air Meeting Angers Environmentalists  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists are criticizing a planned
meeting between state regulators and industry groups on air quality
rules as a secret attack on public health standards.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of regulators who are struggling with the
Environmental Protection Agency over air pollution standards was
arranged by Russ Harding, the top environmental official for
Michigan Gov. John Engler, an outspoken supporter of Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality
said next Thursday's planned meeting is simply a policy discussion
among officials who believe the EPA's air quality standards are too
cumbersome for industries to comply with or for states to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Casey, spokesman for the Washington-based Environmental
Working Group, said Harding ''is rounding up a bunch of polluting
industry lobbyists with public servants from other states to figure
out how they are going to hobble environmental health laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a dirty and suspicious little web of backroom
dealing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said the meeting was clearly a move to drum up support for
Bush's presidential bid. Democratic Vice President Al Gore is the
administration's point man on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are fooling no one when they say, 'Gosh, we'll give these
lists of reform ideas to whoever is president,''' Casey said.
''Between the two men that are running for president right now, the
record on clean air couldn't be more stark.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Engler is a top Bush supporter, Ken Silfven, spokesman
for the Michigan environmental department, said the meeting is not
connected to any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't a G.W. or an Al Gore meeting,'' he said. ''The fact
is that there is an upcoming election and there will be new members
of Congress, regardless of party, and a new administrator,
regardless of party, obviously the timing is right.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Bishop, a spokesman for Consumers Power Corp. of
Jackson, an industry group planning to attend the gathering, said
members are hoping to influence the next president's environmental
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for a series of regulations that a new
administration, regardless of party, would find of interest and
possible use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush's campaign, said officials
there were not involved in planning the meeting or even aware of it
until they got a call from The Detroit News, which disclosed the
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harding invited top regulators from 17 other states involved in
major policy fights with the EPA to the April 27 conference in
Detroit. Representatives of auto makers, utilities, paper and oil
industries plan to meet at the same hotel on the same day, then
come together for a brief meeting with the state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Harding had suggested the utility industry help pay for the
meeting, but backed off after several states expressed concern
about the funding.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation calls for ''a framework for this reform that can
be considered by the next U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Administration and/or the next Congress.'' The invitation list
includes officials from seven Democratic and 10 Republican state
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Silfven said representatives of Iowa, Kentucky, South Carolina,
Texas and West Virginia had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Seif, Pennsylvania's secretary of environmental
protection, was invited but said he would not attend because he
doesn't agree with Michigan's position on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to strengthen clean air standards not weaken them,''
he said. ''Governor (Tom) Ridge has sued a number of states on
these issues. We just got the EPA to restore standards that several
utilities had sued to try to weaken.''

<HEADLINE> Carbon Emissions Plan Finds Interest  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In advance of this weekend's Earth Day, the
World Bank announced Thursday that a global market it established
in January to trade carbon emission credits has attracted more
money, government and corporate interest than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said about $135 million has been pledged to the
Prototype Carbon Fund by 15 companies and six countries. The fund
was started to finance projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus is on renewable energy technology such as
wind, small hyrdo-electric and bio-mass that would not be
profitable without support from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Fund participants receive emissions credits based on the size of
gas emission cuts achieved through the projects they finance.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank acts as a broker by helping to negotiate a price
considered reasonable to both buyers and sellers of the credits
that can be used to meet international climate control obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said the money raised so far is about $15 million short
of the $150 million legal cap placed on the fund by the bank's
executive board. It will ask the board to raise the limit to
accommodate interest in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that have agreed to participate so far include Canada,
Finland, the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden and Norway. Another nine
companies want to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Investor companies include BP Amoco, Deutsche Bank, Gaz de
France and six Japanese electric power companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high level of corporate interest in this venture marks a
major shift in how companies think about their role in contributing
to new thinking about global problems such as climate change,''
said Ian Johnson , a World Bank vice president for environment
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also points to growing competition among corporate players
anxious to position themselves in what will likely become a highly
competitive market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund's potential benefits for industrial countries
and companies is that emission reductions achieved from fund
projects could be counted toward meeting their targets under the
Kyoto protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial countries, including the United States, agreed in
December 1997 in Kyoto Japan to reduce from 1990 levels emissions
of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, sometime
between 2008 and 2012. President Clinton has signed the protocol
but Congress has not ratified it.

   Treasury Buys Back $2B of Debt
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, its coffers filled because of
budget surpluses, bought back $2 billion of the national debt
Thursday, the latest in a series of debt repurchases. Because the
outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds carry higher yields than the
current market yield on comparable securities, the Treasury
Department paid sellers $431 million in premiums to cash in early.
Treasury bought back 12 issues of 30-year bonds maturing between
February 2020 and August 2025. The bonds carried yields ranging
from 6.250 percent to 8.750 percent.

   Fuel Takes Toll on Airline Earnings
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Northwest Airlines posted a small net profit on
the sale of Priceline.com stock but still had an operating loss as
earnings were weighed down by greater costs for fuel. Continental
Airlines' profits fell sharply. Northwest reported net earnings of
$3 million in the first quarter as a one-time gain from the sale of
Priceline.com stock made up for losses from higher fuel costs.
Without the $44 million gain, it lost $41 million, or 51 cents per
share, beating analyst estimates of a loss of 73 cents a share.
Continental Airlines reported a 73 percent decline in profits due
to higher fuel costs, but still managed to beat Wall Street
expectations. It earned $14 million, or 21 cents a share, down from
$52 million, or $1.25 a share, in the same period last year. The
year-ago results included an accounting charge of $33 million.
Analysts had expected Continental to break even.

Earnings per share increased to 74 cents from 52 cents per share in
the first quarter of 1999. Net income in last year's first quarter
was $129 million. Revenues rose 6 percent to $2.91 billion. Union
Pacific appears to be finding its feet now after troublesom years

</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- USX Corp. reported first-quarter profits
Thursday in its oil and steel businesses, bouncing back from losses
in the same period last year, as better prices for both products
lifted results. Marathon Oil, USX's petroleum company, posted
earnings of $199 million or 81 cents a share before a one-time gain
compared to a loss of $11 million, or 4 cents a share in the same
period a year ago. The results for the most recent quarter did not
include a $55 million gain on the sale of a one-third ownership of
a Gulf of Mexico project. The year-ago results did not include $130
million in credits from adjustments to the value of inventory.

   Glaxo, SmithKline See Higher Sales
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceuticals companies Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham, which are in the process of merging,
each reported strong first-quarter results. Meanwhile, U.S.-based
Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter profits rose 17 percent
primarily due to increasing sales of its Claritin allergy drug.
Glaxo Wellcome said today it boosted its first-quarter sales by 13
percent to 2.13 billion pounds ($3.36 billion) from 1.9 billion
pounds ($3 billion) in 1999. Sales in the United States rose 22
percent at constant exchange rates. SmithKline Beecham earned a
quarterly pretax profit of 562 million pounds ($888 million), an
increase of 12 percent from the first quarter of 1999 based on
comparable exchange rates. Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter
profits rose 17 percent $628 million or 42 cents per share,
compared to $539 million or 36 cents per share a year ago. Sales
rose 10 percent.

   Winn-Dixie To Cut Jobs, Shut Stores
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Supermarket giant Winn-Dixie Stores
Inc. said today it will cut 11,000 jobs and close 114 money-losing
stores and other facilities. The job cuts and closings will
eliminate 8 percent of 132,000 positions in the 14-state chain
based in Jacksonville. A Tampa warehouse, detergent and bag

   Allstate Blames Storms for Losses
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp.'s earnings before special items
fell 27 percent in the first quarter as the result of an unusually
high number of storms which led to large catastrophe losses and
offset higher premiums. The nation's largest publicly held
insurance company said today it earned $481 million, or 62 cents
per share, before restructuring charges and capital gains for the
three months ended March 31, down from $663 million, or 81 cents a
share, before capital gains in the same period of 1999. Wall Street
analysts forecast earnings before onetime items of 65 cents a
share.

   Gatorade Lifts Quaker Oats Profit
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soaring Gatorade sales helped Quaker Oats Co.
post a 45 percent increase in first-quarter profit before one-time
items. The results reported today exceeded Wall Street's
expectations. Quaker shares rose 4\ to 67 5/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange. A strong rise in sales of Gatorade, the leading
sports drink worldwide, and snacks such as Chewy Granola Bars
enabled the Chicago-based company to easily overcome a 3 percent
decline in hot cereals, including its namesake Quaker Oats.
Excluding one-time items, profit from operations was $106 million,
or 77 cents per share, up from $72.9 million, or 51 cents a share,
a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
had forecast per-share earnings of 60 cents. Including the special
items, Quaker's earnings fell to $1.8 million, or 1 cent a share,
from $86.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Found in McDonald's Blast  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators have identified the likely source of
explosives used to bomb a McDonald's restaurant, a finding that
casts further suspicion on a regional separatist group, judicial
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing Wednesday in Dinan, a town in the western French
region of Brittany, killed a 28-year-old McDonald's employee.
Explosives used in the attack were part of a stock of dynamite
stolen in September from a company in the Breton town of Plevin,
the judicial sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After the theft, police recovered more than half the dynamite
and arrested eight Breton and five Basque separatists. Then, in
March, a small separatist group called the Breton Revolutionary
Army claimed responsibility for an attack that made use of some of
the explosives that weren't recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have pointed to the Breton Revolutionary Army as the
most likely suspect in the McDonald's attack, the judicial sources
said. The group seeks autonomy for Brittany, which has maintained a
strong cultural identity reflecting the Bretons' Celtic origins.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, authorities are expected to open a judicial inquiry
into the bombing. Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said Thursday
that France would do ''everything that is possible to do to shed
light on this attack and find its authors.''
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence also links the McDonald's attack with another
bombing attempt in Brittany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Rennes, Brittany's largest city, authorities defused a small
bomb found in front of a downtown post office. The bomb, which
contained three sticks of dynamite, came from the same stock of
stolen explosives, the judicial sources said.

<HEADLINE> Big Hurdles for Asylum-Seeking Kids  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six-year-old Elian Gonzalez faces substantial
hurdles in trying to persuade courts to let him seek asylum in this
country -- especially if it is against his father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   A child his age ''doesn't really have the life experience and
maturity ... to understand enough about which political system he
professes allegiance to,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the
University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. ''The fact
that Elian signed this application does not at all convince me that
he knew what he was signing.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday barred Elian's return to Cuba
until it determines whether he must be given a hearing to seek
asylum. Miami relatives want to keep the young shipwreck survivor
in this country, but his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, wants to
take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida
coast last Thanksgiving after his mother and other Cubans drowned
when their boat capsized while trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Children ordinarily do not seek asylum against their parent's
wishes. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Elian may
be entitled to seek asylum on his own, and chided U.S. immigration
officials for failing to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only does it appear that (Elian) might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so'' by signing
an asylum application, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says ''any alien'' in the United States can seek
asylum -- the right to stay here to avoid persecution in one's own
country. The appeals court must decide after hearing arguments May
11 whether ''any alien'' means even a child of Elian's age acting
against his parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   To be granted asylum, people must show they were persecuted or
had a legitimate fear of persecution in their home country because
of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or
political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say Elian has nothing to fear in Cuba because he's a
''national hero'' there, said Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett, chairman
of the American Bar Association's coordinating committee on
immigration law. But he said others could say the boy faces an even
greater prospect of becoming a ward of the government in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia lawyer Michael Maggio said Thursday he has
been practicing immigration law for 22 years and ''I've never even
heard of a 6-year-old pressing an asylum case before.'' In any
immigration case, he added, ''The fact that you don't want to go to
your country has absolutely no weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court's ruling referred to the 1985 case of a
Soviet youth who did not want to return to his home country with
his parents. In that case, a federal appeals court said a
12-year-old was ''presumably near the lower end of an age range''
of maturity to assert rights separate from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   However, several legal experts said there are instances in which
a much younger child could be allowed to pursue an asylum claim --
for example, a girl who faced genital mutilation if returned to her
home country.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnett contended that unless a hearing is held, it is not
possible to determine what weight to give to Elian's views.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court's order did not prevent the government
from reuniting Elian with his father in this country, and Attorney
General Janet Reno was considering her next step. The appeals court
also cautioned, ''no one should feel confident in predicting the
eventual result in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday that Justice
Department lawyers look forward to making their case next month
that ''the father speaks for the boy and why that's the legally
proper view.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Benitez, a George Washington University law professor
who represents immigration clients, said that if Elian were allowed
to remain in this country, ''I'm going to be one of the first
lawyers to say here are Ethiopian and Somalian and Chinese kids who
want to live here because life is better in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives may have their
eye on a federal law known as the Cuban Adjustment Act, which
allows Cubans lawfully on U.S. shores for more than a year to be
granted permanent resident status -- a much easier process than
gaining asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Elian can apply on his own behalf could
arise there, too, Benitez said. But, ''I'm fairly certain his
lawyers are keeping that in the back of their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case is sent to an asylum hearing, with several levels of
possible appeals, the case could take years, several lawyers said.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs May Have Been Warm-Blooded  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of a 66 million-year-old dinosaur
suggest that the extinct creatures were warmblooded -- not
coldblooded as once believed -- and capable of the swift and
sustained motion typical of modern birds and mammals.
</P>
<P>
   A modern medical X-ray of a dinosaur fossil named Willo found
clear evidence that the animal had four heart chambers that sent
blood directly to and from the lungs and then pumped the
oxygen-rich blood to the body through a single arched aorta,
similar to how the human heart works.
</P>
<P>
   ''The single aorta completely separates the oxygen-rich blood
from the oxygen-poor blood and sends it to all parts of the body,''
said Dale A. Russell, senior research curator at the North Carolina
Museum of Natural Sciences and a paleontologist at North Carolina
State University
</P>
<P>
   ''The single aorta is really important,'' said Russell, a
co-author of the study appearing Friday in the journal Science.
''This challenges some of the most fundamental theories about how
and when dinosaurs evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Most reptiles have three-chambered hearts, but even in those
with four chambers, such as the crocodile, the blood is pumped
through double arteries that mix oxygen-heavy blood with
oxygen-lean blood, said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Coldblooded reptiles are dependent on the environment for body
heat. Warmblooded mammals and birds generate their own body heat
and are more tolerant of temperature extremes. Birds and mammals
also have more physical endurance and can be swifter.
</P>
<P>
   Some dinosaur experts said discovery of the fossilized heart
will change basic views about the dinosaur and send researchers
scrambling to do more X-ray studies of intact specimens.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fantastic. It's way cool,'' Jack Horner, a famed dinosaur
researcher at Montana State University in Bozeman, said of the
discovery. ''It is a landmark in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Horner said finding the heart in the fossilized remains
''strongly suggests that all dinosaurs were warmblooded.''
</P>
<P>
   If verified by other studies that a rock-hard mass in the
fossilized chest is a heart, it will mark the first time that
scientists have been able to study the cardiac system of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came in the remains of a member of a group of
dinosaurs known as Tescelosaurus, or ''marvelous lizard.'' The
precise species has not been identified, but researchers have
called it ''Willo'' in honor of the wife of a rancher who owns the
discovery site in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the animal was about the size of a pony and weighed
about 660 pounds. A long bony tail gave it a total length of about
13 feet. It had short legs, ate plants and was probably very fast
to survive in a world where giant meat eaters ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably liked to live in brushy terrain, around deadfalls,
and could probably go through that terrain just like a torpedo,''
said Russell. Big animals would have a hard time following so the
Willo ''probably did quite well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This animal lived near the end of the age of reptiles, so it
was highly evolved,'' he said. This suggests that by the end of the
dinosaur era, about 65 million years ago, many, if not all, of the
dinosaurs had complex hearts and high metabolic rates, Russell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hammer, a co-author of the study, found the nearly
intact dinosaur fossil in Harding County, S.D. in 1993. The
specimen was recovered without disturbing the dark mass in the
chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   It was suspected that the mass could be soft tissue that somehow
fossilized with the animal's bones. Usually dinosaur specimens bear
no trace of soft tissue, which usually decays before it can become
fossilized.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew A. Kuzmitz, an Ashland, Ore., physician and amateur
paleontologist, later examined the specimen with a CT scan, a form
of medical X-ray that gives details of internal structure. He said
seven cardiologists looked at the images and identified the object
as a heart with separated pumping chambers similar to the human
heart.	   Paul Fisher, director of an imaging lab at the North Carolina
State University veterinarian school, enhanced the CT scan data
into three-dimensional images. He said the presence of a
four-chambered heart became obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see both ventricles (lower heart chambers) and the
aorta (a major artery),'' said Fisher, the first author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said that two veterinarian experts have looked at the
images and agreed that the chest mass is the fossil of a
four-chambered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a four-chambered heart and a high metabolic rate
could have been essential to survival for dinosaurs like Willo,
which would have been choice morsels for the big meat eaters, such
Tyrannosaurs Rex, said Fisher. Coldblooded animals are sluggish in
chilly weather and would have been easy prey.
</P>
<P>
   Horner said that because of the Willo study by North Carolina
scientists, he and other researchers will now start doing CT scans
on any intact dinosaur fossils they find.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are several around like that and I think we'll all start
looking at them,'' said Horner.
</P>
<P>
   Among the effects of the heart discovery, said Horner, is a
boost for the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs, a theory that
is becoming more widely accepted by paleontologists. Birds also
have four-chambered hearts.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Colorectal Cancer Treatment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in years, the government
has approved a new first-line treatment for patients whose
colorectal cancer has spread, saying the newer therapy could
prolong survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmacia Corp.'s Camptosar won Food and Drug Administration
approval Thursday. It can be used, in combination with two standard
cancer drugs, as soon as colorectal cancer has metastasized.
</P>
<P>
   Camptosar has been sold as a follow-up cancer treatment since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new approval ''will likely change the way patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer are treated,'' said Dr. Robert
Justice, FDA's deputy director of cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer
this year. About half of the patients treated with surgery,
sometimes followed with chemotherapy or radiation, will have their
cancer spread beyond the colon or rectum.
</P>
<P>
   The new approval comes after two clinical trials studied whether
infusing patients with Camptosar in addition to standard treatment
-- the older drugs 5FU and leucovorin -- helped newly metastatic
patients. Those studies found median survival prolonged by about
three months with the newer combination.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects of Camptosar include severe diarrhea that may
require medical treatment, as well as nausea, vomiting and a drop
in white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia said it expects a 60 percent increase in patients
using Camptosar as a result of the new FDA approval. A course of
treatment, lasting up to six months, costs about $15,000.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Attacks Iran's Reformists  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader attacked the country's
reformist newspapers on Thursday, accusing them of undercutting the
Islamic revolution. He also warned hard-liners not to take the law
into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an estimated 100,000 young people in Tehran's Grand
Mosque, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there were 10 to 15 newspapers
undermining Islamic principles, ''insulting'' state bodies and
creating social discord.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, some of the newspapers have become the bases of
the enemy. They are performing the same task that the BBC (British
Broadcasting Corp.) radio and Voice of America as well as the
British and American and Zionist television broadcasts intend to
perform,'' Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei said the reports which accused the elite revolutionary
forces of being involved in the March 12 shooting of the leading
reformist Saeed Hajjarian had harmed Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-reform newspapers have blamed the attack on hard-liners.
Hajjarian, a city councilman, was gravely injured and remains in a
Tehran hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''A shooting happens. Investigations have not produced any
results and these newspapers accuse the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps ... of involvement,'' Khamenei said. ''This trend is
detrimental to the state, revolution, the youth and the faith of
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei said he has told President Mohammad Khatami, a
reformer, about this trend. ''He is also unhappy with this
situation,'' Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was interrupted by chants of ''death to mercenary
writers'' and ''shame on you, hypocrites, leave the press'' from
apparent hard-liners in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, however, condemned ''any illegal action by any person
due to emotion and support for this or that person. I'll not allow
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners, who oppose the reforms introduced by Khatami, have
often been accused of using force against opponents. They have
employed vigilante groups and security force members to attack or
intimidate critics.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in 1997, Khatami has loosened the strict
Islamic social code and allowed greater press freedom. Hard-liners
see such moves as a betrayal of the 1979 Islamic revolution that
brought the clergy to power.

   Microsoft Earnings Up 24 Percent

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s third-quarter earnings rose 24
percent from a year ago amid analysts' concerns over lagging
computer sales and investor worries about its ongoing legal woes.
The software company had profits of $2.39 billion, or 43 cents per
share, on sales of $5.66 billion -- a 23 percent increase in
revenues -- in the three months ended March 31. In the same period a
year ago, the company made $1.92 billion, or 35 cents per share, on
revenue of $4.6 billion. The results squeaked by analysts
expectations of 41 cents per share, as reported by First

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, its coffers filled because of
budget surpluses, bought back $2 billion of the national debt
Thursday, the latest in a series of debt repurchases. Because the
outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds carry higher yields than the
current market yield on comparable securities, the Treasury
Department paid sellers $431 million in premiums to cash in early.
Treasury bought back 12 issues of 30-year bonds maturing between
February 2020 and August 2025. The bonds carried yields ranging
from 6.250 percent to 8.750 percent.

   Fuel Takes Toll on Airline Earnings
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Northwest Airlines posted a small net profit on
the sale of Priceline.com stock but still had an operating loss as
earnings were weighed down by greater costs for fuel. Continental
Airlines' profits fell sharply. Northwest reported net earnings of
$3 million in the first quarter as a one-time gain from the sale of
Priceline.com stock made up for losses from higher fuel costs.
Without the $44 million gain, it lost $41 million, or 51 cents per
share, beating analyst estimates of a loss of 73 cents a share.
Continental Airlines reported a 73 percent decline in profits due
to higher fuel costs, but still managed to beat Wall Street
expectations. It earned $14 million, or 21 cents a share, down from
$52 million, or $1.25 a share, in the same period last year. The
year-ago results included an accounting charge of $33 million.
Analysts had expected Continental to break even.

lifted results. Marathon Oil, USX's petroleum company, posted
earnings of $199 million or 81 cents a share before a one-time gain
compared to a loss of $11 million, or 4 cents a share in the same
period a year ago. The results for the most recent quarter did not
include a $55 million gain on the sale of a one-third ownership of
a Gulf of Mexico project. The year-ago results did not include $130
million in credits from adjustments to the value of inventory.

   Glaxo, SmithKline See Higher Sales
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceuticals companies Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham, which are in the process of merging,
each reported strong first-quarter results. Meanwhile, U.S.-based
Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter profits rose 17 percent
primarily due to increasing sales of its Claritin allergy drug.
Glaxo Wellcome said today it boosted its first-quarter sales by 13
percent to 2.13 billion pounds ($3.36 billion) from 1.9 billion
pounds ($3 billion) in 1999. Sales in the United States rose 22
percent at constant exchange rates. SmithKline Beecham earned a
quarterly pretax profit of 562 million pounds ($888 million), an
increase of 12 percent from the first quarter of 1999 based on
comparable exchange rates. Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter
profits rose 17 percent $628 million or 42 cents per share,
compared to $539 million or 36 cents per share a year ago. Sales
rose 10 percent.

   Winn-Dixie To Cut Jobs, Shut Stores
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Supermarket giant Winn-Dixie Stores
Inc. said today it will cut 11,000 jobs and close 114 money-losing
stores and other facilities. The job cuts and closings will
eliminate 8 percent of 132,000 positions in the 14-state chain
based in Jacksonville. A Tampa warehouse, detergent and bag
factories and three division offices also will be shut down. The
top-to-bottom restructuring plan will also lead to management
consolidation, the company said, beginning with the retirements of
10 vice presidents.

   Allstate Blames Storms for Losses
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp.'s earnings before special items

high number of storms which led to large catastrophe losses and
offset higher premiums. The nation's largest publicly held
insurance company said today it earned $481 million, or 62 cents
per share, before restructuring charges and capital gains for the
three months ended March 31, down from $663 million, or 81 cents a
share, before capital gains in the same period of 1999. Wall Street
analysts forecast earnings before onetime items of 65 cents a

   Gatorade Lifts Quaker Oats Profit
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soaring Gatorade sales helped Quaker Oats Co.
post a 45 percent increase in first-quarter profit before one-time
items. The results reported today exceeded Wall Street's
expectations. Quaker shares rose 4\ to 67 5/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange. A strong rise in sales of Gatorade, the leading
sports drink worldwide, and snacks such as Chewy Granola Bars
enabled the Chicago-based company to easily overcome a 3 percent
decline in hot cereals, including its namesake Quaker Oats.
Excluding one-time items, profit from operations was $106 million,
or 77 cents per share, up from $72.9 million, or 51 cents a share,
a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
had forecast per-share earnings of 60 cents. Including the special
items, Quaker's earnings fell to $1.8 million, or 1 cent a share,
from $86.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Two upstate New York banks merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWICH, N.Y. (AP) -- NBT Bancorp Inc. said Thursday it is
acquiring a rival upstate New York bank holding company, BSB
Bancorp Inc., for $251 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Norwich-based NBT Bancorp operates NBT Bank, which has 36
offices in nine counties in central and northern New York.
Binghamton-based BSB Bancorp's banking subsidiary, BSB Bank &AMP;
Trust, operates 22 offices in six counties in central and western
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they have signed a definitive agreement to
join forces late this year, creating one of upstate New York's
largest independent community banks with more than 55 offices in 12
counties and $4.7 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, BSB
shareholders would get two shares of NBT common stock for each BSB
share. That amounts to a premium of 34 percent over BSB's price of
$17.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BSB Bancorp employs about 600 people and NBT Bancorp has 900
employees. Fewer than 100 jobs will be eliminated by the merger,
said Thomas Thorn, BSB Bancorp's acting president.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceuticals companies Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham, which are in the process of merging,
each reported strong first-quarter results. Meanwhile, U.S.-based
Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter profits rose 17 percent
primarily due to increasing sales of its Claritin allergy drug.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome PLC
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome said Thursday that it boosted its first-quarter
sales by 13 percent over the same period last year, due partly to
strong results for its new asthma drug Seretide and its HIV
treatment Ziagen.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly sales grew to 2.13 billion pounds ($3.36 billion) from
1.9 billion pounds ($3 billion) in 1999, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the United States rose 22 percent at constant exchange
rates. U.S. sales benefited from an encouraging debut by Lotronex,
Glaxo's drug for irritable bowel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   A strong performance by other new products, including the flu
medicine Relenza, contributed to the result for the first three
months of the year. But so did the favorable comparison with last
year's weak first quarter, when poor sales for some drugs were a
drag on the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   European sales grew by 9 percent at constant exchange rates,
while sales in the rest of the world rose by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that earnings growth, excluding costs related
to restructuring and to Glaxo's pending acquisition of drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham, were broadly in line with its sales growth. It
gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo agreed in January to buy SmithKline in a deal worth about
$180 billion. Chairman Richard Sykes affirmed that the SmithKline
acquisition is on track for completion this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Glaxo Wellcome rose 56 pence, or 3 percent, to 1,958
pence ($30.94) in London trading.
</P>
<P>
SmithKline Beecham PLC
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline Beecham earned a quarterly pretax profit of 562
million pounds ($888 million), an increase of 12 percent from the
first quarter of 1999 based on comparable exchange rates, the
company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales of three drugs introduced last year in the United
States -- the antibiotic Augmentin, antidepressant Paxil and
diabetes drug Avandia -- helped lift earnings. However, results for
the arthritis treatment Relafen lagged in the face of strong
competition.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline's pretax profit in the first quarter of 1999 was 510
million pounds ($811 million).
</P>
<P>
   Sales from ongoing operations rose 11 percent, at constant
exchange rates, to 1.99 billion pounds ($3.14 billion) from 1.83
billion pounds ($2.89 billion). However, sales slipped 3 percent if
the results for operations that SmithKline sold last year are
included in 1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
   Drug sales in the U.S. market rose 20 percent at constant
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Paxil sales rose 24 percent to 348 million pounds ($550 million)
and Augmentin sales grew by 10 percent, in spite of a dip in
European sales, to 318 million pounds ($504 million).
</P>
<P>
   Shares of SmithKline rose 28 pence, or 3 percent, to 879.50
pence ($13.89), in London.
</P>
<P>
Schering-Plough Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough Corp.'s first quarter profits rose 17 percent
primarily due to increasing sales of its Claritin allergy drug.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough made $628 million or 42
cents per share, compared to $539 million or 36 cents per share a
year ago. Results matched Wall Street analysts' forecasts,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 10 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's drug sales increased by 12 percent to $2.02
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Claritin, the world's leading allergy drug, rose 18
percent to $665 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Intron A/Rebetron combination therapy for hepatitis C
rose 23 percent to $336 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's inhaled steroid Nasonex rose 26 percent to $137

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports Isolated TB Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A tuberculosis outbreak in the transgender
communities of Baltimore and New York City may be spreading to
other cities, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 26
active cases and 37 dormant cases of tuberculosis, most of them
connected to members of the transgender community in the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC uses the term transgender to encompasses cross-dressers,
those who have undergone sex-change procedures and individuals who
are planning to undergo sex-change operations.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cases in Baltimore were men except for four women who
were either family members of the men or health care workers who
treated them. Many had a strain of TB treated with common
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The government said 62 percent of the tuberculosis patients
tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. People with
HIV are susceptible to tuberculosis and could die if not treated.
</P>
<P>
   Transgenders often travel to many cities frequenting social
clubs and participating in fashion and dance competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frequent travel and social network links identified among the
Baltimore and NYC cases have raised concern that this strain ...
may be circulating in other cities among young, mobile transgender
persons with HIV infection,'' the CDC said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC is checking for additional cases linked to the same
strain in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia
and Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service Inc.'s profit for the first
quarter rose 63 percent, swelled by a 14 percent increase in
revenue and onetime gains.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the onetime items, its profit rose 35 percent and
beat Wall Street expectations. Its shares shot up $4.43}, or more
than 7.5 percent, to $63.50 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery company, which sold stock to the public in
November, also announced Thursday it plans to spend up to $1.2
billion of the proceeds from the initial public offering to launch
a share repurchase program.
</P>
<P>
   UPS earned $813 million, or 67 cents per share, in the
January-March period, up from $499 million, or 44 cents per share,
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results were inflated by $139 million in
non-recurring items as proceeds from the sales of investments and a
truck leasing operation were offset partly by labor charges.
</P>
<P>
   Without the onetime items, its earnings rose to $674 million, or
56 cents per share. That beat the consensus forecast of 52 cents
per share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter climbed to $7.2 billion from $6.3
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. package operations profit rose 13.2 percent on an 11.7
percent increase in revenue. International package operations's
profits rose 23.1 percent on a 15.6 percent increase in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 65.6 percent in its non-package business that
includes a new subsidiary set up to help companies that sell their
products on the Internet and a new insurance business.

<HEADLINE> Russia Resists Boosting Cops' Powers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A proposed code expanding the authority of the
traffic police met stiff resistance in parliament Thursday, with
deputies across the political spectrum saying it boosts police
powers and trims some civil liberties won after the Soviet Union's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we pass this, we lay the foundation stone of a totalitarian
state,'' said Andrei Isaev, a deputy in the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal expanding the authority of traffic police met
particular criticism from lawmakers, who said that this branch of
law enforcement is already notorious for abusing its powers and
bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Communist legislator Anatoly Lukyanov said the traffic police
proposal had been advanced by members of several parties, yet
faction leaders of all parties spoke against the measure that would
stiffen punishments for some moving violations to include jail
stays.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Morozov, head of the Russia's Region's group, called the
proposal ''a tilt toward a police regime,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Viktor Pokhmelkin, a leader of the liberal Union of Right
Forces party, said the provisions would give police more chances to
demand bribes from motorists eager to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will only lead to a worsening of corruption,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new administrative code has thousands of provisions covering
everyday life, such as parking and licensing of street trade. It
specifies which officials can hand out punishment for which
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But fines or imprisonment often apply only to those who cannot
bribe their way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 U.S. State Department human rights report said Russian
police sometimes keep people in jail for administrative offenses
beyond the legal period in order to extort bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The current administrative code dates from 1985, and a revision
has been in the works for four years, resulting in a four-volume
proposal that has received more than 3,000 amendments. Deputies
gave preliminary approval to some sections Thursday but the
contentious parts will face more debate in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Union Pacific Reports Income Boost  </HEADLINE>
By JOE RUFF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Citing service improvements after its merger
with Southern Pacific, leading railroad operator Union Pacific
Corp. reported net income of $185 million for its first quarter of
the year, a 43 percent increase over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share increased to 74 cents from 52 cents per share
in the first quarter of 1999. Net income in last year's first
quarter was $129 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 6 percent to $2.91 billion from $2.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific poured millions of dollars into implementing its
1996 merger with Southern Pacific as service problems crippled the
railroad in 1997 and 1998. Now, Union Pacific appears to be finding
its feet, earning $810 million last year compared to a net loss of
$633 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Because of higher oil prices, Union Pacific spent $100 million
more on fuel in the quarter ended March 31 than in the same period
the year before. At the same time, Union Pacific reported a 28
percent increase in operating income to $451 million. That figure
excludes UP's Overnite Transportation business, which has been hit
by a Teamsters strike.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific's difficulty in implementing its merger was a key
factor in the Surface Transportation Board's decision in March to
impose a 15-month moratorium on railroad mergers. The board, which
regulates railroads, wants to study the problems from combinations
in the 1990s and rewrite its merger rules.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision has put a halt to Burlington Northern Santa
Fe's planned merger with Canadian National Railway.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares were priced at $41.31\ at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $1 or about 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Deaf Sue Movie Giants Over Captions  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three deaf individuals sued movie theater
giants Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. and AMC Entertainment on
Thursday, contending they violated the federal disabilities law by
failing to provide captioning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, asserts that the theaters could take reasonable steps to
allow deaf individuals to watch movies with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply cannot enjoy movies without the proper
accessibility,'' said John Stanton, a Washington attorney who is
one of the plaintiffs. Deaf since age four, Stanton said that
people who can't hear miss out on shared experiences that movies
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, Kevin Ball, said he faces problems when he
takes his small children to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't lip read cartoons,'' said Ball, who works at the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint argues that theaters are a place of ''public
accommodation'' as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act
and therefore should ensure that deaf people are not denied service
due to their disability.
</P>
<P>
   The companies named in the lawsuit say they already offer some
showings of movies using a system called ''open captioning.'' That
system is similar to movie subtitles, but without the black
background box. It also uses italics in the corner or icons to
describe sounds and events that a deaf person might miss.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Cohen, the lawyer handling the case, said the problem
is the infrequency with which such captioned films are shown in a
given week or month.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll do an occasional viewing from time to time to try to
sugarcoat the issue,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks for the theaters to implement captioning at all
screenings within 180 days. There is no monetary request.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the theaters can make movies more accessible to deaf
individuals through a number of means without exorbitant costs or
inconvenience to their hearing audiences.
</P>
<P>
   One system, called ''rear window'' captioning, involves the
theaters providing deaf attendees with a plexiglass screen that
they can stick into the cup holder or seat in front of them. The
screen would show captions for that individual viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Another system involves scrolling captions on the backs of seats
and a third would call for a separate viewing screen altogether
within the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen estimated that adding such technologies would cost about
$8,000 to $15,000 per theater but would also bring added revenue
from hearing impaired or other audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews Cineplex, said that the
rear window captioning system is cost-prohibitive to install and
could become obsolete very soon. In the last two years, the company
has been doing special engagements of films with open captions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making efforts to reach out to the hearing impaired
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said the company has been providing
open captions in some of its theaters for nearly three years and
plans to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been well-received,'' AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte
said. ''This was the system that we have been advised is the
preference of the hearing impaired community.''
</P>
<P>
   Another limiting factor is the number of prints that movie
studios make with the captions included. Nanci Linke-Ellis of
Tripod Captioned Films coordinates between studios that make
captioned films and movie houses that want to show them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have many more theaters coming into the program than the
number of prints (the studios) are willing to give us,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> GM Allowed To Operate Savings Bank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp., the world's largest
automaker, received permission Thursday to operate a savings bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Office Of Thrift Supervision's approval clears the way for
the Detroit-based automaker to open a federally chartered bank.
GMAC Bank will be a full-service banking operation. It will be

<P>
   OTS said GMAC will offer its services to the public through its
Wilmington office but will conduct the majority of its business

</P>
<P>
   Through the arrangement, GMAC Bank will be one of the nation's
largest originators of residential mortgage loans and home equity
loans, OTS said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Earnings Up 24 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s third-quarter earnings rose 24
percent from a year ago amid analysts' concerns over lagging
computer sales and investor worries about its ongoing legal woes.
</P>
<P>
   The software company had profits of $2.39 billion, or 43 cents
per share, on sales of $5.66 billion -- a 23 percent increase in
revenues -- in the three months ended March 31. In the same period a
year ago, the company made $1.92 billion, or 35 cents per share, on
revenue of $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results squeaked by analysts' expectations of 41 cents per
share, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial, but did not
impress some on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pretty weak,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst William
Epifanio. ''I expected much higher sales than this, even with the
Y2K bug effects in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft really needs a breakout quarter if they're going to
move the stock price,'' he said. ''It would really take something
like getting $6 billion in revenues to make that kind of
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported earnings after the regular trading ended on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, where shares finished at $78.93}, up 25
cents. In after-hours trading, shares were trading down $3.31\ to
$75.62{.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares were hit hard this month after a federal
judge's antitrust ruling against the company on April 3. U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft
violated antitrust law by illegally using its monopoly power. The
case stems from a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and 19
states.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, on April 12, prominent analyst Rick Sherlund
of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., reduced his estimate of Microsoft's
revenues due to slow corporate computer sales, sending shares
downward again.
</P>
<P>
   John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer, agreed that
personal computer sales, slowed by concerns over the Year 2000
computer bug, affected the bottom line this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Demand for business PCs remained slow in the quarter, and we
remain guarded about near-term growth,'' Connors said. ''However,
PC demand appeared to pick up late in the quarter, and with the
launch of Windows 2000, we are excited about the opportunity to
help customers migrate to this new generation of platform
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Epifanio and other analysts say the new Windows 2000 operating
system, designed for corporate networks and work stations, will
help boost sales in future quarters. It was introduced Feb. 17,
though most corporations who might purchase Windows 2000 will take
their time in testing and installing the new software.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 31, when the stock closed at $106.25, Microsoft has
plummeted more than 25 percent, contributing to a major market
selloff and investor uncertainty that continues to linger.
</P>
<P>
   The stock hit its 52-week low of $73 on Monday and, as of
Thursday's end of regular trading, is down 14 percent over the past
12 months compared with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index,
a widely recognized barometer of the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three quarters of the year, Microsoft earned $7
billion, or $1.27 per share, on revenues of $17.2 billion. Last
year, Microsoft had net earnings of $5.6 billion, or $1.02 per
share, on sales of $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Earnings Rise 10 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Knight Ridder, the nation's
second-largest newspaper publisher, reported a 10 percent rise in
first-quarter earnings before a special gain as stronger
advertising revenues and lower newsprint costs lifted profits.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a one-time gain from the sale of several Internet
investments, Knight Ridder, which publishes 31 daily newspapers
including the San Jose Mercury News, earned $68.9 million in the
first three months of the year compared to $62.9 million in the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Per-share earnings were 74 cents, edging analysts' expectations
of 73 cents, as measured by First Call/Thomson Financial. The
year-ago earnings were equivalent to 65 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares were priced at $47.81\ at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder earned $92 million from the sales of two
companies, Cadabra, an Internet software company, and Prio, an
online coupon company. In connection with those transactions, the
company received stock in GoTo.com and InfoSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Including the gains, Knight Ridder had net earnings of $161
million, or $1.74 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a solid performance, propelled by strength in our large
West Coast markets, sustained robust national advertising, strong
classified and lower newsprint costs,'' chairman and CEO Tony
Ridder said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue for the quarter was up 4.7 percent,
classified advertising was up 6.6 percent, but retail revenue fell
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Total circulation was flat, while costs were up a total of 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 5 percent to $808 million from $771 million.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Delay May Spur Merger  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1998, it was Viagra. In 1999 it was the
arthritis pill Celebrex. This year, the biggest new blockbuster
prescription drug was supposed to be the hypertension medicine
Vanlev.
</P>
<P>
   But Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s hopes of launching the next pill
destined for multibillion dollar annual sales were scuttled when
federal officials raised concerns that Vanlev may cause severe
facial swelling and impair breathing in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries led the nation's third-largest drugmaker Wednesday
to withdraw its application for Vanlev until more studies can be
completed, a move that should delay launch of the pill until at
least late next year.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of its promising blood-pressure drug now
uncertain, Bristol-Myers may find itself an acquisition target or a
merger player, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year delay on a potential blockbuster could cause them to
think more actively about merging,'' said Bob Kirby, an analyst
with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The company is downplaying the need to merge, despite the
consolidation wave sweeping the pharmaceutical industry. But the
officials aren't ruling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking back or standing still,'' Michael Mee,
Bristol-Myers' chief financial officer, said in a conference call
Thursday with analysts. ''We are looking at all of our options with
great intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's first-quarter earnings rose a
better-than-expected 15 percent, most analysts' focus was clearly
on the company's pipeline of future products -- and the future of
Vanlev.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe a merger is likely if the company cannot
revive Vanlev, a drug expected to post $2 billion or more in annual
sales when it reaches market.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will probably merge if they are not able to revive
Vanlev,'' said Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. He gives the
drug a 50-50 chance of making it on the market without serious
safety warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Companies routinely stumble in developing new drugs -- nine out
of 10 drugs they test in people never make it to market.
</P>
<P>
   But drug firms' pipelines have grown in importance as Wall
Street pressures the firms to show evidence they can continue to
raise profits at double-digit levels. As a result, the New
York-based Bristol-Myers has not shied away from promoting numerous
studies of Vanlev over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers officials acknowledge they expected to have the
drug approved in June, and had no contingency plan for the delay
caused after the Food and Drug Administration raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of more than $100 billion and a
diverse portfolio of products, including medical devices and the
world's leading infant formula, Bristol-Myers remains confident
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very fortunate that we are not just a one- or two- or
three-product company,'' Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   Other big drugmakers have overcome similar research setbacks,
Kirby said. Merck &AMP; Co. in 1998 disappointed Wall Street when it
announced it was not moving ahead with a promising antidepressant.
And Schering-Plough Corp. was punished last year after the company
ran into safety problems with its experimental impotence pill.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Wall Street considered Bristol-Myers one of the
most attractive drugmakers. But the Vanlev problem spotlights a
number of potential shortcomings at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the company's top-selling drug, the
cholesterol-lowering pill Pravachol, have declined, losing market
share to Warner-Lambert Co.'s Lipitor. And the company's top cancer
drug Taxol is expected to lose patent protection in the next year
or two, making it vulnerable to cheaper generics.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a New England Journal of Medicine study raised
concerns about another Bristol-Myers' drug. It said Plavix, a new
blood thinner given to heart patients after angioplasty, in rare
cases may trigger a deadly blood disease.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix, which had $201 million in sales in the first quarter, up
128 percent from a year ago, is Bristol-Myers' fastest selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers said the side effect was extremely rare and the
study would not have a big impact on sales.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, the company said it was resubmitting its new
colorectal cancer drug for FDA approval. Safety questions has been
raised after the drug was first submitted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares have dropped by nearly 25 percent in the
past two days. On Thursday, the stock fell 93} cents to $50 on the
New York Stock Exchange, despite the company's better than expected
first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers reported earned $1.22 billion, or 61 cents per
diluted share, on revenue of $5.26 billion, up from $1.07 billion,
or 53 cents per share, on revenue of $4.85 billion last year.
Results beat analysts' forecasts by a penny, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.

<HEADLINE> State deal gives firefighters free cameras to find fires  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Fifty fire departments Thursday became the
first to collect free cameras that can spot fires -- or people --
behind walls in a $7.5 million deal that the state and the
manufacturer say is the first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By December, every local fire district will have at least one of
the cameras and be eligible to buy more. And thanks to the state
contract, the cost will be $7,695 -- well less than half of the
camera's $18,000 list price.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an investment. It's an investment in people's lives,''
said Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jane M. Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras register heat rather than light so firefighters can
see fires through building walls and other surfaces. They are
sensitive enough to register body heat, allowing rescue workers to
spot people who might be trapped inside burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   That will help save the lives of both people in danger and those
trying to rescue them, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   Bought individually, cameras of this type can cost between
$18,000 and $25,000. They are used like a normal video camera and
can be mounted on a helmet, with color or black and white monitors.
Some departments have purchased cameras with the help of corporate
and civic sponsors and fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
   And for some small fire departments, the only way they could get
the cameras is through this state program.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a word it's absolutely incredible. It's a tremendous
help,'' said Alfred Loverdi, chief of Runnemede Fire Co. No. 1, the
volunteer fire department in that Camden County town.
</P>
<P>
   Loverdi said his department looked into buying one of the
cameras but was hampered by the high price tag. Now since his group
shares services with two other nearby towns, ''we'll have access to
three at a time if we need them,'' Loverdi said.
</P>
<P>
   With the state picking up the tab, Loverdi said his town can
spend money on other needed equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Gov. Christie Whitman signed legislation authorizing
the purchase. The $7.5 million will cover the cost of buying the
750 cameras and also will provide money to reimburse some
departments that already bought a unit. Each of the state's 750
local fire departments will have at least one camera. Some will get
more, based on population.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud that New Jersey is the first state in the nation to
ensure that every community has access to this lifesaving
technology,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The state will also provide new computer software that gives
fire departments information on fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thermal imaging cameras and this software are two new
tools that will help make New Jersey a national leader in fire
safety,'' said William Cane, director of fire safety for the
Division of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said the potential for saving lives and property made the
decision to spend the money easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those pieces of technology that make so much
sense,'' Kenny said. ''It really is an investment. It's a good one
because its going to save lives and prevent injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer E.D. Bullard of Cynthiana, Ky., has agreed to
provide at least 100 of the cameras per month to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's contract is the biggest for the company and one of
the largest in the industry, according to Tom Kiddle, a product
manager at Bullard. The volume of the deal allows Bullard to slash
the price of the camera, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's big and big enough so we were able to get breaks from
our suppliers,'' Kiddle said. Now possibly four other states are
interested in similar packages, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Oil Smuggling on Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In enforcing U.N. sanctions against Iraq,
authorities have caught 17 ships for suspected oil smuggling this
year, nearly as many as during all of 1999, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been actually a lot of activity in the anti-smuggling
operation in the Gulf this month,'' said Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon -- eight ships stopped in April with a determination that oil
would be confiscated from six of them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the interdiction procedure used by a maritime force of 18
nations, ships are detained, authorities figure out whether they
are carrying Iraqi oil, and those that are would be diverted to a
place where the oil can be unloaded, confiscated and sold -- partly
to offset the costs of the anti-smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   In all of last year, oil from 19 ships was confiscated, but
smuggling has risen dramatically this year because higher oil
prices made it more profitable, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, U.S. officials
said earlier this year that illicit oil exports from Iraq were
averaging 100,000 barrels a day, compared with 50,000 barrels in
1998, when oil prices were much lower.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Challenges Security Report  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Thursday challenged a report
that questioned national defense strategy, saying U.S. forces have
demonstrated in operations around the world that they can do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon was responding to a report that
contends that U.S. strategy of preparing to fight two wars at once
is outdated and leaves the United States unready to tackle other
problems that will increasingly threaten the world in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   The report Wednesday by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on
National Security said American forces need to be able to deploy
faster. They also must handle missions ranging from humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief to major wars.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''two major theater wars'' strategy is based on
the thinking that troops could be forced to fight in two conflicts
at once such, such as in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they're saying is we need more then a two major theaters
war strategy. And I think we have more than that,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces are well-trained and have proved their ability to
handle multiple tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're able to serve superbly as peacekeepers in Kosovo and
Bosnia,'' Bacon said. ''They're able to provide presence around the
world .... They've clearly shown that they're able to fight when
called upon to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the next step is for the commission to ''sit down and
become more specific about their recommendations,'' something
expected in their next report due next year.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the second in a three-phased study on security
for the coming century. Last year, the commission outlined a vision
of the future and next year, it is to give specific recommendations
on how American security structures should be changed to meet
coming needs.
</P>
<P>
   Established by Congress in 1998, the panel includes former
senators William Rudman of New Hampshire and Gary Hart of Colorado
as well as former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, former
United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and retired Army Gen. John
Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   In their report Wednesday they made several dozen policy
suggestions, including that the United States make nonproliferation
of weapons a high priority, strengthen cooperation with other
nations against terrorism, build a defense against domestic missile
attacks and draw other nations, especially China, Russia and India,
more into the ''mainstream of the emerging international system.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Reunite Elian and Dad  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday that Elian
Gonzalez should be promptly reunited with his father, saying
''there's now no conceivable argument'' to keep them apart after a
federal court ruled the boy cannot leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he should be reunited in as prompt and orderly way as
possible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke a day after a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said that Elian must remain in
the United States until the court decides whether he should get an
asylum hearing. A hearing was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's now no conceivable argument for his not being able to
be reunited with his son,'' Clinton said. ''That is what the lawful
process has said. The immigration law is clear and the
determination of the INS and a federal court are clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke in response to questions in the Rose Garden
as he welcomed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the opening of
discussions about the Midde East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed the Elian case with Attorney General Janet
Reno for 45 minutes on a flight from Oklahoma City, where they
attended the dedication of a memorial to the 168 people killed five
years ago in the deadliest terrorist attack in America's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he should be reunited with his son,'' the president
said. ''That is the law. And the main argument of the family in
Miami for not doing so has now been removed. Their main argument
was if we let him go back to his father before the court rules, he
might go back to Cuba. The court has now said he shouldn't go back
to Cuba. The Justice Department agrees with that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said that Clinton was
leaving the decisions in Reno's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general is leading the effort,'' Lockhart said.
''The president has been briefed and has had input. Is she making
the decisions here? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to discuss Clinton's conversation with Reno
about the case but said the president ''believes the attorney
general has moved forward in a deliberate way which he believes is
appropriate, allowing all sides to have their say.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the court ruling Wednesday should be reassuring to
the Miami relatives fighting to keep the child, while at the same
time clearing the way for the boy to be reunited with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who came here from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   By saying the boy should not leave, the court has removed a
concern of the Miami releatives, Lockhart said. ''They now should
move forward and, in conjunction with the Justice Department, allow
the boy to be reunited with his father.''

<HEADLINE> Food Makers Warn of Ingredients  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two food manufacturers issued warnings
Thursday that their products contain items not listed on the labels
but could cause allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder of Berlin, Pa., said it voluntarily recalled 202 cases of
Naturally Low Fat Carmel Corn because they may contain peanuts that
are not listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   And Gourmet Mixes, Inc., of Seattle, Wash., said it recalled all
bottle sizes and production codes of Demitri's Bloody Mary
Seasoning because they may contain egg yolk not listed on the
label.
</P>
<P>
   People with allergies to these foods could run the risk of
life-threatening reactions if they eat them.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-ounce packages of Snyder's Naturally Low Fat Carmel Corn
were distributed in Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. They have the code 42May22
directly below the preprinted price of $1.75 on the front.
Consumers can return the item to the place of purchase for a
refund. Persons with questions can call 1-800-270-2743.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled Demitri's Bloody Mary Seasoning was distributed
nationally in retail stores and through catalogs in 5-ounce glass
bottles and 16-ounce and 64-ounce plastic bottles. Customers can
return the mix to the place of purchase for a refund. Those with
questions can call the manufacturer at 206-764-6006.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Focus on School Safety  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush earned rare
praise Thursday from Democratic rival Al Gore for marking the
Columbine massacre with a focus on teaching kids values. Gore also
toned down his criticism of Bush on gun control, saying it was not
''the one main solution'' to youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   In separate forums mostly stripped of signs that they were
campaign stops, the presidential candidates presented multifaceted
remedies for the kind of teen rage that erupted into gunfire and
bomb throwing one year ago at the Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Texas, suggested the Clinton-Gore White House had been
lax on gun control. ''It's important for the next administration to
do something a little different and that's enforce laws on the
books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor's real focus was on character education.
He offered proposals for teaching students better values, including
giving American Youth Character Awards to honor young people and
requiring federal programs ''affecting young people'' to include an
ethics component.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can pass laws in society and enforce laws, but it's also
important to remember much of what violence takes place is a matter
of heart,'' Bush said. ''I strongly believe this kind of character
education is so important in making sure children make the right
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would increase federal grants for character
education from $8 million to $25 million and let students transfer
out of dangerous schools. He also renewed his call for any juvenile
convicted of a serious gun or violent offense to be banned from
ever buying or carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gore saluted what he called Bush's talk ''about
character and spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I compliment him for doing that,'' Gore told an assembly at
Fort Lee High School. ''I think that's right near the top of the
list. I think that's a big part of this also. But if we are serious
in the aftermath of Columbine, we have to make some serious
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is counting on proposals for stricter gun laws to win
him votes over Bush, told parents and students that Bush opposes
mandatory child-safety trigger locks and, as governor of Texas,
overturned the state's 125-year-old ban on concealed weapons,
making it possible for hidden guns to be brought into places of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''What gives?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the lessons of Columbine is that we have to stand up to
the NRA and the gun industry and get guns out of the hands of
people who shouldn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ''I don't think that guns represent the one main
solution to this problem.'' He talked about curbing violence in
entertainment, alleviating overcrowded schools and offering
government help to stressed-out working parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not settled for some easy, glib silver-bullet
answer,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tipper, appeared on CBS' ''Early Show'' and said that
''easy access to guns on the Internet'' was a frequent concern of
teens she met in recent campaign forums. ''They say they can order
guns, they can order parts to guns and put them together,'' Mrs.
Gore lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and the vice president observed the solemnity of
Thursday's anniversary by toning down the fierce partisanship that
has characterized their campaign. In the Fort Lee auditorium, there
were none of the usual Gore campaign posters, only three yellow
ovals scrawled with the message ''Safe Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no campaign signs in Texas either. Instead, a large
yellow paper sign with green lettering said: ''Cater Elementary
Welcomes Governor Bush.'' Student signatures and smiley faces
decorated the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was making his appearance, in part, to fulfill a
promise to the father of one of the Columbine students killed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   At a Denver-area memorial, the father ''said into my ear as we
were embracing, he said, 'Promise me that these children have not
died in vain.' And then after a moment's pause he repeated with
urgency and force, 'Promise me,''' Gore recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'I promise' and that's the kind of promise you take
into your heart.''

<HEADLINE> Incoming Steel Drops Almost 10 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports dropped by almost 10 percent in
March, continuing a general trend downward over the last six
months, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 9.8 percent decrease followed an increase in February, but
the imports have been heading downward since last year, fueled in
part by the recovery of the domestic steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, steel industry officials are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The import level of 2.8 million metric tons, is a drop from 3
million in February. There have been declines in five of the last
six months and for all of 1999, steel imports fell by 14 percent.	   Greg
Mastel, an economist at the New America Foundation, a
Washington think tank, said the data indicate the American steel
industry is improving, but imports are still high.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be past the worst of the steel crisis but imports are
still 50 percent above where they were in 1993,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew G. Sharkey, CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''AISI and its members are not out of the woods -- world steel
capacity remains a severe problem and adverse effects of the 1986
surge continue,'' he said. ''We urge all due vigilance to this
year's trends, because they are both familiar and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of cold-rolled, hot-rolled, wire rod and semifinished
steel rose from their January levels. But imports of cut-to-length
plate steel fell.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major sources of foreign steel, imports from Brazil,
Korea and Russia fell while imports from China and Japan increased.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Butler, president of the Japan Steel Information Center,
said the data indicate that imports have stabilized. He said much
of the demand for imports has come from American mills that cannot
produce enough steel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe White-Owned Farms Rampaged  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Nearly 200 attackers rampaged through a
white-owned farm Thursday in northern Zimbabwe, beating dogs to
death and burning down workers' homes a day after a leader of the
farm occupations promised to end hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the latest violence by armed squatters who have
occupied nearly 1,000 white-owned farms across Zimbabwe over the
past two months. In the past week, two farmers have been killed,
six others have been abducted and beaten, and several farmhouses
set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rampage came after occupation leaders had met with
farm leaders and President Robert Mugabe and said they would end
the violence, although they said they would not leave the farms.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, who inflamed the situation earlier this week by calling
white farmers ''enemies'' of the state, has been accused by
opposition leaders of using the land dispute to drum up political
support ahead of nationwide elections expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   The white farmers are considered supporters of the Movement for
Democratic Change, an opposition party with support far beyond
Zimbabwe's 70,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying whips, sticks and rocks, the youths attacked Alan
Windram's farm in Arcturus district, 35 miles northeast of Harare
on Thursday. Associated Press Television News videotaped them
running to the farmhouse, which Windram had abandoned after
receiving threats. They then began beating his six dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs were bludgeoned to death with sticks. Others were
stoned to death, their crushed bodies left scattered about the
yard. The attackers then ran to the farmworkers' houses, kicking
down doors, smashing windows and setting at least 30 homes on fire
as the stunned workers watched.
</P>
<P>
   The farm was targeted because it was an Movement for Democratic
Change headquarters, said a man directing the attackers who
identified himself as David Mazhandu.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people have been suffering because of these people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Militant squatters marched onto another nearby farm Thursday,
forcing the owners to flee, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe reiterated Thursday that he would not deploy police or
soldiers to maintain security on the farms, saying the police
wanted to give the squatters time to stop the violence on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many houses broken into in Britain and it doesn't
mean there's no law and order,'' Mugabe told the British
Broadcasting Corp. from Harare, Zimbabwe's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the United Nations should not intervene, Mugabe
maintained his country was generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can reach their own settlement without the help of the
U.N. This is not a United Nations issue yet. There is peace
generally in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe is to meet Friday in Victoria Falls with African leaders,
including South African President Thabo Mbeki, Rwandan President
Paul Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The meeting,
called to discuss the Congo civil war, will also touch on the farm
crisis and violence in this former British colony in southeast
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says the farm occupations are a legitimate protest
against the ownership of one-third of the country's productive
farmland by 4,000 white farmers. He also says Britain reneged on an
agreement to help pay for land reform.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which pledged nearly $55 million for land reform when
Zimbabwe won independence in 1980, delivered nearly 90 percent of
that money before freezing the fund in 1990. Britain halted the
payments, accusing Zimbabwe of violating the agreement by forcing
unwilling farmers to sell to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say the occupations and other political
violence are merely a political ploy orchestrated by Mugabe to
distract and intimidate voters ahead of what are expected to be
tough parliamentary elections expected to be called for May. In
recent weeks many squatters have been wearing ruling party
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, said the
violence would not intimidate the Movement for Democratic Change
into boycotting elections. He also said that chaos in Zimbabwe
would destabilize all of southern Africa and that regional leaders
should take a stand against it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Africa's leadership must put their own house in order,''
Tsvangirai said after arriving home from a weeklong trip to
Britain, South Africa and the United States. He called Mugabe ''a
deranged dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look positively beyond Mugabe,'' Tsvangirai said of
the president who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence. ''Mugabe
is history.''

<HEADLINE> Winn-Dixie To Cut Jobs, Shut Stores  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Supermarket giant Winn-Dixie Stores
Inc. plans to cut 11,000 jobs and close 114 money-losing stores and
other facilities in a bid to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts and closings will eliminate 8 percent of 132,000
positions in the chain, which has operations in 14 states and the
Bahamas. A Tampa warehouse, detergent and bag factories in
Jacksonville and division offices in Tampa, Atlanta, and
Louisville, Ky., will be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's grocery business is probably the most competitive in
our 75-year history,'' company chairman Dano Davis said in a
statement. ''These changes are absolutely necessary to provide
Winn-Dixie with an effective infrastructure to train and support
operations management teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-to-bottom restructuring plan for the 1,189-store chain
will consolidate management, beginning with the retirements of 10
vice presidents, though most of the cuts will involve store worker
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Winn-Dixie, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket
chain, were trading down 75 cents, or 3 percent, to $18.31\ on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The changes should produce annual savings of $400 million a year
and will be absorbed with a pretax charge of $450 million to $550
million in the fourth quarter and the company's next fiscal year,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville-based chain has focused in the past five years
on building and remodeling more than 900 stores, primarily under
the Winn-Dixie Marketplace banner.
</P>
<P>
   Stores operate in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Ohio,
Tennessee, Indiana, Virginia, Texas, Oklahoma and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Fired employees will get severance packages and accrued
benefits, said company spokesman Mickey Clerc. He said the company
is not disclosing which stores will be shut down. An average store
has 85 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa warehouse and division office, with about 200
employees, and the bag and detergent plants with a total of 62
employees, will close by the end of June, also the end of the
fiscal year Clerc said. Division offices in Atlanta, with 75
employees, and Louisville, with 60 employees, face the same closure
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie had earlier announced the sale of 74 stores in
Oklahoma and Texas to The Kroger Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported third quarter revenue of $3.20
billion, down $4.2 million from the same period last year. Profits
were $10.3 million, or 7 cents a share, down from $58.8 million, or
40 cents per share, for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting
earnings of 22 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Census Incentive  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau offered free 30-minute
calling cards as an incentive for some Americans to return their
forms, a test program that Republican critics say demeans the
''civic ceremony'' of the census.
</P>
<P>
   A randomly selected sample of 15,000 households took part in the
program, in which they received a card good for $20 in calls if
they answered census questions, Census officials said. The
incentive was part of a number of test programs the bureau
routinely does during census years in preparation for future
counts, bureau spokesman Steve Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chip Walker, an aide to Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, said
''education, not compensation, should be what motivates people to
participate in the census.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The census should be a civic ceremony similar to voting,''
Walker said. ''I think if we start going down that road, we may
find ourselves in one, two or three censuses from now trying outbid
a previous census.''
</P>
<P>
   Jost said Census director Kenneth Prewitt personally opposes
incentives, but is willing to test it if it means more people will
respond. If the incentive sticks, it could also cost far less than
paying to send an enumerator to homes that did not mail back their
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of forms mailed out were not returned to the
bureau, meaning that census-takers must be sent to those homes to
gather their information. That operation begins on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Jost said that Miller's concerns were legitimate but that the
bureau must test it in this census before determining if it should
be an option in the next one in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a test program,'' he said. ''This doesn't mean this is
a final decision on whether we will use these incentives or not.''
</P>
<P>
   One city, Valdosta, Ga., drew criticism after offering a $5
incentive to people who returned their forms. The Southeastern
Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law group, said
that incentive may violate Georgia law.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said this is the first time an incentive has
been tested by the bureau itself as a way to get forms back.

from restructuring and a charge for severance. Excluding those
one-time items, BellSouth earned 52 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> Duracell Drags Down Gillette Profit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Despite overall growth in revenues, Gillette Co.
reported a decline in first quarter earnings Thursday on weaker
results in its Duracell battery line.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette had net income of $258 million, down 4 percent from
$269 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings were 24 cents, two
cents above Wall Street expectations and unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 5 percent to $2.05 billion from $1.94 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette reported higher sales in most of its product lines,
which include Braun products, razors and blades, and Oral-B
toothbrushes. But Duracell sales dropped 2 percent, with a 33
percent decline in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette spokesman Eric Kraus said marketing costs and
unfavorable foreign exchange rates, particularly in Europe, also
dragged down earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The decline continued a recent trend for Gillette, which saw
declining profits in the fourth quarter last year as the company
worked to boost sales in underperforming sectors of its business,
including blades and razors.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's shares were priced at $37.62{ at 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange, up 50 cents or more than 1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds fell by $9.52 billion in the latest week to $1.004
trillion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell
by $6.86 billion to $834.86 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets fell by $2.66 billion to $169.63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $12.46
billion to $692.68 billion for the same period. Among institutional
funds, taxable money market fund assets fell by $8.45 billion to
$643.35 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $4.00 billion
to $49.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.697 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.719 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>

   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.47 percent from 5.45 percent the
previous week, said Money Fund Report, a service of iMoneyNet Inc.
in Westboro, Mass. The 30-day average yield rose to 5.44 percent
from 5.40 percent, according to Money Fund Report.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No Smoke, Dementia Prevention Link  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Contrary to the belief that smoking may help ward
off dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the most rigorous study ever
to investigate the link has concluded that cigarettes provide no
protection against mental decline.
</P>
<P>
   In research published this week in the British Medical Journal,
scientists from Oxford University found male doctors who smoked
were just as likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer's as their
counterparts who had never smoked or had quit years before.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies on the relationship between smoking and
dementia, a major component of Alzheimer's, produced conflicting
results, with some showing an apparent benefit. Alzheimer's is one
of the few diseases said to occur more often in nonsmokers than
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached a point now where the suggestion that smoking is
protective is no longer an issue. This wipes out the question of it
somehow being a good thing,'' said Dr. Carol Brayne, an
epidemiologist at Cambridge University who was not connected with
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may not put the whole discussion to rest because that
almost never happens, but this is very strong and it certainly does
squash the notion of a benefit,'' added Bill Thies, vice president
of medical and scientific affairs at the U.S. Alzheimer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the latest from the longest-running study of
smoking and disease. It has tracked British doctors since 1951 and
has previously confirmed the link between smoking and lung cancer,
showed that about half of smokers die from the habit and that
quitting can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Many have believed smoking could protect against mental decline,
partly because it is well-established cigarettes can help ward off
the brain disorder Parkinson's disease and partly because it seems
plausible that nicotine might boost brain chemical networks that
are damaged in Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific studies that have indicated smokers were less
likely to develop dementia were based on too few people to be
reliable, looked back at smoking habits when the people already had
become demented or were otherwise fundamentally flawed, according
to the authors of the Oxford study.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a popular belief, but there weren't any
serious studies showing it,'' said Richard Peto, an Oxford
professor of epidemiology who was involved in the study. ''This
study supercedes the other studies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 34,439 male doctors were followed for nearly 50
years, with their smoking habits recorded every six to 12 years up
until 1998. By then, 24,133 had died, with dementia mentioned on
the death certificate in 473 of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers accounted for 40 percent of doctors who developed
dementia and 40 percent of those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Peto's group reviewed the previous studies and concluded, based
on all the reliable evidence, that if anything, smoking might
marginally increase the risk of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that some dementia cases occur when the
brain is deprived of oxygen because of blockages in the blood
vessels. Smoking is bad for blood vessels and can encourage
blockages.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the degeneration of brain
cells, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for about
two-thirds of cases.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that the disease afflicts about 12 million
people worldwide -- including 4 million in the United States -- or 3
percent of people 65 or older, according to the nonprofit
organization Alzheimer's Disease International.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Suspect Had Missile Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- American Edmond Pope, arrested two weeks ago and
charged with espionage, was seeking plans for an underwater missile
fired by submarines, the Federal Security Service said Thursday,
according to Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency previously had said only that Pope had tried to
obtain military secrets. Pope was arrested April 5 and is being
held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. He could face 20 years in prison
if convicted of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. citizen focused his attention on a high-speed
underwater missile,'' said the agency, known by the initials FSB.
Such missiles can build up a speed of about 225 mph, it said,
according to the news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embassy in Moscow has not commented on the spying
charges against Pope. He is being held in Moscow's Lefortovo
prison, where he has been visited by U.S. diplomats, the embassy
said. A Russian lawyer has been appointed for him.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the missile to be the most effective weapon that
could be used in duels between submarines, the FSB said, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian man who allegedly was Pope's accomplice also was
arrested in Moscow on May 5. The FSB has not identified him,
although he has been charged with divulging state secrets and faces
10 years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Pope is a native of Grants Pass, Ore. After retiring from the
Navy, Pope worked in 1994-97 with Pennsylvania State University's
Applied Research Laboratory, which does research for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Pope was an ''assistant for foreign technology'' who developed
contacts between Russian and U.S. research institutes and worked on
converting technology for commercial uses, a statement from Penn
State said.
</P>
<P>
   He left the laboratory to create CERF Technologies
International, which ''has commercial contacts with organizations
in Russia,'' according to the statement. He frequently traveled to
Russia on business, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest has provoked a more muted reaction than during a
string of arrests of alleged spies last year.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a U.S. diplomat was expelled from Russia after
being briefly detained by the FSB. Washington then expelled a
Russian diplomat who allegedly monitored transmissions from a
bugging device discovered at the U.S. State Department.

<HEADLINE> Pippen: Blazers Hungry for Title  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUALATIN, Ore. (AP) -- They all came to Portland with their best
days behind them, hoping to give the young Trail Blazers enough
leadership and veteran guile to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after their first regular season together, Scottie Pippen,
Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf get to see whether all their
experience will be enough to get the Blazers close to their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a very hungry team,'' six-time champion Scottie Pippen
said before Thursday's practice as the Blazers prepare for Sunday's
Game 1 of their best-of-five series against Minnesota. ''These
players have a chance to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland advanced to the Western Conference finals last year,
only to be swept 4-0 by the San Antonio Spurs. The seasoned Spurs
exposed the Blazers as a temperamental bunch that wilted under
pressure despite their talent.
</P>
<P>
   When the unpredictable Isaiah Rider is your best player, there's
only so far you can go. With billionaire owner Paul Allen's vast
resources and his deep desire for a title, big changes were on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   In came Pippen, who was traded from Houston for six Blazers --
one of whom, Stacey Augmon, was waived and wound up back in
Portland; next was Smith, who was traded for Rider and Jim Jackson;
and then Schrempf, signed as a free agent after being discarded by
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries caused the Blazers' payroll to balloon to almost
$74 million, and what Allen really bought was the kind of
experience the Spurs had.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, Smith and Schrempf have appeared in 331 playoff games,
led by Pippen's 182. The other eight players in the Blazers'
rotation have 322 postseason games, and 98 of those belong to
backup point guard Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to come to an organization that has a window of
opportunity better than others, and I think we have that,'' Smith
said. ''We have a good chance, and we're probably one of six teams
that really have a legitimate chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and Smith have had mixed results. Each has played
brilliantly at times but also wallowed in terrible slumps. Pippen
seemed to score only when he had to, or when he had a lane to the
basket and wanted to show he still could cut and slash at age 34.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf has been a dependable reserve, but has talked of
retirement after 14 seasons. He averaged 7.5 points, his lowest
since his rookie season, and saw his minutes cut from 35.3 last
season to 21.6.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Schrempf, Pippen and Smith welcomed their reduced roles.
Pippen averaged 33.5 minutes, down from a career-high 40 last
season. And Smith's minutes (32.8, down from 36.5 last season)
allowed him to keep his bad knees healthy and play in all 82 games
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all accepted and wanted reduced minutes, and they all had
very good years,'' said Blazers president and general manager Bob
Whitsitt. ''It allowed us to get some of the younger guys minutes
and let them play.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-year shooting guard Bonzi Wells appears to be the next
Blazers' star. The 23-year-old player averaged 8.8 points this
season, double his average from last season, and will make his
first playoff appearance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bonzi's grown up,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his advice regarding the playoffs was, Pippen
replied: ''You just relax and play hard. It's like the regular
season; the games are just a little bit more intense.''

<HEADLINE> As health insurance costs rise, employers begin trimming coverage  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Despite New Jersey's booming economy and
historically low unemployment, the number of uninsured residents is
growing, partly because employers facing rising premiums are
starting to scale back coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of Garden State residents covered
by government health insurance programs fell about 20 percent from
1995 to 1998, as welfare reform resulted in thousands of poor
people losing Medicaid coverage. Together, those factors left an
estimated 1.3 million people, or 16.4 percent of state residents,
without health insurance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Health coverage provided by New Jersey employers peaked in 1997.
That happened after two years that saw extremely low increases in
health insurance premiums as managed care companies infiltrated the
market following the state's 1993 deregulation of hospital rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're entering a period where premiums are going up faster
than income again, so I think we can expect further erosion of
employer-sponsored coverage,'' Joel Cantor, director of the Rutgers
Center for State Health Policy, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That situation leaves many low-income working families unable to
afford their portion of the premiums, and nudges some employers to
raise salaries, at least for low-paid workers, rather than provide
health insurance, Cantor explained.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, employers in New Jersey were hit with the biggest
jump in health insurance premiums for their workers since 1996, an
average of 6.6 percent, according to the survey by the New Jersey
Business &AMP; Industry Association, the nation's largest statewide
employer association.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 percent of its 16,000 member companies responded, and
43 percent reported double-digit increases in health plan costs in
1999. Worse yet, 36 percent said they expected their costs to rise
10 percent or more this year. The average premium cost per employee
last year was $5,214, or 13 percent of the members' average payroll
cost of $40,138.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the percentage of employers providing health
insurance to full-time workers and their dependents dipped to 74
percent in 1999, down from 78 percent a year earlier and 80 percent
in 1997. The survey also found a tiny decline in the percentage
covering just full-time workers, from 94 percent in 1997 and 1998
to 93 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the labor market as tight as it is and with the
difficulties employers already have attracting talented workers, if
they give up health benefits they've lost half the game,''
association spokesman Christopher Biddle said Thursday. ''I think
that's why we haven't seen a more dramatic increase'' in employers
eliminating coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey found 50 percent of companies are shifting
more cost onto their workers, through higher premiums, copayments
or deductibles. Already, 90 percent of the employer-sponsored
health plans in the state are some form of managed care, making it
tougher for companies to cut their premiums by changing insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Profitability has been strong, but the only way employers
today can improve their profitability is to increase productivity
and cut costs,'' because stiffer, sometimes global, competition
makes it difficult to raise prices, Biddle said.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the state Department of Health and Senior Services
show that the number of people covered by employer-sponsored plans,
5.025 million in 1998, and the number of people buying their own
health insurance, about 528,000 that year, were inching up from
1995 until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But over the same period, the number of state residents insured
through the Medicaid and Medicare programs fell from 1.472 million
to 1.21 million and the number of uninsured New Jersey residents
rose to 1.329 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rising health care costs and health insurance premiums here,
as well as the slight pullback in employer coverage, both follow
national trends that began around 1996, Cantor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're right in the middle of the pack in the percentage of our
population uninsured, but we're No. 2 in (per capita) income,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That high income, however, is offset by the fact that New Jersey
companies pay the nation's second-highest health insurance
premiums, after Massachusetts, Cantor noted. Data from a Census
Bureau survey found the average premium companies paid for family
coverage in 1996 was $5,846 in New Jersey, compared with $4,954
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Avs Determined To Eradicate Coyotes  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Having won eight straight games to end the regular
season and the first three games of their playoff series with
Phoenix, the Colorado Avalanche perhaps forget how they had
fashioned such a streak.
</P>
<P>
   Not by being outplayed in the first period and falling behind
3-0, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche couldn't overcome that early deficit Wednesday
night, falling to the Coyotes 3-2 in Game 4 thanks to superb
goaltending by Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of gaining a sweep of the first-round, best-of-seven
series, the Avalanche return home Friday night for Game 5 in what
they regard as a must-win mode.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go back to Phoenix'' for Game 6, Avalanche
wing Dave Andreychuk said Thursday. ''They've got some momentum
right now, and it would give them a lot of momentum if they win
another game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a good lesson last night, that if we're not ready to
play, that team can beat us. They came out flying in the first
period and put us back on our heels. We came back and dominated in
the second and third periods, when we had a lot of chances. But the
bottom line is we didn't win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to be ready to play in Game 5, especially in our own
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Avs defenseman Aaron Miller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we learned a valuable lesson,'' Miller said.
''Hopefully, it doesn't cost us too much. I don't think anyone in
here thought we were going to win 16 games straight and win the
Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did, they were awakened from that dream quickly.
Outplayed in every department, the Avalanche were outshot 15-6 in
the first period, during which the Coyotes grabbed a 2-0 lead on
goals by rookie Trevor Letowski and Travis Green.
</P>
<P>
   Just 38 seconds into the second period, Mikael Renberg's goal
made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outshot Phoenix 32-16 over the last two periods,
putting constant pressure on Burke and peppering him with shots.
But a second-period goal by Andreychuk and a third-period score by
Adam Deadmarsh were all the Avs could muster.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out the way we expected in the first period, and we
didn't match their intensity,'' Colorado captain Joe Sakic said.
''The goal they got on the first shift of the second period hurt
us, and the way Burke was playing, it was too much to come back
from. A two-goal lead is one thing, but three ...
</P>
<P>
   ''We had tons of chances, but Burke played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, subjected to months of speculation that the Coyotes would
be better off yielding to the salary demands of holdout goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin, finished with 36 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could sense a little bit more of a purpose in our dressing
room,'' Burke said. ''That team over there has so many talented
players. If we have anybody take a night off or even a shift off,
it's going to hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a great game for us. If we can go into Colorado and
play like we did in Game 4, we can win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Letowski said Burke was ''huge. Here's a guy who's been doubted
a lot. We can't say enough about Burkie. He was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Bob Francis promised a repeat performance by his
team on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of pride on this team and, believe me, you're
going to see the same type of effort in Colorado,'' he said. ''We
realize we've got our work cut out for us, but we're going in there
with all guns firing and try to get this series back to Phoenix for
our fans.''

<HEADLINE> White House Ridicules GOP Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is criticizing a Republican
plan to offer prescription drug insurance to senior citizens as a
''Swiss cheese plan'' that won't cover millions of older Americans
and will be too expensive for many, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's underfunded, unlikely to be available to all (Medicare)
beneficiaries and inevitably ... unaffordable to people with
disabilities and probably millions of seniors,'' Secretary of
Health and Human Services Donna Shalala said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan, as outlined by House Speaker Dennis Hastert last
week, calls for private health plans to offer drug benefits and
government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
While many of the details have yet to be worked out, Republicans
said the plan would lower drug prices, give seniors more coverage
choice and help the neediest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has its own plan to provide prescription drug
coverage under Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly
and disabled. With many lawmakers out of town for the Easter
recess, administration officials took the opportunity to point out
flaws in the GOP plan and show how their plan would help more
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us it still seems like a Swiss cheese plan with more holes
than substance,'' said Gene Sperling, head of the president's
National Economic Council, at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the administration of jumping the gun with
its criticism, saying that when all the fine print has been worked
out they will have a comprehensive plan for all seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House is taking shots in the dark,'' said John
Feehery, Hastert's spokesman. ''We are still fleshing out the
details of the plan. We believe we are going to have a good plan
for all seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the GOP plan to provide subsidies to cover drug
costs for seniors at the poverty level would leave out 6 million
Medicare beneficiaries who have no drug coverage but have incomes
above the poverty line -- which he calculated at about $12,500 a
year for singles and $16,875 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are said to be looking at provisions that would
limit seniors' out-of-pocket costs to between $2,000 and $3,000 a
year and would establish a cap at which the government would step
in and bear the cost of drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House plan, which will cost $195 billion over 10
years, would provide drug benefits to all 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries, paying up to $1,000 in drug costs annually for a $26
monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known what premiums would be under the GOP plan.
Sperling predicted drug benefits provided by private insurers -- a
cornerstone of the GOP plan -- would probably end up being too
expensive for many Medicare beneficiaries. The coverage would work
much like drug benefits under private supplemental policies such as
Medigap, which charge high premiums that increase as policy holders
age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the Republican plan ''should be particularly a
concern of older women'' because the majority of seniors over age
85 are women. ''Building a drug program off that model has very
serious concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether the Republicans will commit enough
money to a prescription drug program. GOP lawmakers have set aside
$40 billion in their budget proposal for Medicare over the next
five years. Hastert has said most of that would go toward the drug
program, but details have not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed GOP tax cuts of $792 billion over 10 years leave little
room for investments in a drug program unless spending cuts are
made in other programs, Sperling suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their tax cut is filling up so much room that it's very
difficult for them to show how they can have a significant drug
program without either reducing the tax cut or relying on
discretionary cuts that are ... unrealistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even while they took shots at the GOP plan, administration
officials said they wanted to work with Republicans to come up with
a compromise. They said they've been in discussions with members of
a Senate finance committee, which has held a number of hearings on
prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying its our way or the highway,'' said Sperling.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Doubts Royal Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A skeleton identified for decades as that of
Macedonian King Philip II, father of Alexander the Great, may be
actually the remains of Alexander's half brother, a new study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, a Greek
researcher said that bone scars once used to identify the body are
natural features of the skull.
</P>
<P>
   Antonis Bartsiokas of the Anaximandrian Institute in Voula,
Greece, said his analysis of the remains from a royal tomb at
Vergina, a town in northern Greece near the site of the ancient
Macedonian capital, suggests that the skeleton is that King Philip
III Arrhidaeus.
</P>
<P>
   King Philip II was a noted fourth century B.C. military leader
from Macedonia who took control of Athens and Thebes. He was
assassinated in 336 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous battle in 354 B.C., Philip was hit in the right eye
by an arrow, but recovered to win many more battles and rule for
another 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Philip's successor, son Alexander, went on to conquer most of
the known world, stretching from Greece and Egypt eastward across
Asia to India. Alexander died in 323 B.C. and his body was buried
in Egypt and has since been lost.
</P>
<P>
   A research team in 1977 found a tomb containing a royal couple
at Vergina and identified the male remains as King Philip II. The
identification was based mainly on what experts said were healed
bone scars from the arrow wound to the right eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Bartsiokas said in his Science report that the marks on the
skull are actually natural anatomical features, not the result of
wounds. The researcher also said he found of no evidence of healing
in the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, artifacts found in the tomb were dated at about
317 B.C., a generation after the assassination of King Philip II in
336 B.C. Bartisiokas said this suggests the royal remains are those
of the king and queen who ruled after Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   King Philip III ruled for six years after Alexander's death and
was murdered in 317 B.C.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves Elian Case To Reno  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While tempers flare and passions rise in the
five-month Elian Gonzalez custody case, President Clinton is
standing back and leaving the decisions to Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general is leading the effort,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ''The president has been briefed and
has had input. Is she making the decisions here? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing his attorney general's words, Clinton said Thursday that
the boy should be promptly reunited with his father, now that a
federal court has ruled that Elian must stay in the United States
until the court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing. A
hearing was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's now no conceivable argument for his not being able to
be reunited with his son,'' Clinton said. ''That is what the lawful
process has said. The immigration law is clear and the
determination of the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service)
and a federal court are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, I think he should be reunited and as prompt and an orderly
way as possible,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has expressed support for Reno's handling of the
case, White House officials are frustrated it has dragged on so
long without resolution. A senior official, expressing a view
shared by colleagues, exclaimed in mock horror, ''Get this off
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the administration has not been able -- or willing --
to find a way to end it. The case has exposed divisions between
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who at one point endorsed
legislation to extend permanent resident status to Elian, his
father and other relatives living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's custody battle is not the first explosive political
issue time that Clinton has relinquished to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general oversaw the government's handling of the
standoff at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993.
Some 80 people died in a fire after an FBI tear gas assault Reno
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was quick to take the responsibility -- and the blame.
Clinton let her, and kept his distance.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, two men angered by Waco bombed the Oklahoma
City federal building, killing 168 in the most deadly terrorist
attack in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Reno talked about the Gonzalez case for 45
minutes as they flew home late Wednesday from Oklahoma City and the
dedication of a memorial to the 168 victims.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to discuss their conversation but said Clinton
''believes the attorney general has moved forward in a deliberate
way which he believes is appropriate, allowing all sides to have
their say.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Clinton's role in the case, Lockhart said, ''I think
the president has remained informed throughout this process, but
the process has been spearheaded at the Justice department by the
attorney general and at the (Immigration and Naturalization
Service) by Commissioner (Doris) Meissner.

<HEADLINE> Platinum, Palladium Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Platinum prices fell to the lowest level in more than a month
Thursday amid profit-taking as investors prepared for a shortened
week due to the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, coffee futures closed higher, while
pork bellies and palladium fell.
</P>
<P>
   Traders have been awaiting activity in Russian exports since
last month when that country's leader, Vladimir Putin, signed a
much-anticipated quota for metal exports. Russia is the world's No.
1 exporter for palladium, which is in heavy demand to make cars'
catalytic converters and semiconductors, and No. 2 for platinum
behind South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, platinum for July delivery fell $9 to $462.80 an
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
June palladium dipped $12.20 to $562.10 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Metals prices had been soaring during Russia's strategic absence
from the market. Russia has been promising for weeks to clear up
supposed bureaucratic red tape and resume exports.
</P>
<P>
   But market observers said Thursday's activity was due more to
profit-taking than to rumors circulating about the possible
resumption of exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rumors that the Russians may resume shipments have made
the market pretty tight, but what we saw today was probably based
more on profit-taking,'' said Vanessa Motto, a metals analyst for
the CPM Group in New York. ''With the Easter holiday approaching,
you do see some weakness around that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffee closed $2.05 higher at 97.75 cents a pound Thursday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as the market rebounded
from last week's six-month low. Typically, spring coffee prices
rise amid concerns of frost damage to May and June crops in Brazil.
Investors were also speculating that recent increases in coffee
stocks would soon level off.
</P>
<P>
   Pork futures were down on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork
bellies dropped .55 cent to 97.65 cents a pound, down from a
3{-year high amid expectations for fewer slaughters.

<HEADLINE> First-round Playoff Sweep for Kings  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Kings got a new arena, a new
coach and some new players that helped them return to the playoffs
this season. But the result was the same: a first-round exit for
the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Red Wings swept the Kings in four games, the same
thing that happened to Los Angeles against St. Louis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four games with Detroit were close -- a 2-0 loss in
the opener, then a 2-1 defeat in Game 3 and a 3-0 loss in Game 4.
But the Kings hurt themselves by going 0-for-23 on the power play
and never playing with a lead in the four games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot better team than we did in '98. Everyone's
trying to compare it and saying, 'Well, you got swept again,' but
this team was much, much better,'' captain Rob Blake said. ''That's
what makes it so frustrating, that we didn't get a win in this
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake didn't score in the playoffs against a Detroit defense
that played him tightly. He was limited to four shots in 31 minutes
of the series finale Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Also shut down were Glen Murray and Bryan Smolinski, neither of
whom had a goal or an assist in the playoffs. Jozef Stumpel didn't
score, either, and Luc Robitaille, who had 37 goals in the regular
season, was held to two in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost to a very good team,'' said Andy Murray, who had a
39-31-12 record in his first season as an NHL coach. ''We feel we
didn't play up to our normal standard of play and we're
disappointed by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray consoled himself by noting that the Kings had a 6-5
scoring advantage when playing even strength against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a lot of positive things. We played some pretty
exciting hockey, we scored some goals this year,'' he said. ''We
couldn't seem to generate them here in the playoffs, but our team
played real hard this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One area in which Murray believes the team succeeded was in
playing hard consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right from day one of training camp we tried to instill a new
attitude, a new work ethic, a new level of commitment on the part
of our players,'' he said. ''It's all about eliminating excuses and
making commitments, and our team did that from day one this year.''

<HEADLINE> City Attorney Won't Prosecute Ditka  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The city attorney refused Thursday to
prosecute Mike Ditka on a criminal charge filed by a former casino
pit boss who claims the former New Orleans Saints coach hurled a
lighted cigar into his face during a dispute over a craps throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our review of the facts reveals no crime of assault because
assault requires specific intent,'' City Attorney Mavis Early said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of our job as prosecutors is not to clog the court with
cases that cannot be won. We do not believe that a judge would
conclude that Mr. Ditka had the requisite specific intent to commit
an assault. Basically, we have determined that this is not a viable
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The March 16 incident, which was confirmed by state police,
resulted in Ditka being barred from the casino for three months.
</P>
<P>
   According to state police, the altercation occurred at a craps
table in a high-rollers area when Ditka became angry by a call made
by pit boss Randy Curtis on some tilted dice.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis quit his job after the incident and filed suit in state
district court against the casino, contending that Harrah's has a
dual standard for unruly customers, with high-rollers such as Ditka
being tolerated much longer than other patrons. The suit contends
the standard created a dangerous working condition.

<HEADLINE> Just Phil Jackson and the Trophy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Stern is apparently busy plotting how to broadcast NBA
games on the backs of fans' eyelids. In the meantime, someone has
to say a few good words about the upcoming playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So here are seven of them: Come for basketball, stay for Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he figures to be around at the end. For another,
he will have the league's most entertaining team in tow. Need a
3-point play? Watch Phil teach Jack Nicholson how that
rather-be-lucky-than-good grin is supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is easy to underestimate. He almost seems to prefer it.
He will be the first to say the Lakers aren't the Bulls, just like
L.A. isn't Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are comparisons. The Lakers play defense, they score
fast enough to bury opponents and they've learned to like winning --
tearing off consecutive streaks of 16, 19 and 11 games on the way
to 67 regular-season wins.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson never forgets the difference between this team and
that one, either. That's what makes this such a good story.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could stumble anywhere along the way and next season
half of L.A.'s celebrity row will be looking at Jackson and swear
it's Del Harris with a supply of ''Just for Men.'' Or the Lakers
could win it all. And then this time, when Jackson has his picture
taken with the NBA trophy, Michael Jordan won't be anywhere in the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's genius is not inspirational leadership. He doesn't
yell at (or choke) players to get their attention. He whistles. But
if his own ballplayers ever caught Jackson on ESPN Classic or were
old enough to have seen him play, they'd know why he talks so much
about ''energy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson did get off the bench for the great Knicks teams of
the late 1960s and early '70s, he had only a few minutes to make a
difference. And so he attacked the ball from every conceivable
angle, all elbows and knees, happy for the chance to sacrifice.
Nobody ever tried harder.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackson sat down again and paid attention. It didn't take
him long to figure out that despite those brief mood swings, the
teams with the most talent on the floor almost always won. When
Doug Collins got axed in Chicago, Jackson was on his staff, lucky
enough to be in the right place at the right time. Keeping his
place, though, was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson learned to respect talent by respecting the best. That
quality cuts to the heart of his credibility with kids the same age
as his own. He can watch Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal do their
best and honestly say he's seen better. Because he has. He learned
how to coax that effort out of others. It wasn't a coincidence that
Jackson walked in the door and stories of the Shaq-Kobe feuds dried
up.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers went on that first unbeaten streak, they arrived
in Milwaukee at 15 and counting on a midwinter night. In the
hallway before the game, Jackson said it wouldn't break his heart
if Los Angeles lost, because defeats made for better teaching
tools. In the locker room, meanwhile, the same bunch known for
years as underachievers was actually sweating out how it was going
to win one more.
</P>
<P>
   They won No. 16 that night, but lost the next game in
Indianapolis. Seven teams already had been on win streaks of 16
games when this Lakers team did it. But Jackson knew that only two
of those teams -- the 1971-72 Lakers and his 1995-96 Bulls -- went on
to win championships. A month later, Jackson came through Chicago
and said his new team still had plenty to learn about closing
games, especially come playoff time. Thus nudged, the Lakers ran
off two more double-digit win streaks.
</P>
<P>
   At practice Thursday, Jackson even provided the introductions
for one of those up-close-and-personal segments they often show
before games. It's not as compelling as the material that would
have been available if the coaches weren't so darn stubborn about
wearing the mikes Stern bought on another one of his technology
jags. But it isn't half-bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it is, the moment we all play for,'' Jackson said. ''We
all feel real positive going into the playoffs. There are no easy
routes. Now, the next step is here.''
</P>
<P>
   All season long, the tributes have been piling up, but Jackson
moved them to the corner of his office and talked around them,
trading on his reputation as an eccentric. But the underlying
lesson his players should have grasped by now sounds like something
he picked up along the waterfront in his New York days: All that
smooth sailing didn't mean a thing if the ship doesn't make it into
the port.

<HEADLINE> 'Antiques Roadshow' Pulls Episode  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Producers of public television's popular
''Antiques Roadshow'' program have pulled another episode because
of questions about the authenticity of an appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McGhee, a vice president for WGBH-TV, said the station was
concerned about an episode in which a woman brings in a
17th-century Milanese parade helmet and learns it's worth $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she had found the helmet in her attic, but she
won't return the station's telephone calls, McGhee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman owner's story of finding it in the attic -- that's
the part we weren't able to get her to verify for us,'' McGhee
said. ''There was at least a cloud of doubt about that. Here's a
case where doubt persists and we couldn't eliminate it, so we
withdrew the program.''
</P>
<P>
   McGhee said the station talked to the San Francisco appraiser,
Greg Martin, who heads the arms and armor department at
Butterfield's Auction Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was a bona fide appraisal ... and we have no reason
to doubt his word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin told the Boston Herald he was surprised to learn the
episode had been pulled because the woman did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's an irrational conclusion,'' Martin said. ''I
remember she was sincerely frightened after she found out the value
of the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode first aired in 1997 and was scheduled for broadcast
again on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   The show invites ordinary people to bring in items and find out
whether they're junk or treasure. It's watched by about 14 million
people each week and it's going into its fifth year, but recently
it has hit some bumps in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the station said it was cutting all ties with
two of the appraisers that had appeared on the show because they
had staged an appraisal of a Civil War sword during the show's
first season.
</P>
<P>
   McGhee promised ''we will be even more careful that such things
cannot happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Appraisers on the show are not paid but gain national publicity
if they appear on the show.

<HEADLINE> Town makes new history with convictions of officers  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- When Mario and Vera Sinapi moved here
from New York City 25 years ago, they never expected the town with
its quaint, historic Main Street and town green would be rife with
big-city controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, two police officers have been convicted on
charges related to separate civilian deaths and earlier this year,
a police sergeant was charged with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unusual,'' said Mario Sinapi, a retired New York
deputy fire chief. ''The town is becoming a city. It's changing, no
doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated in 1712, New Milford now has about 24,000
residents, making it one of the largest towns in the state. Still,
much of the rural, New England atmosphere permeates as residents
try to accept the change that creeps in amid the well-preserved,
18th-century buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first came here, it was great,'' said Emily D'Alessio,
who moved from Brooklyn, N.Y., 35 years ago. ''But these things do
happen-- you can't say when, or how, or why. It's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Officer William Scribner, a 14-year veteran of the
police force, was convicted of negligent homicide stemming from the
June 1998 death of 17-year-old girl whose car was struck by his
speeding cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, former officer Scott Smith was convicted of
manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed suspect at point-blank
range. He faces 5 to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced May 5.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Sgt. James Duda was charged with drunken driving
following a November accident in which he crashed his personal car
into a utility pole. A month later, the state Department of Motor
Vehicles ruled that Duda could keep his driver's license so he
could continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the police department-- particularly Smith-- is
evident throughout the town. A bright blue pickup truck parked
outside the police station carries a large sign proclaiming ''We
Support Scott Smith.'' Other vehicles bear bumper stickers with the
message ''Scott Smith Not Guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the M&AMP;B Market, Lorri Barker accepts donations in the
form of clothes, furniture and other goods for a tag sale to
benefit the Scott Smith Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people are outraged. I mean literally outraged,'' said
Barker, of neighboring Roxbury. ''I'm just mad about the whole
thing. I think Scott Smith is being railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Police Chief Colin McCormack says the town has been very

<HEADLINE> Police: Ottawa Student Stabs Five  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy stabbed four students
and a school employee on Thursday and also cut himself before
handing the knife over to the principal, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the youth, described as a loner, suddenly lashed
out at the school worker and other students at Cairine Wilson high
school in the Ottawa area. All five victims and the student with
the knife were hospitalized. None had life-threatening wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Greenwood, 16, said one of the victims was ''playing
cards or something'' when the attacker came from behind and
''stabbed him in the back and the head.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He just stabbed the guy sitting closest to where he was coming
from,'' Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the knife-wielding youth wounded himself. He was
under arrest and would be charged when released from the hospital,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The attack at an Ottawa high school occurred on the first
anniversary of the Columbine high school killings in Littleton,
Colorado, although there was no immediate indication that
Thursday's violence was linked to the anniversary of the shooting
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy police chief Vince Bevan said the suspect knew the first
person he stabbed, but there was no evidence that any victims were
targeted. Principal Mike Jordan calmed the youth, who handed him
the knife about 15 minutes later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunchtime stabbings, some students formed a prayer
circle and sang ''Amazing Grace'' outside the school as others
sobbed openly.
</P>
<P>
   Students described the suspect as quiet with few friends.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, two Columbine students killed 13 people before
commiting suicide with their guns. A week after the Columbine
shootings, a youth at a Taber, Alberta, high school shot to death
one student and wounded another.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian schools have tightened security in recent weeks due to
various threats of possible violence around the anniversary of last
year's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In New Brunswick, a high school was almost empty Thursday after
threats of violence to coincide with the Columbine anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Nike Chair Wary on U. of Ore. Funds  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike Chairman Phil Knight complained
Thursday about the University of Oregon's decision to join an
organization of students and activists protesting sweatshop
conditions at clothing and shoe industry factories abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight, an Oregon graduate and track athlete, declined to
comment on a television report that he would withdraw a reported
$30 million pledge to help expand Autzen Stadium because the school
joined the Worker Rights Consortium last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hinted he may be rethinking his financial generosity
toward the university, saying the school was free to join the
consortium but ''it does not mean that we are required to support
those efforts with which we have fundamental disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight refused to confirm the size of the stadium donation or a
report by Portland-based KGW-TV, which quoted unidentified sources
as saying Nike told university officials Monday that Knight was
withdrawing his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The details of Phil's private philanthropy have and will
continue to be personal,'' according to the company statement.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials said no changes had been made in any donations
to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had not heard from any of our donors that anything was any
different, whether it was Phil Knight or anybody else,'' Dave
Williford, UO sports information director, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has repeatedly been the target of labor rights groups who
have admitted their strategy is aimed at the Beaverton-based
athletic shoe company because it is an industry leader and can
pressure other companies to follow its example.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, Nike's billionaire co-founder who once sold shoes from
the back of his car at Oregon track meets, defended the company's
labor record, saying it had become a leader in ensuring worker
rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that, since he appeared at the National Press Club in
Washington, D.C., in May 1998 to promise industry reforms, Nike has
increased its minimum age requirements for footwear workers to an
industry high of 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said Nike has raised wages more than 70 percent for
footwear workers in Indonesia during the last 20 months, improved
air quality at factories and disclosed the location of 45 domestic
and foreign factories producing clothing licensed by U.S. colleges
and universities.

   DOKCHON, South Korea (AP) -- According to declassified U.S. military

officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial in the
early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur became
aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents originally
classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting by The
Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some historians
have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested by the
right-wing regime were secretly killed.

No Smoke, Dementia Prevention Link

British Medical Journal, scientists from Oxford University found male doctors
who smoked were just as likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer's as their
counterparts who had never smoked or had quit years before. Earlier studies on
the relationship between smoking and dementia, a major component of Alzheimer's,
produced conflicting results, with some showing an apparent benefit.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Northwest Air Deal Reached  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines and its flight
attendants' union, which has been seeking a new contract for 3{
years, reached agreement Thursday on a tentative deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots to 11,000 flight attendants, who rejected a tentative
agreement last August, will be mailed next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased to reach this agreement and believe it is a
fair one for all parties,'' said Doug Steeneland, the company's
chief corporate officer.
</P>
<P>
   On a recorded hot line, Teamsters Local 2000 President Billie
Davenport said an agreement was reached Thursday in Seattle, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ''They offered us increases in pay and pension that we thought
were good enough to take to our members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement posted on the union Web site, the
tentative deal includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Industry-leading pension rates, increased from $35 to $65 per
month per year of service, which is nearly an 86 percent
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   --Stronger work rules.
</P>
<P>
   --Full domestic partner health insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The members made their voices heard loud and clear,''
Davenport said. ''I believe our negotiators achieved an agreement
that meets flight attendants' needs. No longer will Northwest
flight attendants stand on the bottom rung of the industry
ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, pay for flight attendants at Northwest starts at
around $16,000 and rises to more than $40,000, with the average pay
in the mid-$30,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants at the nation's fourth-largest airline
have been seeking a new contract since September 1996. Tensions
have remained high since Northwest sued the union over an alleged
holiday sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest fired 18 flight attendants for calling in sick during
the Christmas-New Year's holiday period, and the union filed
grievances. Northwest canceled about 300 flights over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had agreed before Thursday that the company's lawsuit
would be dropped if the flight attendants ratified a tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants took pay cuts for three years beginning in
1993 to help keep Northwest out of bankruptcy, and until early this
year wages were only 3 percent higher than before the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Northwest gave flight attendants a 4 percent raise,
just a day after giving its mechanics, custodians and cleaners the
same pay hike.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest pilots went on a 15-day strike in 1998 that crippled
the airline for weeks and cost the company millions in lost
profits.

<HEADLINE> Gore Completes Fund-Raising  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore won't be doing the
dinner-and-a-donation bit for his presidential campaign anymore.
The vice president is allowed to spend only $9 million more before
his nomination in August, and he's just about raised it.
</P>
<P>
   Unbound by the spending limit Gore faces, Republican George W.
Bush plans to keep doing the dinner circuit even though he has
raised a record $80 million and spent more than $73 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is limited to spending $40.5 million because he is
accepting federal matching funds. Bush is not taking taxpayer
money, so he can spend as much as he can raise.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Gore has more cash: $8.7 million, including
taxpayer matching funds, to Bush's $5.7 million, according to
finance reports filed Thursday. The figures take into account debt
of about $1 million for each.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush expects to catch up quickly and outspend Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said they weren't worried about
being down to $9 million because Bush spent vast sums during the
early primaries ''only to lose a nearly 20-point lead in the
polls'' over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that we'll continue to be outspent, but we'll
use our resources wisely and beat him on the issues,'' Hattaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan noted that the Texas governor
added another $1.8 million in the first half of this month, and
plans another fund-raiser in Greensboro, N.C., next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have plenty of resources to continue spreading
the governor's compassionate conservative message,'' McClellan
said. ''Al Gore needs to explain his administration's fund-raising
excesses, including his visit to the Buddhist temple, before he
attacks the spending practices of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate will receive $67.6 million in federal funds upon
receiving his party's nomination, and will then be prohibited from
raising more campaign cash. The Republican convention is July
31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia; the Democrats meet Aug. 14-17 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will keep raising cash for the Democratic Party even though
he's appeared at his last presidential campaign fund-raiser -- a
$100,000-plus event last weekend at the home of computer company
executive Jesse Singh in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not holding any more events. We will be doing some
fund-raising through direct mail and via the Web site,'' Hattaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush added another 15 names to his list of 156
''Pioneers'' -- fund-raisers who have brought in $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore, who last year released a list of 25
top-level fund-raisers, doesn't plan to give out any more names.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's big donors included millionaire developer George Argyros
of Costa Mesa, Calif., former owner of the Seattle Mariners;
Gregory Slayton, chairman of the Palo Alto, Calif., tech company My
Software; and Jim Haslam, a Knoxville, Tenn., founder of a chain of
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Huizenga, founder of National Heritage Academies, one of
the nation's largest chains of for-profit charter schools, and Mark
Guzzetta, a fund-raiser for Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
were also on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In March, as Gore put away a challenge by former Sen. Bill
Bradley, he raised $1.9 million and spent $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore expects to qualify for a record $15 million
in federal matching funds for the primary season, surpassing 1996
Republican nominee Bob Dole, who received about $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers match the first $250 of each individual contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised $5.9 million and spent $10.1 million in March as he
finished a tough primary race against Sen. John McCain of Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Mailboxes Etc. Store Shut Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The ''Etc.'' in a downtown Boston Mailboxes Etc.
store stood for shipping, packing services and, according to state
banking officials, loan-sharking.
</P>
<P>
   The Commissioner of Banks shut down the store Thursday, alleging
that it charged interest rates as high as 467 percent on small,
short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   The store illegally took applications and processed documents
for loans up to $300, officials said. Some loans were repeatedly
rolled over, resulting in additional finance charges to the
customer, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The store offered what is known as ''payday lending,''
electronically debiting loan and finance charges from borrowers'
bank accounts on the payday after the loan was made, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Payday lending is simply old-fashioned loan-sharking, despite
its antiseptic new name,'' Jennifer Davis Carey, the state's
consumer affairs director, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   State Banking Commissioner Thomas Curry issued a cease and
desist order for the store and owners Jay Patel and Naranbhai
Patel. The order prohibits them from directly or indirectly making
small loans.
</P>
<P>
   Curry also ordered them to provide the state Division of Banks
with records of loans made at the business.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the store after business hours Thursday were
not answered. Home phone numbers for the Patels could not be
confirmed and they could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Tribe Places Sandy Alomar on DL  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sandy Alomar, the Cleveland Indians catcher who
spent nearly four months on the disabled list last season following
knee surgery, was placed on the 15-day DL Thursday because of a
pulled right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar played in a career-low 37 games in 1999 after having a
bone spur removed from his left knee in May. The 33-year-old
catcher lost 15 pounds over the winter and arrived at spring
training in great shape hoping to catch 100 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   But just 14 games into a new season, he's back on the DL for the
eighth time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never easy to deal with going on the DL,'' said Alomar,
who was batting .310. ''But I've had some practice with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar began having spams in his hamstring during Tuesday
night's game against the Oakland Athletics and left in the fourth
inning. He underwent an MRI exam Wednesday, which revealed the
pull, an although it's not considered serious, the Indians didn't
want to take any chances and decided to place him on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors said he will be out anywhere from 10 days to two
weeks,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians purchased the contract of catcher Bobby Hughes from
Triple-A Buffalo to take Alomar's roster spot and back up Einar
Diaz. With Alomar sidelined last season, Diaz, 27, batted .281 with
three homers and 32 RBIs in 119 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 29, was released by the Milwaukee Brewers on April 3. In
two seasons in Milwaukee, he batted .238 with 12 homers and 37 RBIs
in 133 games. At Buffalo, he was hitting .310 with six RBIs in
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got some power for a catcher,'' Manuel said. ''He's got a
good arm. (Buffalo manager Joel) Skinner tells me he throws good
and he's got a chance to hit the ball out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was activated just before Thursday night's game against
the A's. To make room for Hughes on their 40-man roster, the
Indians designated outfielder Scott Morgan for assigment.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has 10 days to trade, release or outright Morgan, who
was the Indians' minor league player of the year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's 11-year career has been riddled with trips to the DL,
including two stints when the six-time All-Star tore the webbing on
his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of times I've gone on for freaky things,'' Alomar
said. ''There could be 50 guys standing around and the bomb would
hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar is the second All-Star to be placed on the DL by the
Indians this week. Cleveland's No. 1 starter Bartolo Colon could be
out for three weeks with a pulled rib cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was decimated by injuries last season, using the DL a
total of 22 times with 16 different players. Because of injuries,
the Indians were only able to field their opening-day lineup four
times all year.

Thursday. The Royals have been successful on 17-of-18 in steal
attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Fifteen members of the Uruguay national under-18
basketball team were in attendance Thursday afternoon as they
concluded their two-week trip through Minnesota. The team, from
Minnesota sister city Montevideo, played 10 games against various
high school teams.
Devil Rays-Orioles:

and sent RHP Al Reyes to the minor league club. Johnson will start
Sunday in Oakland.
Athletics-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: C Bobby Hughes, called up from Triple-A Buffalo when
Sandy Alomar went on the disabled list, got word he was going be
activated while on the Bisons' team bus en route to Scranton. ...
Manager Charlie Manuel said he'd like the Indians to be more
aggressive on the bases, especially leadoff hitter Kenny Lofton.
The Indians have two steals as a team through 14 games. Last year
they had 13 in their first 12 games. ''I'd like to see Kenny run
more even if he gets thrown out,'' Manuel said. ... The Indians
traded minor league OF Dan McKinley to Montreal for OF Scott
Hunter. Hunter, drafted by the Dodgers in 1993, was batting .200 in
seven games for Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Right after hockey, Matt Stairs' favorite subject is
hockey. Following Wednesday night's win over the Indians, Stairs,
who is from Canada, chased reporters away from his view of the St.
Louis-San Jose game on the clubhouse TV. ... John Jaha returned to
the A's starting lineup after missing six of the last seven games
with a tender left shoulder. ... The A's, who were just 2-10

in Cleveland since Sept. of 1989.
Angels-Blue Jays:

Cubs-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Sammy Sosa started in center field for the first time
this season. Roosevelt Brown made his first start in right field.
... The Cubs have lost four straight for the second time this
season. They also lost four from March 30-April 6. ... Eric Young
entered Thursday night's series finale just four steals short of
300 for his career. ... Also entering the game, Chicago starters
had gone at least six innings in 11 of their last 12 games. ...
Ismael Valdes threw 61 pitches in 4 1-2 shutout innings over 4 1-3
innings Wednesday during an extended spring training game. Valdes,

shoulder. ... The starting time for the Cubs' April 26 game in
Houston has been changed to 6:05 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>

three-game series sweep over Chicago since May 6-8, 1996 at Olympic
Stadium. ... Vladimir Guerrero, who entered the game just one RBI
short of 300, needs three more homers for 100. Guerrero struck out
for the first time this season Wednesday night. ... At 8-6,
Montreal is off to its best start since 1996. The Expos didn't win
their eighth game of 1999 until May 4, when a 2-1 win over Los
Angeles gave them an 8-18 mark. Montreal hasn't started a season
9-6 since 1993.
Pirates-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates purchased the contracts of RHPs Brad
Clontz and Jose Parra and recalled RHP Mike Garcia from Triple-A
Nashville. To make room on their roster, the Pirates optioned LHP
Chris Peters and RHP Marc Wilkins to Nashville and placed RHP Jason
Schmidt on the 15-day disabled list (retroactive to April 15) due
to an inflammation in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: With a win Thursday, the Marlins will equal the best
start in the team's eight-year history. The 1997 World Series
championship team started 10-7 before losing two straight. ...
Thursday's starting pitcher Ryan Dempster will have a diary on the
Marlins' new Web site at www.floridamarlins.com. Considered one of
the team's most colorful players, Dempster will provide insights
into the daily nuances of a major leaguer.
Giants-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Barry Bonds came down with the flu Thursday
morning, causing him to miss a game for the first time this season.
That was a big break for Reds starter Denny Neagle: Bonds is
13-for-37 (.351) career against the left-hander with five homers.
... Livan Hernandez (0-4) is in a four-game losing streak that
matches the longest of his career. He also lost four games in a row
from Aug. 21 to Sept. 12, 1998, with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds ended their streak of 11 straight games
with an error, their longest since 1974. ... SS Barry Larkin (.344)
has hit safely in 14 of the Reds' 16 games this season and is off
to his best start since 1995, when he won the NL Most Valuable
Player award. ''Throughout my career, every other year I get off to
a good start,'' Larkin said. ''This happens to be one of those
years.'' ... The Reds will be trying for their first three-game
winning streak on Friday against Los Angeles.
Mets-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   BREWERS: Milwaukee will be happy to leave New York, where it has
not only had trouble with the Mets (losing 15 of 18 meetings since
1998) but also the Yankees before the switch to the NL in 1998...
Milwaukee is 3-16 in games against the two teams in New York since
1996. ... RHP Jim Bruske (whose number, 88, is the highest ever for
a Brewer) has won his last six decisions dating back to Sept. 10,
1997, when he was with San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Opening day CF Darryl Hamilton, scheduled to come off
the disabled list Saturday with this sprained left foot, is not yet
physically able to play. ... RHP Rick Reed reported progress but
discomfort on the bruised left thumb hit by a line drive Wednesday
night off the bat of Brewers Marquis Grissom. He is expected to
make his next start Monday against Los Angeles in New York.
Phillies-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: After Atlanta, the Phillies traveled to Florida
for a four-game series. Philadelphia dominated the Marlins in 1999,
going 11-2 overall and 5-1 Pro Player Stadium. That was their best
overall and road record against any team. ... Ron Gant's error in
the eighth inning Wednesday night snapped a streak of 62 innings
without an error. The Phillies had committed a league-low three
errors through their first 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: New hitting coach Merv Rettenmund has made his presence
felt with the Braves, who used to be known as a free-swinging team
that relied on the three-run homer. Entering Thursday's game,
Atlanta had the fewest strikeouts in the majors (5.2 per game). The
Braves averaged 5.9 strikeouts in 1999, when now-Cubs manager Don
Baylor served as hitting coach, and 6.6 in '98, when Clarence Jones
handled the job. ... Nineteen-year-old Rafael Furcal made another
start at shortstop. Baseball's youngest player is virtually sharing
the job with Walt Weiss, having started six of the Braves 15 games.
... Kevin McGlinchey, one of the team's most valuable relievers in
1999, has been the forgotten man this year. Going into Thursday's
game, the 22-year-old right-hander had not pitched in eight days.
Overall, he worked just 2 2-3 innings through the first 14 games.
Padres-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Tony Gwynn was out of the lineup Thursday, a day
after making his first start in eight games due to an injured left
knee. He said he felt fine aside from a lack of strength in the
knee, but ''they're taking the cautious route with me.'' The Padres
have lost each of Sterling Hitchcock's four starts by one run. ...
Trevor Hoffman entered the game with 33 straight save conversions,
the longest active streak in baseball. He had converted 122 of his
last 127 opportunities. ... The team optioned C Ben Davis, who was
1-for-16, to Las Vegas of the Pacific Coast League and purchased
the contract of RHP Vicente Palacios from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire returned to the lineup after missing
seven games with a lower back strain. ''Now we can start talking
about how I play instead of that,'' McGwire said. ... Manager Tony
La Russa is tired of Ray Lankford's streaky nature, noting this is
his 10th season as a regular. ''He's not a young hitter anymore, he
knows how to make adjustments,'' La Russa said. La Russa benched
Lankford, who entered the game in a 1-for-26 slump, on Wednesday
and moved him from third to fifth Thursday. ... The Cardinals have
hit back-to-back home runs six times this season and Fernando Tatis
has been involved on three occasions. The NL record is 15
back-to-back homer games by the 1997 Colorado Rockies. ... C Mike
Matheny got only his fourth day off in 16 games. He has thrown out
eight of 11 baserunners.
Rockies-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Larry Walker, livid over suggestions that he purposely
had ducked facing Randy Johnson, asked manager Buddy Bell to put
him in the lineup against the Big Unit on Thursday night. Walker
had never played against Johnson in three previous opportunities.
Bell did so. ... Going into Thursday night's game, the Rockies had
scored 33 runs without a homer. The last Colorado player to hit a
home run was Todd Helton on Sunday in the first game of a
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Closer Matt Mantei, on the disabled list since April 2
with biceps tendinitis, will be activated on Friday. ... Entering
Thursday night's game, Randy Johnson had struck out 33 since his
last walk. In all, he had 34 strikeouts and two walks in his 3-0
start.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore talks character education on Columbine anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush earned rare
praise Thursday from Democratic rival Al Gore for marking the
Columbine massacre with a focus on teaching kids values. Gore also
toned down his criticism of Bush on gun control, saying it was not
''the one main solution'' to youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   In separate forums mostly stripped of signs that they were
campaign stops, the presidential candidates presented multifaceted
remedies for the kind of teen rage that erupted into gunfire and
bomb throwing one year ago at the Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Texas, suggested the Clinton-Gore White House had been
lax on gun control. ''It's important for the next administration to
do something a little different and that's enforce laws on the
books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor's real focus was on character education.
He offered proposals for teaching students better values, including
giving American Youth Character Awards to honor young people and
requiring federal programs ''affecting young people'' to include an
ethics component.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can pass laws in society and enforce laws, but it's also
important to remember much of what violence takes place is a matter
of heart,'' Bush said. ''I strongly believe this kind of character
education is so important in making sure children make the right
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would increase federal grants for character
education from $8 million to $25 million and let students transfer
out of dangerous schools. He also renewed his call for any juvenile
convicted of a serious gun or violent offense to be banned from
ever buying or carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gore saluted what he called Bush's talk ''about
character and spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I compliment him for doing that,'' Gore told an assembly at
Fort Lee High School. ''I think that's right near the top of the
list. I think that's a big part of this also. But if we are serious
in the aftermath of Columbine, we have to make some serious
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is counting on proposals for stricter gun laws to win
him votes over Bush, told parents and students that Bush opposes
mandatory child-safety trigger locks and, as governor of Texas,
overturned the state's 125-year-old ban on concealed weapons,
making it possible for hidden guns to be brought into places of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''What gives?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the lessons of Columbine is that we have to stand up to
the NRA and the gun industry and get guns out of the hands of
people who shouldn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ''I don't think that guns represent the one main
solution to this problem.'' He talked about curbing violence in
entertainment, alleviating overcrowded schools and offering
government help to stressed-out working parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not settled for some easy, glib silver-bullet
answer,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tipper, appeared on CBS' ''Early Show'' and said that
''easy access to guns on the Internet'' was a frequent concern of
teens she met in recent campaign forums. ''They say they can order
guns, they can order parts to guns and put them together,'' Mrs.
Gore lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and the vice president observed the solemnity of
Thursday's anniversary by toning down the fierce partisanship that
has characterized their campaign. In the Fort Lee auditorium, there
were none of the usual Gore campaign posters, only three yellow
ovals scrawled with the message ''Safe Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no campaign signs in Texas either. Instead, a large
yellow paper sign with green lettering said: ''Cater Elementary
Welcomes Governor Bush.'' Student signatures and smiley faces
decorated the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was making his appearance, in part, to fulfill a
promise to the father of one of the Columbine students killed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   At a Denver-area memorial, the father ''said into my ear as we
were embracing, he said, 'Promise me that these children have not
died in vain.' And then after a moment's pause he repeated with
urgency and force, 'Promise me,''' Gore recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'I promise' and that's the kind of promise you take
into your heart.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore Staffs Up for General Election  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is adding new faces to his
presidential campaign and stocking the Democratic National
Committee with loyal aides in preparation for the November showdown
with Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a former Clinton White House aide who helped the
president weather the Whitewater inquiry and other high-profile
controversies, is joining Gore's team this week as deputy campaign
manager for communications, according to top campaign advisers Tony
Coelho and Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from their Nashville, Tenn.,
headquarters, the pair said Fabiani will oversee the press,
research, message and issue teams at both the campaign and the DNC.
He will become the most visible face of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani's hiring coincides with several promotions and additions
at the campaign, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Lisa Berg, deputy campaign manager for scheduling and advance.
</P>
<P>
   -- Chip Smith, deputy campaign manager and chief of staff who
will conduct the campaign's day-to-day coordination with the DNC
and other party affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   -- Heather Marabeti, deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   -- Janet Murguia, deputy campaign manager of public liaison,
making her the point person for Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elaine Kamarck, policy consultant with the campaign and the
DNC.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sarah Bianchi, policy and communications under Kamarck. She is
a health care specialist at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whouley, the political strategist credited with helping
to build Gore's teams for the New Hampshire and Iowa elections,
will become senior political strategist as a consultant to both the
campaign and the DNC. Donnie Fowler Jr., field director at the
campaign, will coordinate his efforts with Whouley.
</P>
<P>
   Changes at the DNC include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Laurie Moskowitz will work on the coordinated campaign
efforts. She was a political operative at the DNC before heading
Gore's delegate process.
</P>
<P>
   -- Laura Quinn will move from Gore's White House office to be
communications director at the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mike Mathews will move from the AFL-CIO to be senior political
adviser at both the DNC and the campaign on labor relations and
policy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kikki Moore, a top Democratic communications specialist, will
be a senior adviser and frequent spokeswoman for both Gore and the
DNC.
</P>
<P>
   -- Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, will join the DNC to help
Gore and other party candidates target female and elderly voters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush is tweaking his Austin, Texas, staff and placing
advisers at the Republican National Committee

<HEADLINE> Scuffle at Galatasaray-Leeds Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEEDS, England (AP) -- Leeds fans smashed the window of a bus
carrying Galatasaray officials to Thursday's UEFA Cup semifinal, a
2-2 tie that advanced the Turkish team to the championship game on
4-2 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray, the first Turkish team ever in a European final,
will play Arsenal, which won 2-1 at Lens to advance on 3-1
aggregate. The championship is May 17 in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Three buses carrying Galatasaray officials arrived at the
stadium to jeers and chants of ''scum'' from hundreds of Leeds
fans.
</P>
<P>
   An object was hurled at the front coach, smashing one of the
windows, and some Leeds fans drew their finger across their neck in
a mock gesture similar to that given by Turkish fans toward Leeds
supporters two weeks ago. Several coins were also thrown at the
buses.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray striker Hakan Sukur was struck by an object thrown
by a fan toward the end of the game in which he scored his team's
second goal.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported 23 arrests, but there were no immediate reports
of any injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents came on a night of high tension surrounding the
game following the killing of two Leeds supporters in Istanbul two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans throw coins at the police outside, and the game began
10 minutes late. The bus taking the Galatasaray team into the
stadium grounds entered through a side entrance to avoiding the
Leeds fans waiting at the main gates.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Galatasaray's fans banned from the game, there were
350 police, twice as many as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stadium and when the Galatasaray players ran out to
warm up for the game, they placed flowers at several parts of the
field as a mark of respect to the two Leeds fans who were stabbed
to death in Istanbul two weeks go before the first leg of the
home-and-home, total-goals series.
</P>
<P>
   At first some of the Leeds fans began to boo the players, who
were also deliberately wearing black warmup suits, but that changed
to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Yildirim Akbulut, the speaker of the Turkish parliament, sports
minister Fikret Unlu and former premier and leader of the
opposition True Path party Tansu Ciller were among the party of 35
who arrived at Leeds, some of them in Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit's private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray went ahead in the fifth minute when Gheorghe Hagi
converted a penalty kick after Hakan Suker was pulled down by
Jonathan Woodgate. Eirik Bakke's header tied it 11 minute later,
</P>
<P>
   Suker put the Turkish team back ahead in the 42nd minute, and
Bakke scored again in the 68th.
</P>
<P>
   At Lens, the Gunners got goals from Thierry Henry (43rd minute)
and Nwankwo Kanu (86th), while Pascal Nouma (73rd) scored for the
home team.

<HEADLINE> Black Student Arrested in Race Case  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- A black dental student was charged
Thursday in a series of racist and threatening e-mails directed at
her minority classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors blamed Tarsha Michelle Claiborne, 23, for a
three-week period of threatened violence that frightened students
at the University of Iowa's College of Dentistry and forced the
closing of the school's main building on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne of Baton Rouge, La., was arrested early Thursday.
According to court records, the second-year dental student
confessed when faced with allegations. A motive remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities charged Claiborne with a felony count of threats in
violation of individual rights, related to a Tuesday bomb threat,
and misdemeanor charges for three previous e-mail threats.
</P>
<P>
   She also was charged with one count of criminal trespass-hate
crime for an April 4 incident in which red noodles were left on
another black student's doorstep with a note referring to a dead
black man's brains.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was being held at the Johnson County Jail on $52,000
bond. It could not be determined if she had an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some 1,000 people gathered at a rally to condemn the
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The dental college has an enrollment of 381 students, of which
49 are minorities. Thirteen of the 49 are black.
</P>
<P>
   The dental building was closed Wednesday after the bomb threat.
After an extensive search turned up nothing, it reopened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been having nightmares since this all started,'' said
Dana Vetter, a white third-year dental student from Mount Pleasant.
''It's been pretty scary, but I feel totally safe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Rhodes, vice president of university relations, said she
could not discuss Claiborne's academic status. She also said she
was not aware of any ill feelings Claiborne had toward the college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any reason to believe there were major problems
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said authorities, including the FBI, located the computer
that was used early in the investigation. Authorities then set up a
surveillance videotape at the site, a few of blocks from the dental
school.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's classmates had mixed feelings after being told of
the arrest.
</P>

   ''She was in one of my classes and she seemed really normal,''
said Julie Farrell of Ottawa, Ill., who's white. ''So it was a
pretty big shock when we found out. I'm relieved, but I'm also sad
that, obviously, something is so wrong mentally.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee Enema Doctor Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A doctor who received network television
attention for unusual cancer treatments that include coffee enemas
was told by a jury Thursday to pay the husband of a dead patient
$282,000.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Dr. Nicholas J. Gonzalez negligent for telling
Hollace Schafer, a college music professor, that by testing her
hair he could diagnose the state of her cancer and prescribe
appropriate treatment. Schafer died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was the second against the 51-year-old Gonzalez. In
1997, a jury ordered him to pay the family of Julianne Charell, 64,
more than $2 million because of his unorthodox treatment of her
uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in the Schafer case found Gonzalez negligent for not
arranging proper testing to determine her condition, and they found
that this contributed to her death from Hodgkin's disease -- cancer
of the lymph system.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's husband, Jack C. Gray, sued Gonzalez in 1996, charging
that he used ''quackery'' instead of proven medical regimens to
treat his wife with vitamins, dietary manipulation, purges, animal
tissue extracts, and enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's lawyer, Maria del Pilar Ocasio, said Gonzalez's cancer
treatment also called for four to 10 coffee enemas a day to
''detoxify'' Schafer's gastrointestinal system. Ocasio said the
doctor ''brainwashed'' Schafer to make her believe this would work.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, 40 when she died in 1995, was first diagnosed with
cancer in 1977, Ocasio said. Twice she had been treated with
chemotherapy and twice her cancer had gone into remission. When the
cancer appeared a third time, she decided to try alternative
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Schafer, an assistant professor at the College of
the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., 51 percent liable for her own
death, while Gonzalez was ruled 49 percent liable.
</P>
<P>
   The apportioning of liability showed the jury believed the
defense argument that Schafer, a Ph.D. in musicology, was an
intelligent woman who researched her treatment options and chose
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's cancer treatment was the topic of an ABC news special
and a segment on CBS's ''48 Hours.''

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Rally for Elian in Havana  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- About 100,000 chanting, flag-waving government
supporters massed Thursday in front of the U.S. mission, venting
anger at a U.N. human rights censure and at delays in the return of
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous crowd, called to the protest by the government,
spilled out along Havana's waterfront, from a newly erected protest
stage outside the U.S. Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
   ''The northern empire (the United States) has spent 40 years
working to crucify this people,'' declared Baptist minister Raul
Suarez in an Easter-themed message comparing the passion of Christ
with the suffering of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Miguel Barnet complained that Elian had been exploited in
the United States. ''They have converted that boy into an
automaton, into a circus animal,'' he told the crowd. He said Elian
''is our child ... a child we are going to defend with our blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters sat atop Havana's famous Malecon seawall while
tens of thousands more stood packed together, waving small Cuban
flags in unison. Some came on their own, others came in organized
units from work, youth or Communist Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This delay is unjust,'' said Maya Peruren, a 32-year-old
microbiologist. ''The boy should be at his father's side.''
</P>
<P>
   Peruren complained that President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno ''have done nothing'' to reunite father and son.
''Everything is just words, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with loudspeakers roamed the streets of the Cuban capital
and the front pages of newspapers announced the late afternoon
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people, angered and indignant, will unite once again to
denounce and implacably condemn the imperialist maneuvers against
our fatherland,'' according to the announcement in the newspaper
Juventud Rebelde.
</P>
<P>
   The rally mixed protests against U.S. sluggishness in returning
6-year-old Elian with protests against a censure of Cuba this week
by the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the government gathered between 100,000 and 200,000
people for a protest march past the Czech Embassy in Havana because
the Czechs sponsored the censure resolution. Cuban officials claim
the United States was the true author of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from official denunciations of the Czechs, a dance
troupe at the rally bounced a giant figure of Uncle Sam with a
smaller marionette dangling from strings. ''Look at the poor Czech.
He dances like a puppet,'' they sang to an African rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said on state television
Wednesday night that the United States ''manipulates the topic of
human rights against our country'' while giving aid ''in our
country to a minuscule and absolutely unknown and unrepresentative
(group of) paid traitors,'' a reference to local dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials also complained about the federal appeals court
ruling in Atlanta barring Elian from returning to Cuba while court
appeals over possible asylum are heard.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Cuba's Interests Section in Washington, Fernando
Remirez and Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said the judgment
''ignored the opinions of judges, psychologists and pediatricians''
about the Cuban boy's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement read on television Wednesday night, they
said that the U.S. government should have settled the case by
turning Elian over to his father four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. government knows ... of the dangers the boy runs and
is responsible for his security,'' their statement said.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Said Hot-Tempered  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Richard Glassel was known as the hothead
who was furious at groundskeepers for trimming the shrubs outside
his retirement-community condominium.
</P>
<P>
   The community association was so unnerved by Glassel that it
obtained a restraining order against him. When he finally moved
out, he allegedly took a chainsaw to his place, tearing up
sheetrock and slicing cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors hadn't seen him in months -- until Wednesday. That's
when police say he stormed into a community association board
meeting with guns blazing, killing two people and wounding three
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he moved, I was glad he trashed his house and didn't take
his frustrations out on us. Now, we feel especially lucky,'' said
Art Rausch, who lived across the street from Glassel.
</P>
<P>
   At first, members of the Ventana Lakes homeowners association
didn't even recognize the 61-year-old Glassel, since they hadn't
seen him in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just came in, stood in the rear of the room and started
firing,'' said Sheldon ''Smokey'' Stover, 76, who shouted warnings
when the gunshots erupted.
</P>
<P>
   During the shooting, according to court documents, the gunman
said he was getting even with the association for all the problems
the members had caused him.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people dropped to the floor, scrambled under chairs or
huddled together as the bullets tore through the Ventana Lakes
Yacht Club, where the homeowners meeting was under way.
</P>
<P>
   When Glassel's gun jammed, Sheldon and five others tackled him,
holding him on the floor until police arrived. Police found two
more loaded guns in his jacket and a large stash of ammunition in
the rental moving truck he had driven to the meeting, Sgt. Russ
Scarborough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're very lucky there weren't more people killed,'' said
Thomas Mangan, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and
three counts of attempted first-degree murder. Prosecutors have up
to 45 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty. During a
court appearance in the middle of Wednesday night, he requested a
lawyer. One was not immediately appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Nila Lynn, 69, died of a gunshot wound to the back. Esther
LaPlante, 75, was fatally shot in the head and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ettinger, 69, who was shot in the chest, was in fair
condition Thursday. Gilbert McCurdy, 63, underwent foot surgery
late Wednesday and was in good condition. Charles Yankowski, 69,
was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth person was also hospitalized after the shooting but not
for a gunshot wound. Police had no details Thursday on the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The association sued Glassel and obtained a restraining order in
1998 to keep him from harassing or intimidating the groundskeepers
after he allegedly shoved a property manager, said Penny Koepke, an
attorney for the community association.
</P>
<P>
   Koepke said Glassel wanted the bushes around his property to
grow lush and full instead of having them neatly cut back.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the bank foreclosed on his condo. It was auctioned in
November. But before Glassel left, neighbors and others said, he
destroyed its interior, sawing through cabinets and removing the
dishwasher and kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took a chainsaw to the doors, took a chainsaw to the
plastic tub and the plastic shower stall. He also etched big X's on
the Arcadia doors, pulled down the sheetrock, cut the wiring in the
walls,'' said Donald McLean, a former association vice president.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers drug troubles raises merger specter  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1998, it was Viagra. In 1999 it was the
arthritis pill Celebrex. This year, the biggest new blockbuster
prescription drug was supposed to be the hypertension medicine
Vanlev.
</P>
<P>
   But Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s hopes of launching the next pill
destined for multibillion dollar annual sales were scuttled when
federal officials raised concerns that Vanlev may cause severe
facial swelling and impair breathing in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries led the nation's third-largest drugmaker Wednesday
to withdraw its application for Vanlev until more studies can be
completed, a move that should delay launch of the pill until at
least late next year.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of its promising blood-pressure drug now
uncertain, Bristol-Myers may find itself an acquisition target or a
merger player, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year delay on a potential blockbuster could cause them to
think more actively about merging,'' said Bob Kirby, an analyst
with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The company is playing down the need to merge, despite the
consolidation wave sweeping the pharmaceutical industry. But the
officials aren't ruling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking back or standing still,'' Michael Mee,
Bristol-Myers' chief financial officer, said in a conference call
Thursday with analysts. ''We are looking at all of our options with
great intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's first-quarter earnings rose a
better-than-expected 15 percent, most analysts' focus was clearly
on the company's pipeline of future products -- and the future of
Vanlev.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe a merger is likely if the company cannot
revive Vanlev, a drug expected to post $2 billion or more in annual
sales when it reaches market.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will probably merge if they are not able to revive
Vanlev,'' said Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. He gives the
drug a 50-50 chance of making it on the market without serious
safety warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Companies routinely stumble in developing new drugs -- nine out
of 10 drugs they test in people never make it to market.
</P>
<P>
   But drug firms' pipelines have grown in importance as Wall
Street pressures the firms to show evidence they can continue to
raise profits at double-digit levels. As a result, the New
York-based Bristol-Myers has not shied away from promoting numerous
studies of Vanlev over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers officials acknowledge they expected to have the
drug approved in June, and had no contingency plan for the delay
caused after the Food and Drug Administration raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of more than $100 billion and a
diverse portfolio of products, including medical devices and the
world's leading infant formula, Bristol-Myers remains confident
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very fortunate that we are not just a one- or two- or
three-product company,'' Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   Other big drugmakers have overcome similar research setbacks,
Kirby said. Merck &AMP; Co. in 1998 disappointed Wall Street when it
announced it was not moving ahead with a promising antidepressant.
And Schering-Plough Corp. was punished last year after the company
ran into safety problems with its experimental impotence pill.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Wall Street considered Bristol-Myers one of the
most attractive drugmakers. But the Vanlev problem spotlights a
number of potential shortcomings at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the company's top-selling drug, the
cholesterol-lowering pill Pravachol, have declined, losing market
share to Warner-Lambert Co.'s Lipitor. And the company's top cancer
drug Taxol is expected to lose patent protection in the next year
or two, making it vulnerable to cheaper generics.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a New England Journal of Medicine study raised
concerns about another Bristol-Myers' drug. It said Plavix, a new
blood thinner given to heart patients after angioplasty, in rare
cases may trigger a deadly blood disease.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix, which had $201 million in sales in the first quarter, up
128 percent from a year ago, is Bristol-Myers' fastest selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers said the side effect was extremely rare and the
study would not have a big impact on sales.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, the company said it was resubmitting its new
colorectal cancer drug for FDA approval. Safety questions has been
raised after the drug was first submitted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares have dropped by nearly 25 percent in the
past two days. On Thursday, the stock fell 93} cents to $50 on the
New York Stock Exchange, despite the company's better than expected
first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers reported earned $1.22 billion, or 61 cents per
diluted share, on revenue of $5.26 billion, up from $1.07 billion,
or 53 cents per share, on revenue of $4.85 billion last year.
Results beat analysts' forecasts by a penny, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose early Friday following a jump in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street. The dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 308.93
points, or 1.63 percent, to 19,268.25 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 127.30
points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.80 yen, up 1.02 yen from late Thursday and
also above its late New York level of 105.73 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo stock market, prices moved broadly higher as
investors were cheered by the Dow's 169.09-point rise Thursday,
leaving the New York index at 10,844.05 at the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said, however, that some investors were cautious ahead
of a three-day Easter holiday weekend in the United States starting
Friday. New York markets will be closed April 21 in observance of
Good Friday, a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 30.05 points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,659.05
points. The TOPIX closed up 9.18 points, or 0.56 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was lifted by remarks by
Japan's top central bank official reaffirming that the bank's
current credit policy will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Japan's Parliament, Bank of Japan Governor
Masaru Hayami said Thursday the central bank will keep its current
zero-rate policy until deflation fears are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.22 yen, up from
98.30 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7350 percent, unchanged from Thursday's finish. Its
price remained 101.42.

<HEADLINE> Nevin, Padres Manager Bochy Ejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- San Diego Padres cleanup hitter Phil Nevin and
manager Bruce Bochy were ejected Thursday night in a dispute over a
called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin struck out to end the top of the third, and after going to
third base he badgered plate umpire Larry Young about the call.
Bochy also was ejected when he joined the argument.
</P>
<P>
   On his way off the field, Nevin threw his glove and hat in the
air and made a gesture in Young's direction with his arm. He then
took off his jersey and dropped it in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Young was the first base umpire on Eric Davis' controversial
two-run bases-loaded infield hit on Wednesday night, ruling him
safe when replays indicated Davis was out by a half-step.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were trailing the St. Louis Cardinals 6-0.

<HEADLINE> Dayne Attends Giants Minicamp  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- While they probably know what Ron
Dayne can do on a football field better than most, Robert Reid and
Ron Hopson prefer to talk about the Heisman Trophy winner and New
York Giants' first-round draft pick in other terms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of discussing the tailback's ability to cut or his
speed, quickness and power, they like to talk about the other side
of Dayne, the part only friends and family see off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Reid helped raise Dayne, taking his 13-year-old nephew into his
home after Dayne's mother went through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson was Dayne's principal and mentor at Overbrook High School
in southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At Dayne's first local news conference since being taken by the
Giants with the 11th pick in the NFL draft, both men stood in the
back of the room Thursday, enjoying every moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a hunger and sense about him,'' Hopson said. ''He knows
what he needs to do and he always gets it done. He has that kind of
intelligence. You could sit down and talk to him. He won't talk
back, but he's listening all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said that being almost twice as big as his friends somehow
made Dayne mature even before high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ron had a mystique growing up because people always thought he
was older, because he was always the biggest kid in the class,''
Reid said. ''He was always respected as a mature kid. You never
knew what to expect out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates might also be surprised, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a jokester, a comedian more than anything else,'' Dayne's
uncle said. ''He's a fun-loving guy, a prankster enjoying life,
having a tremendous desire to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Giants will expect out of Dayne is a halfback who can
restore a running game that averaged less than 90 yards last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the numbers he produced at Wisconsin, where he broke
the Division I rushing record, Dayne should help. But some experts
have questions about his weight (255 pounds) and how much wear and
tear his body has taken.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said there wasn't any wear-and-tear until Dayne got to high
school, because he wasn't allowed to play when he was 11, 12 and
13. He already weighed around 250 pounds at that point, well over
the 135-pound midget limit, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All his nephews and cousins were achieving, doing real well on
the football field and here he was being relegated to soccer,''
Reid said. ''It was eating him up on the inside and he couldn't
wait until he was a freshman in high school and could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne broke records in high school and didn't stop in college.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants seem to be expecting more. When they handed out
uniforms on Thursday, Jim Fassel handed Dayne No. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The last Giants player to wear the number was Rodney Hampton,
the team's leading rusher with 6,897 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne had wanted No. 33 -- his number from college and high
school -- but second-year halfback Joe Montgomery has the number
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make a difference what number I have,'' Dayne said.
''I just want to come out here and give it my best and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Pete Monty, Dayne's teammate at Wisconsin,
thinks Dayne will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't get a shot early on at Wisconsin and he kept
fighting to get playing time,'' Monty said. ''Eventually he did,
and he kept running from there.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopeful on Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing the ''risks and difficulties'' inherent
in achieving peace, President Clinton on Thursday greeted
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with hope that he can help Israel
and the Palestinians meet a September deadline for a final
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly three-hour meeting, the White House said that
Israel and the Palestinians will resume negotiations later this
month in the Middle East region. A senior administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States would
take on ''a more intensified role'' at the request of both Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the talks are now turning to the most complex
emotional issues, such as settlements, borders, refugees, even
Palestinian statehood -- matters at the core of a final status
agreement -- and expressed optimism that a framework for an
agreement might be reached by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the issues between the two sides are ''difficult,
but I think they can be bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are risks and difficulties involved,'' Clinton said. ''I
believe they are not nearly as great as the risks and difficulties
of not making a peace agreement. So I hope they will do it. ... I
will do everything I can to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived at the White House by car Thursday evening.
Clinton received Arafat exactly as he received Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak last week -- meeting him at the White House's
South Portico and strolling together across the Rose Garden to the
Oval Office. Clinton spoke briefly with reporters, Arafat did not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Arafat talked for a half-hour along with nine aides
each, then pared that group down to themselves, two notetakers and
an interpreter for discussions that went on for more than an hour.
Then Clinton and Arafat shared a dinner of red snapper, salad,
mixed vegetables and saffron potatoes, and Arafat left.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin also reaffirmed that
the United States is prepared to play a more active role in
recognition not only of the September deadline but also of others
that are approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is agreed that we will play a more involved role by
being at the table, trying to be creative, trying to help each side
figure out what its needs are,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met with Clinton a few hours after a luncheon meeting
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Palestinians
and Israelis face ''a very tight time line'' and Clinton wanted the
face-to-face sessions to see how the United States could keep the
negotiations on track.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton met with Barak last week, the discussion focused on
the need for an accelerated pace, and that appeared to be at the
center of Arafat's talks here as well. Lockhart said Clinton wanted
to ''take stock of where we are'' without offering new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on a treaty framework are to begin after the Jewish
Passover holiday, which ends April 26. Negotiators will meet in
Israel and the Palestinian areas, rather than in Washington, as
they have done in two previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have said no progress has been made since talks
on a blueprint for a peace treaty began in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he was not aware that there are any new U.S. ideas
that were being presented on Thursday or any time soon. This did
not rule out the possibility of ''creative suggestions'' at some
point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians face a May deadline for a treaty
framework, and a September target for a full accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Sunday he would turn over West Bank land that would
give the Palestinians the territorial contiguity they need for
statehood, and assured his hard-line Israeli critics that Jerusalem
would remain united under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Palestinian suburbs just outside the city, claimed
by both sides as their capital, would be handed over.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Subway Fire Prompts Evacuation  </HEADLINE>
By RON VAMPLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fire in a tunnel between two Metro subway
stations forced the evacuation of a train and the two stations at
the height of the evening rush hour Thursday, stranding thousands
of commuters and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported, but paramedics treated a
dozen people for smoke inhalation as the Farragut West and Foggy
Bottom stations were emptied. The stations, which carry the Blue
and Orange lines that ferry passengers to and from the Virginia and
Maryland suburbs, were reopened and service resumed at about 9
p.m., after about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was scary for a while,'' said Ann Wright of Calgary,
Alberta, a tourist who was on the train that was evacuated. ''Smoke
filled one of cars and people started screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright, traveling with her three sons, said a man on the
train calmed everyone down.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us not to panic and cover our mouths with our
shirts,'' she said, adding that people followed his directions.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was thought to have started in a power cable in a
tunnel as a train neared the Foggy Bottom station in the heart of
George Washington University campus, said Capt. Brian Lee of the
District of Columbia Fire Department. Farragut West is about four
blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who were trapped on the train for two hours had to
walk through the tunnel to the Foggy Bottom platform after the fire
was put out.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic also was snarled on streets around the stations with
emergency vehicles blocking them as firefighters dealt with the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Some shuttle buses carried passengers from the two shut stations
to the Rosslyn station in nearby Arlington, Va., the closest
station that carries the Blue and Orange lines. But commuters piled
up there because of a shortage of buses to allow commuters to
continue their rides home.

<HEADLINE> Protester Injured in Whale Hunt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- A woman on a jet ski was injured Thursday
as she tried to disrupt a whale hunt by members of the Makah tribe
and collided with a Coast Guard boat. The hunt was unsuccessful,
but tribal members said they would not be deterred by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Abbott, 23, an anti-whaling protester from Seattle, was
listed as stable Thursday at a Port Angeles hospital with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Television video showed Abbott swooping in on her watercraft as
the tribe's carved wooden canoe closed in on a gray whale. The
Makah had just thrown a harpoon, which did not stick in the whale.
</P>
<P>
   As the Makah attempted to maneuver for another shot, Abbott
rushed by the canoe, spraying those aboard with her wake. As the
watercraft turned, it was overtaken by the 21-foot inflatable Coast
Guard boat.
</P>
<P>
   The two collided, and both the watercraft and Abbott appeared to
go under the Coast Guard boat. Abbott surfaced a moment later about
20 feet from her watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe she wasn't killed,'' said Julie Woodyer of
World Whale Police. ''This aggressive behavior by the Coast Guard
is unprecedented -- this is our worst nightmare come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are required to stay 500 yards from the Makah whalers
and their canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope she's OK, but it's unfortunate that she would violate
the exclusionary zone'' around the canoe, said Makah Whaling
Commission Chairman Keith Johnson. ''She'll have to accept the
consequences of her actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Ted Lindstrom said the agency regretted that
Abbott had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said a second protester, Erin O'Connell,
was arrested Thursday morning and a second personal watercraft was
confiscated. Protesters said they would resort to using larger
boats to interfere with the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to keep fighting. It's not going to deter us,''
said Jonathan Paul, a spokesman for Ocean Defense International.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, the Makah hunters had closed in on at
least one other whale, which dove before they could throw another
harpoon. They quit hunting late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders say the seasonal hunt, a centuries-old tradition
that resumed in the fall of 1998 after a 70-year hiatus, is vital
to preserving the identity of the tribe at the tip of Washington's
Olympic Peninsula. Anti-whaling activists fear it could open the
door to a worldwide renewal of commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   A whaling crew with representatives from several families took
the tribe's first whale last May 17. Now the hunts are being
conducted by individual Makah families, as tradition dictates.
</P>
<P>
   Five families have been preparing to hunt as the gray whales
migrate from birthing grounds in Mexico to feeding grounds off
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission has allocated the Makah 20
whales through 2004, a maximum of five per year.

times by U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners
without trial in the early weeks of the Korean War, according to declassified
U.S. military documents and witnesses. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
originally classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting
by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some
historians have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
by the right-wing regime were secretly killed.

times in memory of the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school
shooting. The bell tolled 13 times at 11:21 a.m. today, the precise moment two
teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. At private
ceremonies and public remembrances all day and into the night today, students,

<HEADLINE> Violent Threats Close U.S. Schools  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Classes were canceled or security was stepped up
at many schools around the country Thursday because of a rash of
threats and rumors tied to the anniversary of the Columbine High
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of violence or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   School violence experts said it was natural that threats and
hoax calls would increase on the anniversary of the deadliest
school shooting in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are more likely simply because of the awareness people
have of the Columbine anniversary,'' said Pamela Riley, president
of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence at North
Carolina State University. ''It seems like an anniversary of
something like this is a time to remember by doing something that
is good, but unfortunately, that's not what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   No threats were reported at Columbine or any other Jefferson
County school, a sheriff's spokesman said late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Epping, N.H., were closed Thursday after someone
scrawled a message on a high school bathroom wall that said ''4/20
everyone will die.'' Officials said a boy confessed and told them
it was a prank.
</P>
<P>
   California's Santa Barbara High School District planned
additional security after notes threatening certain students were
found recently. One note said, ''We will finish what Hitler,
Columbine started.'' April 20 was Adolf Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, schools ''have all been walking the
tightrope all week, trying to keep their guard up and react to
incidents and track down rumors while at the same time not
overreacting and creating the type of situation they are trying to
avoid,'' said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety
and Security Services, a consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed Thursday in Port Edwards, Wis., after a
bomb-like device was found near the front doors of a high school.
An Army bomb squad determined that the device -- a propane tank with
a timer, batteries and wires -- could not have detonated.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tightened at Encinal High in Alameda, Calif., where
three students were in custody for allegedly creating ''hit lists''
naming 105 students to be killed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Westerville North High School and Heritage Middle School in Ohio
were closed after a bomb threat was found in a bathroom. A threat
found at Walnut Hills Middle Schools in Ohio prompted officials to
send students to a neighboring church until the time listed in the
threat had passed. Classes then resumed.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Springer Municipal Schools classes were canceled
because of a threat the superintendent said was called in Wednesday
and was related to the Columbine anniversary.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Welcomes Israel Withdrawal Plan  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council said Thursday it
welcomed news of Israel's plans to withdraw from southern Lebanon
and gave the go-ahead to draft plans for a U.N. role in the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement adopted by the council, ambassadors formally
acknowledged a letter received Monday from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy to Secretary-General Kofi Annan informing him that
Israel would withdrawal by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Security Council shares the view expressed by the
secretary-general .... that cooperation by all parties concerned
will be required in order to avoid a deterioration of the
situation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and has occupied part of southern
Lebanon since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council resolutions call for Israel's withdrawal and
the establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to confirm the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told reporters on Wednesday that the United Nations may
need to strengthen its peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon to
monitor the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw
Israeli troops from Lebanon by July, preferably as part of an
agreement with Lebanon and Syria but unilaterally if necessary.
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. Talks between Israel and
Syria, however, have stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
   Israel believes the U.N. force, now numbering about 4,500
troops, will be enough to patrol the Israel-Lebanon border if
expanded to its full mandate of 7,000 soldiers, a senior Israeli
official said recently, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary-general said the United Nations has not
determined how many troops will be needed.

<HEADLINE> Guard dies after scuffle at prison where another was beaten byinmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YARDVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- The death of a prison guard who suffered
a heart attack while subduing an inmate has union officials
pointing the finger at the state Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   They say cutbacks at the Garden State Youth Correctional
Facility are to blame for two incidents in less than a week in
which guards were injured or died.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Michael Price, 44, collapsed Wednesday while attempting to
handcuff an inmate who had become disruptive, according to union
officials.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, an inmate beat a guard over the head with a pipe.
The guard survived.
</P>
<P>
   Garden State, a minimum security prison with about 1,900
inmates, has about 365 guards, 21 less than is called for in the
Department of Corrections' own staffing analysis, according to
Donald Dudich, vice president of the New Jersey Law Enforcement
Supervisors union, which represents sergeants at Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   When planned staff cuts are completed, 328 guards will work
there, Dudich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The staff is doing the best they can to deal with what they
have. But when you reduce the staff and you give inmates more
liberty, this is what happens. The inmates get more aggressive,
they think they don't have to respect the law as much,'' Dudich
said. ''This department wants us to do more with less, and that's
not a good way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was serving the unidentified inmate with a disciplinary
charge when the man assaulted him, Dudich said. Struggling to
handcuff the man, Price was being helped by another officer when he
collapsed, according to Dudich.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Carden would not
discuss the circumstances of Price's death except to say it
happened while he was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The department's special investigations division is
investigating, he said. Carden wouldn't respond to the union's
criticisms about staffing, saying he would not engage ''in a tit
for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the two incidents occurring so closely, he said:
''You will find that corrections officers have the most difficult
job in the world. They do a yeoman's job in protecting the state
from its worst criminal offenders. Understandably, there are
incidents that occur that are unfortunate. This one is among the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Carden said no one has been charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident last week, guard Claude Nix, 54, suffered a
fractured skull and a broken jaw when he was attacked by one or
more inmates. He was hospitalized for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Price, of Burlington Township, was a 10-year veteran who worked
at Garden State the whole time. For his family, it was the second
tragedy in little more than a year. In February, 1999, his
17-year-old daughter died in a traffic accident.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Linked to Wash. Slayings  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A middle-aged father of five who often
cruised Spokane's red-light district in a flashy white Corvette is
linked by DNA and other physical evidence to at least a dozen
murders, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk said samples of DNA taken from
Robert Lee Yates Jr. matched DNA found on the bodies of at least
eight prostitutes. Other physical evidence links him to the murders
of four other women, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the victims were shot to death, and their bodies dumped
in remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Yates has been charged in only one death.
Additional charges are expected to be filed against him, the
sheriff said. Detectives hope to provide a list of those victims
with a link to Yates on Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Detectives tell me they're comfortable with 12, up to 18,''
Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, an aluminum plant worker and National Guard helicopter
pilot, was being held Thursday in Spokane County Jail in lieu of a
$1.5 million cash bond. He requested an attorney during a court
appearance Wednesday. His wife could not be reached for comment.
Authorities have refused to disclose the whereabouts of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was among hundreds of suspects investigated by a police
task force formed three years ago to probe the serial killings of
18 prostitutes in the Spokane and Tacoma areas.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to the attention of detectives only recently
following tips that he liked to frequent Spokane's red-light
district in his Corvette. Two police reports also linked him to the
prostitution area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The white Corvette and evidence we found in that vehicle led
us to the arrest of Mr. Yates, and through DNA to a number of the
other victims in this case,'' Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we knew what pushed this guy's buttons early on, it would
have helped us solve this case earlier. We didn't know,'' the
sheriff added.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yates was charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of Jennifer A. Joseph, a 16-year-old prostitute
whose body was found on a farm northeast of the city on Aug. 26,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, of Spanaway near Tacoma, was last seen in August 1997
getting into a white Corvette driven by a white male in his 30s or
40s, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of a DNA analysis of blood smears found in
the Corvette once owned by Yates matched Joseph's blood, Sterk
said. Additionally, hair, clothing and other evidence that could
have come from Joseph were found inside the car, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, investigators began combing the inside of
Yates' house for fiber and other microscopic evidence, Sterk said.
Yates lived in the home with his wife and their five children.
</P>
<P>
   Among other clues, investigators were seeking a weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have seized nine vehicles, including the Corvette --
which Yates sold in 1998 -- and two vans formerly owned by Yates.
Another car Yates formerly owned was recovered Thursday in Idaho,
Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives began 24-hour surveillance of Yates after he returned
to Spokane on Sunday from a two-week Army National Guard summer
camp at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Yates left the Army in 1996 after an 18-year
career. He joined the National Guard as a helicopter pilot with the
66th Aviation Brigade, which trains once a month at the base near
Tacoma, spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Army, Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, N.Y., and
Fort Rucker, Ala.

<HEADLINE> New Iraq Probe Agency Worries Russia  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia says it is concerned that the new
U.N. arms inspection agency for Iraq is not different enough from
its contentious predecessor, and wants new measures to help head
off friction between the agency and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Russia last week joined in the Security Council's unanimous
endorsement of the organizational plan submitted by Hans Blix, the
executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued in New York on Thursday, Russia's
foreign ministry said: ''The practical aspects of the new
commission's activities require substantial revision.''
</P>
<P>
   Blix's plan for his office lacks provision for political
advisers who would work with inspectors ''and make it possible to
avert potential clashes and disputes with Iraq,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has repeatedly complained that the former chief
inspector, Richard Butler, was too quick to complain to the council
over problems with access to suspected weapons sites -- problems
Russia believes could have been worked out by legal or political
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Moscow also questioned Blix's ''overstated
assessment'' about the benefits of retaining inspectors from the
previous arms agency, the U.N. Special Commission, which Butler
headed. And it criticized what it called the lack of procedures for
monitoring and obtaining Baghdad's support.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be no return to Butler's working methods,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council created the new commission, known as
UNMOVIC, in December to replace the Special Commission, which was
stung by allegations that U.N. inspectors spied on Iraq on behalf
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Blix's organizational plan took pains to outline ways he would
guard against similar problems, saying all employees would be paid
for by the United Nations -- not individual countries -- and would be
forbidden from accepting any instructions from governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian statement, however, indicated that deep divisions
over Iraq weapons monitoring remain among the Security Council
members and that Moscow will keep a close eye on how the new agency
goes about its work.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, along with China, France and Malaysia, abstained from
the December resolution creating UNMOVIC, saying it was unclear and
ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons inspectors left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of U.S. and
British airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq for failing to
cooperate with arms searches.
</P>
<P>
   Top Iraqi officials have said Baghdad would not accept new U.N.
weapons inspectors, but others have left open the possibility of
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said it has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction and deserves to have sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait lifted. U.N. inspectors say there are still
outstanding questions about Iraq's weapons programs.

<HEADLINE> 2 US Boxers Qualify for Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Brian Viloria and Dante Craig earned
berths in the Olympic Games at Sydney, Australia with victories
Thursday night in an Olympic boxing qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Viloria, 106 pounds, defeated Domenic Filane of Canada 10-2 and
Craig, 147, beat Yovanny Lorenzo of the Dominican Republic 16-3 in
the semifinal round of the second of three Olympic qualifying
tournaments. Viloria and Filane earned berths in the Sydney
Olympics regardless of the outcome of the final bouts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Olanda Anderson, 178, was scheduled to try to
give the United States the last victory it needs to send a full
team to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Viloria got his berth in the Olympics by bouncing back from a
loss to Puerto Rico's Ivan Calderon in the first Americas Olympic
qualifier at Tampa, Fla., three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was real down following my loss in Tampa,'' Viloria, the
current 106-pound world champion, said. ''But I knew that I had to
get right back in the ring and start all over again. I'm just
relieved that I don't have to go to Argentina'' for the last
qualifier May 29-June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a surprise winner over two-time U.S. champion Larry
Mosley, had no international experience before the qualifiers
began. With two bouts in Tampa and four in Mexico, Craig has the
experience he will need to structure his training regimen toward
defeating international opponents in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew deep down inside that coming to Mexico was best for
me,'' Craig said. ''It has been a grueling experience, but I know
that I'll come out better because of it. I've been dreaming about
this for a long time, and I just had to wait a little bit longer
before it came true.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers 5, Sabres 2  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres kept stalling and
stalling, expecting Dominik Hasek to steal a game. While they were
waiting, the Philadelphia Flyers swiped the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers scored two relatively soft goals against the NHL's
premier playoff goaltender, one by Dan McGillis and the other set
up by him, and closed out the Sabres 5-2 in Game 5 of their NHL
first-round series Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGillis' long slap shot sailed by Hasek with eight seconds left
in the first period, and his floater from just inside the blue line
was redirected by John LeClair for the go-ahead goal midway through
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kind of goals Hasek seldom allows in the
postseason, especially last season when his strong play carried the
Sabres to the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Daymond Langkow made it 3-1 slightly more than three minutes
after LeClair's goal, an advantage much too big to overcome for a
star-less Sabres offense that scored only eight goals in the five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Gagne also scored a power-play goal at 9:55 of the third
period after Stu Barnes' goal had briefly cut the Flyers' lead to
3-2. The Flyers, who had the NHL's second-best power play during
the season, scored nine of their 14 goals in the series on the
power play
</P>
<P>
   Bounced by the Sabres in a first-round upset in 1998 and again
by Toronto a year ago, the top-seeded Flyers now advance to the
Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' second-round opponent remains undetermined, but will
be seventh-seeded Pittsburgh if the Penguins don't blow a 3-1
series lead against Washington. Game 5 of that series is Friday
night in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After Gagne's goal, some Flyers fans began chanting, ''We Want
Pittsburgh'' -- and no wonder, since the Flyers were 3-0-1 against
the Penguins this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers helped break two longstanding NHL playoff rules in
eliminating Buffalo 4-1 -- Hasek never gives up easy goals in the
postseason, and he always keeps the Sabres in the playoffs longer
than they should expect to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   McGillis' goal was the crusher, and it undid everything that
Buffalo had done up until then to take the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smehlik scored at 8:44 of the first, a slap shot from
the left point off a faceoff won by Michael Peca.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers kept pressing for the tying goal, and finally got it
as McGillis took new Flyers captain Eric Desjardins' cross-ice pass
and teed up a slap shot from the left point. The shot was so hard
that it rattled the water bottle atop the net as it whistled past
Hasek's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers scored at least one power-play goal in every game of
the series, a streak kept alive when LeClair scored. McGillis' shot
hardly seemed threatening as he let it go but Hasek, apparently
screened, didn't pick it up well, allowing LeClair to put his stick
on it.
</P>
<P>
   That goal reenergized a noisy crowd of 19,801, and the momentum
carried over to Langkow's goal at 12:52, or 3:05 after LeClair's
goal. Gagne dug the puck out along the rear boards and fed Rick
Tocchet, who moved it to Langkow in the low slot.
</P>
<P>
   Langkow added an empty-net goal with one-tenth of a second
remaining -- the least amount of time possible for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sabres left the ice, coach Lindy Ruff was struck by a
flying object on the left side of his face. The extent of his
injury, if any, wasn't known, but several Sabres assistants tried
to climb the glass behind the bench to point out who threw the
object.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers rookie goaltender Bryan Boucher, whose 1.47 goals-against
average going into the game was lower than Hasek's 1.98, enjoyed a
relatively comfortable evening, stopping 20 of 22 shots as he won
his first NHL playoff series.

<HEADLINE> NYC Protesters Denounce Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 2,000 protesters marched about three
miles from Brooklyn to City Hall to demand Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
resignation over his handling of fatal police shootings of unarmed
black men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amadou Diallo! Patrick Dorismond! Malcolm Ferguson!'' shouted
the mostly Haitian-American crowd. ''Giuliani must go!''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was slain by four white police officers -- they were
acquitted of murder charges. Dorismond was killed outside a
Manhattan bar and Ferguson was fatally shot during an undercover
drug raid, all this year.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Giuliani has vociferously defended the police. He
sometimes sought to shift blame for the shootings to the victims
and was criticized for releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters promised to fight against Giuliani's bid for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all have got to vote!'' shouted Marie Dorismond,
Dorismond's sister. ''All of this will mean nothing if you don't
vote. ... I'm tired of crying for black brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani loses the Senate race in November to his Democratic
opponent, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, he will remain mayor
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters voiced anger toward the NYPD as well, but their
real focus was Giuliani, and sign after sign depicted the mayor as
the devil or as Adolf Hitler. The signs were cheered by about
hundred onlookers as the marchers came off the Brooklyn Bridge into
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giuliani violates human rights,'' ''Giuliani, the new
Hitler,'' and ''Stop and frisk Giuliani, book him up for racism,''
read some of the signs.
</P>
<P>
   One person was arrested during the protest, but he was later
released and the arrest voided.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not immediately return a telephone call
for comment on the rally, but he said earlier in the day: ''People
have a right to protest, I really have no problem with that at all
as long as they do it peacefully.''

Carmen Dillon
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Art director Carmen Dillon, who won an Academy
Award in 1948 for her work on Laurence Olivier's ''Hamlet,'' died
April 12. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, who created sets for many memorable British films for
more than 40 years, was the first female art director in the
British film industry. Dillon joined the art department at Fox
Studios north of London in the 1930s after six years of training as
an architect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, she moved to Pinewood Studios, where she worked on the
films ''The Mikado'' and ''French Without Tears.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked with Paul Sherriff on the Academy Award-nominated
design for Olivier's 1944 classic ''Henry V,'' but it was her work
on Olivier's ''Hamlet'' that won her the Oscar -- for set direction
on a black-and-white film.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon designed the films ''The Way to the Stars'' in 1945,
''The Browning Version'' in 1951, ''The Importance of Being
Earnest'' in 1952, Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' in 1967, ''The
Go-Between'' and ''Lady Caroline Lamb'' in 1972, and ''The Omen''
in 1976.

</P>
<P>
   DOVER, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew J. Karpinski, the former state
insurance commissioner who was forced out in an ethics controversy,
died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated by Gov. Christie Whitman on March 1, 1994, to
serve as insurance commissioner after a 30-year career as an
insurance agent. He resigned in October 1995 over charges he used
his personal insurance license to sell three policies for his
former insurance agency in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office said Karpinski acted
''improperly'' but did not recommend criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Karpinski was president of the New
Jersey Title Insurance Co. in Parsippany.
</P>

John P. McLaughlin
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- John P. ''Jack'' McLaughlin, retired president
of Northern California's largest Teamsters union local, died
Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin retired in 1992 as president of Teamsters
Professional and Clerical Local 856 after a 32-year career, during
which he negotiated contracts in the car rental, freight, parcel
delivery and hotel industries.
</P>
<P>
   He studied for the priesthood for seven years and said his
religious studies fueled his strong social ethic.
</P>
<P>
Jack Page
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Page, who taught journalism for
several decades at Oakland's Merritt College, died Saturday of a
heart attack. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Page, who also taught English and photography in his 30 years as
a Merritt professor, was known for his outspoken defense of his son
Bradley Page, who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Page was convicted of the 1984 killing of his
college girlfriend, Roberta ''Bibi'' Lee. His father ardently
maintained his son was wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Page then worked as a reporter in Minneapolis and an editor for
the weekly Arizona Record, and later joined the Merritt College
faculty, where he taught until his retirement in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Page is survived by a daughter; three sons; and five grandsons.

Dr. J. Eugene Smith
</P>
<P>
   WINDHAM, Conn. (AP) -- Dr. J. Eugene Smith, a former president at
what is now Eastern Connecticut State University, died Thursday. He
was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was hired in 1937 to teach social sciences at the school,
then known as Willimantic State Teachers College. He was named the
school's second president in 1947, a position he held until 1966.
The school became Eastern Connecticut State University in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also served as executive secretary to the Board of
Trustees for the Connecticut state college system from 1967 to
1972.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 169; Nasdaq Falls 62  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose sharply Thursday on the
latest round of strong corporate profit reports. Technology stocks
ended modestly lower as investors took some profits from the big
gains of Monday and Tuesday and struggled to chart a course in the
volatile sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.09 to close at
10,844.05. The Dow ended the four-day week with a gain of 538.28
points, or 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 62.53 to close at 3,643.88. Even
with losses Wednesday and Thursday, the Nasdaq rose 322.59 points,
or 9.7 percent, for the week after plummeting a record 25.3 percent
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 7.07 to 1,434.54.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks paced the Dow. American Express rose 3 47/64
and J.P. Morgan gained 2 1/16 to 130~. Also, Wal-Mart rose 2} to 57
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus, however, was on earnings reports. Companies
are nearing the peak of the reporting season, with about half the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 having released their first-quarter
reports, and most have reported strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service rose 4 7/16 to 63{ after the company
reported earnings that topped expectations. Commerce One, which
provides electronic-commerce software and services, rose 7 9/32 to
55, also on better-than-expected results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strong earnings have been a very pleasant surprise to this
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. He said money now is going
to companies with the best earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares came under some selling pressure as investors
cashed in on the market's recent gains. On Monday and Tuesday, the
Nasdaq rose a total of 472 points, with record point gains each
day, and the Dow average gained 461.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise earlier this week wiped out a portion of the
crushing losses sustained during last week's devastating selloff.
Traders are still feeling their way through the battered technology
sector, knocking down stocks that ran up sharply at the start of
the year but beginning to pick up issues that fell sharply in last
week's rout.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase fell 6 5/16 to 85 3/16 and Intel fell 3 11/16 to
115].
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors this week concentrated on earnings
reports and other signs of fundamental strength as they determined
which stocks to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's exactly what investors should be doing, but had given
up doing in recent months,'' said Bernard Horn, mutual fund manager
at Polaris Capital Management. ''The market is behaving in a much
more normal, more rational manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While stocks have generally moved higher this week, many
economists remain concerned about whether the economy is growing
too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Thursday that new claims for
unemployment benefits plummeted last week to the lowest level in
nearly 27 years, indicating that businesses are scrambling to find
workers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concerns that the tight labor market will spur
higher inflation because employers have to recruit workers with big
increases in wages and benefits. The increased costs could then be
passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers, fearful that too-rapid economic
growth could revive inflation, have raised interest rates five
times since June. Many investors worry that continued signs of
brisk growth will spur the Fed to raise rates several more times
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets will be closed Friday for the observance of
Good Friday. Bond markets closed at 2 p.m. Thursday. Ahead of the
long weekend, composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled a moderate 1.07 billion shares, compared with 1.20 billion
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.39 to 481.84.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.7 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Shooter in Kosovo Escapes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A 15-year-old ethnic Albanian boy
suspected of killing a Russian peacekeeper has escaped again --
crawling through a kitchen vent despite having his leg in a cast,
U.N police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Faton Hajrizi had been in custody off and on since late March in
the shooting death of a Russian peacekeeper mortally wounded Feb.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Officials discovered he was missing late Wednesday, said U.N.
police spokesman Charlie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Hajrizi has escaped several times, breaking his leg during a
breakout April 2, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy reportedly admitted to his father that he shot Pvt. Igor
Korshunov with the soldier's own gun after provoking a fight.
Korshunov died March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Russian was one of 27 peacekeepers to die in
Kosovo since the NATO-led force arrived in June, most from natural
causes, traffic wrecks and accidents clearing explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N's top official joined 500 ethnic Albanians
Thursday to call for the release of a prominent ethnic Albanian
arrested by Serb police a year ago during the 78-day NATO air war
and later imprisoned on charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Brovina, a medical doctor, women's' activist, poet and a
widely known humanitarian worker, was sentenced to 12 years
imprisonment in December after a Serbian court convicted her of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Her sentence was condemned by independent human rights
organizations, the United States and other Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason to sentence her, and there is no reason at
all to believe that she was involved in something else other than a
human fight to get a better Kosovo,'' Bernard Kouchner, the United
Nation's top official in Kosovo told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina's son, Uranik Begu, 22, said the family was looking
forward to appeal on May 16.

massed today in front of the U.S. mission, venting anger at a U.N. human rights
censure and at delays in the return of Elian Gonzalez. The enormous crowd,
called to the protest by the government, spilled out along Havana's waterfront,
from a newly erected protest stage outside the U.S. Interests Section. President
Clinton said today that the boy should be promptly reunited with his father, now
that a federal court has ruled that Elian must stay in the United States until
the court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing. A hearing was set for
May 11.

Document: S.Korea Executed 2,000

<P>
   DOKCHON, South Korea (AP) -- According to declassified U.S. military
documents and witnesses, South Korean soldiers and police, observed at times by
U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial
in the early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
originally classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting
by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some
historians have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
by the right-wing regime were secretly killed.

   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Coloradans fell silent while a church bell tolled 13
times in memory of the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school
shooting. The bell tolled 13 times at 11:21 a.m. today, the precise moment two
teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. At private
ceremonies and public remembrances all day and into the night today, students,

<HEADLINE> Gore Sees Elian 'Family Solution'  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Thursday he
''advised'' Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives to abide by the law as
he rejected an appeal by the Cuban boy's father for public support
for a reunion with his 6-year-old son while custody is litigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision ought to be made according to what is in the
boy's best interest. Usually a family court or a decision maker
following those kinds of procedures gives tremendous weight to the
views and preferences of a surviving parent, but not always if
there are other factors involved,'' Gore said on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.'' He did not say what other factors should weigh into the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, asked Americans
to help him persuade the Clinton-Gore administration to end the
five-month father-son separation.
</P>
<P>
   A caller to the talk show told Gore the Miami family was
''breaking the law'' by refusing an order, after their temporary
custody was revoked, to return Elian to his father. ''Do you
condone this lawbreaking?'' the caller asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advised them to abide by the law and they have said that
they will,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane later clarified that Gore has not spoken
with Elian's U.S. relatives. ''That's a public counsel he's
proffered,'' Lehane said. ''He has not been in contact
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in New Jersey, Gore urged the feuding relatives to get
together ''without government officials or lawyers'' to try to
resolve their increasingly entrenched and contrary positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, pressed by reporters, refused to criticize the handling of
the case of the shipwrecked Cuban boy by President Clinton's and
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to get into that. I respect the way they're
going about this and I hope we'll be able to get the family members
together,'' Gore said during a round robin of local TV interviews
in a Fort Lee school corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Miami area, where Elian is staying, New Jersey has a
large number of Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be a constructive step if the family members
could all meet together without government officials or lawyers to
try to reach a family solution to this,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still confident that might happen. I think everybody wants
this thing to be over in the way that's in the best interests of
the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has made
clear he will strongly compete for the 25 electoral votes of
Florida, where many in the influential Cuban-American community
oppose turning Elian over to his father for a return to Cuba. Some
have surrounded the relatives' home in Miami where Elian is staying
and vowed to block his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to criticize those Little Havana demonstrators,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been there to see the scene for myself. It's kind of
hard to get a picture of it just from a television angle,'' Gore
told New York's WNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   He evaded repeated questions on whether he agreed with Attorney
General Janet Reno's assessment that Elian should be with his
father, who is waiting in Washington for a reunion and return to
Cuba, while a court decides if the boy should have an asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''My position is the same as it has been. I think it would be a
constructive step if the family members could all meet together
without government officials or lawyers to try to reach a family
solution to this and that's what I would recommend,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Lawyers Ask Jurors To Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Prosecutors want jurors in Ray Lewis' murder
trial to be taken in a limousine to the spot where two men were
stabbed to death early Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In a court motion filed this week, the Fulton County
prosecutor's office asked for jurors to be allowed to sit in the
40-foot limo in which the Baltimore Ravens linebacker and his
friends were riding, and to revisit the crime scene at the same
time -- 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In other motions, prosecutors want:
</P>
<P>
   -- A prohibition of defense claims that unidentified persons
killed the men, unless they first prove to the court's satisfaction
that there is a plausible alternative theory.
</P>
<P>
   -- To introduce into evidence previous assault charges against
Lewis and co-defendant Reginald Oakley, as well as subpoena friends
of Lewis to establish a relationship between Lewis and Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Oakley, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting of Miami are
accused in the deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar during a
brawl after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury's understanding of the layout of the crime scene and
the limousine (is) vitally important to allow them to critically
evaluate witness testimony,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates the prosecutors want to head off defense
contentions that the scene was not well-lit and that passengers in
the back of the limo could not hear passengers talking near the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to show that Lewis, who was sitting in the back
of the limo's tunnellike interior, could hear the other defendants
talk about the stabbing. The limo driver has told police he had
heard at least one defendant say he stabbed someone.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Drug Investigator Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A federal agent investigating a marijuana
cartel and officials' alleged links to drug trafficking was gunned
down on his way home from work, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Orlando Guzman was attacked Wednesday night by
AK-47-toting assailants who fired about 25 rounds, said Alfonso
Navarrete, an official from the Oaxacan arm of the Mexican attorney
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was one of the authorities in charge of an investigation
into a small marijuana cartel run by the Diaz Parada family in
Oaxaca, about 250 miles southeast of Mexico City, and into federal
officials allegedly linked with drug trafficking, Navarrete said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the investigation, authorities have jailed
numerous officials. In addition, Navarrete said an arrest warrant
had been issued against a federal district attorney whom he did not
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's slaying is yet another in a string of violent,
apparently drug-related killings in the past two months in Mexico.
Victims have included two police chiefs of the border cities of
Tijuana and Reynosa as well as prosecution and defense attorneys.

<HEADLINE> Young Have Different Elian Views  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Outside Elian Gonzalez's Miami home, a younger
generation of Cuban Americans -- many of whom have never even seen
Cuba -- mix with the usual crowd of elderly emigres in camouflage,
guayabera shirts and pink sportcoats.
</P>
<P>
   Girls in shorts and tank tops, boys with shaved heads and droopy
pants, the younger Cubans tend to see the Elian case as a custody
issue, not a struggle of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can identify with Elian,'' said Yanelys Palma, who left Cuba
last year at age 15. ''But I think they should focus more on the
boy, and make this less of a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the difference reflects a softening of the
anti-Castro sentiment among next-generation Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cuban first generation is passionate against Castro,''
said Jaime Suchlicki, the Cuban-born director of the Institute for
Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It begins to slow down with the second and third
generations,'' he said. ''It may disappear altogether in 50 years,
but ethnic groups reinvigorate themselves every so often.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be happening now with the Elian dispute. Those who grew
up under Castro are finding new interest in their stories of
oppression, abuse and death.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Fernandez, 22, an American-born art student at Florida
International University, said her Cuban parents reminisce more
about life in Cuba amid all the Elian news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she's become more sensitive to Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So has Melissa Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the beginning, I just didn't care,'' said Alvarez, an
18-year-old Florida International student studying criminal
justice. She was born in New Jersey and her parents were both born
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   She visited Cuba with her father last August, a trip she said
changed both her life and her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad when you go over there because kids walk barefoot
because families want to save for other things,'' she said. ''They
see the U.S. as a fantasy. They would ask me, 'Is it like the
movies?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Alvarez said, she is just as passionate as the older
generation.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 1.4 million people of Cuban descent in the United
States, according to Census Bureau figures, with 800,000 of them in
the Miami area. Gus Garcia, a founder of the Democracy Movement
with an estimated membership of 1,600, said the Elian issue was
helping the anti-Castro group's work.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good consciousness-raising effort, especially among
young people and women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At an open-air restaurant two blocks away from the Elian
protests, a half-dozen Cuban-American high school juniors chatted
Thursday over a meal of pizza and croquetas, a fried and breaded
meat dish.
</P>
<P>
   Their favorite foods include rice and beans. They prefer salsa
or merengue and much of their conversation is in Spanish. They
watch Mexican or South American soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   They consider themselves ''Cuban, 100 percent,'' as Lazaro
Alfonso, a shaved-bald student, says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But the few born in Cuba left young. Asked why she attends the
demonstrations, Surumy Gonzalez shrugs her shoulders and considers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Cuban,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Sanchez, 20, an engineering student at Florida
International University, said: ''If he (Elian) says he doesn't
want to go back, please, somebody listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he doesn't sit around with his Cuban-American,
Nicaraguan, Ecuadoran, or Brazilian friends and discuss politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (the Castro regime) is terrible but what can you do?''
added Adrian Morales, a 20-year-old broadcast major at Florida
International. ''It's nothing that consumes me, I guess, because
I'm over here.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs 10, Expos 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit a grand slam and tied his career
high with six RBIs as the Chicago Cubs beat the Montreal Expos 10-6
Thursday night, ending their four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Batting cleanup for only the third time this year, Sosa hit a
two-run double in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth, he hit his
fourth career slam against Miguel Batista. It was Sosa's fifth
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time Sosa had six RBIs in a game. He last
did it on Sept. 16, 1998, the same day he hit his previous grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams (1-0) pitched a perfect fifth for his first win
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill had a pinch-hit, two-run double off Batista to
ignite the Cubs' six-run rally in the sixth. Matt Blank (0-1) took
the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who usually bats third, also started in center field for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa's two-run double in the fifth drew the Cubs within
5-4, Chicago took the lead the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reed singled to lead off and slid in safely ahead of
Blank's throw to second on Damon Buford's sacrifice. Hill's double
put the Cubs ahead, and two walks loaded the bases for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa fell behind 0-2 before recovering to drive a 2-2 pitch over
the left-field wall for his first grand slam since he connected off
San Diego's Brian Boehringer.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White had an RBI single in the Montreal ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young hit an RBI single in the Cubs third. Montreal
responded with five in the fourth, including Michael Barrett's
three-run double over Sosa's head.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Downs, making his third career start, allowed five runs
and seven hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Jeremy Powell went 2-for-2, including a
run-scoring single in Montreal's five-run fourth.
Notes: Roosevelt Brown made his first start of the season for the
Cubs in right field. ... Chicago also lost four in a row from March
30-April 6. ... Young stole his fifth base of the season after his
RBI single in the third, leaving him just three steals short of 300
for his career. ... The Expos have won five straight home series
from the Cubs since June 6-9, 1997. Montreal was going for its
first three-game series sweep over Chicago since May 6-8, 1996, at
Olympic Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Panthers 1  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Martin Brodeur and New Jersey's stifling
defense held the Florida Panthers to one goal for the third
straight game Thursday night, ending the Devils' first-round
playoffs woes.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made 35 saves and Sergei Nemchinov scored twice in the
final four minutes as New Jersey beat Florida 4-1 to sweep the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils advanced to the second round for the first time since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who fell to 1-12 in their last 13 playoff games,
continued to struggle offensively in Game 4 despite getting their
most scoring opportunities of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Florida snapped an 0-for-10 drought on the power play with the
game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure beat Brodeur with a slap shot from just outside the
left circle to give Florida a 1-0 lead at 5:19 of the first period.
Bure slipped the shot under a sliding Ken Daneyko and between
Brodeur and the right post.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bure's first goal of the playoffs. The Russian Rocket led
the league with 58 goals during the season, but the Devils --
primarily using Scott Stevens to shadow Bure -- limited his shots
and open skating space in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vernon kept the Panthers ahead in the opening period,
stopping 17 shots -- including one-on-one saves against Jason Arnott
and Claude Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey scored twice in the second, tying the game at
4:26 and taking a 2-1 lead at 15:02.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias tied it, beating Vernon high on a precise centering
pass from Jason Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers had plenty of chances to regain the lead, getting
14 shots in the second period, but again struggled against the
Devils' smothering defense and Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey took the lead when Scott Niedermayer scored his
second goal since returning from a 10-game suspension for hitting
Florida's Peter Worrell over the head with his stick March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's wrist shot floated past Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov put the Devils up 3-1 with 3:48 to play and added his
second goal of the night with 1:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lost in the first round of the playoffs as the
Eastern Conference's No. 1 seed the last two seasons. Ottawa beat
them 4-2 in 1998 and Pittsburgh beat them 4-3 last year.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Families Mark Tragedy  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A father fell to his knees and kissed
the grass on his son's grave. A mother watched 13 white balloons
soar into a brilliant blue sky over the cemetery where her son now
rests.
</P>
<P>
   And at 11:21 a.m. -- the precise moment two teen-agers opened
fire inside their high school on April 20, 1999 -- Coloradans
quietly reflected as a church bell tolled 13 times in memory of the
victims of the Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   At private ceremonies and public remembrances all day and into
the night Thursday, students, staff, survivors and strangers came
together to mark the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest
school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is about the angels who are watching over us -- helping
us to heal and helping us to remember,'' Gov. Bill Owens told a
crowd at the state Capitol in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Owens presided over the moment of silence that marked the
instant Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris began the bloodbath, killing
12 students and a teacher and wounding 26 before taking their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There was little mention of the gunmen Thursday, and the acts of
remembrance -- the 13 balloons, the bell tolling 13 times, 13
crosses erected -- were meant to recall the victims and not the
killers. The victims' families had even asked the news media to
avoid any references to Klebold and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too often over the last year, the coverage of the tragedy at
Columbine High School has focused on the two young men who so
viciously took the lives of our loved ones and friends. But not
today,'' the governor said in opening the ceremony at the Capitol.
''Because today is about the victims of Columbine and their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The killers' parents apologized again last week for their sons'
actions. Their whereabouts Thursday were not clear.
</P>
<P>
   As a lone bagpiper played ''Amazing Grace,'' the governor and
his wife planted columbines, the state flower that gave the school
its name, beneath a flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, families and friends of slain students Rachel
Scott, Corey DePooter and teacher Dave Sanders embraced and wept
during a memorial at the cemetery where all three are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today can be a new beginning, not just for our community but
for our nation,'' pastor Billy Epperhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A fishing vest and lures adorned the grave of DePooter, who
loved fly fishing. Behind the grave markers stood 13 wooden crosses
to honor the victims. An angel windsock hung from Scott's cross,
blowing gently in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   When the service was over, 13 white balloons drifted into the
sky as a symbol of letting go. For several minutes, DePooter's
mother, Patricia, refused to leave her son's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard just remembering it, the good times, and then
remembering how it all ended,'' said Cherry Creek High student Sam
Mamtherne, 17, who was friends with Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine senior Richard Castaldo, left a paraplegic in the
shootings, also struggled to make sense of the events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've spent the last couple of days trying to find the right
words. I can't really find them,'' a weeping Castaldo told about
1,500 people at a Trinity Christian Center service.
</P>
<P>
   At Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, the family of victim Isaiah
Shoels was joined by Martin Luther King III in remembering the
18-year-old boy who dreamed of becoming a music executive and
talent scout like his father.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Michael Shoels knelt and kissed the grass
over his son's grave. ''He always said I kiss the ground you walk
on, so I owe it to him,'' Shoels said.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, hundreds of people marched with lighted candles
from nearby churches to attend a vigil at Clement Park next to
Columbine. John and Doreen Tomlin, parents of slain student John
Tomlin, carried a lighted torch and led a procession in their son's
gold Chevrolet pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's looking forward. The people who are following this truck,
a lot of them are teen-agers,'' John Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, 1,000 students, including alumni, and about 175 staff
members attended a private assembly inside the Columbine gymnasium
where a representative for each victim spoke. About 500 parents met
in the auditorium. Classes were canceled, and the building was
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there's a lot of crying and a lot of hugging, a lot
of solemn remembering,'' school district spokesman Rick Kaufman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good remembrance of people who were lost,'' sophomore
Angie Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   After the assembly, more than 3,000 students, teachers and
residents gathered in nearby Clement Park for a public observance.
Teacher Patti Nielson, who was wounded and was among the first to
call 911, shared memories of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this exact time one year ago, I was curled up in a cupboard
in a back room of the library,'' she said, adding that to her the
anniversary marks the day ''I let go of the anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wandell of Adrian, Mich., who watched along with her
17-year-old daughter as 13 crosses were erected in Clement Park,
said Klebold and Harris should have been remembered as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we should also pray for the other two,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary remembrance comes amid new accusations in
lawsuits filed this week by victims' relatives, who are accusing
the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department of mishandling the
shootings. One lawsuit contends a sharpshooter had the opportunity
to kill Klebold but was denied permission to fire; the other
contends one victim was killed by police.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the pain of Columbine would never be erased.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Columbine will be with us forever just as the Oklahoma
City bombing,'' Owens said.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Pa. Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- A woman fleeing her estranged
boyfriend made a frantic cell phone call to a 911 dispatcher
Thursday before her car was pushed into the path of a freight train
by the car chasing her. The woman was killed, along with another
woman and two children in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we have a good idea who is responsible for this
tragedy, and we're pursuing that person now,'' state police Cpl.
Bruce Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not immediately identify the man, who fled the scene
in his car.
</P>
<P>
   The crash followed a chase in and around town that lasted for
about half an hour and reached speeds up to 90 mph, police said.
Sinking Spring, a town of about 2,400 people, is 50 miles northwest
of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's car went around a car that was parked at the
crossing -- the gates were down because of the oncoming train -- and
pulled up to cross the tracks but stopped, state police Lt. Ed
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second vehicle came up behind her and struck her in the
rear. The second vehicle then pushed the first vehicle onto the
tracks,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the woman had called 911 while stopped at the
railroad crossing and was talking to the dispatcher when her car
was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The freight train was going about 40 mph at the time of the
collision, Edwards said. He said the engineer applied the brakes
but was unable to stop in time. The woman's car was dragged nearly
60 feet before coming to a rest, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-year-old girl at the scene said she was playing nearby when
she saw the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard this screech of the train trying to stop,'' said
witness Racheal Kohl. She said she saw the car ''twirling and
twirling'' and the four people were thrown from it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women and one of the children died at the scene; the
other woman and child were airlifted to a hospital but later died.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the fleeing woman as Candace Wertz, 20, of
Sinking Spring and said her 2-year-old son, John Michael Cortez,
was killed. The other child was a 6-year-old girl, police said. Her
name and the other woman's name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a car matching the description of the estranged
boyfriend's car was found Thursday night in Reading, about five
miles away. He was still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Several roads remained closed Thursday evening near the scene of
the wreck, and traffic was being redirected. Dozens of police
officers and fire officials remained on the scene late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 14, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Eli Marrero hit a grand slam and later combined
with pitcher Rick Ankiel for back-to-back home runs Thursday night
as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the San Diego Padres 14-1 to
complete a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel (2-1) worked around seven walks in a five-inning
scoreless outing. He also went 3-for-3 -- the rookie pitcher is
5-for-9 with a triple and two RBIs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Marrero capped a six-run first with his first career grand slam.
He and Ankiel hit consecutive homers off reliever Vicente Palacios
in the fifth as the Cardinals continue to pace the majors in run
production.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is averaging eight runs per game after topping their
previous high of 13 runs, have homered in 12 straight games and
lead the majors with 39 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis had four RBIs, two of them coming on bases-loaded
walks, and Ray Lankford broke out of a 1-for-26 slump with two hits
and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire returned to the lineup after missing seven games
with back problems and was 0-for-2 with two walks and two runs
scored, leaving for a pinch-runner in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Not many Padres made contact against Ankiel, at 20 the
second-youngest pitcher in the majors, who also had four
strikeouts. He walked the bases loaded in the first and got out of
it by striking out Ed Sprague and getting Bret Boone to foul out.
He walked two more in the fifth and again escaped a bases-loaded
jam by getting Sprague to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning lasted 41 minutes as Ankiel threw 36 pitches
and Padres starter Brian Boehringer (0-3) threw 44, including four
consecutive walks. Lankford and Tatis both walked with the bases
loaded and Marrero, making only his fourth start, hit his grand
slam on a 1-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have hit 30 homers during their 12-game streak,
which is five games shy of the team record set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Padres cleanup hitter Phil Nevin and manager Bruce Bochy were
ejected in the middle of the third disputing a called third strike.
On his way off the field, Nevin threw his glove and hat in the air
and made a gesture in Young's direction with his arm, then took off
his jersey and dropped it in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Young was the first base umpire on Eric Davis' controversial
two-run bases-loaded infield hit on Wednesday night, ruling him
safe when replays indicated Davis was out by a half-step.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals have had back-to-back homers seven times
already. They did it only four times last season. The NL record is
15 by the 1997 Colorado Rockies. ... Cardinals manager Tony La
Russa, who twice insisted that Davis was safe Wednesday, admitted
Thursday he hadn't seen the replay until later and had been taking
the word of a Cardinals player or coach. ... Palacios made his
first major league appearance since 1995 when he pitched for the
Cardinals. He allowed six runs, four of them earned, in 1 2-3
innings. He was called up Thursday when the Padres demoted C Ben
Davis, who was 1-for-16. ... The Cardinals are 10-2 the last two
seasons against the Padres, although the first two victories in
this series were by one run. ... The Padres' run came on a
groundout by Chris Gomez in the sixth.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
Friday morning on selling of shares in companies to be replaced in
that index. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The index, which was up some 300 points earlier in the session,
reversed into negative territory to shed 91.51 points, or 0.48
percent, to 18,867.81 points at the end of the morning session.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the average closed down 127.30 points, or 0.67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.76 yen in late morning, up 1.01 yen from
late Thursday and also above its late New York level of 105.73 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo stock market, prices started higher as investors
were cheered by the Dow's 169.09-point rise Thursday, leaving the
New York index at 10,844.05 at the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   But investors later began selling industrial stocks which will
be removed from the Nikkei index's stocks starting April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the index's stocks will be replaced to better reflect
changes in Japan's economy, the Nihon Keizai newspaper, a major
Japanese financial daily and the administrator of the index, said
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of stocks from the index tends to lower their prestige
and makes them less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 21.41 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,650.41
points. The TOPIX closed up 9.18 points, or 0.56 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was supported after a top
government official said Japan will maintain its policy of
near-zero interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Japan's Parliament, Bank of Japan Governor
Masaru Hayami said Thursday that the central bank will keep its
current policy until deflation concerns have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.36 yen, up from
98.30 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7350 percent in late morning, unchanged from Thursday's
finish. Its price remained 101.42.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 3, Pirates 2, 14 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Danny Bautista hustled for a leadoff double in the
14th inning, then made a headfirst slide home on Mike Lowell's
shallow sacrifice fly to give the Florida Marlins a 3-2 win over
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista, who struck out with the bases loaded to end the 11th,
doubled off the glove of shortstop Pat Meares and took third on a
sacrifice by Alex Gonzalez. Mark Kotsay was intentionally walked
and moved up on defensive indifference, and Preston Wilson walked.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell followed with a short fly to center fielder Bruce Aven.
Bautista tagged and barely beat the two-hop throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Darensbourg (1-0) pitched a scoreless 14th inning to earn
the win. Mike Williams (0-1) took the loss in a game that lasted
four hours, 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Florida used all of its position players and was forced to use
pitcher Alex Fernandez as a pinch-hitter in the 13th with runners
on first and second and two outs. Jason Christiansen struck out
Fernandez looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins loaded the bases with one out in the 11th, but Brad
Clontz retired Kevin Millar on a short liner to center and struck
out Bautista.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had runners at second base in the 12th, 13th and 14th
innings but could not score.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Jimmy Anderson and Ryan Dempster both settled down
after allowing early runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored twice in the first off Dempster. Jason
Kendall led off with a single, Meares doubled and Brian Giles had
an RBI groundout. Kevin Young followed with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell singled and scored on Mike Redmond's two-out infield
single in the Marlins second. In the third, Alex Gonzalez walked
and scored on Preston Wilson's two-out single, tying it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but
reliever Dan Miceli retired Young on a popup.
Notes: Pittsburgh reliever Mike Garcia, called up from Triple-A
Nashville, had an impressive debut, striking out the side in the
seventh. ... Pirates relievers struck out 14 after Anderson left
following the sixth. ... With the win, the Marlins tied their best
start in franchise history with a 10-7 mark achieved by the 1997
World Series championship team. Last year the Marlins did not win
their 10th game until May 14.

<HEADLINE> Starting date for the EPIC expansion seems to have changed  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- What advocates had presumed to be an Oct. 1
starting date for an expansion of the state's prescription drug
program for senior citizens could now be delayed for months,
legislative sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and Gov. George Pataki had initially talked about the
Oct. 1 date when reaching a deal to expand eligibility under the
Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC) program, but aides
acknowledged Thursday that the start-up date may change.
</P>
<P>
   ''All kinds of details relating to EPIC are under discussion,
and discussions are ongoing,'' Pataki spokesman Charles Deister
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Burgess, executive director of the New York StateWide
Senior Action Council, said he was told by top legislative aides
that a starting date of Jan. 1, 2001 is under serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, eligible senior citizens would have to wait
longer before they can get reimbursed for prescription drug
payments, Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can see no reason why -- other than fiscal and political
reasons -- for doing this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To receive reimbursements under EPIC, senior citizens would
first have to pay a deductible, starting at $530 for a single
person with an annual income of $20,001. So if an individual with
that income spends about $200 dollars a month on drugs, it would
take three months before the first reimbursement check comes in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to expand EPIC, to be included in the 2000-01
state budget, is designed to increase the number of participants in
the program from the current 115,000 to an estimated 215,000 within
three years. The expansion will also cost the state an extra $180
million when fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing forward the effective date for an expansion of the
program would likely save the state millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hansen, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno, said that while Oct. 1 had been discussed, ''the effective
date has not been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's office would not confirm the
possible starting date delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't comment on it,'' spokesman Charles Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in both chambers have begun their traditional
Passover-Easter holiday and will not be back in session until
Monday, May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised EPIC program, annual income limits for
eligibility under EPIC will be expanded from $18,500 to $35,000 for
senior citizens living alone and from $24,400 to $50,000 for
married couples. Copays and fees charged seniors to enroll in EPIC
will also be reduced, and the complicated rules of the program will
be simplified.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers must be 65 or older to qualify for EPIC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state Sen. John Marchi said he is introducing a bill
to create an interstate compact to monitor prescription drug
prices. The bill would establish a commission composed of attorneys
general from compact states and make it a felony to charge a higher
price for drugs to any compact state than that sold to anyone
outside the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, said such a commission is
necessary to the combat the high prices for prescription drug sold
in the United States. U.S. prices sometimes run as high as two and
a half times as much as their Canadian counterparts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The compact would take effect when it becomes law in at least
two states. It would apply to New York seniors not covered under
EPIC.

<HEADLINE> A first: A judge now heads the state's judicial watchdog panel  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Odd as it may seem, an actual judge has
become chairman of the state's judicial watchdog commission for the
first time in its 25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Salisbury, a prominent Buffalo lawyer specializing in
labor issues, has also been village justice in Blasdell, in Erie
County, since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   His elevation to the chairmanship of the 11-member Commission on
Judicial Conduct came in his 12th year on the panel, a long tenure
for judges who are appointed to the commission. Usually, sitting
judges serve for one four-year term and then step down from the
commission due to the assumption of other judicial posts or other
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Salisbury has stuck around long enough to win the
chairmanship in an election by members of the commission. He
replaces Henry Berger, a New York City election lawyer who will
retain his seat on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the commission are not paid but they do get expenses
when on official business.
</P>
<P>
   Appointments are made to the panel by governors, legislative
leaders and, in Salisbury's case, the chief judge of the state
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is not without controversy, both within and
outside the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Judges preside over matters of often great import to people's
lives, be they a stiff fine for speeding in a traffic case or, for
superior-court judges, criminal cases where a defendant's liberty
for many years or even life is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   As such, their work is constantly being criticized.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, the commission has received more than
25,000 complaints about judges in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury termed the bulk of the 1,400 cases the commission
looks into each year ''one-time accidental conduct'' which does not
result in the formal punishment of judges.
</P>
<P>
   But when the commission finds recurring, serious misconduct it
holds formal hearings and has the power to admonish or censure
judges -- two forms of public rebuke -- or to recommend their removal
from the bench. Once ousted, a judge can never hold judicial office
in the state again.
</P>
<P>
   In its history, the commission has deemed 131 judges unworthy of
serving on the bench any longer. Of those, 28 have been removed
from county courts or higher judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   It has also admonished 162 judges, censured 191 judges and 299
others resigned while the commission was looking into the
misconduct charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the commission focuses on misbehavior by prominent
jurists. It was in the news earlier this month when the state's
highest court upheld its recommendation to remove Onondaga County
Court Judge J. Kevin Mulroy -- one of central New York's most
prominent judges -- for making insensitive remarks about blacks and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Far more of the judges the commission punishes sit on lower
courts, and Salisbury acknowledged that the panel still receives
criticism for ''going after'' the state's 4,300 town and village
court judges and not scrutinizing higher-court jurists more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, town and village judges are not lawyers and they
are sometimes elected to their posts with only rudimentary
knowledge of courts and law. The state mandates that they undergo
training on legal procedure, proper handling of fines and other
aspects of being a judge.
</P>
<P>
   New York also requires judges at all levels to take three hours
of ethics training each year. Salisbury is one of the instructors
in the special classes for judges offered by the state Office of
Court Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said the extra training has ''gone a long way'' to instilling
ethics and knowledge in judges.
</P>
<P>
   But Salisbury said the pedigree of a judge or the loftiness of
his or her bench is not a factor when the commission looks into
misconduct charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a case, it is assigned a case number, and obviously we
know who it (the alleged wrongdoer) is,'' he said. ''But it
(judicial office) doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury and others associated with the Commission on Judicial
Conduct say they take the result of appeals of commission
determinations before the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals, as confirmation of the soundness of their rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The high court has upheld 55 of the 68 recommendations it has
been asked to hear on appeal. Of the others, the recommended
punishment was reduced in nine of the cases and, twice, censure was
increased to removal.

<HEADLINE> S.Dakota Jury Awards $268.7M in Case  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE ORTMAN, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- A jury Thursday night awarded $268.7
million in the first test of a state law allowing drug dealers to
be held liable for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledged that the defendant, Wayne Clarence
Johnson, has little money, but attorneys for Jean Muhs asked the
jury to send a message that people must be responsible for their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Muhs, 71, was severely injured in a 1998 traffic accident near
Canton that killed her husband, Floyd Muhs.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit says Johnson provided methamphetamine that the other
driver, Daniel Bolls, used shortly before the accident. Bolls
veered into the opposite lane and struck a van driven by Jean Muhs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not been charged. He was on the witness stand only
briefly after the judge raised the issue of whether his testimony
could be self-incriminating.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Muhs $6.6 million for her medical expenses,
nursing home care, pain, suffering and other losses; $12 million to
the Floyd Muhs estate for similar losses and $250 million in
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Lias called no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a good job of presenting their case and obviously my
client will not be pleased with the outcome,'' Lias said. ''We'll
be reviewing our options.''
</P>
<P>
   They include asking the judge to modify the judgment or filing
an appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the state's drug dealer liability law has
been used, and most attorneys don't know it exists, Muhs' attorney,
Mark Meierhenry, told the jury in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a new concept in the war on drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Lias asked the jury to put aside
emotion and to be fair and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Muhs testified that she doesn't expect to collect any money.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has no money. I'm sure he doesn't unless he hits the
lottery,'' she said. ''But someone has to be responsible, someone
has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolls is charged with manslaughter and vehicular homicide for
the accident, but he disappeared before trial and is a fugitive. A
passenger in his car, Carrie Walker, was convicted of manslaughter
and vehicular battery and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Bolls were romantically involved and were fighting
over the steering wheel when Bolls jerked it into the path of the
Muhs' vehicle, another Muhs' attorney, Clint Sargent, told the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said in a deposition that Johnson gave her a packet of
methamphetamine and she turned it over to Bolls, who injected it in
his arm on the day of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Curtis Blasy of the Highway Patrol said blood and urine
tests on Bolls and Walker showed both had methamphetamine in their
systems.
