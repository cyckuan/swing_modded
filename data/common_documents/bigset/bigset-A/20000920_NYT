BRAVES CRUSH METS, 12-4 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets are running out of ways to explain
their futility against the Atlanta Braves. After Tuesday night,
they cannot even say that the ball did not bounce their way. This
time, it did. And still, nothing changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Rafael Furcal smashed a grounder up the
middle that deflected off the shoe of the Mets starter Glendon
Rusch. It dribbled directly to second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, who
flipped to second for a forceout. The Braves already had three runs
that inning, but maybe that break was what the Mets needed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not. The Mets need more than one freakish play to change
their fortunes against the Braves, a very good team that always
makes them look terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The next five Atlanta batters reached base after the lucky
bounce. When the onslaught finally stopped, the Braves had scored
seven runs _ their best inning of the season and the Mets' worst.
The Braves went on to win, 12-4, for their second victory in two
games this series and their 20th in their last 22 games against the
Mets at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Braves widened their lead in the National
League East to five games over the Mets with 11 to play. Any
combination of seven Braves victories and Mets losses will clinch
Atlanta's ninth consecutive division title.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' sights are turning to the wild-card race. They led the
Arizona Diamondbacks by five games before Tuesday; the Diamondbacks
played the Dodgers in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said he knew the final score of
Arizona's game Monday before going to bed, and the Mets will
probably continue to monitor that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so many games left and only so many teams in this
thing,'' Valentine said before the game. ``We don't have to figure
out what Atlanta's doing because we're playing against them, and I
think there's only one other team that affects us directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine then spoke confidently, if indirectly, of making the
playoffs by mentioning the first-place St. Louis Cardinals and the
San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also look at St. Louis and San Francisco and will continue
to do that,'' he said, ``because I think these are all teams that
will be part of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown, of course, is what kind of future the Mets
will have if and when they reach the postseason. The offensive
blackout that plagued them in early September seems to have
returned; before scoring in the fifth inning on Tuesday night, the
Mets had failed to score in 22 of their previous 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (11-12) mastered them this time, allowing one
unearned run, five hits and a walk over seven innings. Ashby shut
out the Mets in July. Rusch (10-11), who was pounded by the Braves
in July, also held form.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old left-hander probably never saw it coming,
especially after striking out the first two hitters in a scoreless
first. He lasted only an inning and two-thirds, his shortest start
of the year. After five strong outings in a row, Rusch could do
nothing right.
</P>
<P>
   He missed badly with his curveball, bouncing it or leaving it
high in the strike zone, where it was crushed. He left a pitch up
for Andres Galarraga, the leadoff batter in the second, and it went
for a long double. Javy Lopez followed with a shot to right-center,
and with Derek Bell, who has a bruised knee, giving chase, Lopez
had his first triple this year.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1-0 Braves and about to get worse for the Mets. Reggie
Sanders doubled into the left-field corner, scoring Lopez. Sanders
stole third, and with one out and the infield in, a bouncer by
Ashby deflected off third baseman Robin Ventura's knee.
</P>
<P>
   It was an error, and the Braves led, 3-0. That is when the Mets'
luck seemed to turn, when the sure single by Furcal turned into the
second out. But a wild pitch moved Furcal to second, Rusch walked
Andruw Jones and Furcal stole third.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had the momentum back, and the luck. Chipper Jones
blooped one into center for a run-scoring single, and Pat Mahomes
relieved Rusch.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan walked to load the bases. Galarraga walked, forcing
in the Braves' fifth run. Lopez singled in two, pushing the Braves'
lead to &QC; 7-0 and giving them their highest-scoring inning this
season. The seven runs represented the most the Mets have
surrendered in one inning this year.

 ENROLLMENT DOWN AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hot job market and an impossibly tight housing supply have
driven enrollment down dramatically at the California State
University system's campuses in the Bay Area and beyond for the
first time in years, university administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses were caught off guard this fall as hundreds of students
opted for work over classes or stayed home because they could not
find housing near schools.
</P>
<P>
   With a surge in students projected to enter colleges this
decade, the public universities expected to be bulging at the
seams. But while enrollment at Southern California campuses grew,
California State University campuses from San Francisco to San Jose
and Monterey lost students who had been expected to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of it is surprising us,'' said Lee Dorosz, interim
associate vice president of curriculum and assessment at the
27,500-student San Jose State University, which is down about 500
to 600 students from last year. ``They are simply working and
hauling in the money while they can. The Silicon Valley is so
hungry for workers that they don't even have to have degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the campus did see a boost in its freshman class, but
many seniors did not return. A survey of the missing students found
the majority putting off their education and going to work.
</P>
<P>
   At CSU Monterey Bay, officials expected 1,624 returning students
and got only 1,593.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Romagnoli, 41, was among the missing. He planned to go
back this fall to complete his senior year in communication,
science and technology, but then, IBEAM Broadcasting, an Internet
startup in Sunnyvale, offered him a salary _ plus stock options.
With a wife and two children to support, he couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   Romagnoli, formerly a restaurant worker, hoped a degree would
get him a job in the technology field. The work happened sooner
than he thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully intend at some point in my life to finish my degree.
But at this point it was too good of a deal to turn down,'' said
Romagnoli, who took a job as a sales engineer. ``This is a time in
our economy that we will probably never see again.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ENROLLME (85003 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The tale is the same at CSU Hayward, where classes have not
started yet, but projections put full-time-equivalent enrollment at
10,629, at least 1 percent behind last year. At San Francisco State
University, where about 27,600 students started classes last month,
the head count was about 100 fewer than last year and fell about
600 short of growth projections.
</P>
<P>
   It is mostly upper-division transfer and graduate students who
are not returning, administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting offers of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 for a
job. They are opting to do that now because they can always go back
to school, or their employers will pay for them to go back to
school,'' said Leroy Morishita, San Francisco State's associate
vice president for budget planning and resource management.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California campuses are growing rather than
shrinking, but they serve students right out of high school, while
the average CSU student is about 26 years old. Many CSU students
work or raise families while going to school.
</P>
<P>
   The housing shortage, too, has been a factor in the equation in
Northern California. Rents are astronomical, when a place can even
be found. Many students just gave up and stayed home this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly hard hit was San Francisco State, where two
residence halls that served 640 students were closed after toxic
mold was found growing in the walls. Then, the construction on a
new 760-student apartment building fell behind schedule. Expected
to open last month, it will not be completed before midsemester.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of housing around us has skyrocketed,'' Morishita
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Michael Austin, 21, has lived in campus dormitories or
apartments for the past three years, but he found himself with no
housing this year. He returned to classes, but it has not been
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to hop around to different relatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waking up 20 minutes before class, he has to commute
from the East Bay. Now he has to allow more than two hours before a
class. He copes by studying and eating his breakfast _ Rice
Krispies with milk _ on BART.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ENROLLME (85003 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But he considers himself lucky. One friend had to sleep in his
car for a few nights and is now staying with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected enrollment drop has some students _ particularly
at San Francisco State _ concerned that it has led to the
cancellation of classes. But campus officials insist there is no
connection.
</P>
<P>
   CSU spokesman Ken Swisher said the system's chancellor could
consider adjusting a campus' budget if its enrollment continued to
drop, but it would have to dip more than 2 percent below
projections for several years running.
</P>
<P>
   While some upper-division classes are being canceled at San
Francisco State, administrators say it is part of a plan already
under way to eliminate underenrolled classes and create more room
in lower-division core courses.
</P>
<P>
   The campus has added 713 spots in various high-demand general
education courses, from English composition to critical thinking,
and plans to make room for at least 750 more next semester, said
Jerald Combs, San Francisco State's dean of undergraduate studies
pro tem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a chronic problem over the past few years of
students unable to get the basic courses they needed to graduate,''
he said. ``We have been shifting some of our resources. That
declining enrollment should help us a bit.''

VOUCHERS WILL COST STUDENTS BOTH FUNDING AND STANDING, REPORT 
 SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By NANETTE ASIMOV 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  California stands to lose at least $2.6 billion _ and gain
little academically _ if voters pass the school voucher measure on
the state ballot in November, a team of nonpartisan researchers is
warning
<P>
   Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 38 is intended to give fed-up public school parents
a $4,000 voucher toward private or religious school tuition,
courtesy of the California taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, it is unlikely that enough students could leave
the public school system in order for the state to break even on
the cost of the voucher program, say the researchers from Policy
Analysis for California Education, a group of the University of
California at Berkeley and Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   California spends $6,700 per pupil in the public system. Money
available for public education would be depleted under the voucher
system, but only up to a certain point. If enough students left the
public system for private school, the state could actually make
money.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers say there is nowhere for the public school
students to go. More than twice as many private school seats would
be needed for the state to simply break even on the cost of such a
program, say the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposition 38, given its high price tag and unknown impact on
children, is like joining a high-stakes poker game in which you can
only look at half your cards,'' said UC Berkeley professor Bruce
Fuller, a co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher supporters agree that doubling the number of private
school seats would be necessary to avoid losing money _ but say it
would be easy to do, said spokesman Chris Bertelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with several inner-city pastors in San Diego,''
Bertelli said. ``They told us that if vouchers pass, their churches
will become schools during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli said he also knows of a builder in Orange County who is
eager to construct 10 private schools if the measure passes.
</P>
<P>
   But creating enough private classrooms _ and filling them with
teachers good enough to make them better than public schools _
would be nearly impossible, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, California would need enough private school seats
for 1.5 million children, the authors say.  &LR;   &LR;  Currently, there
about 672,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about 6 million children go to California public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $4,000 would be nowhere near enough of an incentive to
expand the number of (private) schools or make capital
improvements,'' said Luis Huerta, a co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Their 15-page analysis slams the measure on several other
fronts:
</P>
<P>
   --The voter-approved guarantee that at least 40 percent of the
general fund go to public education could die, along with funding
protections for programs for child-care, preschool and special
education.
</P>
<P>
   --Vouchers would subsidize the tuitions of affluent children as
well as those of low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   --Low-income children who use vouchers could still not afford to
attend elite schools of proven quality, where tuitions can soar
well above $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   --If the economy dives, the state would still be required to pay
the full cost of the voucher, which rises with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (measure) does not expand choice to more families,'' said
Huerta. ``It's essentially tax relief for the well-off.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the other authors said the story of charter schools in
California illustrates just how hard it has been to provide enough
seats for students who want non-traditional schooling. Charters are
public schools that are independently run by parents or other
groups that want to start them.
</P>
<P>
   Charters have been legal in California since the early 1990s,
yet only 261 charter schools have been created so far, Huerta said,
far from the legal limit of 350. The biggest impediment to charters
has been finding places to put them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important in the debate over vouchers, however, is
whether they can really rescue kids from a rotten education. The
researchers looked at results of an array of small voucher programs
in some cities across the country. Most are privately funded, but
two, in Milwaukee and Cleveland, are funded publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Did achievement rise after public school students entered
private and religious schools?
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer is yes,'' said the researchers, who looked at
the work of other analysts around the country to draw their
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But they cautioned that the available studies had problems that
made the data not fully reliable: large numbers of children
dropping out before a study was completed, or a failure to control
for family background characteristics, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the city, academic subject, and ethnicity of the
children, test scores rose, fell or leveled off. No finding was
consistent. Some of the strongest gains were seen by African
American elementary children in math.
</P>
<P>
   The California researchers concluded that ``small-scale voucher
programs in Dayton, Milwaukee, New York City and Washington, D.C.
have significantly boosted the math achievement of black children
in recent years. These learning gains ... are similar in magnitude
to the positive results observed as state-led reform programs have
begun to work, including the rising Stanford 9 (achievement) test
scores of California's elementary school children.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers said, ``gains displayed by black
children are most distinct during their first year in a private
school; then the achievement advantage, relative to their peers in
public school, levels off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli of the Yes on 38 campaign objected to the tone of the
new analysis, saying that credit should be given where it's due.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students showed improvement over where they were when they
were taught in public school,'' he said. ``So it's not right to say
that's not relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the new report, 59 percent of all black respondents
and 52 percent of Latinos polled by National Public Radio last year
support the idea of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In California, however, recent polls show the measure trailing.
Last month, the Field Poll found that 49 percent of those surveyed
opposed the voucher measure, while 36 percent favored it. The rest
were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the worrisome news, Tim Draper, the Redwood City
venture capitalist who authored Proposition 38, has begun offering
free computers, Hawaiian vacations and department store shopping
sprees to lucky supporters, with extra chances at winning for those
who round up more supporters.

 $4.4 BILLION ANNUAL U.S. QUAKE LOSSES FORECAST  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earthquake damage losses across the United States could run to
billions of dollars a year _ and California would suffer most of
the losses by far, federal and state seismic hazard experts
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Using estimates of quake risks, population totals and building
densities for every state, city and region in the country, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released a detailed
report saying earthquake losses for the entire country would add up
to about $4.4 billion a year over the indefinite future.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new report from the California Department of
Conservation estimated that the average annual cost of quake damage
to buildings alone in the state could total $3.9 billion during the
next few decades and reach a staggering $4.7 billion a year _ more
than the federal estimate for the entire country _ if ``losses to
contents, inventory and income'' are counted in.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the federal nor the state report tried to assess a
dollar cost for injuries or deaths caused by the quakes.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies will be presented today in Seattle at a national
conference on earthquake risk management sponsored by FEMA, the
federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   In California during the past 30 years, property damage from
quakes has totaled as much as $56 billion, the state report said,
and the magnitude 7 Northridge disaster accounted for most of that.
The Loma Prieta temblor of 1989, also with a magnitude of 7, caused
$8 billion in damage even though its epicenter was in a remote area
of the Santa Cruz mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of smaller earthquakes strike with lesser damage
throughout California each year, and as population in quake-prone
cities and towns continues to mount, the likelihood of future huge
costs rises, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating an ``annual'' cost for quakes anywhere in the
country is a tricky business. It is based on a complex federal
computer program created by the U.S. Geological Survey that links
America's history of earthquakes to probability estimates of future
quake risks _ high or low _ for 150,000 point locations in every
part of the country, plus population growth rates and building
densities everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of QUAKES20 (2713 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The study is the first nationwide estimate of earthquake risks
and costs, and it is designed to provide fresh information for city
planners, building code designers, and other policy makers trying
minimize future damage in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Principal author of the federal seismic risk study is Stuart P.
Nishenko, a FEMA seismologist and former Geological Survey
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our best attempt to give a balanced picture of earthquake
risks everywhere,'' Nishenko said in a phone interview from Seattle
last night, ``and although earthquakes may be infrequent, they pack
a much bigger punch than floods or hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, and in regions far from California, annual losses
from floods have totaled $5.2 billion between 1989 and 1998, while
annual losses from hurricanes in the same decade reached $5.4
billion, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although people in most areas of the country besides California
and the Pacific Northwest have never experienced an earthquake of
any size, they are far from unknown. For example, a series of
monster quakes struck along the New Madrid fault in Missouri in
1811 and 1812; they were felt as far north as Boston, and the cost
today in cities like St. Louis or Memphis would be incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Boston itself could be devastated if it suffered another
damaging quake like the big one that struck on nearby Cape Ann in
1775. In 1886, a quake near Charleston, S.C. killed 60 people and
damaged most of the buildings in the city. If it happened today,
the cost to the entire area would be huge.
</P>
<P>
   And on the West Coast, evidence today shows that a monster quake
in 1700 ruptured 500 miles of the ground from Puget Sound south and
sent a huge tsunami that flooded coastal Japan. If it happened
again today, the toll of lives and damage would send both nations
into mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake histories like those _ rare as they seem _ have been
fed along with hundreds of smaller ones into FEMA's new computer
program called HAZUS, for Hazard U.S., and experts at both the
federal and state agencies will be refining their calculations for
future cost projections.

   &LR; COL. 1 of QUAKES20 (2713 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The study is the first nationwide estimate of earthquake risks
and costs, and it is designed to provide fresh information for city
planners, building code designers, and other policy makers trying
minimize future damage in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Principal author of the federal seismic risk study is Stuart P.
Nishenko, a FEMA seismologist and former Geological Survey
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our best attempt to give a balanced picture of earthquake
risks everywhere,'' Nishenko said in a phone interview from Seattle
last night, ``and although earthquakes may be infrequent, they pack
a much bigger punch than floods or hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, and in regions far from California, annual losses
from floods have totaled $5.2 billion between 1989 and 1998, while
annual losses from hurricanes in the same decade reached $5.4
billion, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although people in most areas of the country besides California
and the Pacific Northwest have never experienced an earthquake of
any size, they are far from unknown. For example, a series of
monster quakes struck along the New Madrid fault in Missouri in
1811 and 1812; they were felt as far north as Boston, and the cost
today in cities like St. Louis or Memphis would be incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Boston itself could be devastated if it suffered another
damaging quake like the big one that struck on nearby Cape Ann in
1775. In 1886, a quake near Charleston, S.C. killed 60 people and
damaged most of the buildings in the city. If it happened today,
the cost to the entire area would be huge.
</P>
<P>
   And on the West Coast, evidence today shows that a monster quake
in 1700 ruptured 500 miles of the ground from Puget Sound south and
sent a huge tsunami that flooded coastal Japan. If it happened
again today, the toll of lives and damage would send both nations
into mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake histories like those _ rare as they seem _ have been
fed along with hundreds of smaller ones into FEMA's new computer
program called HAZUS, for Hazard U.S., and experts at both the
federal and state agencies will be refining their calculations for
future cost projections.

CITY OF LOVE TURNS HOT, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ah, San Francisco is lovely in the late morning
when the earth-toned smog rolls gently across Twin Peaks, and the
valleys ring with the coughs of squirrels and raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   We work so hard to pollute our air. It's good when the results
are tangible.
</P>
<P>
   What poet said the smog creeps into little cats' lungs?
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave brings good news and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Some bad news: Muni buses ride on Firestone tires, which have
been known to shred spontaneously under hot-road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Muni spokesperson Maggie Lynch informs me that Muni has been
on the case from the beginning. When the Firestone problem
surfaced, Muni checked the fleet. Says Lynch, ``We don't have any
of the problem tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, here's tip to Muni riders: Since low tire pressure can
contribute to blowouts, always carry a tire-pressure gauge. When
the bus stops for you, ask the driver to wait a few minutes while
you check the pressure in all the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, and your fellow riders, will applaud your
citizenship!
</P>
<P>
   (But don't try this on the Metro.)
</P>
<P>
   SWEAT SHOP: ``Hey,'' snap the sweaty tourists, ``isn't this
supposed to be the Air-Conditioned City?''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, folks, we can't run the air conditioner when it gets this
hot. Eats too much power, which we need to ice down our lattes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want air conditioning, do what I did Tuesday morning: Hop
on an outbound N Judah. My car was so cold that I was expecting
Rocky Balboa to leap aboard and start gut-punching the standees.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there were only a few of us on the car. We pooled our
change and ran into a 7-Eleven to score a can of Sterno.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEAT is so hot that it seems to be mutating names.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Heller was watching the 5 p.m. KRON news Monday. The lead
story was the heat, and the reporter interviewed a woman named
Summer Swelter. Sounds sultry.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, bless its heart, is trying to put us all into a winter
frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulhern of P.J. Mulhern's restaurant was at the Stonestown
Macy's on Monday for the traditional kickoff of the Christmas
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put up their Christmas trees,'' Bob reports, ``right next
to the Halloween display that has been up for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   This confuses some people, who go trick-or-treating as Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   I love Macy's, because I hate it when Christmas sneaks up on me.
</P>
<P>
   WAS IT THE HEAT, or the rentals shortage? Or art?
</P>
<P>
   Reader Michi was walking across the USF campus last Friday and
saw two women hanging red single-bed frames in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Wait 'til Willie's builder buddies hear about this. Thousands of
trees in the city will be converted to live-work lofts.
</P>
<P>
   DA HOTTEST new team in town is the Demons, San Francisco's entry
in the new Xtreme Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Like the NFL isn't extreme enough, with a sign on the
training-room door: ``Six knee surgeons, no waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Demons will play in the Giants' new ballpark, Steve
Abney wonders if we can call it Pac Bell Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Steve also wonders if the Demons' will recruit Bobby Knight as
the team mascot. Bobby already has the little devil's horns, red
sweaters, and brimstone smoke coming out his ears.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know who the Demons' team psychiatrist is going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, you Demons, but the first time Barry Bonds gets a bad
bounce off a football divot in left field, you guys will be playing
your games on the lawn at South Park.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKET MAN Elton John played the Al Gore fund raiser last night
at the Atherton home of multiskrillionaire Joe Hyatt.
</P>
<P>
   No word at press time on what wild costume Elton showed up in.
My source Goggles Grogan speculated that the rocket rocker would
dress in a donkey suit, or in jeweled Buddhist-priest vestments.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who plays the big George W. Bush fund raisers.
Maybe Buck Owens and the Buckaroos.
</P>
<P>
   Dub the Shrub is getting drubbed in California, but you have to
figure he'll carry Buck's Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   SHARK SUITS, the new second-skin suits worn by all the Olympic
swimmers, are interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The TV guys said that it takes four people to help a swimmer
into one of those suits.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do if you go into Macy's to try one on? Do they
have a dressing-room pit crew?
</P>
<P>
   And while those suits look good on the super-buff Olympic men
and women, I worry that the shark suit will be mass-marketed and
fall into the hands of the 285-pound beach-towel potatoes. Remember
when that happened to Speedos?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the aesthetics, we could have another Firestone
problem on our hands.

JOHNSON WILL GET CHANCE TO DISCUSS HIS FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before the Los Angeles Dodgers announce anything
about the future of Davey Johnson, the veteran manager will get a
chance to speak to the people in the front office making the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will meet with managing general partner, CEO and
chairman Bob Daly after the season to discuss the situation. Though
a date for the meeting hasn't been set, it's expected to be within
a week of the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who have 10 games remaining, conclude the season
Oct. 1 in San Diego. But Daly isn't expected to attend either of
the final two games at Qualcomm Stadium so as to not feed the
speculative fire about Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made no determination on Davey's standing, and will not
do so until we sit down with him at the end of the season,''
Dodgers vice president Derrick Hall said. ``At that time, we plan
on having various open and honest discussions to get feelings from
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson opted not to talk about his future, but he has said he's
proud of some of the things that were accomplished this season,
particularly in developing the middle of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   And among the issues that figure to be discussed during the
season-ending meeting is the improvement the Dodgers made over
1999. They entered Tuesday with two more wins (79) this season than
a year ago and did it with their Nos. 4 and 5 starters a combined
10-25 _ with three of those wins coming in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare what happened this year to what happened last
year, I said before that we made progress,'' Johnson said. ``It's
somewhat clouded in that we had more injuries this year than last
year. . . . But I think all those factors are factors that have
been factored in. The bottom line is we're not close enough. We
need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield out, again: Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield was
out of the lineup for the third time in four days because of his
ailing back. Sheffield was examined by back specialist Dr. Jae
Chon, but X-rays were negative. Sheffield was diagnosed as having
lumbar strain, which should be corrected through an exercise
program.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield isn't expected to return until the weekend, which puts
a crimp in his pursuit of Duke Snider's franchise home run mark of
43. Sheffield seemed to be a cinch to break it, but injury and
illness has cost him 14 games in the last month and he has one home
run since Aug. 19 and stands at 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to shut it down and rehab my back and take a couple of
days and get my strength back,'' Sheffield said. ``They said if I
kept playing with it, I'd irritate it and make it something
serious.''

BLUE JAYS DEFEAT YANKEES, 16-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Derek Jeter was a rookie the first time he slapped his
glove against the chest of Joe Torre during pitching changes, a
silly and constructive tradition that usually extracts a small
smile from his manager. But not on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torre removed Andy Pettitte in the sixth inning of an
embarrassing 16-3 loss to Toronto, and when Jeter tagged Torre with
his glove, Torre's concrete-block expression never changed. He was
disappointed and angry, and probably already formulating the
pointed words he directed at the team after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bad,'' Torre said. ``It was just ugly _ really
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees embarrassed themselves with stunningly poor defense,
allowed 19 hits and the margin of defeat matched the largest of the
season for the defending World Series champions. They cannot pass
off this wipeout as an isolated instance, either; the Yankees have
been bingeing on one-sided defeats. In losing five of their last
six games, they have been outscored by 50-16.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the Yankees were on their way to a record
125 victories, they punctuated a brief September malaise with a
terrible performance against Tampa Bay, and Torre called a postgame
meeting _ something he rarely does _ and offered a blistering
tirade.
</P>
<P>
   He was more measured after Tuesday night's game, but direct,
insistent that his team begin to increase its level of energy.
``We've been a club that's pretty much taken the bull by the
horns,'' he said, ``and we need to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing terrible, and that's the bottom line,'' Jeter
said. ``We're not hitting, we're not pitching, we're not playing
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter speculated that perhaps the Yankees had begun to rely on
their large lead, on the assumption that they can count on making
the playoffs and use the remaining games on the schedule merely to
get healthy. Bernie Williams added, ``Any time you go out and lose
by that many runs, it's kind of like a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Torre had gotten a message from Toronto Manager
Jim Fregosi, who called to tell him that David Wells was scratched
from his start because of gout in his big toe. Wells might pitch
Thursday, but the right-hander Steve Trachsel was tabbed to start
in his place on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in the lineup, his first action against a
right-handed pitcher in two weeks. Pettitte seemed to have an
excellent chance for his 19th victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' defense undermined him. Chuck Knoblauch fielded
a grounder in the first inning, and first baseman Tino Martinez set
himself as he usually does when preparing for Knoblauch's throws _
feet set wide apart, arms at his sides, as if he is about to tackle
a heifer. Knoblauch tossed the ball right at Martinez's feet,
directly in front of him, and Martinez, caught in an awkward
position, dropped the ball for an error.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Carlos Delgado lifted a high fly to left, where
Luis Polonia drifted over for the ball, looking completely in
control, calm and confident right up to the moment that the pop
landed 20 feet from him for a hit. A run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked the leadoff batter in the third inning, and
Knoblauch hustled in to grab a chopper hit by Shannon Stewart, then
threw to first _ safe. Both runners scored on Dave Martinez's
two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were close, 3-2, because of homers by Glenallen Hill
and David Justice. But Pettitte allowed a double to Darrin Fletcher
to start the fifth inning, one of 6 hits in 12 at-bats by
left-handed batters against the Yankees' pitcher. Pettitte has
combated left-handers with a sharp breaking pitch this year, but he
did not have this on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher eventually scored on a groundout, and with a couple of
runners on base and two out, Delgado skipped an easy grounder
toward third. Scott Brosius flubbed the play, allowing another run
to score. Pettitte was knocked out in the sixth, having surrendered
seven runs (five earned) on eight hits and three walks, and he
failed to produce a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had reason to be perturbed by the time he relieved
Pettitte, with the score 6-2. What happened after that could only
have fueled his misery. Jason Grimsley threw a wild pitch to allow
the seventh Toronto run. Ted Lilly, one of the rookie left-handers
contending for a spot on the postseason roster, faced four batters
in the seventh and did not get an out, and Toronto built its lead
to 11-2 after seven.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Choate, another rookie left-hander, faced three batters
and could not get an out, and threw so poorly that Torre yanked him
even with the left-handed-hitter Brad Fullmer coming to bat. Craig
Dingman replaced Choate and the first four batters he faced hit
singles, extending the Toronto lead to 16-3.
</P>
<P>
   With a fan repeatedly yelling ``Mercy!'' from the stands behind
home plate, the Yankees finally escaped the inning and the game.
But they still had to hear from their manager. &QL;

SISTERS FIND EACH OTHER

<P>
   CANYON COUNTRY, Calif. _ The two sisters cried Tuesday as they
watched the video of their first meeting, tears of happiness mixed
with the sadness of knowing 40 years had passed before they met.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Rogers of Canyon Country, northwest of Los Angeles, and her
older sister, Twilight Paige, met for the first time Saturday when
Paige arrived at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The treasured videotape shows passengers on Paige's flight,
aware of the impending reunion, lining up inside the terminal to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Paige stepped off the plane, Rogers ran to her,
screaming, ``Oh, my gosh! It's her, it's her!'' while a stunned
Paige wrapped her arms around her newfound sister and shut her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the sisters sat in Rogers' home and talked of their
instant love for one another, their shared dream of spending the
second half of life together and the common ache to know why their
parents split two sisters born just a year apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was I put up for adoption and she was kept?'' asked
Rogers, 40. ``It's all pretty much water under the bridge now, but
the thing that gets me is why? We'll probably never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Rogers was adopted by a Los Angeles couple when
she was 2 days old. Her biological parents never brought her home
from the hospital to meet her big sister, now 41.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year, Rogers managed to track down Paige in
Oklahoma using her birth records and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Rogers and Paige led separate lives and had no idea
the other existed. Now they have discovered they had more in common
than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite conflicting personal images _ Rogers is matronly and
conservative while Paige's tattoos suggest a more adventuresome
lifestyle _ both are self-described ``neat freaks'' with willful
stubbornness and high-strung temperaments.
</P>
<P>
   They are also haunted by the same nagging question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was some kind of joke when she called and said
she thought she was my sister,'' said Paige, 41. ``But she knew
things about our mom and dad that no one else knew. I've been in
shock ever since. I still can't believe she's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have found each other, they say they want to spend
as much time together as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to talk to each other about anything,''
Rogers said. ``I can call her and say: I'm having a real bad day,
the kids are driving me crazy, and she'll understand. She's someone
I can just love and be close to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, geographic distance remains a problem. Rogers is firmly
rooted in Santa Clarita and devotes much of her time to her two
sons, Daniel, 9, and Chad, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Paige has purchased a mobile home on two acres near Noble,
Okla., and recently built a pool and deck in her back yard. She
said she wants to keep the property to provide financial security
for her 19-year-old daughter, Gypsy Rose Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me 41 years to get where I'm at and Ed McMahon
hasn't come to my door yet,'' Paige said. ``My daughter doesn't
understand this yet, but that property is her security. Everything
out here is very, very expensive, and way too commercialized and
crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rogers is urging her sister to move back to
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting any younger,'' she said. ``I'd like to have
her here for the holidays, and it would be nice to have someone to
do things with. We could go shopping together, go to the movies or
just go to lunch. I definitely would like to have her closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige is planning to return to Santa Clarita north of Los
Angeles in February to see her 73-year-old father for the first
time in more than 20 years. For Rogers, the meeting will be her
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   Though both say they would like to ask him why he and their
mother gave up Rogers for adoption, they also say it might be
pointless at this stage to raise painful questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't confronted him with anything yet and I don't know if
I will,'' Rogers said. ``It's all in the past now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers learned her father's name about six months ago when she
won the rights to see her birth records from a Los Angeles Superior
Court judge. She then persuaded the local Social Security office to
mail a personal letter to an Oroville man she believed to be her
biological father, and got a return letter from him within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' father, James Powell, told her she had a sister, but
that her mother had died of a heart attack in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers typed a note to her sister on an Internet message board,
and a woman who called herself a ``Search Angel'' responded
immediately with information about Paige. Rogers learned her sister
had lived in Orange County and had been married to a man with the
surname Been. She then tracked down Paige's former sister-in-law
through the phone directory and learned her sister's current name
and address.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been history in the making,'' Rogers said. ``I've
always wanted a sister and I can't believe I've had one all
along.''

CITY COUNCIL OKS LAPD DECREE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles City Council, bowing to the threat
of a Justice Department lawsuit, agreed in principle Tuesday to a
federal court consent decree over the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-2 vote came after a second consecutive day of lengthy
debate over the impact of the consent decree, which is expected to
come back to the council for final approval next week if it is
accepted by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good package, with broad consensus and now
we'll see what the Justice Department does,'' said City Attorney
James Hahn, who headed the city's negotiation team on the
agreement, which will include a federal monitor to audit the LAPD
and report to a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will agree to the changes we want and then we
will get on with reforming the Los Angeles Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the consent decree to the city is estimated at $25
million in start-up costs and as much as $45 million a year after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-page document detailing procedures the LAPD must comply
with is to be in effect for a minimum of five years and will be
lifted only after the city proves it is in compliance for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin, who represented Mayor Richard Riordan
on the negotiating team, said she believes the mayor will sign off
on the package if the Justice Department agrees to the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have done the best we can and I believe everyone
will be satisfied with this,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials last week indicated they would
support modifications sought by Riordan to limit the role of the
federal monitor _ to oversee the LAPD, not operate the department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal suggested by Riordan, council President John
Ferraro and Councilman Alex Padilla, the role of the federal
monitor would be limited to reviewing audits and the progress of
the LAPD in achieving the goals of the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This monitor will not be running the Police Department,''
Councilman Mike Feuer said. ``We are not giving up local control.
The Police Commission will continue to oversee the Police
Department along with the mayor and council.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the concessions being sought is that the monitor would
report on any problems in complying with the consent decree to the
Justice Department rather than to the federal court to allow
corrections to be made before the city is held in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there will be an effort to cap the amount to be
spent for the monitor and any staff the person has, as well as
allowing for the city and Justice Department to agree on who is
selected as monitor.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all officials were pleased with the proposal, and
council members Hal Bernson and Nate Holden voted against the
consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need this,'' Holden said. ``I am telling you that
this will come back to haunt the city. We are capable of doing
these reforms ourselves and I wonder why the Justice Department is
seeking this now, under this chief of police who has done more to
discipline officers than any chief we have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernson said he resented having to vote for the decree under
intense pressure from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before the Justice Department tells us how to run our
department, they ought to clean up the departments under them,''
Bernson said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that argument, the council approved a proposal from
its three Latino members _ Mike Hernandez, Nick Pacheco and Padilla
_ asking the Justice Department to work with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the FBI so those federal agencies would
be held to the same civil rights standards as the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The three council members who did not vote on the consent decree
Tuesday were Pacheco, who was away on city business in Washington,
D.C.; Rudy Svorinich Jr., who had an excused absence; and Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who had left the council meeting when the vote was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree came out of a four-year Justice Department
investigation into a ``pattern and practice'' of discrimination by
the LAPD. However, the Justice Department's civil rights division
did not press forward until after the Rampart scandal, which
included accusations that members of the LAPD Rampart Division's
anti-gang unit assaulted and planted evidence on individuals and
lied in court to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other main features of the agreement include development of a
computerized tracking system of officers based on their records and
complaints filed against them, and increased independence and scope
of work for the Inspector General's Office, which the council
agreed will continue to report to the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's debate, Councilman Joel Wachs won a short-lived
victory in his efforts to require the LAPD to restore the senior
lead officer program as part of the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Because of objections from the Police Department, however, the
council reversed itself after receiving assurances that the Police
Commission was close to a decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter Wachs, who along with Hahn is a candidate for mayor
next year, said he will continue to press the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it works around here,'' Wachs said. ``You put
in something the people want but the department doesn't, and the
department wins. That's why it was so important to get this into
the consent decree to force the department to return one of the
more important parts of community-based policing.''

 &HT;     By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He worked for (beginitalic)Rolling Stone (enditalic)magazine as
a teenager. He wrote (beginitalic)Fast Times at Ridgemont High
(enditalic)at 22. Later, he directed Tom Cruise in
(beginitalic)Jerry Maguire(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he even married a rock star, Nancy Wilson of Heart.
</P>
<P>
   But Cameron Crowe is not cool. Just ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look cool, and it's always betrayed my deepest desires
to be cool,'' Crowe says in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've always noticed that the truly cool guys never talked
about who was cool and who wasn't cool. So in a way, as soon as
you're having this conversation, you're not cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's latest movie, the mostly autobiographical
(beginitalic)Almost Famous(enditalic), follows an awkward,
precocious teenager who covers rock bands for (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone (enditalic) in the 1970s, much as Crowe did in high school.
Though Crowe experienced success at an early age, he always
recognized the difference between the stars and the journalists,
the cool and the uncool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, briefly, I probably almost felt cocky, but I got
slapped down pretty quickly for one reason or another,'' he says.
``My family had a motto, which was, `Always wear tight shoes.' And
what that meant was, `Stay humble.'''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe notes that (beginitalic)Fast Times (enditalic)(1982)
wasn't a success at first but gained a cult following as VCRs and
cable television came into vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a movie that barely got released,'' he recalls, ``that
sort of gained on word of mouth. It's never been more popular than
it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's follow-ups were well-received but failed to achieve the
runaway success of (beginitalic)Fast Times(enditalic). They
included his directorial debut, (beginitalic)Say
Anything(enditalic), with John Cusack, and
(beginitalic)Singles(enditalic), a Matt Dillon comedy that he wrote
and directed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his work does well or not, Crowe gets the most
satisfaction from the writing itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just primarily a writer, and I've always felt that way,''
he says. ``And they can't take that away, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success or failure, you still can go sit in a Denny's and
observe life and write a story about real people, and that's
probably when I'm happiest, is just being a journalist in some way
or another.''
</P>
<P>
   With (beginitalic)Almost Famous(enditalic), Crowe returns to his
fly-on-the-wall roots. He attributes his success as a rock writer
to hanging in the background, unnoticed, while he gathers
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to make movies that feel that way, that you're just
sort of overhearing what's happening,'' he says. ``You're
eavesdropping.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, 43, says he tried to make (beginitalic)Almost Famous
(enditalic) ``painfully personal.'' Everything in the movie
happened to him at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of felt wide open making it,'' he says. ``I thought it
was about the only way to make it where it was honest, and I've
just always felt like, put your cards on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I always liked the painfully personal albums my
favorite artists made, and I realized that they ran for the hills
after that album to something less personal next time - and I will
probably do that.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Almost Famous (enditalic)follows Crowe's alter ego,
William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a 15-year-old who's determined to
become a rock writer. He hooks up with a second-rung band on its
way up (the fictional Stillwater) and befriends the band's favorite
groupie (Kate Hudson).
</P>
<P>
   Crowe says Stillwater and its lead singer, Russell Hammond
(Billy Crudup) are based on musicians he covered during the
mid-'70s, including the Allman Brothers, the Eagles, Yes and King
Crimson. Crowe also developed some original songs for Stillwater to
play, getting songwriting help from his wife and from Peter
Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's mostly a coming-of-age story, the movie also offers
serious commentary on the state of rock and roll, warning about the
onset of naked commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   But Crowe rejects the notion that rock has passed away:
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've thought about it since making the movie, I sort of
realized that rock dies every year. Every year is the year rock is
dead, and then something happens to resurrect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember there was a big article in (beginitalic)Esquire
(enditalic)on Elvis Costello that said, `Rock is dead. The last
rock star.' And about two minutes later, Kurt Cobain and Nirvana
released (beginitalic)Smells Like Teen Spirit(enditalic), and, all
of sudden, rock was never more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In his other films, Crowe didn't shy away from offering brutal
commentary. But he pulled some punches in (beginitalic)Almost
Famous(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be tough on myself with this movie, but this
movie's a little bit more of a love letter than a searing view of
rock and roll,'' he says. ``I think, for a searing view of rock and
roll, you have a lot of other stuff. You have many documentaries.
You have (beginitalic)Don't Look Back (enditalic)or
(beginitalic)Gimme Shelter(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a movie that tried to be about a feeling: Why do
you love music, and let's take a look at a time before music got as
popular or as global as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crowe, the message is simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think it says I love music. I love everything
about music, including the bad stuff. I love arguing about it, and
let the debate rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let's also not categorize the '70s as a funny, cutesy,
kitschy hairdo decade. There was a time at the beginning of that
decade where people were sort of gloriously naive and passionate,
and, you know, let's not make sport of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long and often tumultuous struggle, a bill
to remove trade restraints with China passed the Senate in a strong
bipartisan vote Tuesday, giving President Clinton what he
considered one of his crowning foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with approval by the House in May, the vote Tuesday
ended the annual congressional review of China's trade status, a
Capitol Hill ritual for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading
but that critics argued was necessary to force China to improve its
record on human rights and religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   After the historic vote, which passed with little debate,
Clinton told reporters, ``This landmark agreement will extend
economic prosperity at home and promote economic freedom in China,
increasing the prospects for openness in China and a more peaceful
future for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad margin of the victory, 83-15, was all the more
remarkable coming less than two months before the presidential
election, and after nine months of passionate debate. It
demonstrated how a foreign-policy issue could retain bipartisan
backing even in the heat of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
nominee, has supported the legislation. ``This measure will help
open markets to American products and help export American values,
especially freedom and entrepreneurship,'' said Ray Sullivan, a
spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore feared losing the support of
allies in organized labor who opposed the measure as a threat to
union jobs, he voiced qualified support for the bill Tuesday. But
he stressed that American workers' rights must be protected. ``We
must combat unfair trade practices abroad when they harm our
working families,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   [China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday 20 _ China's Foreign
Ministry today heralded the Senate's approval of the bill removing
restraints on trade as paving the way for more stable relations
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, China criticized clauses in the bill intended
to maintain pressure on Beijing to improve its human rights record.
Hu Chusheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, reiterated irritation at the human rights
monitoring panel in the trade bill, saying it ``still contains
certain clauses that are irrelevant to trade and are intended to
interfere in the internal affairs of China.'')
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters hailed the deal, which will expand a vast
overseas market for U.S. good from soybeans to semiconductors, as a
path-breaking step toward a new economic and security relationship
with China. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who tried unsuccessfully
to amend the bill to penalize Chinese companies that exported
advanced weaponry, voted for the measure but said he would continue
to press China to curb its arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, free trade leads to freer markets, and freer
markets can lead to more open societies,'' Thompson said in a
statement. ``I will keep pushing to hold the Chinese accountable
for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure ensures that the United States will
benefit fully from a market-opening accord that Washington and
Beijing negotiated last November to slash Chinese tariffs on a wide
range of farm and industrial products and removes barriers to
American service providers, like banks and telecommunications
companies. Almost everything from apples to wine would have a
better chance of getting into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement paves the way for China to enter the World Trade
Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for
global commerce. China will join the trade organization, probably
later this year, and would have done so regardless of how lawmakers
voted Tuesday. But without Congress' blessing, China could withhold
some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other
members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For U.S. farmers, businesses and working people, this
agreement opens up a range of opportunities in China across all
sectors and all fields of a magnitude unprecedented in the modern
era,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Some provisions of the agreement have already taken effect, she
said, noting that orange exports to China from Florida and
California, for instance, have increased 100-fold since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``From semiconductors to circuit boards, from PCs to cell
phones, China is simply the most dynamic international market for
U.S. high-tech exports,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the
Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the United States bought $82 billion worth of
Chinese-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of
what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second-largest,
was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade bill warned that several challenges
remain in dealing with China, most immediately resolving disputes
over some agriculture tariffs and how Taiwan will join the WTO at
the same time as China. ``We've got a lot of work ahead of us,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.

</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Tuesday's vote was never in doubt. The fierce
lobbying that pitted corporate America against organized labor and
religious groups in the run-up to the House's approval of the
measure in May, by a vote of 237-197, never materialized in the
upper chamber because all sides knew the question in the pro-trade
Senate was never if the measure would pass, only when and by how
much.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters still faced a delicate procedural and political
balancing act in the Senate, where lawmakers zealously guard their
prerogatives and a lone senator has the power to delay the most
popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation said it was essential to press for a
measure free of amendments because, they said, there was not enough
time to reconcile an amended Senate bill with the House version
before Congress adjourned for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had the votes, but what was difficult was that
there was no margin for error in the Senate,'' said Steve
Ricchetti, a deputy White House chief of staff who was Clinton's
point man for the bill in the Senate. ``It had to pass exactly as
it passed out of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   So supporters adopted a low-key strategy aimed at leaching from
Senate consideration all of the volatile politics that enmeshed the
House vote. Tactically, that meant having Clinton project enough
support to show he still cared deeply about the bill, but not
raising the rhetoric high enough to prompt some foe to take the
bill hostage to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's original point man on the bill, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, left the Cabinet in June to head Gore's
presidential election campaign, some supporters fretted that
momentum was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., balked at scheduling a vote
before the July 4 recess, arguing that the Senate had more pressing
business in wrapping up many of the 13 must-pass spending bills
that keep the government running. ``If we go into September, our
chances for passage drop preciptiously,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
the minority leader, warned in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, critics seemed to have a point. Just as the
vote in the House created unusual political alliances between
liberal labor groups and conservative religious organizations in
opposition to the bill, the Senate battle produced odd political
couplings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., perhaps the Senate's most liberal
member, teamed up with Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the chamber's
staunchest conservatives, to back amendments on human rights,
religious freedom and prison labor in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the gloomy predictions proved wrong. Lott and Democrats
agreed in late July to bring the bill up for a final vote after the
five-week summer recess. Despite its long-simmering tensions with
Taiwan, Beijing heeded private warnings from administration
officials to avoid any diplomatic or military provocations that
could fuel opposition to the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill never became the political issue that some
expected, partly because pro-trade Republicans were loath to
antagonize their corporate benefactors in a tight election year,
and labor leaders never believed they could win enough Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, 20 different amendments to improve human
rights, religious freedom and labor standards in China fell by
lopsided votes, not because senators opposed them on merit but
because of their potential harm to the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate awaited the most popular amendment, sponsored by
Thompson and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to penalize Chinese
companies that trafficked in nuclear, chemical, biological weapons
and long-range missiles. The measure struck an especially strong
chord with lawmakers who had grown increasingly alarmed by
intelligence reports of Chinese arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's final vote, all but seven Democrats and eight
Republicans supported the trade bill. Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., who is Gore's running mate, was campaigning in California
and Ohio, and did not vote. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, also did
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement would benefit American business
and values. ``The Senate has cast an epic and overwhelming vote,''
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``By so doing, we bring
China back into the trading system that it helped to establish out
of the ashes of the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents criticized the measure as one that would undercut
America's moral authority in the world, and reward a government
that threatens its neighbors, persecutes its own citizens and sells
advanced weaponry to America's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety and security of the American people come first,''
Helms said. ``That safety and security will be ensured ultimately
not by appeasement, not by the hope of trade at any cost, but by
dealing with communist China without selling out the very moral and
spiritual principles that made America great in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   This year has been the most productive for trade legislation in
nearly a quarter century. In addition to the China bill, lawmakers
approved bills to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration's last major trade victories were
passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which created the World Trade
Organization, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993,
which established duty-free commerce among the United States,
Mexico and Canada.

<P>
   UCLA is getting ready for a big football game against Oregon on
Saturday, which means the charmingly rakish name Nick Aliotti is
being spoken on the Westwood campus once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In vain?'' Aliotti said on the phone from Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to disappoint him, but, well _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Aliotti ask something like that, anyway? Why would he
interject something negative when I'm trying to write a sweet story
of redemption?
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, despite what Aliotti might expect, nobody
here has anything but loving thoughts to express on the subject of
Oregon's (and UCLA's former) defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Freddie Mitchell, the Bruins' top receiver, had
the following to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Aliotti, with the defense, you know he wants us,''
Mitchell told reporters earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   (He didn't have to add that it's nice to feel wanted.)
</P>
<P>
   Bruins head coach Bob Toledo was given a chance to say something
about Aliotti and these are the words he chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy with a great family,'' Toledo said after
pointing out that Aliotti's departure from UCLA following the
disappointing 1998 season has ``worked out well for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   (``I'm not going to dwell on that,'' Toledo said and he quickly
called for the next question, perhaps fearing he would choke up if
he thought about his old buddy for too long.)
</P>
<P>
   If I had to cite further examples, I probably could find dozens
of people at UCLA who aren't making an issue of Aliotti this week
and who don't seem to view the Bruins-Ducks game Saturday in Oregon
as the second annual grudge match between coaching staffs with a
prickly history.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the woman behind the fish-tacos counter in the
student union said, ``Can I take your order?'' without so much as a
mention of Nick Aliotti.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up in Eugene, they sound as if they're just plain
tired of the subject of Aliotti's acrimonious departure from UCLA
and return to Oregon before the 1999 season, and how his presence
there might heat the atmosphere for the Pacific-10 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we went through all this last year,'' Oregon head
coach Mike Bellotti snapped.
</P>
<P>
   So let me say, once and for all, there are no ill feelings
between UCLA and Oregon, or between Toledo and Aliotti, because of
what happened during and after the latter's lone season on the
Bruins' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Which, if it happened to be true _ if there really were no ill
feelings _ wouldn't disappoint Aliotti a bit.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he's working on a plan for his promising but barely
tested defense to stop the sixth-ranked team in the country, and to
hear him tell it, he doesn't need the added incentive that a
rekindled feud would provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I can compare it is that it's like playing your
brothers, your family or your close friends,'' said Aliotti, 46.
``Those games have a little more meaning. But in reality, we're
preparing for a good football team and there's been no added
emphasis just because it's UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   He even said he is pleased to see UCLA's defense lead the team
to victories over Alabama and Michigan during its 3-0 start. Six of
this season's defensive starters were young regulars on the 1998
unit that blew UCLA's national-championship shot by giving up 87
points to Miami and Wisconsin. Aliotti was blamed publicly by
Toledo, resigned in the offseason and was hired by Oregon for the
third time. Aliotti and Toledo haven't spoken since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were puppies when I was there. But those kids have grown
up and they're having some success,'' Aliotti said, hinting he
draws some vindication from the still-young Bruins' struggles in
1999. ``I'm telling you right now that I'm thrilled for those kids.
You know, sometimes you don't get a chance to say your proper
goodbyes.''
</P>
<P>
   His comparison to a family is fitting. The Pac-10 coaches all
seem to be related _ if not by blood, by their resumes. Of the 100
head and assistant coaches in the conference, 44 used to coach at
another Pac-10 school, and of those, half have worked at three or
more. Stanford defensive-backs coach Denny Schuler used to be at
Washington, Cal, Oregon and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo was an assistant at USC (1976-78) and Oregon (1983-88).
This means he was a co-worker of five members of Oregon's current
staff at one time or another. Bellotti replaced him as Oregon's
offensive coordinator when Toledo left for Texas A&AMP;M in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for family? Aliotti's second cousin is Alan Borges,
UCLA's (and Oregon's former) offensive coordinator. And Borges is
something of a sore subject among the Ducks, having been ``stolen''
by Toledo for his Bruins staff in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Borges, asked about his controversy and Aliotti's, said he
thinks all of those issues have blown over, leaving nothing more
intriguing than a game to be settled Saturday. It's just one big
happy family playing touch football on the back lawn.

VICE PRESIDENT VOWS ADDED MEDICAL PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the campaign trail in the San Fernando Valley
on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore proposed new federal laws to
prevent improper access to medical records, a problem he said is
plaguing the health care industry nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we take action on this, it's going to get worse,'' Gore
told about 150 local officials, physicians and patients at a round
table held at the New Horizons health care facility for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a movement in the direction of people being
victimized by powerful institutions that are able to take your most
private medical information and treat it as a commodity ... and
trade it back and forth ... and that's just wrong,'' Gore said,
adding that current legislation does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, the Democratic presidential nominee
fielded questions and comments from the crowd on medical privacy
and also took the opportunity to reiterate his proposal to
establish a universal health care system in four years if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president proposed laws that would specifically forbid
the improper disclosure of private medical information, create
stiffer penalties for leaking information, and make it illegal to
use genetic information to screen a perspective employee or loan
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   He said similar proposals have come up against strong lobbying
by the health care industry at the congressional level.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of
Health Plans, said the insurance industry already makes it a
priority to prevent the improper disclosure of private medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't support marketing private information to vendors,''
Zelman said. ``On the other hand, insurers need to continue to
collect extensive private information to provide the proper care.
If we leave that up to the individual physicians, they are
ill-equipped to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, HMOs would support legislation that made it
tougher for patient information to ``get into the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Republican presidential nominee Gov. George W. Bush
attacked the vice president's proposal as campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore's proposal highlights the fact that they have failed
to address this issue in eight years in office,'' said Bush
spokesman Ray Sullivan. ``Here in Texas, Gov. Bush and the
Legislature have passed laws protecting driver's license
information, prohibiting disclosure of genetic testing and
criminalizing identity theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd Tuesday told of their fear that they would
suffer discrimination if a prospective employer or loan officer
were to find out they had been diagnosed with a chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor, who identified himself as an HIV specialist in the
Valley, said many patients hesitate to be tested for chronic
diseases because they fear that the information could be used
against them.
</P>
<P>
   One psychiatrist said that days after writing a prescription for
one of his patients, he was contacted by a pharmaceutical company
offering an alternative drug for the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they got my patient's information, but they
shouldn't have,'' said Dr. Dan Borenstein, who identified himself
as president of the National Psychiatrist Association.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who said her mother had been diagnosed with breast
cancer said she had not been tested for the disease herself partly
because of the worries of having her diagnosis disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks before the first presidential candidate debate
and with strong showings in public opinion polls, Gore has
continued to focus on national issues instead of attacks on his GOP
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But he did spend a few minutes during the round table to
reiterate his criticism of Bush's plan to allow Americans to invest
a portion of their Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Bush's) plan were implemented today,'' Gore said, ``the
impact to the national deficit would be horrendous.'' He estimated
that the proposal would decrease the Social Security fund by 16
percent, leading to an increase in the national deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has touted his plan as an alternative that would yield
higher returns to retirees, leaving the choice of investment risk
up to the individual.

PERU'S PRESIDENT VOWS TO STAY IN OFFICE UNTIL NEXT SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In his first public appearance since he called for
new elections and the dismantling of the National Intelligence
Service, President Alberto K. Fujimori entered the Palace of
Government on Tuesday night to the cheers of supporters. He assured
assured the nation that he was in full control and would remain in
office until his successor is sworn in next July.
</P>
<P>
   After climbing atop the palace gate and waving to the crowd, he
went inside to give a televised address in which he said his
decision last Saturday was a moral obligation to ensure stability
and one that he made after a videotape surfaced that showed his
close aide and intelligence chief apparently offering a $15,000
bribe to an opposition congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Vladimiro Montesinos, has not been seen since
Fujimori's announcement, and opponents have worried about the
possibility of a coup, given Montesinos's close ties to
high-ranking officers and the continued silence of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying goodbye yet,'' Fujimori said during an address
that was by turns animated and jovial. ``This message does not
signify my immediate resignation. I am in full function.''
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that he enjoyed the support of the commanding
generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no power vacuum,'' he said. ``We will keep working
intensively until the last days. The country is at peace and there
is liberty for demonstrations and freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   He was emphatic in saying that he arrived independently at his
decision to call for new elections in which he would not run. He
denied that he had been under pressure from the U.S. government,
which along with other nations had questioned Montesinos's role in
his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never received a call from anyone, and the United States
does not act in that manner,'' he said. ``We have good
communication. We have been in dialogue and cooperation. But
absolutely no calls or insinuations. Nothing. Zero. These decisions
were the sovereign decisions of the president of Peru. I am not the
president of any other country.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about Montesinos' whereabouts, Fujimori passed
the microphone to the Cabinet ministers who flanked him. Several
times, the ministers said they did not know Montesinos' exact
location, but added that he was in Lima and not under arrest. They
said that he was still receiving official protection, given his
role in combating terrorism and narcotics, and that he was also
entitled to due process regarding any criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also criticized his opponents, who he said had attacked
him despite his success in fighting terrorists and improving the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, several of his opponents said that while
they were willing to resume talks with his government to find a
solution to the political crisis, they also had more videotapes
with evidence of official misconduct. They had previously
conditioned participation in such talks on Montesinos' arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Their change of heart came one day after Fujimori instructed his
Cabinet to submit to Congress the necessary bills to have a new
election.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events came against a backdrop of deepening mystery
about the whereabouts of Montesinos, and a continued silence from
the military about the changes in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real situation of emergency and misinformation, so
we can no longer remain on the margins,'' said Fernando Olivera, a
congressman with the Independent Moralizing Front Party. ``This
does not mean we withdraw our demand for the arrest of Vladimiro
Montesinos. What would happen is, it would be put on the table for
discussion so together we can make the correct decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups had been taking part in talks with the
Fujimori government under the aegis of the Organization of American
States, which was trying to bolster confidence in Peru after
Fujimori won a controversial third term this year.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear on Tuesday if the main opposition leader,
Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew from the presidential race after
accusing the government of rigging the election had agreed to new
talks. On Monday night he was acting like a candidate as he
addressed a crowd of 10,000 cheering supporters at Plaza San Martin
to propose a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera said on Tuesday that this was not the time to campaign,
but to find solutions, hoping that talks would bring about
elections soon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olivera, who set off the crisis when he made public the
incriminating videotape, also tinged his overture with its own
mystery when he announced that he had other damning videotapes. His
assertion was backed up by Susana Higuchi, an opposition lawmaker
and Fujimori's former wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the military is pressuring Fujimori so there would
not be a coup,'' she said at a midday news conference. ``That is
why we do not plan to release the other videos, because there would
be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, however, said he did
not think there was much appetite among officers for a coup in
support of Montesinos.

RICHARD TO PLAY SPARINGLY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Does USC really need to bring an injured starter
back to play against San Jose State, or would it be wiser to wait
until the start of the Pacific-10 Conference season next week?
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma facing the Trojans regarding cornerback Kris
Richard, who practiced in noncontact drills Tuesday after being
sidelined last week with a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm preparing myself to play a whole game, but I won't be
surprised if I don't,'' Richard said. ``It's kind of a wait-and-see
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important game, but the Pac-10 is right around
the corner. If I play against San Jose State and reinjure it, I
might miss the Pac-10 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, USC coach Paul Hackett said Richard would play but
was a little more vague on how much he might use him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be in there when we need him,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lonnie Ford, bothered by a sprained ankle after
leaving the Colorado game with back spasms, is doubtful for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Trevor Roberts, who has been out since
training camp with a sprained foot, will play. Tailback Malaefou
MacKenzie (sprained ankle) is not 100 percent but also will see
action.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going outside? Tailback Sultan McCullough says he isn't
impatient about the lack of running plays designed to go outside in
USC's first two games. With the majority of the plays going inside,
McCullough is averaging 3.8 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, we'll open it up and go on the perimeter,''
McCullough said. ``Whatever they give me, I'll take.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's cousin, Elonte Vaughn, is a backup wide receiver
for San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Decision for Guenther: Freshman tight end Gregg Guenther of
Taft High, who has a herniated disc, will meet with doctors to
determine whether he needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman tailback Chris Howard is scheduled to have
reconstructive surgery on his left knee on Tuesday and will return
for spring practice. Howard originally had arthroscopic knee
surgery last spring but never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing,'' Hackett said. ``Rehab is as important as the
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming home: San Jose State coach Dave Baldwin, the former
Cal State Northridge coach, said he will have about 25 relatives at
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up . . . in the San Fernando Valley and have always
been a fan of USC,'' Baldwin said. ``I had a signed photo of Mike
Garrett and always wanted to be a tailback but found out that I was
one of those slow guys and ended up playing wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went on to play at Cal State Northridge. But I always
considered USC to be the premier program.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Game captains: Hackett named McCullough, offensive tackle
Brent McCaffrey, linebacker Markus Steele and defensive end Matt
Childersas captains for the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Touchdown for Youth: Former USC quarterback Vince Evans will
join nearly 2,500 disadvantaged children as guests of USC and the
Los Angeles Sports Council Foundation.

GORE MISSPEAKS AND FABRICATES, CHENEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ The Republicans continued a sharp assault
Tuesday on Vice President Al Gore over the veracity of a statement
he made last month saying that his mother-in-law paid a much higher
price for a prescribed arthritis medication than he had to pay for
the same drug when it was prescribed for his dog.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Gore campaign released information that on
close examination seems to suggest there was little disparity in
the price for similar dosages of the drugs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said the
questions about Gore's statements on drug costs was an example of
how he ``simply makes some things up out of whole cloth and repeats
them over and over and over again until he's called on it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was referring to news accounts that cast doubt on an
anecdote Gore used last month when he told a group of elderly
people in Florida that the arthritis medicine his mother-in-law
took cost three times as much as the animal version of the same
medicine taken by his dog, Shiloh. The Boston Globe reported on
Monday that Gore made the assertion based on figures from a
congressional report, not on his family's actual drug bills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after enduring barbs on the issue from the Bush
campaign for a day and a half, the Gore campaign said the
congressional report that Gore had cited put the cost of Lodine at
$1.20 per capsule and Etogesic at 42 cents. Gore's mother-in-law,
Margaret Ann Aitcheson, paid $2.13 per capsule of Lodine, while
Shiloh's Etogesic cost 92 cents per capsule, the campaign said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign did not specify what how much the drug cost per
dose. And a check of prices for the two drugs at Web sites showed
that the cost per milligram of Lodine was lower in some cases than
the price per milligram of Etogesic, suggesting that the disparity
was generated by the difference in dosages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides noted that the drugs, and the figures they
released showed that the cost of Aitcheson's pills was 231.5
percent of the cost of Shiloh's. In the congressional report that
Gore had relied on last month the cost of Lodine was 285.7 percent
of that of Etogesic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A check of Web sites showed Lodine ranged in cost from 22 cents
a milligram to 48 cents per milligram. At a similar Web site for
veterinary supplies, Etogesic ranged from .25 cents a milligram to
.51 cents per milligram. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later Gore talked about the matter and said the issue was not
his mother-in-law. ``The issue is what seniors around the country
are paying, and the wholesale price is between two and three time
what is charged for pets,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney contended the issue was one of credibility. When a
Republican misspeaks, that's big news,'' Cheney told reporters,
referring obliquely to the malapropisms of his running mate, Gov.
George W. Bush. But it's equally important to go out and spend some
time and ask questions about the vice president, a candidate for
the president of the United States, who simply makes some things up
out of whole cloth and repeats them over and over and over again
until he's called on it.''

MILLER DROPS OUT OF 100
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Never mind everything she said this summer
about running Marion Jones down at the Olympics. Inger Miller won't
beat her nemesis in the 100-meter dash and it's possible she won't
give her a race in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Miller downsized her Olympic dreams today by pulling out of the
100 meters because of a hamstring injury. The Van Nuys resident
said she suffered a strain earlier this month while training at
UCLA's Drake Stadium and is exercising caution in the hopes of
salvaging the 200 meters, the better of her two events, and the
800-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-meter heats are Friday and the final will be run on
Saturday. By taking herself out of the sprint, Miller buys herself
five more days of rest and treatment before the heats of the 200
meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult decision for me,'' Miller said today at
a press conference with other HSI athletes who train under John
Smith at UCLA. ``I didn't want to jeopardize my other events. A few
more days will help me heal. At this point it's getting better day
by day. I've been able to do some training, just not at the level
that I'd like to be at.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 28, is the reigning world champion in the 200 meters,
having prevailed in Seville last summer after Jones collapsed with
back spasms while running in the heats. Miller's winning time of
21.77 was .01 seconds slower than Jones' personal best at sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Jones has put a little more distance between herself
and Miller, posting six times this summer faster than Miller's top
seasonal effort of 10.91. Jones is one of only three women in
history to have run faster times for both the 100 and 200 than
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Torri Edwards, 23, who trains alongside Miller at UCLA, will
take her teammate's place in the 100. After expressing
disappointment for Miller, Edwards said, ``I've been training hard
and I'm prepared to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose track career at USC was marred by injuries and
illness, was not maudlin when addressing this latest setback. She
did not hang her head or fight back tears or rail at the fates. She
managed a few smiles and a couple of laughs and behaved as though
she hasn't forgotten the sun will come up tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my hands.'' Miller explained. ``Last year, when I
was very successful in the 100 and 200, I didn't ask, 'Why me?' So
I can't say that now. I can't be upset if I don't achieve the goals
that are in my plan. God has a different plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's goals have been the worst-kept secret in track this
year. Beating Jones clearly has become her obsession. She hasn't
defeated her U.S. rival at any distance since 1990, when Miller was
a senior at Pasadena Muir High and Jones was a freshman at Oxnard's
Rio Mesa High.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second to Jones in both the 100 and the 200
meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in July, Miller said she was
saving her best performance for the sport's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   These Olympics were supposed to validate her, not go on without
her. So when Miller felt that sharp twinge of pain on the Drake
Stadium track on the first Thursday of this month, many things went
through her mind, none of them fit to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dramatic,'' she said. ``Something like that happens (so
close to the Olympics), of course you're thinking, 'There's no way
I'm going to be able to run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When her hamstring felt much better the next day, Miller moved
on. She decided she might not be able to control her destiny, but
she has command over her mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying not to be as disappointed as I was when it
first happened,'' Miller said. ``I think I'll be all right. I've
got to go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, she said, ``It's not the end of the world.''

EDITORIAL: SOUND STRATEGY ON FOREST FIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 20:
</P>
<P>
   What President Clinton has called ``one of the worst fire
seasons in memory'' has yielded at least one tangible benefit _ an
ambitious new firefighting strategy aimed at protecting the
nation's forests and grasslands from runaway fires like those that
have scorched more than 6.7 million acres in the last two months.
It has also produced a rare moment of bipartisan harmony in an
otherwise rancorous election year. Meeting in Salt Lake City, six
Western governors, five of them Republicans, joined with
administration officials in urging Congress to approve Clinton's
$2.8 billion request to get the plan under way. Congress should
heed their plea, while resisting the temptation to reopen an
unproductive debate over the administration's earlier proposals to
protect millions of acres of federal forests from commercial
logging.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would provide $1.6 billion in new money beyond the
existing $1.2 billion firefighting budget. Of the new money, $900
million would replenish funds depleted by the high cost of fighting
this summer's fires, leaving $700 million for prevention. The
prevention strategy has two main components. It would expand the
current policy of controlled burns, fires deliberately set to
reduce combustible underbrush and shrubs. More important, it will
greatly increase the mechanical thinning of overgrown forests by
removing the smallest, most fire-prone trees while leaving the
largest, most fire-resistant ones behind. Current thinning efforts
cover just 2.4 million acres a year, a fraction of the 40 million
acres judged to be at serious risk.
</P>
<P>
   One novel feature is the plan's organizing principle. It calls
for sharing responsibility among various levels of government,
which appealed to the Western governors. The Forest Service and the
Interior Department would provide overall supervision, making sure
that the thinning strategy is not used to expand commercial logging
beyond federally mandated levels or undercut broad conservation
goals. The states will play a central role in deciding which areas,
including state and private lands, most need thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Once these priorities have been set, local governments will be
asked to do the actual work, possibly through community agencies.
In the words of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, these agencies
could provide ``jobs in the woods for local residents,'' much as
the Civilian Conservation Corps created jobs during the 1930's. In
any case, the big timber companies would not be invited to
participate. The administration fears that they would insist on
cutting enough big trees to meet their profit targets, and cutting
big trees is exactly the wrong strategy. Indeed, as a
congressionally mandated report released three weeks ago makes
clear, heavy logging in years past has left the forests vulnerable
to big fires by leaving behind dense stands of flammable small
trees and underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are signs that a few Western senators will
use the administration's budget request to open a broader debate on
forest policy and to make the case, however shaky it may be, that
the best way to make forests healthier is to allow more timber
sales on public lands. One senator, Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has
called for hearings on the subject. This is not where Congress
should be putting its time and energy. As of yesterday, 33 fires
were still burning throughout the West. What the country needs is
not an acrimonious debate over timber sales but a solid strategy
for preventing fires.

SOPHIE DAVIS, EXECUTIVE AND PHILANTHROPIST, IS DEAD AT 74
</HEADLINE>
  By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sophie Davis, a successful businesswoman whose backing helped
create the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at the City
College of New York, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach,
Fla. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, her son Alan said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis helped her husband. Leonard, found the Colonial Penn Group
of insurance companies, and they gave millions of dollars to art,
dance, music and Jewish philanthropic causes, including the
Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But one project in which she took the most pride was the medical
program at City College, which helps place economically
disadvantaged students into medicine with the understanding that
they will practice for at least two years in low-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the seven-year accelerated medical degree program
take three years of undergraduate work at City College, two years
of medical training at Sophie Davis and their final two years at
one of six cooperating medical schools, including New York
University and SUNY/Downstate. The graduates are known as
``Sophies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davises' first gift, $1.2 million, to the school, which
began as an experimental program, was given anonymously in 1972.
Five years later, Davis agreed to have her name attached to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   When the school gave her an honorary degree at that time, she
brought a phalanx of friends and relatives to the ceremony to see
her in her academic cap and gown; she had dropped out of City
College to get married.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Davis was born in 1926 in the Bronx, N.Y. to Isadore and
Esther Kesten, immigrants from Minsk, Russia. After skipping a
grade in high school, she attended City College at night; there she
studied accounting and met Leonard Davis, whom she married in 1945.
He survives her.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and her son Alan, of San Francisco,
Davis is survived by another son, Michael, of Belvedere, Calif.,
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Davis worked as an accountant and later in the
insurance business, Mrs. Davis worked at his side, organizing the
office, handling the bookkeeping and serving as his sounding board.
She was also a director of the Colonial Penn Group, which they
founded in 1963, until they sold it in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Sophie Davis medical school was one of many projects the
couple supported at City College. They also provided funds for a
performing arts center, Aaron Davis Hall, named after Mr. Davis'
father. Mrs. Davis helped choose some of the resident performers,
and she and her husband often entertained them after performances.
</P>
<P>
   As the Davises began to spend more and more time in Palm Beach,
they played a similar role there as impresarios, establishing the
Regional Arts Foundation, with Mrs. Davis as president, in the
early 1970s. The foundation brought performers like Isaac Stern,
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New York City Ballet to
southern Florida, then considered by some a cultural wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   The Davises also became involved with the Norton Museum of Art
in West Palm Beach. Mrs. Davis served as a trustee and spearheaded
the drive to build a new wing.
</P>
<P>
   But even from Florida, she kept in touch with the medical school
named after her. She and her husband gave the school another $2
million for an endowed scholarship fund in their names. And last
year, when she attended the graduation ceremony, the students stood
up and started chanting her name: ``Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!''

CONFIDENT PARK EARNS 16TH WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a bundle of reasons the Los Angeles
Dodgers want to lock up right-hander Chan Ho Park far beyond 2001,
and those reasons came together in a tidy package Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching another gem in what's turned into a rebirth season,
Park pitched eight shutout innings and won his career-high 16th
game as the Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 1-0. The Dodgers'
fifth straight win moved them within a half-game of Arizona for
second place the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as good as Park was, it took second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek's two-out single to right in the bottom of the eighth
inning to give the Dodgers a lead. Tom Goodwin began the mini-rally
with a two-out single to center. He stole second and scored on
Grudzielanek's grounder through the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Grudzielanek was certainly a piece of the background,
while Park moved front and center.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Park) was very focused,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``It's a tough-hitting ballclub and he handled them easy. He got in
the jam in the eighth inning (first and third, one out), and I
wasn't really that worried. I knew he'd rise to the occasion. I've
seen him do it all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Park also matched Hideo Nomo for most wins in a season by an
Asian-born pitcher. Park is 16-10 with a 3.53 ERA. Nomo won 16 in
1996 for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in behind Chan Ho and slamming the door is very, very
sweet, because he's been working so hard to get that 16th win, and
I'm glad he was able to do that,'' said closer Jeff Shaw, who
pitched a perfect ninth for his 26th save. ``He's a lot more
mentally tough than he was last year. And he's starting to believe
that instead of shying away from (tough) situations, he going right
after them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Park, it's the kind of season the Dodgers anticipated in
1999 but didn't get. He was 13-11 with a 5.23 ERA and melted down
time and again in huge spots. A trusting bond with catcher Chad
Kreuter has helped in Park's awesome development.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed six hits, walked four and struck out eight,
including the last two batters he faced. He fanned Diamondbacks
center fielder Steve Finley with runners on first and third with
one out in the eighth and struck out Matt Williams to end the
threat. The strikeout of Williams was Park's 191st of the season,
tying the career high he established in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a strikeout (of Finley) instead of a ground
ball,''Park said. ``If it's a ground ball, I give up a run. I
thought it was better to throw a 3-2 curve because he was swinging
at it. That gave me confidence with Williams. I'm happy about it. I
don't care about the 16th win.''

   CHINA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis. The Senate's
overwhelming vote to give permanent trade benefits to China ended a
decade-long clash between America's global economic interests and

Milosevic of Yugoslavia is running for re-election against NATO and
the United States, the countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year,
not against his democratic opposition. Portraying himself as the
defender of Yugoslavia's sovereignty against a hostile, hegemonic
West led by Washington, Milosevic and his government argue that
opposition leaders are merely the paid, traitorous tools of enemies
who are continuing their war against him by other means. The

MILLER DROPS OUT OF 100
</HEADLINE>
 ... corrects 800 relay to
400-meter relay (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Never mind everything she said this summer
about running Marion Jones down at the Olympics. Inger Miller won't
beat her nemesis in the 100-meter dash and it's possible she won't
give her a race in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Miller downsized her Olympic dreams today by pulling out of the
100 meters because of a hamstring injury. The Van Nuys resident
said she suffered a strain earlier this month while training at
UCLA's Drake Stadium and is exercising caution in the hopes of
salvaging the 200 meters, the better of her two events, and the
800-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-meter heats are Friday and the final will be run on
Saturday. By taking herself out of the sprint, Miller buys herself
five more days of rest and treatment before the heats of the 200
meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult decision for me,'' Miller said today at
a press conference with other HSI athletes who train under John
Smith at UCLA. ``I didn't want to jeopardize my other events. A few
more days will help me heal. At this point it's getting better day
by day. I've been able to do some training, just not at the level
that I'd like to be at.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 28, is the reigning world champion in the 200 meters,
having prevailed in Seville last summer after Jones collapsed with
back spasms while running in the heats. Miller's winning time of
21.77 was .01 seconds slower than Jones' personal best at sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Jones has put a little more distance between herself
and Miller, posting six times this summer faster than Miller's top
seasonal effort of 10.91. Jones is one of only three women in
history to have run faster times for both the 100 and 200 than
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Torri Edwards, 23, who trains alongside Miller at UCLA, will
take her teammate's place in the 100. After expressing
disappointment for Miller, Edwards said, ``I've been training hard
and I'm prepared to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose track career at USC was marred by injuries and
illness, was not maudlin when addressing this latest setback. She
did not hang her head or fight back tears or rail at the fates. She
managed a few smiles and a couple of laughs and behaved as though
she hasn't forgotten the sun will come up tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my hands.'' Miller explained. ``Last year, when I
was very successful in the 100 and 200, I didn't ask, 'Why me?' So
I can't say that now. I can't be upset if I don't achieve the goals
that are in my plan. God has a different plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's goals have been the worst-kept secret in track this
year. Beating Jones clearly has become her obsession. She hasn't
defeated her U.S. rival at any distance since 1990, when Miller was
a senior at Pasadena Muir High and Jones was a freshman at Oxnard's
Rio Mesa High.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second to Jones in both the 100 and the 200
meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in July, Miller said she was
saving her best performance for the sport's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   These Olympics were supposed to validate her, not go on without
her. So when Miller felt that sharp twinge of pain on the Drake
Stadium track on the first Thursday of this month, many things went
through her mind, none of them fit to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dramatic,'' she said. ``Something like that happens (so
close to the Olympics), of course you're thinking, 'There's no way
I'm going to be able to run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When her hamstring felt much better the next day, Miller moved
on. She decided she might not be able to control her destiny, but
she has command over her mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying not to be as disappointed as I was when it
first happened,'' Miller said. ``I think I'll be all right. I've
got to go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, she said, ``It's not the end of the world.''

<P>
   Miller, 28, is the reigning world champion in the 200 meters,
having prevailed in Seville last summer after Jones collapsed with
back spasms while running in the heats. Miller's winning time of
21.77 was .01 seconds slower than Jones' personal best at sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Jones has put a little more distance between herself
and Miller, posting six times this summer faster than Miller's top
seasonal effort of 10.91. Jones is one of only three women in
history to have run faster times for both the 100 and 200 than
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Torri Edwards, 23, who trains alongside Miller at UCLA, will
take her teammate's place in the 100. After expressing
disappointment for Miller, Edwards said, ``I've been training hard
and I'm prepared to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose track career at USC was marred by injuries and
illness, was not maudlin when addressing this latest setback. She
did not hang her head or fight back tears or rail at the fates. She
managed a few smiles and a couple of laughs and behaved as though
she hasn't forgotten the sun will come up tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my hands.'' Miller explained. ``Last year, when I
was very successful in the 100 and 200, I didn't ask, 'Why me?' So
I can't say that now. I can't be upset if I don't achieve the goals
that are in my plan. God has a different plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's goals have been the worst-kept secret in track this
year. Beating Jones clearly has become her obsession. She hasn't
defeated her U.S. rival at any distance since 1990, when Miller was
a senior at Pasadena Muir High and Jones was a freshman at Oxnard's
Rio Mesa High.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second to Jones in both the 100 and the 200
meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in July, Miller said she was
saving her best performance for the sport's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   These Olympics were supposed to validate her, not go on without
her. So when Miller felt that sharp twinge of pain on the Drake
Stadium track on the first Thursday of this month, many things went
through her mind, none of them fit to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dramatic,'' she said. ``Something like that happens (so
close to the Olympics), of course you're thinking, 'There's no way
I'm going to be able to run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When her hamstring felt much better the next day, Miller moved
on. She decided she might not be able to control her destiny, but
she has command over her mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying not to be as disappointed as I was when it
first happened,'' Miller said. ``I think I'll be all right. I've
got to go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, she said, ``It's not the end of the world.''

</P>
<P>
   ``THE AVENGERS''
</P>
<P>
   By Rich Cohen  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25)
</P>
<P>
   He discovered it when he was a boy on vacation with his family
in Israel, and it was, Cohen writes, ``like no Holocaust story I
have ever heard.'' They had gone to a kibbutz near Tel Aviv to
visit a relative who had survived the Holocaust, and there they met
Abba Kovner, a poet who had been a partisan fighter in Lithuania
during the war, partnered with two teenage girls named Ruzka (the
Cohen relative) and Vitka. The three Israelis told the story of
their wartime heroics sparingly and reluctantly, but it was the
highlight of the Cohen vacation. In 1998, after Abba and Ruzka had
died, Cohen went back to Israel to talk to Vitka, who now wanted to
tell everything so that it would not die with her. It's a stirring
tale of Jewish resistance that culminated after the war in a plan
to poison Nazi prisoners in Nuremberg. It's also a tribute to Abba,
who, Cohen says, ``had only his dignity, his strength and his
belief that if you struggle, then win or lose, you win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``DREAM CATCHER''
</P>
<P>
   By Margaret A. Salinger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Washington Square, $27.95)
</P>
<P>
   Beware of what your children know about you, lest they keep no
secrets. That said, let us all observe a moment of silence for poor
J.D. Salinger, whose daughter has spilled the beans. The
notoriously reclusive writer has been exposed as a urine-drinking,
Nazi-marrying, cult-joining, all-around strange and often abusive
guy who ``barely can tie his shoelaces in the real world,'' let
alone be a conventional father. Despite the dreadful sound of it,
the tone of this memoir is less nasty than curious, as if Margaret
Salinger is only trying to know her father on his own terms. She
has taken the path of any would-be biographer, talking to people
close to him, reading what others have written about him (including
Joyce Maynard's (beginitalic)AtHome in the World(enditalic)) and
analyzing his fiction. There are good moments too - Salinger says
she grew up ``in a world that dangled between dream and nightmare''
- but you can't escape the sound of that dirty laundry flapping in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TALMUD AND THE INTERNET'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Rosen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $16)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a world of unbounded curiosity, of argument
and information, where anyone with a modem can wander out of the
wilderness for a while, ask a question and receive an answer. I
take comfort in thinking that a modern technological medium echoes
an ancient one.'' That would be the Talmud, about which New &AMP;
Notable knows little (nor do we understand the Internet), yet we
read this book with interest and pleasure. Rosen spends much of it
rambling along on a tour of his own thoughts, a path that is
cerebral and yet inviting. The Talmud and the Internet are vast and
complex (though the Internet has no moral center), and Rosen makes
clear his comfort in accepting that he will never fully understand
either of them. We are pulled through the thickest moments of his
discussion by his poignant musings about his family - his parents,
their books, the death of his beloved grandmother. It's an odd,
engaging little book - enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWO FOR THE SUMMIT''
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey Norman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   It began as Norman's 50th birthday present to himself, but
everything changed when his 15-year-old daughter, Brooke, said she
wanted to go along. He took some persuading, but eventually Norman
agreed that they would climb Wyoming's 13,766-foot Grand Teton
together. After a two-day course in climbing, they started off with
a guide and a few other clients. Brooke faltered at first in the
high air but later passed up her father, and both reached the
summit. It was, Norman writes, the best birthday he ever had, and
the opening of a new chapter in his relationship with the daughter
who became his ``climbing buddy'' and eventually surpassed him in
skill and agility. His book, which begins and ends with a big climb
last year (Argentina's Aconcagua, at 22,835 feet the tallest
mountain outside Asia), is easy, entertaining reading about fathers
and daughters, mountains and climbers and the adventure of learning
new tricks in middle age.

ONE LIVER BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom needs a new liver. The one he has is just about shot and if
he doesn't soon get a replacement he'll die. His friend Diane told
him, ``I have a liver. I could give you half of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, that's the plan. Sometime in November the two will go into
the hospital and part of Diane's liver will be put into Tom to
replace his liver. Barring complications he'll grow a healthy one
and Diane will go on as if nothing is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Livers can do that. They regenerate. ``The body's very
magical,'' says Diane, who met Tom through her job as a personal
trainer. He hired her to get him in shape for transplant surgery.
That was back when he thought his only and nearly impossible hope
was a liver transplant from a cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   For three years Tom, who lives in Santa Rosa, has been on the
waiting list at the University of California at San Francisco for a
donor liver. Because the need overwhelms the availability of
cadaver livers, Tom's been told he'd have to be practically dying
before he'd move close to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's liver is wrecked due to hepatitis C, an insidious disease
now considered a national epidemic. It's a sneaky killer which
allows a person to be infected and possibly not know it for 10 or
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's transmitted by blood and so a lot of people who share
needles put themselves at risk. But others can be infected too.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's doctors asked if he had a blood transfusion before 1992.
Since then blood supplies have been checked for the virus. Did he
shoot drugs? More subtly, did he ever snort cocaine through a metal
tube or even a sharp piece of paper that might have cut into the
tender flesh of his nose?
</P>
<P>
   No on all counts, said Tom, but he has his theories.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in the U.S. Army in 1972 he had a sergeant who liked
to harass soldiers about not being clean-shaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried a razor in his pocket. An old and rusty thing. If
he thought you hadn't shaved close enough he'd make you dry shave
right there. It would really tear up your face. He'd go down the
line and after someone used it, he'd clean it off on his sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, Tom, theorizes, he got infected in the dentist's chair
before dentists wore gloves. Or maybe he picked it up from the
needles his acupuncturist used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter now,'' he says. ``You just get
curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane only wanted to know one thing. How could she give Tom part
of her liver and when? After completing paper work, hospital tests
and interviews this summer she and Tom found out they were a match.
There are still some insurance details to settle, but surgery is
planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Diane continues to train with Tom twice a week. ``He
is so inspirational,'' she says. ``I wish some people who are
always complaining about headaches and being too tired to work out
could see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane is also training extra hard even though she appears to be
the picture of vibrant good health. She needs to strengthen her
torso, she says, which will be sliced across the middle and down
the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the scar,'' she explains sheepishly. ``You know,
people who work at a gym spend time on our bodies. We're kind of
vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane has a teen-age son about the age of Tom's and she knows
Tom's wife from the gym. She says, ``I couldn't watch someone like
Tom die when something can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   A single mom who lives in Windsor, Calif., she's never been in
the hospital except to have her son. Only one person has tried to
talk her out of donating so far, telling her that she's
jeopardizing her son. But her son gave his approval. So did Diane's
sisters and father. Her friends are behind her and promise to feed
her sweets while she's recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all say they admire me but most of them say they could
never do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why. We all have a liver and we don't need the
whole thing and we have two kidneys and we only need one. People
are dying and we can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, who refers to his disease as ``C,'' was diagnosed three and
a half years ago. Suddenly his legs would start ``itching like
crazy,'' he says. He seemed to always be getting hit with the flu.
He quit his job as a project engineer because the detailed work
became too taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't keep the lists in my head anymore'' is how he puts
it. The symptoms were baffling but eventually fit into a picture of
hepatitis clues.
</P>
<P>
   He's been told that right after surgery, transplanted liver
patients begin to automatically feel better, and imagines that will
happen for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like living,'' he says with a small smile on his thin face.
</P>
<P>
   As for Diane, he says, ``Everyone knows there are people in the
world who will do things for other people. It's true.''

U.S. WOMEN DEFEAT NIGERIA, 3-1; NORWAY KNOCKS CHINA OUT OF MEDAL
CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ China is gone. There will be no replay of
the 1996 Summer Games final, no replay of the 1999 World Cup final.
And the new U.S. coach, April Heinrichs, will not exactly wax
sentimental at not presiding over a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding, Heinrichs said. ``I am standing on
the shore giving a wave. Thank God they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' farewell salute should not be taken as an insult to
China. Heinrichs knows she escaped two rugged opponents at the very
same time Wednesday night. The American women advanced to the
semifinals of the second Summer Games soccer tournament for women
by surviving Nigeria, by a score of 3-1 and with no apparent broken
limbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the very same time, China was being knocked off by Norway,
2-1, which means that the United States and Norway, bitter foes in
women's soccer, have advanced to opposite semifinals on Sunday. The
United States meets Brazil in Canberra; Norway plays Germany in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   China is always the future _ in population, in production, in
geopolitics, and maybe even in soccer. However, in the very short
run, China will not be standing in the way of the Americans in the
finals, as it did in the manic University of Georgia stadium in
1996, and as it did in the rocking Rose Bowl in California in 1999.
There is a new script.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans keep coming back. They do not appear to be as
fearsome as in 1996 and 1999 when they had two major advantages _
screaming national crowds and the greatest female player ever,
Michelle Akers, now retired from international play because of too
much stress on her weary body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she is retired, but I was happy when I didn't
see her,'' said Ismaila Mabo, the Nigerian coach.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Akers scored two goals as the Americans routed
Nigeria, 7-1, in Chicago, but more to the point, Akers showed the
way by separating opponent from ball by whatever means necessary.
Now there is no more Akers stalking her prey. Carla Overbeck, the
captain, who is recovering from Graves Disease, resides on the
bench, shouting instructions. The United States is not the same
team it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that in 1999 we lost, 7-1, and today it was
3-1,'' Mabo said. ``Perhaps the next time we play, it will be a
win. From what I saw tonight, we played better than the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nigeria forced the action with aggressiveness and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 minutes, it looked like we had all that time and
space,'' Heinrichs said about the view from the bench. ``But none
of us were in the position of having our legs ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian women come in hard and fast, cleats flying. They sent
Tiffeny Milbrett sprawling with a sore wrist and they dumped Brandi
Chastain, and Heinrichs pulled Christine Lilly and Mia Hamm before
they got hurt. And Nigeria showed growing sophistication for
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``With very little funding from their federation, they are one
of the six best teams in the world,'' Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of a wild team,'' said Julie Foudy. ``It's always
a little unsettling to play them. You have a lot of space, they
tackle hard, but sometimes they make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria took the play to America early, but the United States
went ahead on a corner kick in the 26th minute. Hamm fired past the
goalmouth, Foudy headed the ball on goal, and Chastain scored the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, Lilly fired a shot that seemed destined to
clear the goalmouth but was deflected by goalie Perpetua Nkwocha.
It could have been scored an own goal, but Lilly got credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the second half, Nigeria's most celebrated
player, Mercy Akide, turned Kate Sobrero, split two other
defenders, and flicked the ball past goalie Siri Mullinix.
Afterward, Ifeanyichukwu Chiejene performed a series of back flips
that could have earned her a gymnastics medal in far-off Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The United States scored again in the 56th minute on Shannon
MacMillan's screeching free kick over the wall and over the hands
of the goalkeeper. And although Nigeria scattered bodies and kept
the pressure on, it could not score.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans are in the semifinals, and they still haven't
played in the Olympic city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a great time in Canberra,'' Foudy said. ``We were
in Sydney for the opening ceremony, and it's a lot of chaos. We're
happy the way it is. We'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The final is in Sydney. The United States has no guarantee they
will be there, but both Nigeria and China are gone, not a bad
night's work.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Genzyme Corp. chief Henri Termeer will make
another architectural statement along the Charles River next month
when the company breaks ground for its Kendall Square headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Having a signature building, just down the river from the
company's cathedral-like manufacturing site in Boston's Allston
section, will give Genzyme a higher profile as it seeks to expand
and diversify its pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The construction comes just as Genzyme, the second-largest
biotechnology company in New England, prepares to celebrate its
20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer said he looks forward to moving, especially since his
current neighbors barely half a mile away from the new site are
construction crews building research centers for rivals Biogen Inc.
and Amgen Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around here and there is so much brick,'' said
Termeer, 54, the Dutch-born chief executive officer. ``We want to
open it up with lots of glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Building the 12-story, 285,000-square-foot headquarters caps a
decade for Genzyme as one of the nation's largest, most diversified
and profitable biotech companies. It also marks a transition.
</P>
<P>
   With a variety of early-stage drug, medical device and genetic
testing programs, Genzyme is still too dependent on a single drug
to treat one rare disease. In the coming years, it plans to expand
its rare-disease programs and move into medical areas with bigger
patient populations, such as the treatment of cancer and
cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Both tracks will result in Genzyme facing significant challenges
from new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme also must turn some of its smaller drug, device and
medical testing products into financial winners. And it must come
up with a second act to Cerezyme, its successful enzyme replacement
therapy for about 3,000 patients with Gaucher disease, a rare
inherited disorder, who pay an average of $170,000 a year for the
drug. Cerezyme and its predecessor Ceredase have been Genzyme's
money-maker, accounting for 75.3 percent of its revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Genzyme faces is not that different from the big boys in
the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in trying to find the next
blockbuster drugs,'' said William Tanner, vice president of equity
research at SG Cowen &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``To more than incrementally
grow a company's revenue is a very tough feat.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cerezyme, Genzyme saw an opportunity to become a leader in
creating lifelong medications to treat rare genetic disorders. It
is developing four more drugs, including Fabrazyme, a enzyme
replacement drug for Fabry disease, which affects more than 2,000
males.
</P>
<P>
   But while Cerezyme still has no rivals, Fabrazyme faces
head-to-head competition with Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., also of
Cambridge, which is developing a comparable product called
Replagal. Termeer maintains TKT is violating one of Genzyme's
licensed patents and has sued its rival for patent infringement _ a
charge TKT rejects as groundless.
</P>
<P>
   TKT is far from the only new competitor Genzyme faces. By the
middle of next year, Genzyme plans to launch a protein-based oral
medication to treat multiple sclerosis, an arena dominated by
injectable drugs such as Avonex from Biogen Inc. and Betaseron from
Schering A.G. of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to significantly change the effect of the progression
of multiple sclerosis disease,'' said Termeer, who declined to
reveal further details of the small molecule drug.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing new areas, Genzyme still faces hurdles with some
once-promising products and services. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --Carticel, a minimally invasive cellular therapy to repair
damaged knees using a patient's own cartilage, has taken longer
than expected to win over orthopedic surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   --Seprafilm, a plastic coating to prevent abdominal adhesions
after surgery, has taken longer than expected to gain adoption by
physicans.
</P>
<P>
   --Genetic testing services accounted for about $60 million in
sales last year but are not expected to turn a profit until this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer said Genzyme takes a 10-year view for most of its
medical investments. Like all such biotechnology investments, some
have produced few, if any, results.
</P>
<P>
   By far its biggest is the more than $200 million the company has
spent to finance seven early-stage cystic fibrosis gene therapy
programs. All have failed, although Genzyme has developed a
sophisticated genetic test for couples planning a family. Still,
the company has not given up on developing a treatment for cystic
fibrosis, licensing research from Beth Israel Deaconness Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One area that has been more successful is developing drugs on
the farm. Next year, the company expects to seek FDA approval for a
drug to treat patients who are resistant to heparin. Genzyme's
alternative is a human protein found in plasma that helps regulate
blood clotting, which is made in the milk of goats. If approved, it
will be the first human drug developed in an animal.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, in one of the biggest biotech deals this
year, Genzyme announced plans to acquire GelTex Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Waltham. Its goal: to transform GelTex's Renagel, an oral
drug for the estimated 1 million people worldwide on kidney
dialysis, into a billion-dollar blockbuster within 10 years.
Renagel's sales are expected to reach $45 million this year, up
from nearly $20 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renagel has the potential to be a standard of care in kidney
dialysis patients the way Epogen is now,'' said Peter Drake,
biotechnology analyst for Prudential Securities, referring to
Amgen's anemia-fighting drug that is the world's best-selling
biotech product. ``With Renagel, Henri Termeer just brought in the
crown jewel into the Genzyme fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is as bullish that Genzyme will be able
to transform Renagel quickly. Some question whether the ambitious
sales target of $1 billion in sales will be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Termeer points to a dramatic rise in new prescriptions since a
recent spate of scientific studies, including one from the New
England Journal of Medicine, showed that taking some competing
medications can lead to high levels of calcium and cause cardiac
problems for kidney dialysis patients. Nationwide, of the 280,000
dialysis patients with late-stage disease, 22 percent die annually
from cardiac and other medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   So to prove that Renagel is superior by reducing the mortality
rate, Genzyme plans to launch a 2,000-patient comparison study.

SEPSIS EXAM AIMS FOR AN EARLY, ACCURATE READ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year, hundreds of thousands of newborns are whisked off to
neonatal intensive care units where they are attached to
intravenous tubes that deliver antibiotics to fight off a
potentially deadly infection known as sepsis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors don't know if the infants actually have the blood
infection because there is no fast, sure-fire way to diagnose it.
In fact, most of the infants probably don't have sepsis but do have
a fever or other symptoms. Still, doctors treat the babies because
waiting even just a few hours might kill them.
</P>
<P>
   The price of treatment, however, is also high. Doctors and
researchers estimate that more than $800 million a year is spent
nationwide caring for newborns who aren't septic. And the emotional
toll is even greater, they say, causing parents tremendous worry
and grief.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Cambridge, Mass. company, CompuCyte Corp., has developed a
diagnostic test in hopes of getting an early and accurate read on
sepsis. The new test, currently under study, would give doctors a
definitive diagnosis in less than 20 minutes. Early study results
have been promising, showing a high degree of accuracy. But to be
proven effective, the test must hold up under further study.
</P>
<P>
   The company's efforts are not the first. Scientists have tried
for years to develop an effective test to detect sepsis. A
California company, Biosite Diagnostics Inc., is also working on a
test. But to be useful, doctors say, a test must be fast and
unfailingly accurate. If it misses one case in 1,000, doctors say,
that is too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the test is wrong, the baby is going to get very, very
sick,'' said Dr. John Fiascone, medical director of the neonatal
intensive care unit at New England Medical Center's Floating
Hospital for Children in Boston. ``Even if I start treatment later,
the baby may die. When a test says the infection is not there, it
has to be right. It's very hard in medicine to always be right.''
</P>
<P>
   If CompuCyte can prove in clinical trials set to begin this year
that its test would never miss a case of infection, it could become
an invaluable tool for doctors. When a baby becomes lethargic or
feverish or shows other signs of infection, a doctor could put a
drop of the infant's blood into a cartridge and insert it into a
small machine that would let the doctor know in 15 or 20 minutes if
the baby had sepsis or not.
</P>
<P>
   The test works by detecting the presence of so-called CD11b
protein markers on the surface of white blood cells. These markers
spread rapidly on cells that have been exposed to the bacteria
causing sepsis.
</P>
<P>
   An early version of the test was developed by a team of Stanford
University scientists led by Dr. Ronald L. Rabin, now an
immunologist with the National Institutes of Health. The technology
was later licensed to CompuCyte for commercial development.
CompuCyte hopes to have the test on the market late next year or
early in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sepsis is a blood infection that, left untreated, can kill an
infant in six to 48 hours from the time symptoms appear. A blood
culture can usually detect the infection but takes several hours to
return a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Since doctors can't risk waiting, they routinely administer
intravenous antibiotics to any infant they suspect might have the
infection. Nationwide, about 300,000 babies are treated each year,
although doctors estimate that only 5 to 10 percent of them
actually have the infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is massive overtreatment,'' said Timothy Holzer,
CompuCyte's vice president of biomedical development. ``You are
removing the baby from the mother, putting it in a neonatal
intensive care. It's expensive and traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   As a resident in pediatrics, Rabin experienced first-hand the
difficulty of diagnosing infants with sepsis. If they had any of
the risk factors _ low birthweight, a mother who had a bacterial
infection or hadn't gotten prenatal care _ or if they showed signs
of infection, they were sent to a neonatal intensive or critical
care unit to be treated for up to 10 days. Many of these babies
didn't have sepsis. But not treating them could be fatal so doctors
erred on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   If the test incorrectly diagnoses a small percentage of infants
with the infection, Rabin said, that would be OK. But, he said, it
can not miss any infants with the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Early results show that the test is highly sensitive. In a study
of 106 infants, he said, the test correctly diagnosed all but one
infant who was too premature to mount the immune response the test
depends on to make its diagnosis. In that case, however, Rabin
said, any doctor would know to treat the premature baby.
</P>
<P>
   If the test works, Fiascone, the neonatologist at New England
Medical Center, said it would be a tremendous tool for doctors. But
even if the earlier results were confirmed in clinical trials with
large numbers of infants, he said, he would proceed cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test has got a very rigorous standard to meet,'' he said.
``It would take some really good studies and then some time to get
clinical experience in my hands and my colleagues' hands. With a
lot of other things, you get a second chance. With this, you
don't.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   `I'm a freak for the Internet,'' Chuck Fishman says. ``I really
need to know what's going on with my job when I'm away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishman, a producer at a San Francisco radio station, is wired
to work. His fax almost always hums; his computer rarely sleeps.
His work week is sometimes indistinguishable from his days off. He
is so connected that he took a laptop computer with him while
honeymooning in Hawaii this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get between 200 to 300 e-mails per day, so, I bring (the
computer) wherever I go,'' he said. ``I dial in at the airport and
just about anywhere. My wife said, `Don't bring it on our
honeymoon.' But I brought it anyway. I didn't want to be clueless
when I got back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   If statistics from a new survey by Andersen Consulting are an
accurate assessment of our modern worklives, then Chuck Fishman is
a sort of Everyman. He thrives on connectivity, though he admits
that he, like the technical gadgets that enable him to do his job,
almost never shuts down. To do so, would cause him to lose his
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Is Fishman's experience akin to the typical worker's? It appears
so. Fifty-six percent of working Americans carried a cell phone
while on vacation this year, 16 percent took a laptop, and 13
percent took a pager, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide poll of 306 full-time workers with yearly
household incomes of $75,000 and above found that nearly all the
respondents who live in the Northeast, about 89 percent, kept in
touch with the office on their most recent vacation or their
previous one. Seventy-five percent of the Midwesterners were wired
to work, 84 percent of the Southerners, and 82 percent of those
living out West.
</P>
<P>
   A plurality of the people polled (33 percent) said they weren't
thrilled about their inability to break free but recognized the
need to stay in touch while away from the office. Twenty-five
percent said they worry about returning to a backlog, 25 percent
were ``grateful that we have the technology to stay in touch,'' 10
percent resented having to stay in touch with the office during
time off, and 7 percent told researchers that they ``liked being
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Andersen Consulting Institute for Strategic
Change in Cambridge, Mass., Thomas Davenport, 45, spends a lot of
time thinking about technology's impact on his work and personal
life as well as its influence on others.
</P>
<P>
   He, like Fishman, is a knowledge worker. Like many of his peers,
Davenport said, ``My brain does not, cannot, shut down, not even
when I am on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at home, at the office, on airplanes,'' he said. ``I
work anywhere. More and more. The dividing line between work and
the rest of life is disappearing. . . . I have mixed feelings about
that in my own personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about his near-constant connection to work surfaced
when the Davenport family was on vacation and the line between work
and play blurred to the point that the children wondered about his
status: Was he available for softball, swimming, a bike ride? Or
was he really at work, but in surroundings more conducive to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that, like everybody else, I would take two-week
vacations and not do any work during that period,'' said Davenport,
whose sons are ages 11 and 14. ``But for the last several years, I
have not done that at all. It is getting harder and harder to
distinguish between a work day and a vacation day.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's wife, Jodi, said the family has adjusted by making
choices about how they spend time. The Davenports assign more time
to dinner and bedtime. The entire family eats dinner together, and
both parents are usually present. The hours preceding bedtime are
even more important. ``We hold the reading hour before bedtime
sacred,'' Jodi Davenport said. ``The children are more relaxed,
because it is the half-hour before bedtime. A lot of opening up
happens at this time. The phone does not get answered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davenports have held on to these traditions. Friends,
relatives, even business associates know the family does not
respond to telephone calls at dinner or before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, everybody worked in the office and took a
vacation in the summer,'' said Thomas Davenport. ``Now, you must
make a choice. . . . Knowledge workers are no longer bound by the
clock. It is their brain they are being paid for, not their
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many of us talk, with a hint of longing, about the old
days, when snail mail, rather than e-mail, dominated our lives and
9-to-5 wasn't an oxymoron. But for all our complaints about being
part of the wired-to-work revolution, we still thrive on being
connected.

JOB SEEKERS CHECK MESSAGE BOARDS FOR WORD ON A WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After logging on to a message board and reading an anonymous
posting about a prospective employer's culture and hours, Web
producer Kathleen Duffy didn't waste time: She verified the
scuttlebutt by contacting one of the firm's employees and then
turned the recruiters down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company described itself as having an open culture, a
place that wasn't too picky about when you came in or when you
left,'' said Duffy, who lives and works in New York. ``But I
learned from the posting that there was a lot of micromanaging, and
. . . you had to put in 12 hours a day, whether you needed to be
there or not. I was really eager to get out of my old job, but
canceled that interview. Why waste my time?''
</P>
<P>
   The office water cooler, once a central meeting place where
workers swapped rumors and real news, has moved online to message
boards that offer everything from gossip to financial data about
prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the discussion boards appear on career sites aimed at a
young, educated crowd. Greedyassociates.com, an affiliate of
Amazon.com, targets newly minted attorneys. Wetfeet.com, which says
it ``offers real people profiles and the inside scoop on hot
industries,'' appeals to recent college graduates. Management
consultants, bankers, and high-tech professionals in financial
services rely on Vault.com, the message board Duffy used. The
company says 5,000 to 7,000 visitors log on weekly to scan for
information on about 3,000 companies and 70 industries.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the sites can be valuable job-screening
tools, but they warn that message-board postings should not be a
job applicant's sole source of information about a potential
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people use different sources and also talk to (individuals)
who actually work at a company, as opposed to simply relying on an
anonymous listing on a message board, they can get a complete
picture,'' said Butch Price, vice president of Kurt Salmon
Associates, a management-consulting firm based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bookbinder, a consultant at Towers Perrin in Boston,
believes the appearance of office gossip, rumors, and legitimate
workplace news on the Web marks a significant shift in the way
workers communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people talked among themselves about a company,''
he said. ``Now, the talk is beyond company lines. People want
information from the rank and file about what it is like to work at
an organization, and they want their information frank, and they
want it straight, which means companies have to be upfront when
they communicate. It also means learning to use the Internet more
successfully and being more open about the workplace and what the
company hopes to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Vault.com, one of the most prominent sites, has gained a
reputation for anonymous, in-your-face postings. However, company
spokesperson Kate Kaibni described most of the postings to the
board as positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, companies will go online, and sometimes
they'll say, `Look, we're hiring,' '' she said. ``This is also the
place that you go to for information from people who will be
brutally honest and will give you the lowdown, the scoop just the
way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Economics also drives the trend. Kennedy Information, a New
Hampshire publisher of recruitment news and research, produced a
paper version of its online site, ExecutiveAgent.com, for years.
But when the percentage of people using the Web as a job-search
tool and a source of revenue began to increase, the company took
the service online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, less than 10 percent of all executives used the
Internet as part of their job search,'' said Wayne Cooper,
president of Kennedy Information. ``Today, well over 60 percent are
using it as part of the job search. That includes researching and
evaluating job opportunities to actually honing in on a company and
studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said his company expanded its site, which offers career
planning and advice to executives with six-figure incomes, to
include links to Vault.com and to Hoovers.com, a provider of
corporate reports and company financials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage people to visit Hoovers to get financial
background and to check out Vault.com for the latest gossip,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies _ concerned about their online image _ are
monitoring message boards daily, in order to find misinformation,
clarify their stance on workplace issues, and keep abreast of
employees' concerns. Kyle Shannon, cofounder of Agency.com,
responded to messages that appeared on Vault.com last year by
posting a candid, online letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some comments referred to the early days of the company as a
place where people worked extremely long hours for decent (but not
stellar) pay and the occasional pat on the back,'' wrote Shannon.
``It was a startup in a startup industry. . . . We started the
company with (literally) $80, which meant it was a tightly run,
bootstrap organization. . . . We've grown from about 120 people to
over 800!''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to comments about the company's earlier years, Shannon
concluded: ``Did we make mistakes? Of course. Will we make mistakes
going forward? Of course, but we are passionately committed to
building a great company with (the) most talented people on the
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon invited the writers to contact him personally. Then, he
made it plain that he took the griping seriously and would consider
the criticisms when making changes at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Kurt Salmon's Price fired off an online response to a
posting on Vault.com, in which top managers at his firm were
described as old. ``Our CEO is 48, our senior management team
averages mid-40s, hardly a geriatric group!'' Price wrote in his
online missive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch Vault.com,'' he said in an interview. ``If things are
being said against our company, we'd like to know what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Most employers, like Shannon and Price, have taken in stride the
comments on message boards, at least so far. But not all companies
have tolerated employee kvetching on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, Raytheon Co. filed suit against 21 people it
believed were current and former employees, alleging that they had

RECORDING INDUSTRY FACES MUSIC ABOUT DISTRIBUTING ON NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the nation's courtrooms, the big music recording companies
are winning their fight to keep Internet companies from
distributing their music for free. But on every other front, the
record companies are losing.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3.com Web site faces millions in damages for providing
unauthorized recordings of pop tunes. Meanwhile, the Internet music
service Napster is fighting for its life. This week the company
returns to federal court to fend off an injunction that would force
it to stop its members from trading illegal music files. In both
cases, federal judges have made it clear that music pirates can
expect severe penalties at the bar of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the public's appetite for Internet music just keeps growing.
Napster's user base rose from 1.1 million users in February to 4.9
million in July. And other music trading services like Gnutella and
Aimster are also flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad that Sony Music Entertainment must fight off
defections among its own musical artists. The Los Angeles Times on
Friday reported that The Offspring, one of Sony's more popular
acts, will give away free digital copies of its new album on the
Internet, in an effort to drum up more sales for the CD, which
isn't due out for another month. Sony executives expressed ``very
real concerns'' about the wisdom of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Offspring's move only underscores the perception that the
world's five major music companies _ Sony, BMG Entertainment, EMI
Recorded Music, Universal Music Group, and the Warner Music Group _
are taking their sweet time about offering consumers a legal way to
get music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old story. Up pops a new technology that threatens a
well-established industry and offers vast new opportunities. But
complacency or fear of change prevails, and the established
business rejects the breakthrough, with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most spectacular example involved the Internet of
the 19th century. In 1877, Gardiner Hubbard, an executive from a
small start-up company, made an offer to an industrial titan.
Hubbard was willing to sell his business for $100,000 to the
corporate bigwig _ William Orton, president of Western Union Co.
Orton declined. He already had a strong business, and nobody needed
to transmit voices over a wire. Owning the Bell Telephone Co. would
be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seems as though the music moguls are as myopic as
Orton. Napster's success proves there's a vast market for digital
tunes. So why isn't the recording industry scrambling to sell its
music that way?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, the answer was they were afraid to do it,'' says
Eric Scheirer, a digital entertainment analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason. A customer might pay for the latest MP3
from Aerosmith but then decide to share it with friends. Soon
thousands of perfect digital copies have been made from the
original, and neither Aerosmith nor their record label sees a penny
of profit.
</P>
<P>
   But Scheirer says the industry's fear of digital music is slowly
starting to wane, as it begins to consider technology that could
prevent wholesale music piracy. But whether the recording industry
is really ready to embrace the Internet, after decades of
controlling music distribution on its own terms, remains to be
seen. And even if the industry does move in that direction, it
still must overcome some formidable hurdles that may further delay
any major changes in the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
   Music executives think they can solve the piracy problem with a
technology called ``digital rights management'' or DRM. The system
locks a digital music file inside special encryption software that
renders it unplayable unless it's paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have developed systems that attach DRM data to
compressed music files, and MP3 playback devices and software are
adding the ability to recognize DRM-encoded files. But DRM has a
large loophole. Consumers can still buy the music on old-fashioned
CDs, and make pirated MP3 copies of that.
</P>
<P>
   The recording and consumer electronics industries think they've
got the beginnings of an answer. The Secure Digital Music
Initiative is a consortium of 200 firms that has begun to build a
system to make CDs virtually piracy-proof.
</P>
<P>
   SDMI uses a ``digital watermark,'' a silent digital data stream
that can be permanently embedded in a file. The makers of digital
music players such as Sony Electronics will include software that
recognizes the SDMI watermark.
</P>
<P>
   When a CD track is converted to MP3, the music is compressed.
This alters the watermark. An SDMI-compliant device will detect the
change and refuse to play back the file. SDMI discs can also
include digital rights management. It might allow the user to make
one or two digital copies, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   The SDMI system is being introduced in two phases, with the
full-fledged version expected to appear next year. With nearly
every major player in music, software, and home electronics on
board, eventually all music products will use SDMI as a matter of
course. Even would-be cheaters will be hard-pressed to find a music
player or CD that doesn't use the watermarking system.
</P>
<P>
   But a similar antipiracy effort launched by the computer
software industry in the 1980s failed miserably. Firms added ``copy
protection'' features to their software disks, to stop illegal
copying. But copy protection often made it impossible to reinstall
software after a system crash, or make an emergency backup.
Consumers hated it.
</P>
<P>
   More important, hackers soon found ways to defeat the
technology, causing the software industry to abandon the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Scheirer foresees the same woes for SDMI and digital rights
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rules are about preventing the consumer from doing what
he wants to do,'' he says. People will try to crack the systems,
and Scheirer bets someone will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   SDMI hopes to forestall this by holding a contest in which
hackers can win $10,000 if they outwit the watermarking technology.
But the hacker community has reacted with sneering contempt. Don
Marti, the technical editor of Linux Journal, a popular technology
publication, has written an open letter to SDMI urging fellow
hackers not to take part in the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose the security features do work. Can we expect a new
era of low-cost, legitimate digital music? Not just yet. There's
another barrier to overcome _ the musicians themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get permissions and clearances and copyrights,
stuff that companies like Napster never have to do,'' says Cary
Sherman, general counsel of the Recording Industry Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many contracts include clauses that limit the
issuance of individual cuts from an album.
</P>
<P>
   There are also artists whose contracts forbid ``coupling'' _ the
practice of combining songs from several different performers into
a single album.
</P>
<P>
   And every contract is different. So the big five recording firms
must review each contract, and renegotiate many of them, before
distributing music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music Group says it has 1,000 albums ready for digital
distribution, but had to review the artists' contracts before they
could be released. These albums will become available online
starting in November.
</P>
<P>
   But the artists aren't the only ones who must be placated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've also got existing retail relationships you want to
preserve,'' notes Sherman of the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   Major dealers like Tower Records and Sam Goody, small
mom-and-pop record shops, big regional distributors _ all of them
will be threatened by a move to Internet music sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the recording industry can't afford to alienate them,
because until they've made the transition to online selling, most
of their profits will still come from over-the-counter sales of
plastic discs.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping their partners happy while preparing to cut them off at
the knees will require the business cunning of Bill Gates and the
negotiating skill of Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``they've lost a lot of the leverage they had in
controlling distribution,'' says Scheirer.
</P>
<P>
   With digital music, artists no longer need the record companies
and their distribution chains to get their products to the public.
Granted, lesser-known bands still need promotion and marketing, but
new independent firms like Digital Brandcasting of Los Angeles are
already springing up to provide this service to Internet-based
bands. By sacrificing their traditional distribution chains, the
music firms lose most of their control over the artists.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises doubts about whether the companies are truly
committed to embracing an Internet business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to guess now, I'd have to say no,'' concludes
Scheirer. ``They're going to continue to sell lots of CDs, but
they're going to lose a lot of money through Internet
cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA's Sherman insists that his industry has seen the light,
and will shift into online mode as quickly as possible.
``Conducting a legitimate business appears to take longer than
conducting a pirate business,'' Sherman says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, music recordings worth billions of dollars stream
across the Internet, each of them a defeat for the record industry
that no court in the land can reverse.

MANY EXECUTIVES REAP PROFITS EVEN IF THEIR FIRMS DON'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says those young, hot-shot technology companies aren't
profitable?
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies with initial public stock offerings in the
recent past are struggling to climb into the black, or even build
substantial revenues in some cases. But executives running many of
those companies are making huge profits selling shares of their own
businesses in the public stock market.
</P>
<P>
   We looked up the management stock-selling records from
Massachusetts companies that went public last year and compared
them to the performance of the actual business those executives
run.
</P>
<P>
   The state's IPO class of 1999 included some of the stock
market's hottest new names, such as Sycamore Networks Inc. of
Chelmsford, Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, and Art
Technology Group Inc., also based in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for selecting the class of '99: Those companies
have been public long enough for ``lock-up'' periods that restrict
insider sales to expire, at least partially, in every case.
</P>
<P>
   The results: Managers running a handful of the best-performing
IPO companies sold about $800 million worth of stock, more than
twice the revenues those same companies have generated in their
public-stock lives. Only a few of them had corporate profits of any
kind to report.
</P>
<P>
   None of those stock sales takes into account millions of shares
sold by outside directors representing venture capital investment
firms or institutions that owned shares through venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   Our question: Will there ever come a time when profits earned by
those companies exceed the amount of money earned by managers
selling their stock? If not, what's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Many of the local companies that went public in 1999 boast
wonderful technology and great things to come. But technology has a
habit of changing so quickly that it's difficult to tell whether
today's king will still be on top or just an also-ran a few years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc., one of the stock market's most
successful IPOs ever, tends to dominate any kind of list that
includes the company. This one is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Desh Despande has sold about $132 million worth of
Sycamore stock since lock-up periods restricting managers lapsed.
President Dan Smith sold about $108 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's senior managers, a group of nine executives, have
sold an estimated $600 million worth of company stock, by our
count.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, their optical networking equipment company has
performed spectacularly for a young business. Sycamore has posted
sales, while public, of more than $178 million. It has reported a
profit in each of its last two quarters, most recently earning $18
million.
</P>
<P>
   Other local IPOs could claim their share of heavyweight stock
sellers on the management team.
</P>
<P>
   At Akamai, cofounders Dan Lewin and F. Thomson Leighton each
sold about $30 million in stock over the summer. Akamai managers as
a group have sold about $76 million in stock, or nearly three times
revenues the company has reported in its three public quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which specializes in services that improve the speed and
reliability of Web sites, has never reported a quarterly profit and
posted an operating loss that widened to $43 million in its most
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At Art Technology Group, the company's management team has sold
about $58 million in stock. Chief executive Jeet Singh is the
biggest seller in the group, moving about $20 million worth of Art
Technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company has recorded sales of $75.6 million in four public
quarters and turned a profit for the first time in the most recent
three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives at young technology companies assert that
management stock sales are normally part of a careful
diversification plan and the fact that they generate big profits is
simply a function of prices the stock market puts on their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Managers who made the most money selling stock actually unloaded
a very small percentage of their company ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Despande has sold a bit less than 1.2 million Sycamore shares,
but his ownership of the company was in the range of 40 million
shares prior to those transactions. Smith, who sold 1 million
shares, owned a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai officials said all of its managers continue to own at
least 90 percent of the stock they started with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good argument to say insiders are cashing out while
stock prices are sky high and public holders are left holding the
bag,'' said Singh, the chief executive at Art Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have access to our stock are free to sell any time
they want. They are locked up a lot less than insiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh said his sales, like those of other company managers,
follow a fixed schedule in which executives agree to sell shares
regardless of price. The company sets the schedule to avoid the
appearance that managers are dumping stock because of problems
inside the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, who has sold 290,000 shares, continues to own more than
6.5 million Art Technology Group shares.
</P>
<P>
   Big insider sales clearly have become the norm among the
best-performing stocks to come out of the Massachusetts IPO class
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're talking about NetSilicon Inc. of
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Netsilicon shares have earned the fouth-best return in that
group since going public, rising 267 percent (Art Technology Group
tops the list with a gain of 1,398 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Netsilicon was spun off from a public parent, Osicom
Technologies Inc., and managers received options at the IPO price.
Today, employees own stock or options that account for about 25
percent of the company's ownership (worth about $80 million) and
senior managers hold most of that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Insider sales to date: zippo.
</P>
<P>
   Netsilicon's chief financial officer, Dan Sullivan, said he has
discouraged managers from selling any of their options and they
have all held on so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't send a good message to the Street and I want them
to own a piece of this company,'' said Sullivan. ``Call it a Yankee
frugal approach to life, but we worked our butts off to get to this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he once worked at another company in which a
venture capitalist sold shares for the right reasons but at the
wrong time and the stock took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   He said that life lesson informs his advice to Netsilicon
managers about their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked them to be part of the team and being on the team
means not selling your options right now,'' he said.

PROPOSAL WOULD LIMIT `ORPHAN DRUG' MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG and NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A House subcommittee last week heard testimony on proposed
changes that, in some cases, would limit the market exclusivity
granted under the Orphan Drug Act.
</P>
<P>
   The modifications to the law are opposed by Biogen Inc. and the
National Organization of Rare Diseases but endorsed by Serono Inc.
of Norwell.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Mac Thornberry, a Republican, claims the way
the US Food and Drug Administration interprets a section of the law
unfairly extends protection of some drugs to the detriment of new
ones. Thornberry's wife Sally has multiple sclerosis, one of the
diseases whose treatment is covered under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, aimed at encouraging the development of treatments of
rare diseases for small patient populations, gives a drug maker a
seven-year period of exclusivity before competitors can enter the
market. More than 200 drugs have received ``orphan drug'' status,
including Avonex from Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   The law does allow the FDA to grant the status to additional
drugs found to be more effective than existing ones. However,
Thornberry, in a statement, claims the FDA has ``turned this
incentive on its head by effectively extending _ or evergreening _
the period of exclusivity for an entire category of drugs beyond
the seven-year limit.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern comes after the FDA rejected Serono's application
for ``orphan drug'' status because its drug, called Rebif, was not
found to be significantly different from Avonex, the leading
multiple sclerosis medication. Thus, Serono is barred from
competing against Biogen's Avonex until May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serono says its drug is better than Avonex, but there is no

National Organization of Rare Diseases. ``Yet the company went to
Congress to change the law that has worked quite well for 17
years.''

   After weathering some tough years in the biotech industry, Atlas
Venture, a Boston-based venture capital firm, said this has been a
record year for its life sciences investments.
</P>
<P>
   Seven biotech companies in its portfolio have gone public since
April, raising more than $750 million. As of Sept. 1, those company
had reached a combined market capitalization of more than $7
billion, the venture firm said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven companies include Variagenics Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass.; and Switzerland's Actelion Ltd. and Modex Therapeutiques SA,
Iceland's deCODE genetics Inc., San Francisco's Exelixis Inc.,
Germany's MediGene AG and Canada's Neurochem Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' stock prices shot up after their IPOs, and some
are still trading at double or triple their offering price.
Nationally, this has been a banner year for biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 50 of Atlas Venture's 189 portfolio companies are in the
life sciences area. The firm, founded in 1980, manages five
international funds and $1.6 billion in committed capital.

   ZYCOS Inc., a privately held Lexington, Mass. company, said
Tuesday it has licensed exclusive rights to develop products based
on a unique cancer-related protein discovered by researchers at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the protein, called P450 CYP1B1, is expressed
in nearly every major type of human cancer and has enormous
potential as a broad anti-cancer drug target. The protein is not
expressed in normal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really remarkable,'' said Mark A. Philip, the company's
president and chief executive. ``It's expressed in bladder, brain,
breast, colon cancers, and the list goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the company's DNA-based technologies, Philip said, he
expects to have drugs based on the protein in human clinical trials
in 18 months. Philip said the company uses a unique approach that
can rapidly turn genetic information into drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ZYCOS used the approach to develop a product to treat diseases
caused by the human papillomavirus. The product is in human
clinical trials. The company also has an anti-inflammatory drug in
development.

   Lexigen Pharmaceuticals, a Lexington, Mass. company owned by
Merck KgaA of Germany, broke ground at the site of its future
headquarters on the border of Bedford, Billerica and Burlington,
Mass.

<P>
   In the project's first phase, expected to cost $46 million, the
company will build two research and development and administrative
sites. Later plans include the construction of a production lab and
three additional research facilities. The company expects to move
to the site in 2002.

`GUILD' BUILDING IN THE NEW CONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Followers of the comic strip ``Adam'' had reason to wonder what
was going on when, after 10 years of starring as a stay-at-home
husband who babysat the kids and did the laundry, Adam acquired a
computer and began doing work via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1994, and cartoonist Brian Basset, 42, says the
explanation was simple: ``I lost my job.'' His job as political
cartoonist at the Seattle Times had been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly I found myself at home, being Adam,'' and thrust into
the world of telecommuters, online freelancers, independent
contractors and ``temp'' workers _ and of their problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big world, and getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one-quarter of American workers _ 30 million people
or more _ can be categorized as ``mobile workers,'' according to
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Thomas W. Malone,
who is cochairman of an MIT project studying the impact of the
Information Age on societal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They don't hold traditional full-time jobs, but instead work on
their own, from their homes or their cars when on the road, or for
temporary staffing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Malone calls them e-lancers, and they share a common list of
problems. The leading one is how to get the health insurance and
retirement plan benefits that 9-to-5ers take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone worries also about another category of intangible
benefits that are the grist of workaday life in offices and
factories _ the on-the-job training that builds and maintains work
skills, the challenge and satisfaction of working in teams, and
water-cooler gossip that forewarns of changes and trends, not only
within a company but in entire industries.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who teaches at MIT's Sloan School of Management, says
that without these workplace ``safety nets'' the e-lancers of the
new economy risk spending their work lives in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be, in many ways, a lonely and unpleasant life,'' he
says. ``Where do you go to socialize? Where do you go to share war
stories? These are needs that people have, and that in the
traditional world were filled by stable, long-term jobs in a
workplace. How will these needs be filled in the world of the
future?''
</P>
<P>
   Malone says new organizations will have to be developed to fill
these voids. He calls them ``guilds,'' because he thinks they will
resemble the artisan and craft guilds of the Middle Ages, set up to
train apprentices, maintain social bonds, and provide benefits to
members and their families in time of need.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Malone and Robert Laubacher, who works with him on
the MIT project as a research associate, see signs of such
organizations evolving on their own.
</P>
<P>
   One is the work of a nonprofit group, Working Today Inc., which
this fall will begin offering group health insurance to workers in
New York City's ``Silicon Alley'' industries _ interactive media
and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Working Today's founder and chief executive, Sara Horowitz, said
as many as 1,000 people who can't get this coverage now are
expected to enroll and, because of their group advantage, pay rates
at least 30 percent below those for individual coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, temporary staffing agencies have taken a lead in
turning what used to be called ``temp'' jobs into the equivalent of
full-time employment _ designing programs to assure year-round work
assignments, offering training to upgrade computer skills and
qualify for higher rates of pay, and providing health care
packages, retirement plans, and scheduled vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies also have set up newsletters and online ``chat
rooms'' that are aimed at building loyalty in a business where
worker turnover runs as high as 300 percent. But they see little
interest in programs promoting social contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are freelancers,'' says Steven Kapner, cofounder and a
director of Boston's Aquent Inc. ``They don't want to be part of a
community. They want to be freelancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohling, senior vice president for human resources at CDI
Corp., a national agency that is helping finance Malone's work,
adds: ``Our technical people tell us, `Get me the assignment and
the money. I'll take care of my own time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shifting to a freelance life from a full-time job with an office
and benefits didn't come easily for Basset.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Adam'' comic strip, which is independently syndicated to
newspapers nationwide, provided some income, but not enough for a
family of four. Basset's wife, Linda, took a job as a social worker
to help make ends meet _ and, more importantly, to get health and
dental insurance at group rates.
</P>
<P>
   And now truly in the role of his comic character, Basset began
developing new routines to avoid feeling isolated. He became a
morning regular at Seattle's coffee houses after driving his two
boys to school _ settling in with other latte-lovers who brought
their laptops and kept them at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he continues, ``I started finding myself going to Kinko's
at midnight _ for the social interaction. I could have done the
work in the morning, but why not go in and talk baseball or
whatever with the guy on the graveyard shift?''
</P>
<P>
   And soon the comic strip had a new name: ``Adam(at)home.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, the strip now appears in more than 200
newspapers, and the launch in May of a second comic, ``Red and
Rover,'' has boosted the Basset family's income to where Linda
could quit her job.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks is still a daily stop for him, vital for developing
ideas for the ``Adam'' strip.

ESTABLISHED FIRMS LOOKING TO TECHNO-LITERATE FOR BOARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lewis Campbell decided Textron Inc. had to get serious
about the Internet, he knew where he needed to start: at the top.
</P>
<P>
   First came the money. In January, the chief executive of the
Providence maker of helicopters and military equipment inked a $100
million investment in an Internet incubator, to tap new ideas and
send a message to his troops. Then he shipped his top 30 managers
to Chicago for five long weeks to set Web strategy and study the
new economy. And he didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell felt Textron's corporate directors had to understand
what was at stake. He had the panel of industry giants and retired
CEOs sit through a ``JumpSmart'' tech session, a full day of
intensive discussions with Web gurus and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have board meetings now, there are a lot more
insightful questions,'' said Ken Bohlen, Textron's chief innovation
officer and JumpSmart director. ``We've created this expectation.
They now want to know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, few Fortune 1,000 companies gave more than
a passing thought to the Internet. Corporate directors figured the
Web hype, like a teen pop song, would fade, even as ambitous young
entrepreneurs were launching high-tech start-ups at a record pace _
and wooing gray-haired talent to help them invade the turf of
established companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, quite suddenly, Amazon became a verb _ as in, ``getting
Amazon'd.''
</P>
<P>
   CEOs across the country got religion, after watching publishing
giant Barnes and Noble Inc. face the lightning-fast rise of a new
rival in Seattle online bookseller Amazon.com. The call to arms
first meant lining up company insiders to address basic Web needs.
The next wave is now upon them: bringing Internet-savvy directors
to the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Fish, chief executive at Citizens Financial Group Inc.,
has been mulling the Internet dilemma for his own $30 billion
banking group and as a member of Textron's board. About mid-1999, a
year later than he would have liked, he said, ``I began recognizing
that I needed to act boldly in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish's first move, in January, was to assign Citizens marketing
director Hal Tovin to start an e-business initiative, overseeing
everything from dot-com partnerships to online banking efforts.
Then Fish set out to add a new economy member to the board, no
simple task at a time when such executives are busily growing their
own ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see banks as the old economy,'' Fish said. ``They want to
know if they have to stay for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But he persisted. This week, Steven Dodge, chief executive of
American Tower Corp., a leading independent owner of communications
towers, will join the Citizens board. It's a coup, Fish said, both
to help the board stay abreast of the future in wireless
technology, and because many of the bank's customers are high-tech
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fish said having technology-savvy board members is ``extremely
important.'' And he's not done yet. ``I want another. I'm looking
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting directors behind Web strategies is becoming increasingly
important. Once seen as a marketing gimmick, the Internet has
evolved into a kind of utility, or a tool that can improve
efficiency and cut costs, if not completely revamp the way some
industries operate.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies are spending upward of $10 million, on average,
to improve their Web sites and databases, and to weave the Internet
into the way they do business, according to Mainspring .com, a
Cambridge consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these efforts, many of the companies still do not
have board members or executives who are well versed in the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get really nervous as an investor when I look at a board and
see that most of the directors are in the 60s,'' said Ming Tsai, a
senior vice president at Mainspring. Putting established business
people on boards is important, he noted, ``But how is that board
really going to guide that company into the new economy if they
don't understand it?''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai said projects with Fortune 1,000 companies typically start
at the CEO or chief technology officer level. Often, there are
dozens of Internet projects underway across a company, Tsai said,
with no coherent plan behind them. CEOs are willing to spend their
resources only on the most promising ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet strategy has to be deeply embedded in business
strategy,'' Tsai said. ``Otherwise, it's just an interesting
technology play.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Carter, chairman of State Street Corp., is also working
to attract a technology executive to the board. ``We're actively
seeking some people from the new economy,'' he said. But ``a lot of
them don't have time to be on a board.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Carter and his successor, David Spina, set up
an e-business task force a year ago to identify how to best use the
Web at Boston-based State Street, which relies heavily on
technology to provide accounting, record keeping, and investment
services to mutual funds and other large businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bowen, who was named to lead the effort, spent the first
two months meeting with Internet experts, including strategists at
Harvard Business School, thanks to introductions from State Street
director Jim Cash, a Harvard faculty member who Carter says has the
best working knowledge of the Web on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet's really not about a technology challenge,''
Bowen said. ``It's really about a business model challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a while for many large companies and their boards to
see the Web as more than a place to peddle sweaters and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is not just a platform for Ford to sell cars. It can
help Ford engineers around the globe cooperate on a project and
share documents in online meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can speed mundane supply ordering, from pencils to
light bulbs, and it is an efficient way to handle an array of
personnel matters, including health insurance benefits and
retirement plan changes.
</P>
<P>
   While Textron has no Internet-grounded board members yet, its
Web boot camp for directors has paid dividends. Textron has a new
e-procurement system, used to better manage office and factory
supplies and ordering, that will save an estimated $150 million
over the next three years. That should mean 10 cents a share to
investors in 2001 (earnings are estimated at $5.35 a share) and 15
cents a share in 2002, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a push from the top to be aggressive about the Internet,
it's almost impossible to move ahead. Consider the experience of
Nvest LP, a Boston-based investment firm that has owned the domain
name mutualfunds.com since 1994. At least as far back as early
1999, the company knew it should do something to exploit such a
valuable name.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until nearly a year later that Bruce Speca, former
chief executive of the New England Funds, a unit of Nvest, quit to
build a company around mutualfunds.com. The group is trying to
raise venture capital, but the market's fascination with hot domain
names has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, we didn't spend a lot of time on the value of
the URL prior to last year,'' Speca said. ``Now there's a little
bit of a backlash against dot-coms.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the moment is important these days, as legions of
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in their 20s will attest.
Staples Inc.'s Tom Stemberg is one CEO who can take credit for
having moved quickly, despite a host of pressure from Wall Street
to keep his eye on profits instead of a costly online venture.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, the new business development team at the
Framingham-based office superstore company presented a Web business
model to Stemberg. The meeting was to have lasted two hours but
instead went for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1998, Staples.com launched. Stemberg brought eBay
Inc. chief executive Margaret Whitman to the parent board in March
1999. And by that summer, spokesman Tom Nutile said, ``We had
decided to really grow Staples.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The online operation hasn't turned a profit yet. It posted a
pretax loss of $29.8 million in the second quarter. But its
revenues grew sixfold in a year, to $95.7 million in the period. In
August, Staples.com was the 14th-most active site for sales in the
country, with 140,000 buyers making purchases, according to PC Data
Online in Reston, Va..
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy to attract the best and brightest of the new
economy to the boards of older companies. Andy Hunter, chief
executive of Whitehead Mann Pendleton James, an executive
recruiting firm in Boston, said a 27-year-old whiz kid simply
doesn't cut it on the board of a complex company. On the other
hand, he said, ``You can't help but look at the new economy and
say, `What are they doing over there? We should be party to that
thinking.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, the Mainspring consultant, agreed that a loose cannon is
not helpful in the boardroom. The ideal director, he suggested,
``is someone who has a combination of really understanding the new
economy, rooted in the scars of the old economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America could be in for some dramatic changes, as
technology wizards take their seats at the boardroom table. But it
will take time. At Citizens Bank, Fish said, directors still wear
ties to board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far.''

WEB RETAILERS' GROWTH SPURT MAY BE EBBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are the Wild West days of Web retailing over?
</P>
<P>
   Big chains feel smug, now that they have pushed many of their
virtual competitors to the sidelines. Investors yawn at the mention
of Internet stores. And one new forecast suggests that the growth
rate of online retail sales, while still robust, will slow for
another holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   After tripling in 1998 and more than doubling last year, online
retail sales for the holidays are expected to climb 66 percent this
year, to $11.6 billion, according to a report to be released
 &UR; today &LR;  by Jupiter Communications, a New York-based Internet
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the slower growth rate, holiday sales online are still
impressive, especially compared to the single-digit increases
typical in traditional retailing. But as the young Web marketplace
begins to mature, Internet stores must become more realistic about
their expectations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obscene growth rates can't continue,'' said Heather
Dougherty, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``It's just the
law of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for the caveat: Predicting Internet sales is a tricky
business, and projections rarely jibe because firms use different
tools to measure different services and goods during different time
periods. Last year, forecasts for holiday spending online ranged
from $4 billion to $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimated that Americans spent $5.3
billion online in the fourth quarter of 1999, but that number
included the sale of building materials and automobiles along with
books, toys, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   A Jupiter Communications competitor, Forrester Research, is more
optimistic about online sales growth this holiday season. The
Internet research firm based in Cambridge expects Internet sales to
double to $10 billion in the last five weeks of the year from $5
billion at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is clear that Internet hype is fading.
Investors who once applauded dot-coms' mad spending sprees are now
spurning money-losing online retailers. With a new appreciation for
profits, dot-coms have been slashing advertising costs and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas, online retailers also must ease consumers'
fears about security breaches, privacy issues, and botched
deliveries, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to tell them back in April: `Prepare, prepare,
prepare,' '' Dougherty said. ``It will be nice to see if they
listened . . . because every news station is waiting to interview
the guy who didn't get his package delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing concerns about online security, Web sites
continue to have problems protecting customer data. Just last week,
Eve.com temporarily shut down its beauty supplies site after a
software developer discovered a breach that allowed access to
information on thousands of customer orders. And although most
hacking incidents go unreported, America Online Inc. acknowledged
in June that someone had nosed through 200 member accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Internet retailers have downplayed security
concerns. They say sending credit-card numbers over the Web is no
different than handing the plastic to a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant Phil Terry disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different online,'' said Terry, chief executive of
Creative Good Inc., an Internet consulting firm in New York.
``People are comfortable with the restaurant interface. But if
dishes were flying all over the place, you couldn't figure out how
to order and if things were hanging upside down . . . you probably
would not hand over your credit card.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com Inc., a Waltham online retailer, ignited another
controversy this spring after it went bankrupt and tried to auction
off its customer data. Like many Web sites, Toysmart.com promised
e-shoppers that it would never share their information.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission sued Toysmart.com in July, and the
two sides have reached a proposed settlement. A judge in Boston
will rule on the agreement once the company, now under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, finds a suitable buyer for its customer data
base.
</P>
<P>
   While businesses like Toysmart.com continue to drop out of the
race, traditional retailers like Circuit City Stores Inc. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are strengthening their presence online. Their
advantages include deep pockets and stores where consumers can
return unwanted items purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   Even online merchants that once dismissed the idea that retail
chains would ``get it'' are now cozying up to their more
experienced rivals.

   Last month, Web retail giant Amazon.com Inc. announced a 10-year
alliance with Toys ``R'' Us Inc. The two companies will develop a
new e-commerce site for toys and video games. Toys ``R'' Us will
buy the inventory, while Amazon.com will tend to the Web site,
filling orders, and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Amazon.com, small Web merchants like BabyStripes Inc.
have been careful to carve out narrow niches to avoid competing
with the big retailers now lumbering online.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either need to be mass market or be very much the niche
player,'' said Lawrence Siff, chief executive of Newton-based
BabyStripes. ``And we're the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Siff says he sees the advantages the bricks-and-mortar
competitors have. He has a small boutique business, selling
hard-to-find Madame Alexander dolls and Gund's plush toys, that
opened just five months ago. ``They have established brands, an
established customer base, and an established distribution base,''
Siff said.

ANALYSTS WONDER IF MICROSOFT'S BEST YEARS ARE BEHIND IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Gates grinned from ear to ear as he soaked in a
standing ovation from thousands of employees of Microsoft Corp.,
bused in from the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters to Safeco
Field here for a pep talk from their corporate leader earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Microsoft's 25th anniversary. On the bus ride
to the Seattle ballpark, employees received free box lunches with
fortune cookies bearing the message: ``Thanks to you, our future is
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates did not disappoint the troops, promising in his address
that ``the best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the Microsoft fold, however, investors and consumers
alike are wondering what's in store for the company's next quarter
century _ and if its best days are behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the company may not be able to sustain its
blistering growth. Its stock is down 40-plus percent since the
beginning of the year. Sales of its next-generation operating
system, Windows 2000, have been off to a slow start, depressing
revenues for the last quarter of its 2000 fiscal year. Microsoft's
sales grew just 16 percent in its fiscal year ended June 30, the
first time in at least 10 years that the rate has dipped below 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Microsoft has any chance of growing over the
next 25 years at the same rate they have been growing,'' said Tom
Bittman, vice president and research director of the Gartner Group,
a Stamford, Conn., consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer is
undisputed, the red-hot growth in PC sales is beginning to cool. At
the same time, the explosion of the Internet has meant the
proliferation of other forms of computing, from palm-size
organizers and cell phones to wireless ``Web pads'' and game
consoles _ all markets where Microsoft is yet unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft faces the possibility it will lose its appeal
in the lengthy and bitter legal battle against a federal antitrust
suit and be forced to split into two companies _ one selling
computer operating systems, the other developing software
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The company will learn next month whether the appeal will be
heard directly by the US Supreme Court. Microsoft has argued that
the government's antitrust case is ``completely unsuitable for
direct appeal'' because of its complexity, and that federal Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit, made ``serious and
substantive procedural errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is seeking the direct appeal, which is permitted
in major antitrust cases if four of the nine justices favor it,
rather than an initial review by a federal appeals court. The
normal appellate process could delay a final resolution of the case
for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Microsoft is trying to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Microsoft be going away anytime soon? Absolutely not.
Will there be a complicated period of change? Yes, and it's not
going to be an easy ride,'' said Judith Hurwitz, chief exeutive of
the Hurwitz Group, a technology consulting firm in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM went through this 10 years ago,'' Hurwitz added. ``They
were top dog. For decades, they could do no wrong. Then they got
slammed. It took IBM a while to regain its leadership. It was a
very painful transition for IBM. The same will be true for
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft isn't sitting still. In June, it unveiled
a broad Internet strategy called Microsoft.NET, meant to gradually
transform the entire company's business from selling individual
software licenses to a subscription-based business model where
customers pay regular fees for access to Microsoft's latest
software and support services.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also investing heavily in software for
interactive television, pocket-size PCs, and portable devices such
as MP3 digital music players. Next year, it will enter the market
for game consoles. Microsoft also plans to beef up and consolidate
its fractured MSN Web properties.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is good, analysts say, but investors should expect
slower sales growth while Microsoft finds its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be challenged to show annual growth much stronger than
15 to 20 percent,'' said Andrew Brosseau, managing director of SG
Cowen Securities in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One key challenge for Microsoft, Brosseau says, is to move from
providing software for desktop computers to supplying software and
services for large businesses and Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desktop business is simply getting too mature for the
kinds of growth they're accustomed to,'' Brosseau said. ``It's a
transition that's going to take some time for them to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one is saying the personal computer will
disappear, and some industry observers believe it will become the
hub for coordinating all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   As for growth, Microsoft could try to maintain momentum by going
global with its desktop business, says Tim Bajarin, president of
Creative Strategies, a consulting firm in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, all we've done is bring digital technology to the
US,'' said Bajarin. ``We haven't even scraped the surface of
bringing this technology to the rest of the world. In the US
sphere, possibly Microsoft has hit a wall. But globally, I don't
see why they can't continue to grow at a significant pace.''

ECONOMISTS PUZZLED BY WHAT'S DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Productivity is ``a sexy topic,'' says Barry Bosworth, a fellow
at the Brookings Institution in Washington, without a trace of
irony.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, economists are not the only people who think so.
Brookings held a series of workshops this year on the continuing
rise in the nation's productivity and was surprised at the
attention they drew from the public and the media.
</P>
<P>
   As defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity is
simply the increase, year to year, in economic output by each
worker. Economists use a far more complex formula, attempting to
isolate the indirect causes of productivity that cannot be directly
attributed to new employees or a piece of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inventors of this formula, Moses Ambramovitz, called
it the ``measure of our ignorance about the causes of economic
growth in the United States.'' That was in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Many leading economists still agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big mystery,'' says Jeffrey Fuhrer, an economist with
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and member of a growing cadre of
experts attempting to demystify the nature of productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no confusion about why productivity has become such
a hot topic among academics and non-academics alike.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is still enjoying the largest economic expansion in
history, although there are some signs it is finally slowing. Since
1996, productivity has grown nearly 3 percent a year, compared to
an anemic 1.4 percent a year during the 1980s, and hit a scorching
5.7 percent pace in the second quarter of this year. Inflation
remains low, even though wages are rising, and the Federal Reserve
Bank, after a series of interest rate hikes over the last year, is
standing pat, convinced for the time being that there is no need
for further increases.
</P>
<P>
   Now inquiring minds, from economists to the millions of
Americans invested in the stock market, want to know how long it
all will last.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in a better understanding of the trends
behind the growth in productivity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many more questions than answers. But not
surprisingly economists point to dramatic changes wrought by the
high-tech revolution as perhaps the main reason for the boom,
although they can't prove it yet to their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these productivity measurements, from a deep level, aren't
completely satisfying because they don't say why productivity has
changed,'' said Susanto Basu, an economics professor at the
University of Michigan working on the ``why.''
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than Fed chairman Alan Greenspan wondered
aloud this year whether technological advances were creating
permanent structural changes such that the normal economic cycle of
expansion and downturn is being altered.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure, but it's clear that productivity levels
are responsible for the continuing good times. As Cathy Minehan,
president of the Boston Fed, explained to business and government
leaders in Lewiston, Maine: ``Higher rates of productivity growth
have allowed the economy to continue to grow rapidly despite an
ever more limited supply of labor. It has the potential to make
everyone better off.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the question of whether productivity will
continue to rise. The International Monetary Fund in a report on
the global economy suggested that a booming US economy and rising
productivity are powering the world economy, which is forecast to
grow 4.7 percent this year. But, the agency fretted, ``It remains
unclear how long higher productivity growth (in the United States)
can be sustained. The recent increase may in part reflect a
one-time jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all that's riding on productivity, it would be nice to
know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what economists do know. Productivity in manufacturing
companies is up. Henry Ford produced more cars, thanks to assembly
lines, and refined technologies help companies like Intel make more
_ and better _ computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has driven down prices for manufactured products,
making everyone a little better off. Most Americans own a car
today, and more than half own personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But economists have more difficulty measuring the output of
service industries like health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine reduces pain and suffering. Operations aren't as
painful as they used to be. Outcomes are better,'' Bosworth said.
``How do you value that?''
</P>
<P>
   As technology advances, how does one measure incremental
benefits to consumers of owning, say, a DVD player rather than a
VCR? An expanding array of telephone services creates as many
hassles as choices for consumers. How does one measure the
productivity of a consultant or a bank ATM machine?
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot easier to count widgets.
</P>
<P>
   With so little confidence in the underlying measures, it's tough
to gauge where productivity is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a question of how capable are we of using this
technology across a wide expanse of industries,'' said Fred
Breimyer, chief economist for State Street Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Two productivity gurus, nevertheless, took a crack at it.
Computers and technology have boosted productivity across the
economy, concluded Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, and his
former student, Kevin Stiroh, an economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank in New York. They presented their 87-page paper at Brookings
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   What Jorgenson and Stiroh contributed to the debate was
important: new evidence that productivity accelerated not only in
the high-tech industry but in nontech industries in the recent
period, 1995 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Their quantitative findings bolstered similar results by other
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   But Stiroh admits that there is a lot more that economists,
himself included, do not know. Although they looked at productivity
in the overall economy, for example, it was unclear, beyond 1996,
where productivity gains occurred in specific industries, because
more recent industry data isn't even in yet.
</P>
<P>
   Another mystery is why productivity gained speed only after the
economy had already been cooking for years.
</P>
<P>
   What economists had thought was that productivity picks up early
in an expansion, just as the economy pulls out of recession. For
obvious reasons: The boss asks employees to work harder to meet a
growing book of orders, until more workers can be hired.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1992, the first year after the US recession,
productivity surged.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the late-expansion gains, economists need to know
what's driving productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Basu said it could be that workers are working longer
hours that aren't being recorded by the government _ a measurement
problem _ or that technology has made them more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that other efficiencies inherent in factories and
offices pushed up production, without requiring more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty late in the business cycle, but we still don't
have enough data to say, convincingly, that it's an acceleration of
the long-run trend,'' or another explanation, said Basu.
</P>
<P>
   Will his research produce some answers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to tell you better in a few months,'' Basu said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the economy keeps ticking along. Greenspan, an
optimist about the productivity continuing to grow, seemed to hedge
his bets at an August conference of fellow economists in Jackson
Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew at what stage of the current technological wave we
were in,'' the Fed chairman said, ``we could, I assume, confidently
project when these elevated rates of change in long-term earnings
expectations, productivity growth, and, hence, wealth creation
would return to a more historically average pace.''
</P>
<P>
   If only we knew.

WEIGHING MUNICIPAL BONDS VS. CDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I receive $18,000 a year from my municipal bond
investments, which I reinvest. I save approximately 35 percent,
which I would otherwise pay in California and federal taxes. Would
I be better served by buying a $500,000 five-year CD fund and
receiving approximately $45,000 yearly interest and paying the
state and federal taxes?
</P>
<P>
   G.P., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you would be better off. But to get to that $45,000-plus
level you would have to combine both of your investments into
$635,000 worth of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math: I'll go with your specific question, involving
the $500,000 account. (The math would be considerably in favor of
the CD with the tax-exempt money market account added.)
</P>
<P>
   The current highest yield for a jumbo CD is 7.55 percent, which
would bring you $37,750 on a theoretical $500,000 investment. After
paying 35 percent to the state and federal tax collectors, you
would have $24,251. The current yield from the Vanguard California
Insured Intermediate Tax-Exempt fund is 4.55 percent, which would
mean a tax-free income stream of $22,750.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are prudent, you would not buy a single
$500,000 jumbo CD, since that would run well beyond the coverage of
FDIC insurance _ you would buy five $100,000 CDs. Currently two
institutions are offering that 7.55 percent rate, followed by
offerings of 7.50, 7.36, and 7.35 percent. Those five CDs would
combine to bring you $37,310 a year, of which you would have
$24,251 after paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the same math works out for the money market
account, even if you like to keep some funds liquid. If you put
that $135,000 in Vanguard Prime Money Market fund, now earning 6.33
percent, it would bring you $8,545 a year, and you would keep
$5,554 of it after dealing with the taxmen. That compares nicely to
the $4,266 you are getting from the tax-free money market funds, at
the current 3.16 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are expecting our first great-grandchild soon. We would
like to invest $1,000 for 20 to 25 years _ low-risk, steady growth
_ so that it would be a tidy sum at the end of that time. We are
looking for a suggestion. Also, besides the above, are there any
stocks that would make a good gift to keep for the long haul?
</P>
<P>
   B.B., Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, please let me argue a bit about your plan. When you are
putting money into an account where it is expected to remain for 20
to 25 years, it is not a long-term investment; it is a very
long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm sure you know, relying on the stock market is risky in
the short term, pretty dicey for the intermediate term, and fairly
safe for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm pretty bearish on the current stock market, I have a
good deal of faith in the American economy. For that reason, while
I won't claim that it is a low-risk and steady investment, I would
suggest that you simply invest the money in a Uniform Gift to
Minors Act account in the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which is
probably as good a proxy as you will find for the American economy.
Although Vanguard usually requires a minimum of $3,000 to open an
account, the requirement is reduced to $1,000 for a UGMA account.
</P>
<P>
   You should bear two things in mind. First, by putting the funds
in the child's name, you will reduce his or her potential to win
financial aid for college. Second, you cannot guarantee that the
investment will remain untouched for 20 to 25 years; it will become
the property and under the control of your great-grandchild once he
or she reaches age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year average annual total return is 22.22 percent for
Index 500, but over the long term 10 percent would be a more
reasonable assumption. If a $1,000 account were left for 25 years,
an investment returning 10 percent would grow to $12,056.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is hard to pick a single stock for a 25-year
investment, especially if you don't expect to make any changes in
the account. A great deal can change in any company over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to chose an issue, it would be Lucent Technologies,
which represents the old Bell Laboratories division of AT&AMP;T. It's
in a rapidly changing industry and it's far from risk-free. But an
account in Lucent with dividends reinvested would be a likely
winner over the long haul _ and probably would be a bigger winner
than either of the funds I suggested.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWM (Sydney) _ Misty Hyman of Phoenix produced the biggest
upset of the Olympic swim meet, defeating the defending champion
and world-record holder, Susie O'Neill of Australia, in the
200-meter butterfly. On the men's side, Pieter van den Hoogenband
of the Netherlands overtook Ian Thorpe of Australia as THE swimmer
of these Games, after van den Hoogenband defeated the two-time
Olympic champion Alexsandr Popov of Russia in the 100-meter
freestyle. By Jere Longman.

   OLY-GYM-MEN (Sydney) _ Alexei Nemov hadn't seen his newborn son,
not even a picture in the 18 days since his birth, but the idea of
being a father took up every spare inch of his thoughts. Suddenly,
there was no room for distractions. As he walked into the Super
Dome Wednesday night, the Russian with the biceps of an action hero
didn't see the other competitors in the men's Olympic all-around
final. As he calmly walked away from each captivating routine, the
24-year-old with a mapmaker's attention to detail didn't notice the
cameras documenting his every idle moment. Instead, Nemov was
fixated on his son. One day, he would tell him a story about this
night; and he wanted it to be a fairytale. ``An important thing was
my son; that was my major motivation,'' Nemov said through an
interpreter. ``I wanted to do my best for Russia, for my family and
loved ones.'' No one was let down. Nemov won the coveted title as
world's best gymnast. By Selena Roberts.

   OLY-SWM-JENNY (Sydney) _ After three legs of the women's
800-meter freestyle relay, the United States was in danger of not
defending its Olympic title. As Jenny Thompson dived into the pool,
the Americans were trailing slightly behind Australia. After
finishing a disappointing fifth in the 100 butterfly at these
Sydney Games, Thompson might have been dispirited. Instead, she set
an Olympic record with her anchor split in 1 minute, 59.35 seconds,
and the United States had won another gold medal. The victory
provided Thompson with the seventh gold medal of her career, the
most by an American woman in any Olympic sport. By Jere Longman.

<P>
   OLY-TEN (Sydney) _ ``Some day he's going to crush me, it's just
a matter of time,'' said Farice Santoro. The force of nature
Santoro was referring to was Marat Safin: the man of the moment in
tennis and the man who made Pete Sampras his foil in the final of
the U.S. Open two weeks ago. But for now, if only for now, Santoro
is too much for Safin, and Wednesday the short, clever Frenchman
defeated the powerful, confident and undoubtedly jet-lagged Russian
in the first round of the Olympic tournament, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4. By
Jere Longman.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-CYC (Sydney) _ Who doesn't dream of a Dan Jansen Olympic
moment? For four years, for more hours in the gym and on the
cycling track than he could remember, Marty Nothstein thought of
little else. ``There were a lot of tears, a lot of skin lost, to
get to this day,'' he said Wednesday night at the Olympic
Velodrome, rejoicing following redemption. His reversal of fortune
didn't pack the sudden emotional outpouring of Jansen's
long-delayed speed skating gold medal performance at the 1994
Lillehammer Games, but victory lap with his young son aboard the
bike after winning the men's sprint in track cycling felt just as
good. The kisses from his wife were just as sweet. The medal around
his neck _ the first Olympic gold for the United States since 1984
and first non-boycott gold for a male cyclist since 1904 _ was
equally earned. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SOC-WOMEN (Melbourne) _ China is gone. There will be no
replay of the 1996 Summer Games final, no replay of the 1999 World
Cup final. And the new American coach, April Heinrichs, knows she
escaped two rugged opponents at the very same time Wednesday night.
The American women advanced to the semifinals of the second Summer
Games soccer tournament for women by surviving Nigeria, by a score
of 3-1 and with no apparent broken limbs. At the very same time,
China was being knocked off by Norway, 2-1, which means that the
United States and Norway, the two most bitter foes in women's
soccer, have advanced to opposite semifinals. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKN-WOMEN (Sydney) _ ``I don't if I would used the word
`scared,' '' began Nikki McCray, the starting U.S. shooting guard.
``but we had to show our character at some point. Or we were headed
for real danger.'' Their show of character ended with menacing
defense, pressure that wore the Russian Federation down and gave
the U.S. women a 88-77 victory, won on much more grit than skill at
the Dome in Olympic Park. By Mike Wise.

unheralded minor leaguers and major league castoffs, knows that
they are nobody's idea of a Dream Team. Call them uncelebrated,
they might call themselves Olympic baseball's little-known secret.
The U.S. team, winning with drama and defense, is undefeated after
four games of the Olympic baseball tournament, and the mighty
Cubans, losers Wednesday to the Netherlands, are not. By Bill
Pennington.

<P>
   OLY-FENCING (Sydney) _ Cliff Bayer will long remember the last
touch of Young-Ho Kim's sword to his stomach Wednesday, the one
that crushed his chance of advancing to fencing glory. Bayer came
to the Summer Olympics trying to ignore the hopes of the U.S. team
and his federation that come with winning two World Cup titles in
the last year. ``He was the one guy I really didn't want to face,''
Bayer said. ``When I saw him in my bracket, I was nervous. He's
smart, really smart.'' In their match Wednesday, the second for
each man, Bayer was cruising, up 11-7, 13-10, then 14-13. But Kim
knotted the bout, then ducked under an attack by Bayer and
countered with the final touch. By Richard Sandomir.

   OLY-ARCHERY (Sydney) _ The Australia-U.S. rivalry that has
become an unraveling thread through the Olympic Games surfaced
again Wednesday in the men's individual archery finals. But it was
less a story of fervent nationalistic competition than the tale of
two single-minded athletes who met for the ultimate prize.
Australia's Simon Fairweather won the gold medal, defeating Vic
Wunderle of Mason City, Ill., in the final, 113-106. Afterward,
both men acknowledged that archery was a consuming passion that
left room for little else. By Bill Brink.

&HT;     RALPH NADER: THE KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the film version of ``Camelot,'' the
inhumanly chaste and pure Sir Lancelot sadly asks for the truth
from King Arthur's ancient sidekick and mentor, Pellinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I irritate you, don't I, Pellinore?'' Lancelot says. ``All
fanatics are irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this pithy sentiment last week as Ralph Nader
made his way up and down California in his Don Quixote quest for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Nader has been part of the American public
consciousness, he has been a fanatic _ to many of us in the most
admirable, Latin-origin sense of the word: ``of a temple, hence
enthusiastic, inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   To big business, the unphilanthropic rich and to co-opted,
sell-out politicians, Nader has also fit the contemporary
definition of ``fanatic,'' as inscribed in Webster's New World
Dictionary: ``A person whose extreme zeal, piety, etc., goes beyond
what is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the last few weeks, the National Organization for Women and
several minority advocacy groups have put themselves on Nader's
enemies list, not because he's unreasonably pious but because they
believe he's ``stuck in a time warp'' of consumer activism and thus
ignorant of their specific issues.)
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Green Party candidate looks on the horizon of
power, he sees deceit, corruption, greed, neglect, laziness and
hypocrisy. Forty years ago, it was the ``unsafe at any speed''
Chevrolet Corvair that caused Nader's blood to boil and his
activist's heart to leap. Today, it is pretty much life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's detractors have tried for eons to find the chink in his
armor. Nobody can be that committed, they reason, that selfless,
that outraged for that long.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Nader campaigned for president and refused to
disclose his personal income tax returns, his critics thought they
finally had him. He must be hiding something. Why else would he
want to keep his IRS forms a secret?
</P>
<P>
   As Nader's ready financial revelations have shown during this
campaign, his motives for keeping his tax returns to himself were
not about embarrassing off-shore accounts or fortunes amassed
through sweatshop labor.
</P>
<P>
   He just meant what he'd always said about privacy, that nobody
in a free democracy ought to be forced to show the rest of the
country his income tax forms. Not himself, not Bill Gates, not Joe
Sixpack, not even George W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader told the San Francisco Examiner: ``I think because I am
such a public citizen, I don't have much of a private life. When
you fight General Motors, Exxon, corrupt government and all these
other things that beset our country, you tend to work weekends and
nights. So there isn't much to talk about. It's a rather dull
personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was for Sir Lancelot _ until Queen Guinevere saw him raise
one of her husband's knights from the dead, and promptly fell
head-over-heels in love.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, led to the mother of all extramarital affairs,
which led to a war, the end of the Round Table and of Guinevere's
life outside of a convent.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader would never have let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd have even noticed the queen's adoring, lustful glances,
he sure wouldn't have returned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Your Highness,'' he would have said. ``I've just
launched an investigation into the shoddy construction materials
they use to build the serfs' huts, and I'm trying to keep a tally
of all the money the knights waste on those stupid jousting
contests, and Arthur has asked me to hammer out a fair and
equitable health care plan for everyone in his kingdom. I'm just
not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough, lonely job being a fanatic. But somebody has to do
it. Lucky for those who have always found him inspiring that Ralph
Nader still wants the work. May he irritate for another 40 years.
</P>

A QUICK OLYMPIC EXIT FOR SAFIN, THE U.S. OPEN CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ ``Some day he's going to crush me, it's just
a matter of time,'' said Fabrice Santoro.
</P>
<P>
   The force of nature that Santoro was referring to was Marat
Safin: The man of the moment in tennis and the man who made Pete
Sampras his foil in the final of the U.S. Open two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, if only for now, Santoro is too much for Safin, and
Wednesday the small, clever Frenchman defeated the powerful,
confident and undoubtedly jet-lagged Russian in the first round of
the Olympic tournament, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, that score must resonate like a major
upset; it must resonate as loudly as the crack that Safin's racquet
made as he angrily smashed it against a box underneath the umpire's
chair midway through the pivotal second set. But how could it be an
upset when Santoro has won all five of their encounters?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a guy they don't like to play,'' said Safin's
Russian teammate Yevgeny Kafelnikov. ``Marat's guy is Fabrice. It's
a psychological effect. There's nothing you can do about it; no
matter how good you are playing. It has nothing to do with the
jetlag. It's the opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin could certainly be forgiven for feeling weary. After
winning the U.S. Open, he quickly left New York for Tashkent,
Uzbeksistan, to play in a minor tournament to which he had already
committed and for which he had received a hefty fee. After winning
that event on Sunday, he flew to Sydney and did not arrive until 5
a.m. the day before this match. Santoro, a late addition to the
French team after Sebastian Grosjean suffered an injury, has been
here since last week.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans like Sampras and Andre Agassi routinely take long
breaks after winning a Grand Slam event. Safin has played right
through the celebration, but he refused to use that as an excuse
after his 12-match winning streak ended. ``You lose concentration
because you get upset, not because you are tired,'' he said. ``If
you are tired, you are going to lose 6-0 in the third set. It's not
a question at all. I'm 20 years old. I have enough energy to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He played superbly in the first set, smacking winners with his
groundstrokes and his serve and moving fluidly as Santoro lunged
right and left and had difficulty countering Safin's superior
power.
</P>
<P>
   If Santoro and Safin were boxers, they would fight in very
different classes. Safin is 6-foot-4 and about 185 pounds: The
28-year-old Santoro 5-10 and about 160. But though the recent
successes of Safin and Venus Williams would seem to indicate that
power and athleticism are now prerequisites to success, there are
still many ways to win at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro's two-handed groundstrokes off both sides and frequent
use of slice and dropshots rub many players' nerves and rhythm the
wrong way (he also has beaten Sampras and Agassi) but nobody
suffers like Safin, whose five losses to the Frenchman have all
come in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro is not just a quick retriever: He is also adroit at the
net, and when the second set began, he began pushing forward with
greater frequency. He would break the Russian's serve three times
in the second set: Mixing angled volleys with great gets and
jarring changes of pace.
</P>
<P>
   His leitmotif was keeping the ball low.
</P>
<P>
   To Safin's credit, he pulled his big game together in the final
set. What he could not do was crack Santoro's serve despite three
break points in the first game and one more in the fifth. In the
opening exchange of the ninth game, he lost the point on a
questionable call and argued vehemently with chair umpire Mike
Morrissey, and when Santoro held after a struggle to take a 5-4
lead, Safin swaggered to his chair shaking his head. In the next
game, at 15-30 he shanked a low overhead long and then watched as
Santoro knocked a reflex backhand volley past him to win the match
and a few Australian hearts and minds (who wouldn't choose David
over Goliath?).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For now, Safin will have to settle for being popular with the
Clinton family (Father Bill called after the Open victory; daughter
Chelsea was courtside Wednesday) and immensely popular at home.
``Marat is the number one athlete in Russia right now,'' said
Shamil Tarpischev, the Russian International Olympic Committee
member and Davis Cup captain.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Safin's record is 24-3: Quite a turnabout from the
first three months of the year when his erratic play and
combustible mood had him questioning his career choice. The last
time Safin played in this part of the world he lost the in the
first round of the Australian Open in January to Grant Stafford and
became the first player in ATP Tour history to be fined for
intentionally throwing the match.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has changed his address (from Valencia, Spain to
tax-free Monte Carlo); split with his longtime Spanish coach Rafael
Mensua and progressed by leaps and bounds. His victory in
Uzbekistan pushed him past Sampras into the number one spot in the
year-long points race, and a good performance here would have
allowed him to take over the number one spot on the 52- week entry
system used to determine seedings.

   ``I'm angry with myself because I can't fight for the gold
medal,'' he said. ``I'm angry because I couldn't make it to number
one in the world. I'm angry because I'm still losing to Santoro,
and I'm angry because of the chair umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Santoro could only be delighted: Delighted to have gotten the
call two weeks ago to join the team; delighted to have drawn Safin
of all people in the first round; delighted to have decided to
withdraw from Tashkent and focus on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my best victory over Marat,'' he said. ``But let's not
forget that I'm still a long way from the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as far as Safin, but the Russian still has a chance
for a medal; he is playing men's doubles with Kafelnikov.

   COXNET FOOD 0919: BUILDING A BETTER BANANA _ In the modern world
of the nation's fruit processing facilities, an increased number of
store chains have built banana ripening rooms designed to turn out
fruit just the right colors at the right time. In these
climate-controlled places, computers and temperature probes, forced
air and pressurized doors combine to bring bananas to a buff
condition 365 days a year. It's a far cry from the days of storing
bananas in a humid warehouse. (Crider, Austin American Statesman)

<P>
   KITCHEN-CONVERSATION _ Comfort food, says Judith Fertig, author
of Prairie Home Cooking, is that food we turn to when the dog
bites, the bee stings and the check is not in the mail. Ask people
what comfort food is and they'll offer a ready reply -- mac'n
cheese, meat loaf, homemade rolls. But then ask folks what THEIR
comfort food is and you may get some surprising answers. Mine is a
spicy Thai peanut dip that my Mom almost always had in the fridge
leftover from her catering gigs. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   HOMES-ELECTRICITY _ Let's face it; even if a person does all his
own lawn work , minor plumbing, carpentry, landscaping and other
jobs around the house, he may fear electrical work. Even if you
don't expect to fool with anything electrical yourself, it pays to
have a general understanding about how your home's electrical
system works. And it also helps to know how professional electrical
contractors go about the jobs they commonly do in people's houses.
(Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 45. WITH PHOTOS.

</P>
<P>
   NUTS&AMP;BOLTS _ A blown fuse or tripped breaker is a warning.
Something you're doing with your electrical system is wrong and you
need to correct it. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 25.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: This is James Cummmings' Nuts &AMP; Bolts column.
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Call
it the time of The Plan. Now's the time that thoughts of the next
fine gardens race through gardeners' heads like baseball players
rounding first after slamming one deep to center; we have, at last,
reached the fall renewal. Leaves tell the story. As the sourwoods
redden and the maples yellow, we, energized by the prospect of the
cool and maybe even the wet, can plant what we could not during the
hellish days of summer, appreciate what survived _ and perhaps most
important of all, anticipate next year. Next year. It'll be the
greatest, because of the plans we lay out now. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-GARDEN _ The yard man said my backyard would never be
Shangri-la and I took his word for it, content to merely let him
spray and blow and bag and go. But then I tasted a potato for the
first time. Until you've tasted one that has just been dug up, you
haven't tasted a potato. And I knew that sunny hillside in my
backyard would someday be my Eden. Despite drought, work began this
summer, starting with a consultation with a garden designer. The
herb garden is in place; fall vegetables soon to go in the ground.
The first of 4-5 articles over the next year on the development of
my kitchen garden. Includes resources, web sites, how to hire a
garden designer (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SEASONS-BEST _ First, they suffered heat stroke. Then they got
cut off at Uncle Sam's watering hole. Finally, in one last gasp,
they simply bade a sad farewell. If those tender plants you so
gingerly set out in beds last spring are now tumbleweed slammed
against the Herbie Curbie, chin up. Sure, days are still plenty
warm, water is still rationed, and those six packs of begonias look
more like six packs of Bud. But you and your yard are about to be
granted a second lease on gardening. Friday marks the official
opening of fall _ the best gardening season of all _ so get
organized. Here's a 10-point list of gardening projects for each of
the next three months to help you plan for fall, winter and spring.
(Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-NOTES _ Giving up football as a player wasn't difficult
for Tim Green. The former defensive end played his last game for
the Atlanta Falcons in 1993 and smoothly segued into multiple
careers as a sports announcer for the Fox network, a lawyer in
upstate New York, a father of four, and a best-selling author.
Green is in town to promote his latest thriller, ``The Letter of
the Law.'' In other news, David Hackworth, the most decorated
soldier since Audie Murphy, tries his hand at fiction in ``The
Price of Honor'' and Stephen King threatens to pull the plug on his
serial e-novel if more readers don't pony up their dollars.
(O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 21.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-PUBLISHERS _ Not since the invention of the printing press
has there been so much buzz in the book business. As the Publishers
Association of the South and the Southeast Booksellers Association
members gather at Atlanta's Merchandise Mart this weekend for their
annual convention, discussion topics will range from the threat of
chain stores to the future of books themselves. ``The very
definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom Payton, president of
Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the lovingly composed, designed
and printed paper artifact to that of bits and bytes downloaded
onto handheld readers.'' To deal with some of these uncertainties,
Payton and other members of the Publishers Association of the South
have arranged a quarterly series of roundtable discussions open to
the public. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.
</P>
<P>
   TV-FEAR _ Six people who have never met are sent to a place they
have never been to determine if it is haunted. There is no
cameraman and no crew. The only cameras are the built-in
surveillance system and the handheld cameras given to the cast to
film their experiences. Each edition of ``Fear,'' MTV's new
reality-based series, assigns the participants to stay in a creepy
location for three days to explore paranormal occurrences. If they
complete their mission _ and don't freak out _ they win cash.
``Fear'' will premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. EDT. (Jubera, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.

   VIDEO-FIDELITY _ Video of the week: ``High Fidelity.'' Grade:

Heart Is,'' ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' ``Black and White,'' ``The
Cup,'' ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' ``Waking the Dead,''
``Screwed,'' ``The Last September.'' (Staff, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    AIDS walk is for all
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since I've known my husband, I've been hearing about his
childhood friend Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Jim hadn't seen Billy since he was 18, hadn't
lived in the same neighborhood since he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   They were best friends at that time in your life when your best
friend is the center of the universe. It was one of those
friendships that stay with you over the years, whether or not you
stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Jim got the bug to track down some of his
friends from Alexandria, La., where he lived from age 8 to 13.
Within minutes of surfing the Web, he located addresses and phone
numbers he felt sure belonged to Billy and another friend, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   When I came home, he was gleeful, eager to talk to his old
friends again.
</P>
<P>
   He tried Billy first.
</P>
<P>
   An older man answered the phone _ a man who turned out to be
Billy's father. Jim had forgotten that Billy's father's name was
William, too.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes of small talk, the father broke the news:
Billy died three years ago, from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Jim got off the phone in tears, comforted by a hug from our
9-year-old son. Billy's father had been calm and gracious, but Jim
was too shocked, and too upset, to find out the particulars of
Billy's illness, or what he had done with the last 20 years of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Jim only knew that he was the sole custodian of
all those shared childhood memories: swim team, Boy Scouts, church
youth group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had anticipated talking and laughing with him last night,''
Jim wrote Billy's parents the next day. ``He was a very dear friend
of mine when I lived there. I missed him terribly when I moved back
to Cincinnati in '72. I remember him as a very cheerful, hopeful,
funny, faithful friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry old friends around in my heart,'' he added, ``and
always pray that at least they are happy and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   We are a generation spoiled by modern medicine. When we imagine
what old friends might be doing, it rarely occurs to us _ as it
undoubtedly would have to earlier generations _ that they might be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is a throwback in that respect, a disease that has, as yet,
no cure, though many patients are living longer and longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time AIDS hit home,'' Jim acknowledged.
Wanting to do more than write a letter to Billy's parents, he
signed us up for the sixth annual AIDS Walk of Dayton, to be held
Oct. 1, at Carillon Park.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Walk is the largest annual fundraiser for the AIDS
Foundation Miami Valley, said development associate Tom Wamsley,
raising $70,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   More important than fundraising is promoting AIDS awareness,
Wamsley said: ``We want the community to know we're the people to
contact.'' He noted that AFMV helped 566 clients in 1999, providing
services including crisis management, financial aid, support groups
and housing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   This year's walk is more family-focused than ever, with a family
festival from noon to 5 p.m., including hot-air balloons, games and
karaoke. ``We need to attract everyone because this disease affects
everyone,'' Wamsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's walkers, 400 strong, were a diverse bunch. Many
walked for personal reasons, others simply to support the cause.
</P>
<P>
   They walked in reverence for the past _ for all those memories
that can no longer be shared _ and in hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   They walked for all the people they carry around in their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, we're walking for Billy.

 &HT;    Bush needs to denounce Buchanan's strand of bigotry
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lock-and-load Patrick J. Buchanan is out of the hospital and
back on the presidential campaign trail just in time to skim the
bigot vote away from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs every vote he can get. Like his father before him, he
has managed to blow a big lead. Patrician breeding makes the Bush
men recoil when it's time to deliver the coup de grace to enfeebled
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush The Elder couldn't bring himself to finish the job after he
led 19 nations in routing Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's forces
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam now claims victory in the Persian Gulf War and remains a
dangerous threat in the Mideast. In a matter of months, President
Bush allowed a 90 percent approval rating and the presidency slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bush The Son had Al Gore on the mat. Gore now has
pulled far enough ahead of Bush that some Bush supporters worry
that Buchanan will further weaken Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan always has appealed to right-wing zealots who sought
refuge in the Republican Party. Bush and mainline Republicans
should have told Buchanan and his followers to find other shelter
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Bush urged Buchanan to not bolt from the Republican
Party. That's the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's message has been that of a leader who brings people
together to work across party, racial and gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, on the other hand, has made a career out of pitting
Americans against one another by appealing to white supremacists,
anti-Semites, isolationists, homophobes, intolerant religious
fundamentalists and paranoid conspiracy addicts.
</P>
<P>
   These people should be isolated in their own political party.
It's beginning to look as though Buchanan has found a home. After
staging a successful overthrow of the Reform Party, Buchanan
recently was rewarded with $12.6 million from the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After gallbladder surgery, Buchanan immediately headed to Bob
Jones University in Greenville, S.C. to declare war on immigrants,
homosexuals, non-Christians, the World Trade Organization, the U.S.
Supreme Court, Northeastern universities, the United Nations and
``elites'' _ anyone with a different view of America.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University formerly banned interracial dating as being
against the teachings of the Bible. In 1987, the Rev. Bob Jones
described the pope as ``an anti-Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is Catholic, was able to put the school's
anti-Catholic views aside in order to rally the student body to
take America back. ``That is why we are building this Gideon's
army, and heading for Armageddon, to do battle for the Lord,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of talk by a candidate for U.S. president sounds
strikingly similar to what cult leaders holed up with an arsenal of
guns tell their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Buchanan, the university's president, Bob Jones
III, said, ``America will probably not survive another election as
a free people if the Democrats get back into office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush should welcome the departure of Buchanan and his supporters
from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has expressed his admiration of fascist dictator
Franco. He also has described Hitler as ``an individual of great
courage . . . extraordinary gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party presidential candidate once applied to be
ambassador to South Africa's white racist government when it was
torturing and murdering citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than express polite regrets that Buchanan and his
supporters have left the Republican Party, Bush should go on the
attack. Buchanan isn't pulling any punches. Neither should Bush. He
should denounce Buchanan and his bigotry as un-American and
permanently slam the door on this sort of divisive politics.

   COXNET FOOD 0919: BUILDING A BETTER BANANA _ In the modern world
of the nation's fruit processing facilities, an increased number of
store chains have built banana ripening rooms designed to turn out
fruit just the right colors at the right time. In these
climate-controlled places, computers and temperature probes, forced
air and pressurized doors combine to bring bananas to a buff
condition 365 days a year. It's a far cry from the days of storing
bananas in a humid warehouse. (Crider, Austin American Statesman)

cheese, meat loaf, homemade rolls. But then ask folks what THEIR

leftover from her catering gigs. (Walker, Atlanta

   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   HOMES-ELECTRICITY _ Let's face it; even if a person does all his
own lawn work , minor plumbing, carpentry, landscaping and other
jobs around the house, he may fear electrical work. Even if you
don't expect to fool with anything electrical yourself, it pays to
have a general understanding about how your home's electrical
system works. And it also helps to know how professional electrical
contractors go about the jobs they commonly do in people's houses.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Call
it the time of The Plan. Now's the time that thoughts of the next
fine gardens race through gardeners' heads like baseball players
rounding first after slamming one deep to center; we have, at last,
reached the fall renewal. Leaves tell the story. As the sourwoods
redden and the maples yellow, we, energized by the prospect of the
cool and maybe even the wet, can plant what we could not during the
hellish days of summer, appreciate what survived _ and perhaps most
important of all, anticipate next year. Next year. It'll be the
greatest, because of the plans we lay out now. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN-GARDEN _ The yard man said my backyard would never be
Shangri-la and I took his word for it, content to merely let him
spray and blow and bag and go. But then I tasted a potato for the
first time. Until you've tasted one that has just been dug up, you
haven't tasted a potato. And I knew that sunny hillside in my
backyard would someday be my Eden. Despite drought, work began this
summer, starting with a consultation with a garden designer. The
herb garden is in place; fall vegetables soon to go in the ground.
The first of 4-5 articles over the next year on the development of
my kitchen garden. Includes resources, web sites, how to hire a
garden designer (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   SEASONS-BEST _ First, they suffered heat stroke. Then they got
cut off at Uncle Sam's watering hole. Finally, in one last gasp,
they simply bade a sad farewell. If those tender plants you so
gingerly set out in beds last spring are now tumbleweed slammed
against the Herbie Curbie, chin up. Sure, days are still plenty
warm, water is still rationed, and those six packs of begonias look
more like six packs of Bud. But you and your yard are about to be
granted a second lease on gardening. Friday marks the official
opening of fall _ the best gardening season of all _ so get
organized. Here's a 10-point list of gardening projects for each of
the next three months to help you plan for fall, winter and spring.

   BOOKS-NOTES _ Giving up football as a player wasn't difficult
for Tim Green. The former defensive end played his last game for
the Atlanta Falcons in 1993 and smoothly segued into multiple
careers as a sports announcer for the Fox network, a lawyer in
upstate New York, a father of four, and a best-selling author.
Green is in town to promote his latest thriller, ``The Letter of
the Law.'' In other news, David Hackworth, the most decorated
soldier since Audie Murphy, tries his hand at fiction in ``The
Price of Honor'' and Stephen King threatens to pull the plug on his
serial e-novel if more readers don't pony up their dollars.

   BOOKS-PUBLISHERS _ Not since the invention of the printing press
has there been so much buzz in the book business. As the Publishers
Association of the South and the Southeast Booksellers Association
members gather at Atlanta's Merchandise Mart this weekend for their
annual convention, discussion topics will range from the threat of
chain stores to the future of books themselves. ``The very
definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom Payton, president of
Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the lovingly composed, designed
and printed paper artifact to that of bits and bytes downloaded
onto handheld readers.'' To deal with some of these uncertainties,
Payton and other members of the Publishers Association of the South
have arranged a quarterly series of roundtable discussions open to
the public. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.

<P>
   TV-FEAR _ Six people who have never met are sent to a place they
have never been to determine if it is haunted. There is no
cameraman and no crew. The only cameras are the built-in
surveillance system and the handheld cameras given to the cast to
film their experiences. Each edition of ``Fear,'' MTV's new
reality-based series, assigns the participants to stay in a creepy
location for three days to explore paranormal occurrences. If they
complete their mission _ and don't freak out _ they win cash.
``Fear'' will premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. EDT. (Jubera, Atlanta

 &HT;    AMERICAN PURSUES IMPROBABLE GOAL OF A NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE IN ASIA
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The latest breakthrough in John Endicott's nine-year
quest to establish a nuclear-free zone in northeast Asia was that
the North Koreans (ital) almost (ital) came.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, at the start of a three-day conference on his
plan, they called him in his Beijing hotel room at 4 a.m. and
``really pledged to take part in our next meeting,'' said Endicott,
a military intelligence veteran who now runs a Georgia Tech think
tank. ``We take that as a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone gets phone calls from North Korean diplomats, but
then Endicott isn't just anyone. After ending a 31-year career in
government, he has been on what some might consider an unrealistic
mission: banning all short-range nuclear weapons in a yet-to-be
defined portion of northeast Asia that covers seven countries,
three of which are nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first presented his proposal to the Chinese in 1992,
``they were ready to throw me out the 22nd floor,'' he said. But a
week before North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty the following year, China suddenly signaled interest in the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, we began to see much more positive
cooperation from the Chinese,'' Endicott said, concluding also that
Beijing knew of North Korea's startling announcement in advance.
</P>
<P>
   With the region's history of shifting alliances and past
enmities, one of the main goals has been to build mutual trust
among the participants, which also include Russia, South Korea,
Japan, Mongolia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting once or twice a year, the talks are strictly
non-governmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means people can say things and throw out ideas which
governments would have trouble doing,'' said Richard Freytag, a
retired Air Force major general who has been involved since the
group's inception. ``The result is we can be much more
innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the individuals involved are former top military or
government officials. After many shared meals and group tourist
excursions between their meetings, a level of familiarity and
confidence has developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people have become sort of family members,'' said Kwan
Lee, South Korea's former minister of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although China agreed to host this year's meeting, it
continues to have trouble accepting that Endicott does not
represent the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   When Endicott first presented his idea to senior U.S. government
officials in 1992, they argued with him for four hours before
agreeing. Basically, he says, the message to him was: ``Endicott,
if you want to make a fool of yourself, you have the right to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the proposal excludes long- and medium- range ballistic
missiles, its real significance would be to increase interaction
among the nuclear powers since implementation would require a
monitoring agency and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to decrease the potential for
proliferation,'' said U.S. team leader Adm. William Pendley, a
former deputy assistant secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   If the North Koreans attend next year's meeting in Seoul, as
they've promised, Endicott believes the group may be able to
finalize a proposal and then move the talks to official
governmental channels, which is the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean Foreign Ministry officials were briefed on the
concept last March when they visited Endicott in Atlanta at the
Center for International Strategy, Technology and Policy, which he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The world has three nuclear weapons-free zones _ in Africa, the
South Pacific and Latin America _ but none of them include
countries with nuclear capabilities. Endicott comforts himself with
the knowledge that Latin America took 27 years to complete
discussions for its zone.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's in for the long haul. If he succeeds, ``then we get
a whole era of prosperity and stability in northeast Asia to look
forward to.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ruthie Bolton-Holyfield had just rushed two
shots, long 3-point heaves that careened off the rim. Lacking
rhythm and patience, she ran downcourt to witness something even
more unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Pchkova, the Russian forward, beating most of Team USA
downcourt, hit a little runner from the left side, clutching her
fist at the enormous possibility in front of her. The U.S. women
trailed by 7 points, their dominance threatened by the same nation
that dealt them their last Olympic loss in Barcelona, eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would use the word `scared,''' Nikki McCray,
the starting shooting guard, said. ``But we had to show our
character at some point, or we were headed for real danger.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with a McCray steal and 3-pointer with 17 minutes left,
a shot that erased the first Olympic halftime deficit the women had
known since 1992 in Barcelona. Their resolve kicked in again with
less than 12 minutes remaining, when Bolton-Holyfield caught fire
from the perimeter, knocking down two 3-pointers and another jumper
within two minutes of each other, baskets that helped turn a
1-point lead into a 10-point bulge.
</P>
<P>
   And their show of character ended with menacing defense,
pressure that wore the Russian Federation down and gave the U.S.
women an 88-77 victory, won more on grit than skill before 8,383 at
the Dome in Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she saw the game as either a crack in the U.S. facade
or show of perseverance after her team moved to 3-0 in preliminary
play, the U.S. coach, Nell Fortner, replied: ``We were resilient.
We came together when we had to against some very tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie overcame early foul trouble to score 14 of her
team-high 18 points in the second half. Yolando Griffith and Sheryl
Swoopes each added 16 points and Bolton-Holyfield contributed 12
clutch points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was never out of the game, but the closest it came after
the spurt was 68-63.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for much of the first 20 minutes, the Russians sliced apart
the vaunted defense of the Americans. The point guard, Anna
Arkhipova, and Svetlana Abrosimova, most recently of the national
champion Connecticut Huskies, ran the pick-and-roll to perfection,
popping out for jumpers or penetrating for short bankshots.
</P>
<P>
   The center tandem of Elen Chakirova and Maria Stepanova, a
6-foot-8, slender woman with golden blond hair and striking
features whom the Australian press has nicknamed ``The Russian
Barbie,'' were responsible for putting Leslie and Griffith in foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it to the Americans like no other team in the tournament,
the Russians matched the U.S. women in every facet until the
comeback. They put, if not fear, at least major concern into the
minds of Fortner and her players.
</P>
<P>
   The American women never trailed at halftime during any of their
games en route to the gold medal four years ago in Atlanta. They
had not lost in Olympic competition since the 1992 semifinals in
Barcelona, when several of the same Russian players pulled off the
upset. Their last loss in international competition came against
Brazil in a Rio de Janeiro exhibition in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aggressive right now defensively,'' Griffith said.
``This is the third game we started slow. It was a great game, but
we need to work on our communication a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia seems headed for a semifinal showdown with Australia, who
played Slovakia Wednesday night. The winner would most likely see
the United States in the gold medal game. At the 1998 world
championships, the Russians beat Australia in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   As well as they played, the Russians were minus some key
players. Their regular starting point guard, Irina Soumnikova, was
sidelined for the tournament when she caught an elbow in the face
from a Cuban player in the team's first game. Falling to the floor,
she fractured her right wrist on the play and, the Russians said,
had to undergo two hours of plastic surgery for a facial injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian coach, Evgeny Gomelskiy, was still blaming the
Cubans Wednesday night for leaving him short-handed, calling the
act malicious. ``She forced one of our girls to end up in a
hospital,'' he said. The Cuban player, Maria Leon, denied on Monday
that she purposely hit Soumnikova.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the center, Elena Baranova, one of the best players
from Russia, who stars in the WNBA, missed the Olympics with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   That left the arching 3-pointers of Arkhipova _ she made all
four she attempted _ and the creative passing of her teammates to
fill the void. Often, the Russian players over 6-feet tall dribbled
the ball upcourt and picked up their defensive assignments in the
backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Russia, and their post players can do so much,''
McCray said. ``Can you imagine Lisa Leslie picking up someone 64
feet from the basket? They're really talented in a lot of different
areas of the game, where as we specialize a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelskiy, the Russian coach, congratulated the Americans for
their comeback and superiority on defense at the post-game press
conference. He talked about the incredible individual skills of the
Americans, almost inferring that his players played better
together. He lamented a few mistakes by the Russians, ``but as far
as the team effort, there are no tragedies today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No, but for a few anxious moments, the United States came closer
than they have in a while to being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really wasn't a scare,'' McCray said, again. ``It was a
great challenge. Look, we're not going to beat the really good
teams by 20 points, anymore. People just have to get used to
that.''

   Olympics? What?
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention the Games are afoot?
</P>
<P>
   From Sydney, on loooong tape delay, Bob Costas and the rest of
the NBC troops labor mightily to make them seem exciting anyway,
focusing as always on U.S. medal athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, NBC will carry the action uninterrupted, except for
newscasts, from noon till about 2 a.m., featuring the end of
swimming competitions and the start of key track and field events,
plus the debut of some unusual sports like synchronized diving.
MSNBC has baseball, water polo and soccer from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
while CNBC is on the air from 4 to 9 p.m. with soccer and water
polo.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the times are the same, with NBC featuring diving,
rowing, soccer, synchronized swimming and track and field events;
baseball, basketball and volleyball on MSNBC; and boxing, soccer
and tennis on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: We've run out of original ways to say
how truly dismal this show is. Just trust us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' CBS at 9: Episode 8. Things start getting good as
the Alliance begins mowing down the other members of Rattana tribe.
More cold-blooded retribution here than in ``Walker, Texas
Ranger,'' (which airs at 10). Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad TV,'' Fox Saturday at 11: With ``Saturday Night Live''
bumped by the Olympics, this would be a good night to check out
this Fox sketch comedy. Tonight is the Halloween episode. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes,'' CBS Sunday at 7: TBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Confidential,'' CBS Sunday at 8: Hard to say how this
R-rated 1997 noir thriller set in a tawdry 1950s Hollywood will
play after the TV censors get done with it. But director Curtis
Hanson did a terrific job with the complex material of James
Ellroy's novel. And he has an awesome cast in Kevin Spacey, Russell
Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny De Vito
and Kim Basinger, who won the best supporting actress Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons,'' Fox Sunday at 8: Marge is injured in a ski
accident, so Lisa takes over the household. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' Fox Sunday at 8:30: It's the
Krelboyne picnic, which means Malcolm and his family must interact
with the rest of the gifted class. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC Sunday at 9: Regis
Philbin hosts. But it's a repeat, which will make the questions
slightly less challenging for those playing at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice,'' ABC Sunday at 10: Eugene (Steve Harris) gets a
particularly repellent client, and Jimmy (Michael Badalucco) goes
after a company that disclosed an employee's HIV status. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debating Our Destiny,'' PBS Sunday at 9: Jim Lehrer looks back
at 40 years of televised presidential debates in advance of the
first Al Gore-George W. Bush showdown on Oct. 3. Interviews with
numerous participants _ winners and losers both _ suggest what a
tricky game the debate can be.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Jam,'' ABC Sunday at 7: Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny
co-star in this 1996 comedy blending animation and live-action,
which unfortunately seemed like more of a marketing juggernaut than
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticks: The Real Vampires,'' Discovery Saturday at 8: Some of
you can laugh, but those of us who live where these little nasties
do have been picking them off ourselves all summer and fretting
about Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seven-Ups,'' AMC Saturday at 8: Roy Scheider and Tony
LoBianco in this 1973 New York cop thriller that grabs a little
(and only a little) of ``The French Connection's'' gritty glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storytellers,'' VH1 Saturday from 10-midnight: An hour of No
Doubt, followed by an hour of Duran Duran. Sometimes this show
gives a revealing look at the stories behind the music. And maybe
that's what we'll get from Gwen Stefani and No Doubt. But the Duran
Duran segment is the real wild card here _ it could actually be
interesting, or it could be so bad it's good.
</P>
<P>
   Football, ESPN Sunday at 8:30: Redskins at Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' HBO at 9: Samantha is hired to plan a bat
mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music Anniversary Special,'' VH1 Sunday at 9: A
90-minute trip down memory lane for fans of sordid showbiz inside
tales. Comedian Kathy Griffin hosts, and there's a performance by
the Bangles _ yes, they're reuniting _ but devotees will be most
interested in flashbacks and updates involving Leif Garrett,
Poison, MC Hammer and others whose up-and-down stories have been
fodder for this show all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Revenge,'' Showtime Sunday at 8: TV premiere of 1998
comedy starring Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Rupert Graves, about two strangers who meet when they're
thinking of suicide and decide to get their revenges instead. Rated
PG-13.

 &HT;    REPORTER'S JOURNAL: COMPARING ATLANTA TO SYDNEY AS AN OLYMPIC
HOST CITY
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international, (k) commentary
and (s) sports categories
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seven years ago, I knew Atlanta was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, the Olympic world gathered in Monte Carlo to
select the host city for the 2000 Games _ the Games, ironically,
that Atlanta had really wanted to host before it shocked itself and
the world by being awarded the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The magical 1992 Olympics in breathtaking Barcelona were a
recent memory, and Atlanta's Centennial Games _ still three years
away _ were a vision that could not be easily imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It was down to Beijing and Sydney. In my gut, I wanted it to be
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Games in Barcelona were so spectacular, it was
Atlanta's destiny to suffer by comparison. After that, Atlanta
needed to be followed by yet another magnificent city like it
needed a hole in the head.
</P>
<P>
   For all Beijing's grandeur and potent symbolism, no one would be
goofy enough to compare it to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, on the other hand, was everything Atlanta aspired to be
and everything organizers of the 1996 Games foolishly promised it
would be.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons between Sydney and Atlanta would be easy and
stark because of similar cultures and New World textures. Next to
the beauty and breadth of Sydney, Atlanta risked looking like a
truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   My heart sank when Sydney was selected.
</P>
<P>
   I had been in Tokyo in September 1990 for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution to write about the selection of the host city
for the 1996 Games . Consequently, I had developed a shameful
attachment to the curious circus of the Atlanta Olympics in the odd
way that journalists can become mesmerized by what they cover.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I loved Atlanta _ still do _ and dreaded the week in the
year 2000 when the chickens would come home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   They're here, and it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what is being said about Atlanta in America these
days. I can tell you that European reporters and broadcasters, who
frankly never cared much for ``the next great international city''
anyway, aren't recalling the place fondly.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the often rancorous media folks here have been ooing
and awing over the wonders of Sydney, with its spectacular
springtime weather, clean streets and confident virility _ the kind
of things Atlanta had hoped to hear about itself back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they mention Barcelona in adoring tones that verge on
sentimental. Yet, you get the idea that they wish Atlanta never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   When they do speak of Atlanta, it isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the sober judgment of the Financial Times: ``Sydney, a
vibrant and stunningly beautiful city, provides the ideal
environment for the revival of tarnished sporting ideals and the
rehabilitation of an Olympic movement still recovering from four
unhappy years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems began at the Atlanta Games, which were
overshadowed by transport and technology failures, excessive
commercialization, and a terrorist's bomb. The city was simply not
up to the task of hosting the event properly, and the 1996 Games
represented a depressing backward step after
</P>
<P>
   the colorful triumphs of the previous Olympiad in Barcelona.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. It's easy to dismiss this as press ranting, but it is much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the perceived failures in Atlanta have gained a
permanence in the way the words ``former White House intern'' will
forever precede the words ``Monica Lewinisky'' even if she goes on
to medical school and discovers the cure for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is now accepted truth that the Atlanta Games were a
mismanaged disaster in an unpleasant city. This is what Europeans
hear and read every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian: ``All the early indications are that Sydney,
having learned mightily from the arrogant incompetence that
surrounded Atlanta four years ago, is indeed putting on the
best-run and most enjoyable Olympics of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse, even hostile _ a feeling that Sydney's success is
Atlanta's deserved comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Barnes, the acerbic columnist for the Times of London,
felt reborn after witnessing Sydney's opening ceremonies: ``The
egomania of Atlanta gone, Australia sets itself fair for a
celebration of sport'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare and contrast with _ well, not so much the triumphalism
as the downright cockiness of Atlanta four years ago: this is the
greatest nation in the world and ain't you just lucky to be here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Downright cockiness.'' Yes, this was the problem wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Atlanta had its shortcomings. What Olympic city
doesn't? Even in Barcelona the buses ran poorly and the stands were
half empty. The volunteers were sweet but clueless. I remember the
1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France, as a miserable drudgery
of riding for hours in minivans to remote venues only to be treated
rudely by a semi-hostile staff.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehammer in 1994 had dreadful transportation and housing.
Yet, all are remembered _ particularly in Europe _ with great
fondness.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived in England for more than two years and have traveled
extensively in Europe, and I have never heard one kind word about
the Atlanta Olympics. Instead, when I mention where I come from, I
get pitiable
</P>
<P>
   looks and questions about why it was such a disaster _ not just
from other reporters but from ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them what I always say: The Games were great; people had
a wonderful time.
</P>
<P>
   But I often feel I am protesting way too much. The sad truth is
the 1996 Olympics came to a city with a neutral image in the eyes
of the world and left it with the reputation of being run by a
bunch of self-delusional
</P>
<P>
   doofuses.
</P>
<P>
   I blame the people who put on the Atlanta Games and their
runaway hubris problem. To this day I can't figure out what
possessed Billy Payne, who headed the Atlanta Games, to trumpet _
to my count 1 million times _ that Atlanta would stage the
``greatest peacetime event of the history of 20th Century?'' This
defies the tenets of basic PR _ not to mention football coaching
101 _ to be self deprecating, to say, ``Gosh, we hope we don't
embarrass ourselves, but we'll do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   They raised expectations so high that failure was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Billy's PR people treated the world's press as
detestable parasites _ a bad idea even if they are _ and the
members of the International Olympic Committee as corrupt Third
World border guards.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't forgotten.

stark because of similar cultures and New World textures. Next to
the beauty and breadth of Sydney, Atlanta risked looking like a
truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   My heart sank when Sydney was selected.
</P>
<P>
   I had been in Tokyo in September 1990 for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution to write about the selection of the host city
for the 1996 Games . Consequently, I had developed a shameful
attachment to the curious circus of the Atlanta Olympics in the odd
way that journalists can become mesmerized by what they cover.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I loved Atlanta _ still do _ and dreaded the week in the
year 2000 when the chickens would come home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   They're here, and it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what is being said about Atlanta in America these
days. I can tell you that European reporters and broadcasters, who
frankly never cared much for ``the next great international city''
anyway, aren't recalling the place fondly.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the often rancorous media folks here have been ooing
and awing over the wonders of Sydney, with its spectacular
springtime weather, clean streets and confident virility _ the kind
of things Atlanta had hoped to hear about itself back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they mention Barcelona in adoring tones that verge on
sentimental. Yet, you get the idea that they wish Atlanta never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   When they do speak of Atlanta, it isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the sober judgment of the Financial Times: ``Sydney, a
vibrant and stunningly beautiful city, provides the ideal
environment for the revival of tarnished sporting ideals and the
rehabilitation of an Olympic movement still recovering from four
unhappy years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems began at the Atlanta Games, which were
overshadowed by transport and technology failures, excessive
commercialization, and a terrorist's bomb. The city was simply not
up to the task of hosting the event properly, and the 1996 Games
represented a depressing backward step after
</P>
<P>
   the colorful triumphs of the previous Olympiad in Barcelona.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. It's easy to dismiss this as press ranting, but it is much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the perceived failures in Atlanta have gained a
permanence in the way the words ``former White House intern'' will
forever precede the words ``Monica Lewinisky'' even if she goes on
to medical school and discovers the cure for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is now accepted truth that the Atlanta Games were a
mismanaged disaster in an unpleasant city. This is what Europeans
hear and read every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian: ``All the early indications are that Sydney,
having learned mightily from the arrogant incompetence that
surrounded Atlanta four years ago, is indeed putting on the
best-run and most enjoyable Olympics of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse, even hostile _ a feeling that Sydney's success is
Atlanta's deserved comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Barnes, the acerbic columnist for the Times of London,
felt reborn after witnessing Sydney's opening ceremonies: ``The
egomania of Atlanta gone, Australia sets itself fair for a
celebration of sport'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare and contrast with _ well, not so much the triumphalism
as the downright cockiness of Atlanta four years ago: this is the
greatest nation in the world and ain't you just lucky to be here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Downright cockiness.'' Yes, this was the problem wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Atlanta had its shortcomings. What Olympic city
doesn't? Even in Barcelona the buses ran poorly and the stands were
half empty. The volunteers were sweet but clueless. I remember the
1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France, as a miserable drudgery
of riding for hours in minivans to remote venues only to be treated
rudely by a semi-hostile staff.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehammer in 1994 had dreadful transportation and housing.
Yet, all are remembered _ particularly in Europe _ with great
fondness.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived in England for more than two years and have traveled
extensively in Europe, and I have never heard one kind word about
the Atlanta Olympics. Instead, when I mention where I come from, I
get pitiable
</P>
<P>
   looks and questions about why it was such a disaster _ not just
from other reporters but from ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them what I always say: The Games were great; people had
a wonderful time.
</P>
<P>
   But I often feel I am protesting way too much. The sad truth is
the 1996 Olympics came to a city with a neutral image in the eyes
of the world and left it with the reputation of being run by a
bunch of self-delusional
</P>
<P>
   doofuses.
</P>
<P>
   I blame the people who put on the Atlanta Games and their
runaway hubris problem. To this day I can't figure out what
possessed Billy Payne, who headed the Atlanta Games, to trumpet _
to my count 1 million times _ that Atlanta would stage the
``greatest peacetime event of the history of 20th Century?'' This
defies the tenets of basic PR _ not to mention football coaching
101 _ to be self deprecating, to say, ``Gosh, we hope we don't
embarrass ourselves, but we'll do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   They raised expectations so high that failure was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Billy's PR people treated the world's press as
detestable parasites _ a bad idea even if they are _ and the
members of the International Olympic Committee as corrupt Third
World border guards.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't forgotten.

WHY NOT TAP INTO BUSH'S SIDE OF STORY?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore's recent surge in the polls was at least partially the
product of the free ride that he hitched from the media in
marketing his ``fight for the people'' shtick.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it works. Gore says he will help working families
while opponent George W. Bush hands out money to rich people _ and
the liberal-leaning media report it as the Gospel according to St.
Albert.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when Bush sets out to explain why his plan is
the one that's really geared to helping the middle class?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong gospel, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad but true: A conservative Republican candidate has to
run against the other candidates and also against the media.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Bush campaign must be grateful to Gore for
inventing the Internet. Any industrious citizen who is interested
in cutting through the media slant on the campaign can simply log
on to Bush's Web site _ georgewbush.com _ and study his ``Blueprint
for the Middle Class,'' which offers in-depth explanations of
Bush's proposals on education, health care, tax relief, Social
Security ...
</P>
<P>
   The site goes into more detail than you can find in most media
reports and offers point-by-point comparisons of Bush's proposals
and Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   The site also refutes some of the unfair and derogatory claims
made by Gore about Bush's record as governor of Texas _ including
the patently false accusation that the Bush administration has
failed to promote health care for poor children in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vice President Gore wants to complain about health care in
Texas,'' a Bush spokesman says in one of the Web site's issue
papers, ``then he ought to be complaining about the situation in
America under his watch because it's worse. Texas is doing a better
job than the nation as a whole does when it comes to providing
health and dental care to children enrolled in Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The site cites facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   Curious voters can browse the site and learn that Bush's Social
Security plan would guarantee the benefits of current recipients _
but would also make it possible for a young worker earning $20,000
per year to accumulate a $100,000 nest egg _ beyond Social Security
benefits _ by privately investing a small portion of his payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters can learn how Bush would raise standards and improve the
quality of teaching in America's schools _ and how Gore would not.
</P>
<P>
   How Bush would reform Medicare and assist senior citizens who
need help paying for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   How Bush's tax plan would help families by reducing marginal tax
rates; doubling the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 per child;
cutting the marriage penalty that requires married couples to pay
higher taxes than their single counterparts; ending the ``death
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax plan, the Web site says, would ``provide the biggest
percentage cuts to low and middle income taxpayers. Middle class
families will receive significant tax relief _ for example, a
typical family of four making $35,000 will get a 100 percent income
tax cut, worth about $1,500 a year ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-earner couple earning $50,000 a year with two children
will receive a 50 percent income tax cut under the Bush plan. This
means a savings of nearly $2,000 ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A family of four with one earner making $40,000 a year will
receive a 70 percent income tax cut under the Bush plan. This means
$1,600 cash back ...''
</P>
<P>
   And the Gore plan?
</P>
<P>
   ``No tax relief for 50 million Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this is the Bush-eye view of the issues. But it's a view
that's virtually invisible amid the ``risky tax scheme'' and ``tax
cut for the rich'' propaganda that the media disseminate on behalf
of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to believe what you read on the Bush Web site,
but if you're a fair-minded voter who wants to know everything you
can about the candidates and their ideas, you owe it to yourself to
check out Bush's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, all right. Go ahead and check out Gore's Web site, if you
must. Just don't tell them I sent you.

<P>
   These arguments for and against public charter schools are
adapted from statements placed by supporters and opponents in the
official voters guide for the state of Washington, where voters on
Nov. 7 will decide whether to authorize charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ARGUMENTS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are public schools designed and operated by
non-profit organizations made up of parents, teachers or community
leaders. The schools operate under terms of a contract _ charter _
negotiated with the authorizing agency, usually a local school
board, a public university or a state board.
</P>
<P>
   Charter public schools give parents another choice in guiding
their children's education within the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Because charter public schools are schools of choice, they are
directly accountable to students, parents, teachers and their
authorizing agency.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for freedom to innovate, they are accountable for
their students' ability to meet rigorous standards.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the public school system, charter schools must meet
high academic standards and, in many states, must use state
certified teachers. They are required to give annual progress
reports and may be audited at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor monitors their quality and effectiveness and can
withdraw the charter if the school is not performing.
</P>
<P>
   The charter school spirit of innovation and competition will
help propel all of our public schools forward.
</P>
<P>
   Charter public schools are open to all students, must follow all
health, safety and civil rights laws, and cannot charge tuition or
have a religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Charter public schools cannot levy taxes. In most states, they
receive the same amount of state funding per enrolled student as
other public schools. Local levy tax money may be allocated in some
states under some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ARGUMENTS AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are unconstitutional, unfair and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State's constitution requires a ``general and uniform
system'' of public schools. That is why, for nearly 200 years, our
schools have been called ``common schools.'' The public schools are
for everyone. And yet the proponents seek special treatment. They
don't want the rules to apply to them ... just to everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools, by their very definition, cater to
special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Public tax dollars would go to these new schools with little or
no accountability to any elected official ...not your local school
board, not the state superintendent of public instruction. And
this, just when we all rightly demand more public accountability
for our tax dollars, to ensure the success of all children.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers would have to pay for youngsters now educated at home
or in private schools. Make no mistake about it ... this means
public funding for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools were on the ballot in Washington state in 1996.
Two-thirds of our citizens soundly rejected that proposal.
Two-thirds. Charter schools did not even receive 40 percent ``yes''
votes in any single county in Washington. What has changed since
that resounding defeat? Nothing ... and yet charter school zealots
brought their rejected proposal back to the legislature every year
_ where it was also rejected _ every year.

 &HT;    ERRATIC RESULTS FAIL TO HALT CHARTER SCHOOL BOOM
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. With CHARTER-PRO-CON and CHARTER-DATA for release
Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public charter schools are more popular than ever,
despite inconsistent academic results.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department estimates that more than 2,000 are
operating this fall, one out of every 44 public schools. That's up
from about 1,600 last year and two in 1993, when the first ones
opened in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 36 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have
legalized charter schools as they search for new ways to improve
educational performance. These schools are granted broad freedom
from state and local control in order to follow a specific plan of
instruction spelled out in their contract _ the charter. Just like
other public schools, they are funded by taxpayers and charge no
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Center for Education Reform, a pro-charter
advocacy group, estimates that this year the combined enrollment of
charter schools will exceed 500,000 students, up from 350,000 a
year ago. That's about one out of every 94 public school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is that, like it or not, there will be
permanent changes in American public schools,'' said Democratic
education analyst Jack Jennings, director of the Washington-based
Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. ``The days of
cookie-cutter public schools from coast to coast are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in recent months, independent academic audits have shown:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Texas, the test scores of the many charter schools showed
smaller gains than other public schools, or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, charter schools filled 17 of the 45
lowest-ranked slots in the state's latest annual ranking of public
schools, even though they made up only 71 of the more than 2,000
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Michigan, test scores from charter schools were generally
lower than those from other public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Arizona, where more than one-fifth of the public schools
are charter schools, university researchers didn't find any
significant differences between the average gains by students
taking state-mandated tests in charter and non-charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ In California, only a small sample of charter schools has been
studied. The year-to-year gains by their students were higher than
those for students in other, nearby public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even within cities, the differences can be acute. In Houston,
the Kipp Academy has been outstanding in raising the test scores of
disadvantaged students, while the All Saints Academy was so badly
mismanaged that state authorities decided to cancel its charter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, neither supporters nor critics expect such ambiguous
findings to slow the charter school boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter schools can be wonderful, mediocre or poor, but most
charter schools, I believe, do a very good job,'' said Education
Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The first results from a large and lengthy federal study
designed to find out whether his optimism is justified are due for
release early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Riley's department has spent about $200,000 per
charter school on subsidies. About 90 percent of the funds reached
individual charter schools, though some was spent on research,
state chartering agencies and national meetings like the three-day
conference to be held in December for 2,000 charter-school
educators and state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools also qualify for regular federal education
programs, such as Title I money for low-income students or IDEA
funds for disabled students.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, most members of both parties in Congress and
most governors are vocal supporters of the movement. Both of this
year's major-party presidential candidates _ Vice President Al
Gore, the Democrat, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
Republican _ are enthusiasts. They often visit successful charter
schools and each has pledged to expand federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever said charter schools would all be great. What we
said was that those that aren't good enough will be held
accountable and shut down,'' said charter-school pioneer Joe Nathan
at the University of Minnesota's Center for Social Change.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are trying to praise or criticize charters
with very little evidence, because this is still a very early phase
of an exciting experiment,'' Nathan said. ``What would be useful
right now is a little patience.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Some defenders attribute the inconsistent record to predictable
startup problems, complicated by tight budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful when comparing brand new schools, where
boards are still feeling their way, with settled old-style schools
that have been in business for years,'' said Roger Gerber of
Chatham County, N.C., who serves the the charter advisory committee
of his state's board of education.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all charter schools are governed by nonprofit groups _
usually some combination of principals, teachers, parents and
community members. They can't charge tuition, but their states give
them per-pupil payments equal to or smaller than those in other
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   New schools often dip into those operating funds to pay startup
costs, rent and other facility expenses that other public schools
pay for with the proceeds from bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, or charter, that they get from their authorizing
agency gives them a lot more control than other public schools have
over their own budget, staff and curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But they also lose the routine services of the central
bureaucracies. Almost all of the 100 or so schools that failed lost
their charters not because of unsatisfactory academic performance,
but because they were mismanaged or lost track of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those that do survive often have offbeat
characteristics that may not be easy to measure with standardized
tests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some charter schools serve only dropouts, while
others recruit only those who'd like to take some classes in
community colleges or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Others give preference to children who live nearby or have older
siblings in the school, advertise only in certain parts of a city,
or exclude students whose parents decline to volunteer to work at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Some focus on attracting a certain kind of student, such as
someone who is also being home-schooled, is interested in science
or another selected subject, exhibits an artistic bent, wants to
attend a bilingual or trilingual school, or wishes to study an
ethnocentric curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Some are back-to-basics schools with desks all in rows. In
others, there are no desks, and children sit at computer cubicles
or in circles on a rug. Some teach the children outside the school
by sending interns to hotels, offices, hospitals or other
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Some have union teachers, though most do not. Some pay higher
than union scale; most pay much less.
</P>
<P>
   Even some vehement critics have decided that charter schools are
here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Public school boards and administrators often fought the
creation of charter schools. But now many districts sell services,
such as transportation or management and bookkeeping, to charter
schools. So do more than 30 competing private firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educators who start charter schools quickly learn that they
are very challenging from a financial point of view,'' said Tom
Evans, a senior analyst at Eduventures(cq), a national market
research firm. ``The margins are tight, there are high up-front
capital costs. It's not a business people should go into lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions remain skeptical, and their leaders are divided
over the merits of charter schools. But there are signs that
resistance may be fading in some places:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Michigan affiliate of the National Education Association
recently won two organizing battles to represent teachers at
charter schools in Lansing and Eaton Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Miami, the Dade County affiliate of the American Federation
of Teachers announced this month that it would create 10 charter
schools and hire a private company, Edison Schools, Inc., to
operate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique to have a private company hired by a union to run
a school, but you'll see more of that in the future,'' predicted
Chris Whittle, founder and CEO of Edison, the largest for-profit
manager of charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not perfect. ... We categorize our schools, and there is
a handful of schools where we don't like our results,'' Whittle
said. ``What I will tell you is that you aren't likely to see those
same schools on that (low-performing) list next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition from charter schools has also improves
``traditional'' public schools, said Jeanne Allen, president of the
Center for Education Reform. ``Now that they have competition, they
realize they have to shape up.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mesa, Ariz., public schools launched a three-week ad
campaign to convince people to keep their children in regular
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Principals in Milwaukee called parents this summer to discuss
the upcoming school year.
</P>
<P>
   _ After many students switched to charter schools in Lansing,
Mich., the mayor formed a committee of civic and business leaders
who started a drive to revitalize the school district.
</P>
<P>
   But some academics who aren't identified with either side say
that neither the skeptics nor defenders have proven their case.
</P>
<P>
   At Michigan State University, which has conducted several
state-financed studies of the state's public schools, professor
David Plank said, ``Charter school advocates say their (students'
test) scores are increasing faster than traditional charter
schools, but I haven't been able to validate that.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``best guess'' at this point: ``Clearly, charter schools are
successful in attracting the children who were worst-served by
other public schools, but they don't have a magic formula for
raising those children's achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Premack, director of the California Charter School
Development Center, said, ``The real problem is that schools,
whether or not they are charter schools, have a high turnover, and
we don't have a system of tracking students from one school or
system to another, so it is extremely difficult to measure the
value added'' to a child's education by a particular school.

ALEXEI NEMOV OF RUSSIA WINS MEN'S GYMNASTICS GOLD MEDAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Alexei Nemov hadn't seen his newborn son,
not even a picture, in the 18 days since his birth, but the idea of
being a father took up every spare inch of his thoughts. Suddenly,
there was no room for distractions.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked into the Super Dome Wednesday night, the Russian
with the biceps of an action hero didn't see the other competitors
in the men's Olympic all-around gymnastics final. As he calmly
walked away from each captivating routine, the 24-year-old with a
mapmaker's attention to detail didn't notice the cameras
documenting his every moment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nemov was fixated on his son. One day, he said, he
would tell him a story about Wednesday night, and he wanted it to
be a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important thing was my son. That was my major motivation,''
Nemov said through an interpreter. ``I wanted to do my best for
Russia, for my family and loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was let down. Once considered an inconsistent talent in
gymnastics, Nemov calmly unveiled a remarkable mix of grace,
strength and a daredevil's nerve. He was a detached tactician on
each apparatus. Only when he punctuated his last routine of the
night with a twisting dismount on the parallel bars did Nemov
finally allow emotion to seep into his expression.
</P>
<P>
   He had tears in his eyes, and a quiver in his chin. The evidence
of his joy was still there as he stepped onto the medal stand,
bowed his head and allowed himself to be draped with a gold medal.
Although silver medalist Yang Wei of China pushed Nemov, and
Ukraine's Beresh Oleksandr posed a peripheral threat, Nemov's score
of 9.775 on the parallel bars left no doubt as to who would own the
coveted title as world's best gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the best feel for the aesthetics of the sport,'' said
Peter Vidmar, NBC analyst and former Olympic gold medalist for the
United States. ``He doesn't just do a skill, he makes it look
gorgeous. Some gymnasts think if their arm is bent a little it
doesn't matter, but Nemov understands it matters. He's not the
strongest gymnast, but he's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   That was clear from his opening routine on the high bar. He
approached the apparatus as if he was a trapeze artist. Whirling
his body around the bar in swift revolutions, he would repeatedly
release, flip high into the air and then catch the bar on his way
down, all without a hint of hesitation. A score of 9.787 brought a
roar from the crowd. After the first of six events, he was in first
place. He never relinquished that spot.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   To most, it was a dominating, mesmerizing performance. But at
least one competitor in red, white and blue was not impressed. It
wasn't the wholesome, freckle-faced teen from Wisconsin, Paul Hamm,
but the irascible Blaine Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody could be as good as Nemov,'' said Wilson. ``Yeah, he's
a great gymnast but anyone can be that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Wilson wasn't one of them. While he finished
sixth with the help of a spectacular 9.8 on the vault _ making a
handspring to a double-front look easy _ the Olympics has not been
the coming out party for Wilson. He still has an apparatus final to
compete in, but that's another individual event. Perhaps feeling
the pressure to carry the Americans, he suffered a couple of
uncharacteristic meltdowns in the team competition. On Monday, the
United States finished a disappointing fifth, and Wilson left the
floor without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have to redeem myself at all. I walked into
this having done more for U.S. gymnastics than any other gymnast
out there,'' said Wilson, perhaps forgetting the Bart Conners and
Vidmars who came before him. ``I don't have to explain myself to
anyone, not to you, not to my family, not to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 26, could return for another Olympics, but, by then, the
U.S. team's promotional star will likely be Hamm. The 17-year-old,
whose twin, Morgan, is also on the team, showed impressive poise
Wednesday night. Paul Hamm was not only performing in his first
Olympic all-around competition, but, by the luck of the draw, he
was in the same rotation as Nemov.
</P>
<P>
   What was more unsettling, he followed Nemov on every apparatus
but one. It was like a finger painter trying to top Picasso. But
the inexperienced Hamm pressed onward. Although he began with a
fall on the high bar, and found himself in 34th place after the
first event, he had the resilience of youth. By the end of the
competition, Hamm could look up to the scoreboard and see himself
in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great learning things as far as dealing with the
pressure,'' Hamm said. ``I don't think you can have any more
pressure than following an Olympic champion all night.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he arrived in Sydney, Nemov looked like a man
who wanted it more than anyone else. With the thought of his son to
keep him focused, he went after the gold medal without a trace of
doubt in his demeanor. Underneath, though, Nemov admitted that his
nerves were jangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could fall at any moment. That's how I felt,'' Nemov said.
``Destiny was on my side. God was on my side. I ended up with the
gold. That's it.''

&HT;     GENETICS: OLYMPICS OFFER ANTIDOTE TO CLINTON'S DANGEROUS
BELIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JON ENTINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILL, Calif. _ The Olympics celebrate character and
courage. But at the 2000 Games, science is also on display, even on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   What unfolds in Sydney offers a welcome chance to ease
acceptance of the revolution in genetics that is overturning
traditional notions of what it means to be human.
</P>
<P>
   Genetics frightens people. Activists rage that genetic
technology may lead to discrimination based on ``race'' in
employment and insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   People worry that researchers are trying to isolate ``violence
genes'' to target teen-agers based on their perceived potential to
commit crimes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in an attempt to quell jitters about the
impact of the Human Genome Project, President Clinton declared that
humans are 99.9 percent biologically similar. In effect, he was
implying that there are no meaningful differences between
populations.
</P>
<P>
   That belief is wrong, and dangerously so. We share 98.4 percent
of our genes with chimpanzees, 95 percent with dogs, and 74 percent
with microscopic roundworms.
</P>
<P>
   Only one gene determines if one is born male or female, a pretty
meaningful difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, what's meaningful is which genes and how they are
patterned, not the percentages of genes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the flash word is not genetics so much as race, a
concept much like a Dagwood sandwich, layered with hundreds of
years of sometimes-racist mythology. But limiting the rhetorical
use of that problematic word, an admirable goal, is not going to
make the patterned biological variation on which it is based
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Although people share a common humanity, we are different in
critical ways _ such as our genetic susceptibility to diseases. For
instance, blacks are genetically predisposed to contracting
colo-rectal cancer; Eurasian whites are genetically prone to
multiple sclerosis; and Asians are by and large victims of neither.
The problem with Clinton's pandering to political correctness is
that it threatens confidence in the life-saving aspects of the
genetic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It's in that context that the Olympics are so opportune.
Consider the most international of sports, track and field. If, as
socially acceptable wisdom has it, success is solely a product of
cultural factors _ desire and opportunity _ one might expect to see
winners drawn from all parts of the globe. In fact, blacks,
one-eighth of the world population, hold the record in every men's
running distance from the 100 meters to the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all blacks are naturally superior
athletes. Sports performance owes little to skin color, but much to
the genetics of populations. All of the top sprinters challenging
for gold are of primarily West African origin, including
African-Americans. They hold 498 of the top 500 times in the men's
100 meters. But blacks from this region are notoriously poor
distance runners, in part because of their naturally smaller lung
capacity and a dearth of slow twitch muscle fibers critical for
endurance sports.
</P>
<P>
   In a mirror image, East Africans _ chiefly Kenyans, who have
evolved in the highlands of the Great Rift Valley _ dominate
distance running but are mediocre sprinters. East Asians, who are
not very good at jumping and running (except ultra-long races such
as marathons) because of naturally high levels of body fat and a
predominance of slow twitch fibers, are prominent in diving and
gymnastics. When flexibility is key, East Asians shine (hence the
term ``Chinese splits'' in gymnastics).
</P>
<P>
   Although no white (or Asian or East African) has ever cracked 10
seconds in the 100 meters, whites are competitive, if generally
second class, at distance running. Whites of Eurasian ancestry, who
have, on average, more natural upper-body strength, predictably do
best at wrestling, weightlifting and field events such as the
shot-put and hammer (whites hold 46 of the top 50 throws).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither culture nor genes alone determines who become
great athletes. The popular debate over nature vs. nurture is
scientifically naive, for genetic variation is grounded in
environmental adaptations and genes are ``expressed'' by
environmental triggers.
</P>
<P>
   My book, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We
Are Afraid To Talk About It,'' documents the wholly uncontroversial
fact that different body types have evolved in differing
environments over thousands of years. For example, Inuit Eskimos
are biologically programmed (with individual exceptions) to be
shorter than European whites. Genetically linked, highly heritable
characteristics such as skeletal structure, muscle fiber types,
reflex capabilities, metabolic efficiency and lung capacity, are
not evenly distributed among populations and cannot be explained by
known environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   Though individual success is about fire in the belly, genes set
possibilities. In running, elite athletes are born and not made.
``Differences among athletes of elite caliber are so small,'' notes
Robert Malina, Michigan State University anthropologist and editor
of the Journal of Human Biology, ``that if you have a physique or
the ability to fire muscle fibers more efficiently that might be
genetically based . . . it might be very, very significant. The
fraction of a second is the difference between the gold medal and
fourth place.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek to deny what we see with our own eyes in Sydney
threaten to throw a dangerous and racist cloud over health
research, the soul of the Human Genome Project. Scientists are just
beginning to isolate the genetic links to some 3,000
biologically-based diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we need to look at the causes of differences in
athletic performance between races as legitimately as we do when we
study differences in diseases between the various races,'' says
Claude Bouchard, director of the Pennington Biomedical Research
Center in Baton Rouge, La., and a leading geneticist studying
obesity and athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In human biology . . . it is important to understand if age,
gender, race, and other population characteristics contribute to
the phenotype variation,'' he writes in the American Journal of
Human Biology. ``Only by confronting these enormous issues head-on,
and not by circumventing them in the guise of political
correctness, do we stand a chance to evaluate the discriminating
agendas and devise appropriate interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the science. The politics of race are more precarious,
however. Fascination about black physicality has been part of the
dark side of the American dialogue on race for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   We readily accept that blacks have a genetic proclivity to
contract sickle cell anemia, that Jews of European heritage are a
hundred times more likely than other groups to fall victim to the
degenerative mental disease Tay-Sachs and whites are most
vulnerable to cystic fibrosis. Yet we label it racist to
acknowledge that blacks of West-African ancestry have evolved into
the world's best sprinters and jumpers and East Asians the best
divers.
</P>
<P>
   If we do not welcome the impending genetic revolution with open
minds, if we are scared to ask and to answer difficult questions,
if we lose faith in science, then there is no winner; we all lose.
The question is no longer whether genetic research will continue
but to what end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If decent people don't discuss human biodiversity,'' writes
George Mason University professor Walter E. Williams, ``we concede
the turf to black and white racists.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Sydney.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There had never been another 100-meter
freestyle like this _ three men who had volleyed the world record
over the last five days in swimming's main event, eight lanes of
water that churned so furiously they seemed to boil with
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   The women's 200-meter butterfly did not carry the same tense
mystery. Rather, the entire race was one of stunning surprise as
Misty Hyman of Phoenix, Ariz., took an early lead and did not fade
as she frequently had in the past. She produced the biggest upset
of the Olympic swim meet, overcoming the defending champion and
world-record holder, Susie O'Neill, who is known in her native
Australia as Madame Butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   If the outcome of the 100 freestyle was murky at the midway
point, it became crystalline as Pieter van den Hoogenband of the
Netherlands drew his long, thin form into an inexorable lead. He
was the only man to cover the final 50 meters under 25 seconds.
There had been a look of surprise on his face after he won his
first race of the Sydney Olympics, but Wednesday night it was a
look of inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Thorpe of Australia was supposed to be the swimmer of these
Games, but van den Hoogenband has proved himself the greatest of
all. He has won two gold medals, set two world records and tied a
third. He beat Thorpe in the 200 freestyle on Monday, and Wednesday
night he defeated the two-time Olympic champion Alexander Popov of
Russia in the 100 freestyle in 48.30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It did not match the world record of 47.84 that the Dutchman set
in Tuesday's semifinal, but it was nearly four-tenths of a second
faster than Popov. A world record holder last week, he had to
settle for silver Wednesday night in 48.69. Gary Hall Jr. of the
United States, the 1996 silver medalist who has battled diabetes
the last year, took third in 48.73 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   This meet was supposed to be a chlorine war between the United
States and Australia, but the Netherlands has appropriated the
individual competition. After winning the 100-meter butterfly
earlier, Inge de Bruijn broke her own world record in Wednesday
night's 100-meter freestyle semifinals in 53.77 seconds. She and
van den Hoogenband have been collecting world records as if they
were Olympic pins.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 world marks set or tied here, they have accounted for
five. They will also be favored in the 50 freestyles and could end
up with six gold medals between them. Are you the best? someone
asked the reticent van den Hoogenband, who is studying to be a
doctor, not a public figure. Finally, even he had to concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won two gold medals and broke two world records,'' the
22-year-old van den Hoogenband said. ``Yes, at this moment, I am
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 100 freestyle produced no shock Wednesday night, the 200
butterfly did. Having improved her personal best by four seconds
over the last month, Hyman won the gold medal in 2:05.88, while
O'Neill trailed seven-tenths of a second behind. The crowd of
17,500 at the International Aquatic Centre was left incredulous. If
any victory seemed certain for O'Neill it was this one, especially
since Hyman lacked confidence and nearly gave up the sport as late
as May.
</P>
<P>
   As of two years ago, Hyman was a pioneer who spent 30 meters
underwater at the beginning of her races, swimming on her side in
an undulating motion that she nicknamed the fish kick. In 1998,
however, the underwater start was restricted to 15 meters. As she
rose to the surface sooner, her self-assurance sunk as if it had
struck an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure I could continue at the elite level without
it,'' Hyman said of the fish kick. Four months ago, she said she
considered ``throwing in the towel.'' Friends and coaches implored
her to continue, and she won the Olympic trials in July but
struggled home in the final 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
   She was overshadowed in her own training pool at Stanford
University, where Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres raised much of the
attention and expectation before these Games. And even though
Thompson won her seventh career gold medal Wednesday night,
anchoring the American 800-meter freestyle relay home in 7:57.80,
she has never won an individual event. Neither has Torres. It was
the youngest swimmer in the group, the 21-year-old Hyman, who has
produced the first singular triumph.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyman lacked the reputation of her training partners, she
had the same access to the Olympic women's coach, Richard Quick,
and to a dozen specialists who helped her with weight training,
nutrition, stretching and flexibility. She even had a specialist to
massage the toxins out of her lymph system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Okay, I belong here, I can compete with the best of
them,''' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   She reached the first 50 meters Wednesday night in second place,
then moved into the lead at the midway point. Could she hold on?
O'Neill did not believe so, but, as Hyman touched the wall for her
final turn, she thought to herself, ``I can do this, I can finish
this.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill made a final charge, but she had won the 200-meter
freestyle on Tuesday, and there was not enough left in her legs
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's known for dying in the last leg,'' O'Neill said of
Hyman, ``but she held it together until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband maintained the same calm presence in the 100
freestyle to defeat Popov, who had won the 50 and 100 freestyles at
the past two Olympics. Once, he would have seemed an unlikely
Olympic champion. His mother, Astrid, was a former swimmer, but
Pieter preferred soccer and field hockey and judo until, at age 11,
he went to the pool because his mother was giving lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here I am with a gold medal in my hand,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the 1992 Summer Olympics, where only two Dutch swimmers
reached a final in Barcelona, van den Hoogenband's parents began a
foundation to try to resuscitate the sport. Cees-Rein van den
Hoogenband, a trauma surgeon who is team doctor for the renowned
PSV Eindhoven soccer team, asked his wife if there was any talent
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your son and his friends,'' his wife replied.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. van den Hoogenband raised $30,000 from businessmen
associated with the soccer club and hired Jacco Verhaeren as coach
of his swimming group. Verhaeren now coaches both de Bruijn and
Hoogie, as he is known, in a system that relies on fierce sprint
training over 50 meters and 100 meters instead of the distance work
often used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing fourth in the 100 and 200 freestyles at the
Atlanta Olympics, van den Hoogenband left the sport briefly and
then returned with a new resolve, winning six gold medals at the
1999 European championships and defeating Popov twice. He took a
leave from medical school to train for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of the Dutch here inevitably have raised
suspicions about drug use, but no other swimmers have accused van
den Hoogenband. His father said, ``If Pieter takes drugs, I break
his legs and he can't swim anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably on the most potent drug there is _ hard work,''
said Neil Walker of the United States, who finished fifth Wednesday
night. Said van den Hoogenband: ``In swimming we have rules. One of
the rules is that you don't take drugs. You want fair
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   He is thin at 6-foot-3, weighing only 174 pounds, and his
concave chest reduces drag, allowing him to ride high in the water,
his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hears a lot of jokes about his build _ they call it a
chicken breast,'' said Ad Roskam, the Dutch team manager. ``He
says, `That is my special thing. That is why I'm a surfboard in the
pool.' It is why he doesn't wear a high suit. It would cover his
dent.''
</P>
<P>
   Two gold medals on his chicken breast have made Hoogie a
celebrity in the athlete's village. All he wants to do now is
party, he said. Not really, Roskam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the guy watching people have fun; that's his fun,''
Roskam said. ``His trick is to pay $25 if you empty a bottle of
ketchup on your head.''

   OLY-GYM-MEN (Sydney) _ Alexei Nemov hadn't seen his newborn son,
not even a picture in the 18 days since his birth, but the idea of
being a father took up every spare inch of his thoughts. Suddenly,
there was no room for distractions. As he walked into the Super
Dome Wednesday night, the Russian with the biceps of an action hero

escaped two rugged opponents at the very same time Wednesday night.
The American women advanced to the semifinals of the second Summer
Games soccer tournament for women by surviving Nigeria, by a score
of 3-1. At the very same time, China was being knocked off by
Norway, which means that the United States and Norway have advanced
to opposite semifinals. By George Vecsey.

for real danger.'' Their show of character ended with menacing
defense, pressure that wore Russia down and gave the U.S. women a
88-77 victory. By Mike Wise. (With photo)

<P>
   OLY-ARCHERY (Sydney) _ The Australia-U.S. rivalry that has
become an unraveling thread through the Olympic Games surfaced
again Wednesday in the men's individual archery finals. But it was
less a story of fervent nationalistic competition than the tale of
two single-minded athletes who met for the ultimate prize.

THOMPSON'S 7TH GOLD MEDAL SWEETENS U.S. VICTORY IN 800 FREESTYLE

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ After three legs of the women's 800-meter
freestyle relay Wednesday night, the United States was in danger of
not defending its Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
   As Jenny Thompson dived into the pool, the Americans were
trailing slightly behind Australia. After finishing a disappointing
fifth in the 100-meter butterfly at these Sydney Games, Thompson
might have been dispirited. Instead, she set an Olympic record with
her anchor split in 1 minute 59.35 seconds, and the United States
won another gold medal in the event in 7:57.80.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Thompson touched the wall, she was seven-tenths of a
second ahead of Petria Thomas of Australia. The Americans now have
eight gold medals in swimming, doubling the Australian total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty sweet,'' Thompson said. ``It was nerve-racking
because it was neck and neck. I saw Petria and just put my head
down in the last 25 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory provided Thompson with the seventh gold medal of her
career, the most by an American woman in any Olympic sport. Next is
Bonnie Blair, who won five gold medals in speedskating. The one
unfulfilled aspect of Thompson's celebrated career is that all her
gold medals have come in relays. Her last chance at an individual
gold will come Thursday night in the 100 freestyle. She plans to
retire to enter medical school at Columbia University next August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over all, Thompson now has eight Olympic medals, tying her with
the swimmers Shirley Babashoff of the United States and Cornelia
Ender of East Germany. However, an individual gold is likely to
remain elusive. Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands has become the
world's dominant sprinter. She set a world record Wednesday night
in the semifinals of the 100 freestyle in 53.77 seconds. Thompson
hung on de Bruijn's shoulder the entire race but finished behind in
54.40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of world records this year has raised suspicion in the
swimming world about potential drug use by de Bruijn. She has
denied it. And Wednesday night, when asked if he believed that de
Bruijn was clean, Thompson's coach, Richard Quick, said, ``I'm
going to presume she is unless something were to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have the same ameliorating words for China's Zhuang
Yong, who defeated Thompson in the 100 freestyle at the 1992 Summer
Games in Barcelona, Spain. More than three dozen Chinese swimmers
have since been caught taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she was cheated out of an individual gold by a Chinese
woman,'' Quick said. ``That's too bad. But in my mind, Jenny
Thompson is one of the greatest swimmers in the history of women's
swimming. She won two world championships and held two world
records. An individual gold she would love to have, but that
doesn't diminish Jenny Thompson at all.'' &QL;

PUERTO RICO'S FIGHT FOR VOTE RESTS WITH BOSTON APPEALS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gregorio Igartua left the United States for
his homeland of Puerto Rico, he was dismayed he could no longer
vote in US presidential elections. ``If I had moved to Russia, I
could vote by absentee ballot, but not in Puerto Rico even though I
am a US citizen,'' Igartua said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the culmination of a decade-long battle, Igartua is set
to arrive in a federal courtroom in Boston in two weeks to argue
that the citizens of Puerto Rico, a US territory of 3.9 million
people, should be able to vote for president. The stakes are
enormous: If Igartua, the attorney in the case, wins in the appeals
court _ and the ruling is not overturned by the US Supreme Court _
Puerto Rico theoretically could gain eight electoral votes, which
could alter the outcome of a tight presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Igartua loses, the case could leave its mark on the
presidential race, because it is being closely watched by Puerto
Ricans who reside in the 50 states. Igartua has already won a
preliminary ruling in his favor in Puerto Rico, but now the Clinton
administration is appealing that ruling to the Boston court,
arguing that Puerto Ricans have no right to vote unless they move
to a state. Igartua moved back to Puerto Rico from Virginia in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if Hispanics in the United States learned that
the (Clinton administration) doesn't want us to vote, that will
affect the Hispanic Democratic vote,'' Igartua said. And if he wins
the case, Igartua said, ``there is a chance that we will decide the
outcome of the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Puerto Rican Legislature recently authorized the
first US presidential vote in the island's history on the
presumption that Igartua will win his case. Ballots are being
printed and campaigns are being readied, all in hopes of a
favorable ruling in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore have
declined to take a position on whether Puerto Rico should
participate in the election, noting that the matter is before the
courts. Both candidates have identical positions on Puerto Rico,
saying they would back statehood if a majority of voters on the
island support it. Both campaigns have taken steps to prepare for
the possibility of a campaign on the island, signing up volunteers
and organizers.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has put the Clinton administration in an awkward
position of fighting to block a Puerto Rican constituency that is
normally an ally. Indeed, the governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro
Rossello, is Gore's campaign manager on the island. The island also
is a large source of campaign contributions, with about 77 percent
of the $3 million given to the two major parties in the current
election cycle going to Democrats, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics. Many Democrats, including members of the
Kennedy family, make regular trips to Puerto Rico to gather
contributions for themselves and the party.
</P>
<P>
   If Puerto Rico were allowed to vote, ``it would probably be to
the Democrats' benefit, no question about it,'' said Juan A.
Figueroa, president of the New York-based Puerto Rican Legal
Defense and Education Fund, which is not affiliated with the case.
Win or lose, Figueroa says, the case ``will highlight the
inconsistencies and almost irrationality of the relationship
between the United States and Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Figueroa said, the approximately 3 million Puerto
Ricans who live in the 50 states will be an important voting bloc.
Whatever happens with the case, Figueroa said, ``we will be a
decisive factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, said the
administration has no choice but to fight the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just no provision for US citizens who reside in US
territories to vote,'' Miller said. ``Tomorrow you could move to
Puerto Rico and lose your franchise. A Puerto Rican can move to any
state and they can vote. It is the ground they stand on, not the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Igartua's case had been considered a long shot because he lost a
similar effort in 1994. But on Aug. 29, a US judge in Puerto Rico
reconsidered the case and ruled in Igartua's favor, saying the
right to vote is ``a function of citizenship and a fundamental
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, US District Judge Jaime Pieras of Puerto Rico said,
the residents of the District of Columbia, which is neither a state
nor a territory, have been given an exemption allowing them to
vote. The District of Columbia won that exemption in 1961 under the
23d Amendment to the Constitution, which made no mention of Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing the ruling last month in Puerto Rico, the Justice
Department has given the matter top priority, urging the US Court
of Appeals in Boston to resolve it before the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   The US Constitution says that members of the Electoral College,
which technically is responsible for picking a president, come from
``each state,'' Justice officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   As a territory, Puerto Rico has no US senators or
representatives, only a ``resident commissioner'' in the US House.
But if Puerto Rico wins in Boston, it might try to secure the right
to have senators and representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion for reversal, the Justice Department has filed a
motion that says the ruling was in ``obvious error . . . summary
disposition is particularly necessary in this case, since the
district court's decision affects the November presidential
election as well as the ongoing presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the case has highlighted Puerto Rico's
unusual status. With a larger population than 25 states have,
Puerto Rico has considerable political potential. The Puerto Rican
government figures that population would entitle the island to
eight electoral votes. To become president, a candidate needs 270
votes. Maine has four electoral votes, Connecticut has eight, and
Massachusetts has 12.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Ricans are not unified in wanting the right to vote
for president. Many advocates of statehood strongly favor Igartua's
case, but the Puerto Rican Independence Party opposes him. Fernando
Martin, vice president of the Independence Party, said Igartua's
case is a means of arguing for statehood.

   ``This has 99 percent to do with local politics,'' said Martin,
a Harvard-educated lawyer. He scoffed at Rossello for running
Gore's campaign in Puerto Rico, saying that is ``like being the
chief of the bobsled team of Fiji. There is no presidential
election of any sort in Puerto Rico. There is a lot of the theater
of the absurd here.''

DRUG COMPANIES CAN CUT COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies say they deserve their profits, the
highest of any industry in the world, because they do us the big
favor of bringing new drugs to market. The Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers Association says it takes an average of 12 to 15
years to discover and develop a new medicine at an average cost of
$500 million. The drug companies say only three out of every 10
prescription drugs earns enough return to meet or exceed research
and development costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of medicines reflects their enormous value _ to
patients, to society, and to the health care system,'' the
association says. ``If we focus too much on cutting the costs of
medicines, we may lose sight of their value, and we may jeopardize
the value of pharmaceuticals that could be developed in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the hospital citadel of Boston, two researchers say we
can cut the costs of the medicines without jeopardizing the
research of the pharmaceuticals. Professor Alan Sager and research
analyst Deborah Socolar of the Boston University School of Public
Health have estimated that with vast numbers of Americans who
currently lack insurance for prescription drugs, the drug companies
could make about the same money if prices were cut to make drugs
affordable to more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug makers claim that any step by government to interfere
with either their prices or their profits will cause destruction
and devastation,'' Sager and Socolar say. ``They are wrong. The sky
will not fall.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report they gave last month to the Northeast Legislative
Association on Prescription Drug Pricing, Sager and Socolar looked
at prices in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. About 23 percent of
the residents of those states (10 million people) have no insurance
for prescription drugs. Currently, insurance companies, government
programs, and individuals paying out of pocket in those eight
states do $18 billion of business for brand name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of all drugs were discounted by 42 percent, the
same discount used by the Veterans Administration, drug spending in
those eight states would be reduced to $11.5 billion. All that
would do is bring the United States in line with the rest of the
wealthy world. Residents of Germany, Great Britain, Canada, France,
and Italy pay between 30 percent and 48 percent less for their
drugs than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But while sales for those who currently can afford prescription
drugs could be cut to $11.5 billion, Sager and Socolar, bolstered
by Wall Street analysis, estimate that lower prices would trigger
an increase in sales among people who currently cannot afford
drugs. Lower prices would also make it easier for state governments
to expand drug discount or free-drug programs for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Between a rise in volume and agreements by the states to
guarantee revenues in exchange for lower prices for patients the
drug companies could still do $18 billion of business in these
eight states. It would cost drug companies very little to produce
the higher volumes because once the machinery is set up to produce
a particular drug, making extra pills or solutions is cheap. Sager
and Socolar estimate that it costs only 5 cents to make an
additional dollar's worth of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, all Americans could fill their prescriptions, instead of
having nearly one out of every four people in the Northeast
needlessly gut it out through illnesses that could result in far
more expensive visits to emergency rooms. The drug companies would
still have plenty of money to continue their research.
</P>
<P>
   Sager and Socolar argue that this would be relatively easy to do
in a nation that is so rich. If it were its own nation, New York
State alone would be fourth in the world in health care spending.
The three states of Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania spend
almost as much on health care as Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not money. The issue is reshuffling health care
from a system in which fewer people pay high prices for
prescription drugs to one in which more people pay lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the situation, there's not a rationale we can
see for higher profits,'' Socolar said over the telephone this
week. ``We spend enough on prescription drugs to be able to provide
drugs for everyone. Italy's drug prices are about half of those in
the United States, but no one is seriously claiming that the drug
companies are suffering because of that.''

MARTY NOTHSTEIN WINS FIRST U.S. CYCLING NON-BOYCOTT GOLD MEDAL
SINCE 1904 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATT: Pa., France)  By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Who doesn't dream of a Dan Jansen Olympic
moment? For four years, for more hours in the gym and on the
cycling track than he could remember, Marty Nothstein thought of
little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of tears, a lot of skin lost, to get to this
day,'' he said Wednesday night at the Olympic Velodrome, rejoicing
following redemption.
</P>
<P>
   His reversal of fortune, his triumph of the spirit, came on
wheels, not skates. It didn't pack the sudden emotional outpouring
of Jansen's long-delayed speed skating gold medal performance at
the 1994 Lillehammer Games, but don't tell Nothstein that. The
victory lap with his young son aboard the bike after winning the
men's sprint in track cycling felt just as good. The kisses from
his wife were just as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The medal around his neck _ the first Olympic gold in cycling
for the United States since 1984 and first non-boycott gold for a
male cyclist since 1904 _ was equally earned.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein had to beat his longtime rival and the two-time
defending Olympic gold medalist, Jens Fielder of Germany, in the
semifinals, and did. He had to descend from the cloud within the
hour and snatch the gold from a world-class French sprinter,
Florian Rousseau, and did. Nothstein, a 29-year-old two-time world
champion from Trexlertown, Pa., won both the two-of-three-race
rounds in two straight, powering from the outside in the stretch of
all four.
</P>
<P>
   That was his plan, and he stuck with it, holding his
once-notorious temper in check after some bumping with Fielder and
controlling his emotions after learning that a longtime friend and
fellow cyclist, Nicole Reinhart, had died in a road race accident
in Massachusetts earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we found out about the tragedy, everyone here has been
thinking about her,'' Nothstein said. ``I know I have. But I came
here to win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nothstein had defeated the 30-year-old Fielder before, though
not since 1997. At the medal news conference, when the American
said he believed he was the better cyclist in 1996, Fielder frowned
and later said: ``I was better in '96. He was better today.''
</P>
<P>
   These two have been stalking each other on banked tracks
worldwide for the better part of a decade. Head-to-head, the sprint
consists of three laps, with the first two utilized for feeling the
other out, building up speed before the final all-out sprint, which
is the one that is timed. It is not a sport for the faint of heart,
or those weak from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches tall, 210 pounds, with short-cropped hair,
Nothstein has the legs of a linebacker. He played football in high
school, and was a baseball catcher, but team sports were a
diversion, for fun. As a 12-year-old, he and his brother were
caught throwing rocks at the house of a neighbor, Heinz Walter, who
suggested that he do something useful like take advantage of a free
local cycling program.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein went for the bait, was soon hooked and later targeted
the Atlanta Olympics as his place to strike gold. He said that
defeat to Fielder, after losing the first sprint by the tread of a
tire, has ``haunted me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, he worked out until he was dizzy. He lifted
270 pounds of weights until he had to rush to a bucket he kept
nearby to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't see the grind you go through,'' he said. ``The
only thing they see is you standing on the podium getting a gold
medal around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   He narrowly beat Fielder in both sprints with almost identical
times of 10.930 and 10.903. Meanwhile, in the other semifinal, the
Frenchman, Rousseau, needed a third ride to eliminate his
countryman, Laurent Gane, while Nothstein rested. ``A good
surprise,'' said Nothstein's coach, Gil Hatton.
</P>
<P>
   The final was a mismatch, as the Frenchman, outweighed by 40
pounds, didn't have the energy or the power to prevent Nothstein
from twice blowing by him on the outside to win going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware that my opponent was very strong and capable of
overtaking me on the outside,'' Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the medal was around Nothstein's neck, and he was
back on the bike, riding a lap with the American flag flapping in
the draft. Then his wife, Christi was in the first row of seats,
helping 5-year-old Tyler over the restraining wall, while their
daughter, 2-year-old Devin, stayed in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made sacrifices and so did my family,'' Nothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off in gold.

TROY BROWN DETECTS TROUBLING PATTERN: PATRIOTS' ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Troy Brown's voice was barely audible. The
Patriots had done ``some good things'' Sunday, but to no avail, the
wide receiver said. ``And it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Body and soul were hurting.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Brown had been removed from his usual role
of punt returning on the Patriots' most dependable unit _ special
teams _ ``because I just got a little dinged up. And I think I was
a little exhausted a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lost their third straight game Sunday and, once
again, they did not play crisp, clean, smart football. By now, it
is clear the Patriots are in a rebuilding phase, even if they have
lost three close games to unbeaten teams.
</P>
<P>
   So many chances have been missed, inexcusably. There have been
so many mental blunders. Physical blunders, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's execution,'' Brown said. ``We're just not doing a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown ached.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dependable Patriot, Brown had dropped one key
third-down pass. On another key third down, Brown was open near the
right sideline but Drew Bledsoe bounced a pass to him, a horrible
throw by the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get down there (near the end zone), teams throw a
little wrinkle here and there at us, and it all goes up in smoke,''
said Brown. ``We're just not executing our drives when we get down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   All obviously true, of course, but there is more to the
offensive woes. On their second drive of the second half, for
instance, the Patriots faced a third-and-10. But Brown curled back
only 6 yards deep, so even with a completed pass, New England was 4
yards short of a first down. Yet another punt; yet another mental
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got places where we dump the ball off and give a guy a
chance to run with it,'' Brown said. ``It looked like they did a
good job of sitting on the guys who were going (deeper) for the
first down. That's all due to their coverage; you don't want to
force the ball and throw an interception. I mean, just dump the
ball off and hope the guy can make some guys miss him and get a
first down.''
</P>
<P>
   That play seemed to have ramifications much later in the game.
On the Patriots' final offensive play of the game, it was third and
7 at the Minnesota 14-yard line. Bledsoe dropped back and seemed
ready to throw toward the right hash mark, where tight end Eric
Bjornson seemed to be open.
</P>
<P>
   But Bjornson also seemed a yard or two short of the first down
and Bledsoe, apparently not wanting to repeat that earlier
third-down pass that was short of a first down, stopped his arm in
mid-throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been able to throw the ball,'' said Bledsoe, who
subsequently was sacked, ending the game, ``and he may have been
able to get a first down. The bottom line: On fourth downs, I've
got to get rid of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more mental mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   On the first drive of the second half, the Patriots were down,
21-7. The offense absolutely had to do something to get back in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the special teams had given the offense good field
position, on the Patriots' 35-yard line. A pass to Bjornson on the
first play of the drive gave the Patriots a first down.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the third play, a second-and-8 from their 47-yard line,
the Patriots were forced to audible. Bledsoe shouted to his
receivers, he dropped back and threw to the right sideline, toward
Terry Glenn, who seemed to be running his route in slow motion. The
ball arrived and the surprised Glenn dropped the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses, the mistakes we made, we've got to shake them
off,'' said Brown. ``We have to find a way to eliminate those
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has been focused on the Patriots' last-gasp
drive. But if it weren't for earlier mistakes, the game wouldn't
have come down to yet another futile last drive. For instance,
Bledsoe executed a superb play-action fake on a first-and-goal from
the 9-yard line in the second half, rolled right all by his
lonesome, and spotted an open Rod Rutledge in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe, even with time, threw behind Rutledge. Bledsoe then
was sacked on fourth down and the Patriots got nothing from this
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some good things,'' said Brown. ``We moved the ball
fairly well at times. Other times, there were plays players didn't
make. I mean, on both sides of the ball, we just didn't execute
when we had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is inconsistent, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move the ball but we're not finishing off our drives,'' he
said. ``We've just got to figure it out, figure out what we're
doing wrong, and work on it a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the motto of a rebuilding team.

THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   On a night fit only for the tropical fish an admiring fan sent
in Baggies to Pedro Martinez in the Red Sox clubhouse, the Olde
Towne Team remained afloat for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Life preservers abounded, even without Carl Everett, who walked
around the clubhouse with an ice pack twice as big as his
redwood-sized thighs. Nomar Garciaparra hit a two-run triple in the
third, Dante Bichette cleared the Coke bottles in the same inning
while admitting he never even saw the new Hood Milk carton adorning
the right-field light towers, and six Sox pitchers trudged through
the mud and the blood and the beer to stave off the Cleveland
Indians, 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   When plate umpire Paul Emmel peered through a pelting rain and
decided that Derek Lowe's pitch to Travis Fryman had caught the
inside corner for strike three, ending the game, the Sox had a win
that narrowed the margin between the teams to two games in the
wild-card race with 13 games left on the Boston schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could play in that rain because it wasn't steady, but that
game was long, man,'' said center fielder Darren Lewis, who played
in Everett's stead and contributed a double in a two-run fourth.
``You stand around, go sit down, get back up, it's wet. But it
would have been longer if we lost, believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep plugging away, every day. Doesn't matter
who's playing or not playing, just do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitches the matinee of a day-night doubleheader against
the Indians, who inevitably wind up swimming with the fishes when
he has the ball. Martinez is 9-0 against the Indians, counting
October encounters.
</P>
<P>
   But what looks to be a sure thing in the afternoon becomes as
dicey as the condition of the soaked track these teams will have to
play on.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton Crawford, the rookie who hasn't been the same since his
life started taking the kind of soap opera twists that bedeviled
another famous pitchman from Arkansas (hint: his wife is running
for the Senate), is Jimy Williams's choice to start the second
game. Pete Schourek, who originally had hoped to go, finally
conceded that the pain in his left elbow would make him hittable
even in a Wiffle Ball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with him with the Reds when he pitched through pain for
two years,'' said Dave Burba, the Indians' 15-game winner who will
pitch tonihght. ``So if he says he's hurt, he's got to be
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   So Williams is turning to Crawford. That's the same kid he
passed over in Detroit last Saturday to pitch Steve Ontiveros, the
39-year-old elbow patient who was Dan Duquette's vision of a
replacement for the downed Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   But just because Crawford is starting doesn't mean he'll be
around anywhere near the finish. Williams pulled Tomo Ohka after
just four innings, even though the Kyoto Kid had dodged danger
three times and was ahead, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where we are, we know who we're playing,'' Williams
said. ``I talked to him the best I could after the fourth. It was
my decision to pull him. We have to win these games. We know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox relied on a shaky Hipolito Pichardo, Rheal Cormier, a
newly returned Rich Garces, a perfect Rod Beck, and the unsinkable
Lowe to finish the job. Leave it to the Commissioner, Peter
Gammons, to stroll into the press box during the game and note that
pitchers from seven countries appeared in the game: Ohka (Japan),
Pichardo (Dominican Republic), Cormier (Canada), Garces
(Venezuela), as well as Cameron Cairncross (Australia) and Ricardo
Rincon (Mexico) of the Indians, plus the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gammons could have expanded his list to eight, since Beck is
from Southern California, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was doubtful to play Wednesday, according to Williams,
which leaves the burden of providing some pop to Bichette, as the
Indians are disinclined to pitch to Garciaparra (three walks) and
Troy O'Leary appears to be still lost in the fog that engulfed him
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it,'' said Bichette, who came close to knocking
the cap off a Coke bottle with his two-run home run off Charles
Nagy, the gentleman from Connecticut who made another gallant but
futile attempt to pitch with a sore elbow. ``I hit behind (Ken)
Griffey in Cincinnati, (Larry) Walker with the Rockies, (Andres)
Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind it. It's frustrating at times. But those are guys
they're not going to pitch to.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time Thursday, the Sox may be right back in the middle
of the playoff picture, which is complicated by the Oakland A's,
who had their own day-night miseries (and rain) to deal with but
came out on top of the wild-card race by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even be thinking about Oakland,'' first base coach
Tommy Harper said. ``We've got to win damn near all of these games
against the Indians. They're the team that's right here, that we
have to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play the scoreboard.''

ANALYZING OUR ANIMAL INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was drawn to the title of Dr. Joel Gavriele-Gold's book,
``When Pets Come Between Partners'' for four good reasons, my
husband's horses. Most people probably don't think of thoroughbred
racehorses as pets, but Michael's definitely fall into the pet
category. And they do come between us.
</P>
<P>
   Gavriele-Gold is director of the Institute for Expressive
Analysis in Manhattan, a psychoanalytic training institute for
people in the arts. ``When Pets Come Between Partners'' (Howell
Book House, $14.95) isn't about animal behavior, but about pets and
human behavior. ``Until a few years ago people were embarrassed to
say that their pets created problems in their relationships,'' he
said from his office while his dog, Charlotte, barked in the
background. ``But now they seem more willing to talk about it,
maybe because pets have become so primary in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, pet-related issues only emerged during the
course of therapy for other problems, he said. The book uses
stories from the author's 25 years as a psychotherapist, as well as
from interviews he conducted with other therapists. A few examples:
Ted, whose angry feelings about his own ambivalent sexuality were
projected onto Homer, his girlfriend's toy poodle; Miriam, whose
unconscious hostility toward her philandering boyfriend Stan were
sensed by her dog, Genghis, who became vicious with Stan; Harold,
whose anger and guilt at being unable to father a child resulted in
him becoming obsessed with mating rare tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   People-to-pet relationships can be just as complex as
people-to-people relationships, Gavriele-Gold said. ``The way we
behave with our animals is often colored by what is going on within
our unconscious,'' he said. ``The pet is often the catalyst for
what's happening, or not happening, in relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavriele-Gold identifies three main mechanisms that drive our
relationships and illustrates each with examples from his practice.
</P>
<P>
   Displacement. Unconsciously putting past thoughts, moods,
feelings, impulses onto animals, as in the case of Pete, who hated
his girlfriend's Siamese cats because they reminded him of his
selfish mother.
</P>
<P>
   Projection. Unconsciously attributing feelings, thoughts and
actions we don't like in ourselves to a pet. Sam, for example, who
identified with his father's abusive treatment of his mother and
became fascinated with the rough-and-tumble mating rituals of
ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   Repetition compulsion. Unconsciously repeating the same mistakes
again and again, like Dave, whose addiction to relationships with
demanding, destructive women began with his mother and older sister
and came to be reflected in the behavior of his two cats.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the story I most related to involved a horse. Gary
was so jealous of Sultan, his wife Cynthia's horse, that he went
after him with a gun. He ended up shooting Cynthia, supposedly by
accident, but I have my doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Am I jealous of the time and love and money Michael lavishes on
his horses? I suppose it's preferable to him having an affair,
although if he were he'd probably come home smelling better. And I
wouldn't have to listen to all the details, as I did on Sunday,
when his newest pet, the aptly named Cash Shortage, finished last.
``But it was a good last,'' he assured me, beaming with pride.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost understand why Gary shot her.

KOREAN FOILIST IS OLYMPIC FENCING CHAMPION BY A RAZOR-THIN MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Germany, SKorea)    By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Cliff Bayer will long remember the last
touch of Kim Young-ho's sword to his stomach Wednesday, the one
that crushed his chance of advancing to fencing glory. Bayer came
to the Summer Olympics trying to ignore the hopes of his team and
his federation that come with winning two World Cup titles in the
last year and being the 12th-ranked in foil in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to prove that an American fencer was the equal of his
foreign competition and that he was better than the anxious
19-year-old who lost his first bout at the 1996 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer had never faced Kim before but was wary of the resilience
he had seen when the South Korean came back from an eight-point
deficit to win a world championship match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one guy I really didn't want to face,'' Bayer said.
``When I saw him in my bracket, I was nervous. He's smart, really
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   In their match Wednesday, the second for each man, Bayer was
cruising, up 11-7, 13-10, then 14-13. But Kim knotted the bout,
then ducked under an attack by Bayer and countered with the final
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be seeing that for a long time,'' said Bayer, who works
out of the New York Athletic Club and is on a sabbatical from
attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
Business. ``I just missed. It's a heartbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 29, inflicted heartache on three more opponents to win a
gold medal, staging riveting, methodical comebacks against Dmitri
Chevtchenko of Russia in the semifinal and Ralf Bissdorf of Germany
in the final. Three of Kim's victories came by 15-14 scores. ``I
didn't want it that way,'' Kim said through an interpreter. ``I
want to win from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In fencing, the first to score 15 points wins; if no one reaches
15, the most touches after three three-minute rounds wins.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his bout with Bissdorf, Kim stalled frequently, doing
nothing, avoiding contact while pointing his foil at Bissdorf
across the strip, measuring, or maybe, lulling the German. The ploy
seemed to give each man a respite, but Kim could only describe it
as a defense against a Bissdorf attack.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the South Korean said his ability to come back against
Bayer, Chevtchenko and Bissdorf was by means of a ``a skill, where
I have to stretch my arm if I'm not as tall as he is. I practiced
it for three months. It's an attack, a stretch.'' Kim is 5 feet 11
inches, Bissdorf stands 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it worked, and Bissdorf understood. ``He likes
to attack and he attacks very well. I do, too,'' the German said.
``But we didn't attack each other as much because our defenses were
so good. Wednesday we had a real good fight. At 14-14, my strategy
was not enough. His was excellent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kim may have succeeded because he adapted his style to suit his
foe.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chevtchenko, he was a Joe Frazier-like plodder, a tough
guy repelling the 6-4 Russian's trademark running charge, like an
irate bull, down the strip. Their bout had all the wondrous
excitement of an NBA late-in-the-game Hack-a-Shaq strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Against the lean Bissdorf, Kim seemed to mimic the German's
style, as they stretched their scoring into early in the third
period. Bissdorf seemed to be in command at 9-6, but Kim rallied
with five unanswered touches and stretched the lead to 13-10,
before Bissdorf tied Kim at 14. When Kim won the decisive point,
his coach rushed onto the stage at the Sydney Exhibition Center and
tackled him, while Bissdorf stood to the side, waiting to
congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I was dreaming,'' Kim said. ``I didn't know
if it was reality. I thought about my wife, my mother, my son.
History was being made. This is the first gold for Korea in the
men's individual foil.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, whose wife fenced until giving birth to their son, had one
request to make of the Korean Fencing Association, now that he has
a little leverage. Fencing is not widely popular in Korea, and Kim
rarely had enough good partners to work with. He has had to travel
around Korea from his home in Taejun to stay sharp. In victory, he
said, ``I ask for more opponents.''

THE FEET HAVE IT AT THESE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I turned olivine upon learning that Ian Thorpe, the
17-year-old Aussie swimming sensation, has size 17 feet. Because
when I turned 13 my feet turned size 13 with me, and for all the
years since I've been lugging around these satchel-size
sole-and-heel combos, one right and one left. It never dawned on me
that having a pair of over-long dogs could prove to be an asset
instead of a liability.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Thorp-edo,'' as he's known down under, is having a
sensational Olympics, winning races right and left to the delighted
cries of ``Thorpey! Thorpey!'' from his hometown crowd. Three golds
and a silver is his medal count. Who knew that athletic sainthood
could stem from a pair of size 17s?
</P>
<P>
   Flipper-boy is the cover-child for this Olympic edition. As the
current owner of small-boat-size feet, I am saddled with a brace of
size 14 to 15s, depending upon the degree of foppery I select for
my footgear, I am devastated that I never realized what an
advantage I'd have had in the pool. Ever since sophomore year in
high school, and the compulsory dance classes in gym, I was
tumbling over these flipper-size brogans flapping around at the end
of my ankles.
</P>
<P>
   How many generations of comely females ended
otherwisde-promising encounters with that sad sigh I came to know
so well: ``If only you could dance . . . even a little (sigh).''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you live and learn. Live and lose, more often than not,
which is the lesson of Olympic Village life. Because many more
athletes lose than win. But marketing requires success. All of
televised sport is rooted in the basic fantasy of emulating the
athlete's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The key to sport is that the outcome is not scripted. Underdogs
can win. Unlike drama, music, sculpture, poetry, unlike almost all
the other diversions which a prosperous and leisure-saturated
culture can provide, sport holds out attention until the final
bell, whistle, or white line is crossed.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics give profit-conscious business oligarchs the
opportunity to slap the five-ring brand alongside their own logo.
The lure is the image of these strong, healthy body-types
triumphing in highly photogenic settings, the better to sell us
whatever is being sold. There's nothing complicated here: Buy this,
you too can be like that!
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes try too hard. And some advertisers, too. Ukranian
shot-putter Alexander Bagach, last year's world champ, was
suspended for testing positive for steroids for the third time.
Kenyan runner Simon Kemboi was busted for a similar offense.
Romanian weightlifter Traian Ciharean, another banned for a
positive steroid test, was officially listed as missing after
getting booted from the Olympic Village and then missing his plane
home.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the TV ratings is giving NBC a severe case of
the whirlies. Because of the 15-hour time difference between Sydney
and New York, none of the events runs live, and taped events, even
with breathlessly hyped commentary inserted, don't pack the same
wallop for viewers. Viewership in the US is down from '96, '92 and
'88.
</P>
<P>
   So sponsors demand the most bang-for-their-big-buck. Security
crews actually ban cans of Pepsi at the gate; Coca-Cola paid for
their sponsorship, so Pepsi cans get chucked at the door, or you
don;t get in. An Aussie bacon-and-egg combo called locally a
``damper'' went into the dumper, because McDonald's deemed it a
little too close to an Egg McMuffin. I'm not making this up. The
bucks are big with the Lords of the Rings.
</P>
<P>
   And as always when the Almighty Dollar takes over, taste can be
the first casualty. Nike came up with a real stinker of a
commercial, proving anew that it is corporate bigwigs who are
coarsening our popular culture as well as greedy entertainment
producers. NBC, apparently fearful of the condemnation of people
disgusted with the ad, yanked it from the schedule after three days
of assaulting our sensibilities. ESPN, however, still had the
offensive ad on its order-books.
</P>
<P>
   Nike portrayed a masked assailant with a chainsaw chasing Suzy
Hamilton, an American Olympic athlete, running through a scary
landscape in her running pans and sports bra, with Captain Chainsaw
in full pursuit, bent on rape, murder, whatever. When she runs
away, and he stops, gasping, the words come on: ``Why sport?
Because you'll live longer.'' This ad does not deserve to live
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Swoosh crowd at Nike fouled out with this one. To the Just
Do It company's tasteless and tacky commercial, I say:
</P>
<P>
   Just eschew it!

TEACHER CONTRACT TALKS GOING BEYOND BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the name of education reform, Philadelphia wants to turn its
teachers into robots.
</P>
<P>
   That's teacher Lynn Dixon's take on the contract fight between
her union and the city. To make teachers more accountable, the city
wants principals, not seniority, to determine where teachers teach
and how much they are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon says that would give principals too much power and
transform teachers into ``robots, puppets, and Stepford wives'' who
are afraid to be creative in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide drive to overhaul education is contributing to
contract disputes in Boston and Los Angeles as well. In all three
cities, teachers are fighting for higher pay. But seniority is also
at issue, and the contract struggles have as much to do with
principles such as ``accountability'' and ``standards'' as they do
with negotiating economic staples such as salary and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if contracts just dealt with wages, hours and
conditions of employment. But they are _ not just in Boston, but in
most school districts _ the vehicle for school reform,'' said
Samuel R. Tyler of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau, part of a
coalition of community groups that oppose the seniority provisions
in the Boston teachers' contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking down the barriers that exist in the contracts to
improving student performance have to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers like Dixon see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers and their contracts are a comfortable scapegoat,''
said Dixon, who has been an English teacher at Philadelphia's
Martin Luther King High School for 28 years. ``That way if the
reform fails, they can say this contract stood in the way of
reform, not that their ideas were stupid or fallacious from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Philadelphia and Los Angeles have started the school
year without a contract, as is the case in Boston, and the threat
of a strike looms over all three cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ask school officials in any of the three cities why they want to
change the current contracts, and their answers are remarkably
similar.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Kahn, Philadelphia's secretary of education, said the
contract changes the city wants ``address the need for greater
accountability, as well as flexibility on the part of management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the ability at the district and at the school level to
assign teachers where they're needed most, and match teachers'
needs to students' needs,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school officials echo that sentiment, as do those in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really trying to build into a team,'' said Michael
Contompasis, chief operating officer for the Boston schools. ``The
parts are not interchangeable anymore, regardless of what anyone
might say.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every ongoing teacher contract fight in the country can be
connected to education overhaul. According to the Massachusetts
Teachers Association, teachers in roughly 40 districts in the state
are working without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Only one city, Malden, is in serious danger of having a strike,
and seniority and other overhaul issues aren't in play there. In
many Massachusetts districts, the MTA says, issues involving
education overhaul were hashed out in contracts several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, where teachers have already walked off the job on
two separate days this year, the sticking points in the contract
talks are more traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money, money, money,'' said Buffalo schools spokesman Andrew
Maddigan. ``We're apart on salary, and apart on health care
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Ingersoll, a sociologist at the University of
Pennsylvania's education school who studies the teaching workforce,
said it's no coincidence that Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles
are wrestling with some of the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of this accountability movement,'' Ingersoll
said of efforts to scrap seniority as a factor in hiring and
salary. ``Education reform has always involved a lot of conflict
between competing movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say they are all for ``education reform'' to improve
schools _ but they have a different view of what constitutes
meaningful change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says they care about student achievement. But you
can't hold us accountable and not give us the tools to be
accountable,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National
Education Association. ``You have to make sure our students are in
classrooms that aren't crumbling, and that they have supplies and
textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers say smaller classes, tougher discipline policies,
and better teacher training and support would have the greatest
impact on student achievement. And they caution that school
districts haven't fully considered the implications of giving
principals more power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point wasn't to protect bad teachers, but to protect good
employees,'' Ingersoll said of the seniority rules won by the
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston School Department and its supporters note that the
city doesn't want to eliminate school-based hiring committees,
which are made up of teachers, community members, and the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   But principals already have veto power on those panels, and if
the city wins the seniority changes it will make it easier for the
committees to hire teachers from outside the district.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' frustration with the tenor of the debate over
education change also is a factor in the contract fights. Many say
they are being blamed for low test scores while factors beyond
their control, such as broken families, are given short shrift.
Taking a hard line in a contract dispute is a way to express the
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Rodrigues, a second-grade teacher at the Richard J. Murphy
Elementary School in Dorchester, said Boston teachers feel pushed
to defend their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of demands are being put on us, so we need to fight''
for what teachers need, Rodrigues said. ``I feel overwhelmed with
all the demands being asked of us.''

POLISH BUNS TELL A JEWISH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Childhood memories can be so powerfully evocative
that people carry them for decades, in their heads as well as their
hearts. And so when Mimi Sheraton approached Jewish immigrants from
the city of Bialystok in Poland to talk about bialys, she got more
than descriptions of crusty rolls with onion-filled centers. What
tumbled forth was the history of a town, a place where a thriving
Jewish population was almost entirely lost to the Holocaust _ and
with it, the famous buns.
</P>
<P>
   Sheraton has been listening to these stories for 7 1/2 years,
ever since deciding that she wanted to know what bialys tasted like
in Bialystok. ``I've always been fascinated by these things. What
does Danish pastry taste like in Denmark? Turkish delight in
Turkey? French toast in France?''
</P>
<P>
   Her research is documented in ``The Bialy Eaters: The Story of a
Bread and a Lost World'' (Broadway Books). Today, the best bialys
can be found at Kossar's Bialy Bakery on the Lower East Side _
halfway across the world from their place of origin, says the
former New York Times and Time magazine restaurant critic. Standing
in the small shop and taking in the deliciously yeasty aroma,
Sheraton eyes some piping hot buns she'll buy for brunch. She
continues to prefer her bialys dark and crusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people like them light,'' she says. ``They don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, while writing for Conde Nast Traveler about Polish
food, she made a suggestion to her husband, Richard Falcone.
``Let's take a side trip to see if there are bialys in Bialystok.''
Thus began her long adventure. There are only a handful of Jewish
residents in Bialystok now, and the only rolls similar to bialys
are bulkies with onions and poppyseeds made at a shop called New
York Bagels. She's telling me this in a cab heading across East
Houston Street to her West Village brownstone, where she has lived
for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheraton returned from Poland, she wrote an article for the
English edition of the Forward, the weekly Jewish newspaper. Then
she met the late Izaak Rybal, director of the Bialystok Center and
Home for the Aged on the Lower East Side. She asked him about
placing an article in ``The Bialystoker Shtimme,'' printed in both
English and Yiddish and sent to former residents all over the
world. He told her she had to make a contribution. ``I said, `One
hundred dollars.' Then I told him I wanted it to be in Yiddish,
too. `That'll be another hundred,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this mail came in,'' letters written in Polish, Yiddish,
and Hebrew, says Sheraton. ``I called or went to see every one,''
traveling to France, Israel, Argentina, and several cities in the
United States. She met Samuel Pisar, the attorney who wrote ``Of
Blood and Hope,'' an autobiography that includes his years in
concentration camps; the late Max Ratner, former chairman of Forest
City Enterprises; Mordecai Zananni, who owns a pita bakery in
Israel and makes bialys for one customer only _ a Bialystoker; Slim
Schwartzberg, who carried coal and wood for the ovens at Kossar's
when he was 11 years old and slept on warm flour sacks in winter;
and Leo Melamed, former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   From them, she pieced together the history of Bialystok, a city
on the northeast coast of Poland next to Belarus that served as an
escape route. ``Jews would try to sneak across the border to get
into Russia,'' says Sheraton. ``A man I met in Argentina hid out in
the woods for months. He's 83 years old. He ate roots and stole
food and went hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Bialystokers to be unusually tough, a very scrappy
bunch,'' she continues. ``Some were tough street fighters. It
helped them survive the camps. Bialystok was a vibrant city, the
center of the Bund (United Jewish Workers Society) and Zionist
movement. There were 600,000 Jews before 1939, and about 200,000 in
the province of Bialystok. They ran the arts, the theater, the
lumber industry, the leather industry, textiles, newspapers, and
the social services. Sixty to 70 percent of the town were Jews.
There were five left when I went. Now it's probably more like
three.''
</P>
<P>
   The town was famous for its kuchen, or buns (the word
``kuchen,'' writes Sheraton, translates as ``any baked good'').
Bialystoker kuchen became simply ``bialys'' in America, where they
were first made at the turn of the 19th century. Bialys are always
dusted with flour, and the dough they're made from is exactly like
a pizza dough _ without the oil. The center indentation is filled
with onions. Kuchen in Bialystok were sprinkled with poppyseeds,
which bakers here omit.
</P>
<P>
   The bun is similar to something called a pletzl, which is flat.
``My guess is that it originated by accident as a variation on the
more ubiquitous pletzl.'' She wonders if an unbaked pletzl fell to
the floor, was stepped on, and a frugal baker saved the dough by
covering the hole with onions and poppyseeds. The sides puffed when
it was baked.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, bialys became a symbol of comfort. Pisar, the
attorney, wrote, ``It reminds me of coming home safely from school
in the late afternoons of Bialystok's long, dark season. I can
still hear the women vendors carrying hot kuchen in big straw
baskets as they went through the streets yelling at the top of
their lungs, `Kuchen, kuchen, heisse kuchen.' They had to be heiss,
not cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Arieh Shamir, an Israeli writer whom Sheraton met in Jerusalem,
told her, ``Rich Jews ate kuchen with meals, and for poor Jews
kuchen were the meal. Sometimes we had kuchen with tea and maybe a
piece of smoked herring or other fish, or with soup of cabbage and
potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Butter or cheese was always spread on the top or bottom.
Sheraton was surprised to discover that no Bialystoker eats bialys
the way she does _ cut horizontally to make a sandwich. ``Who
slices a bialy?'' a Kossar family member scolded her. ``It's not a
roll, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheraton once asked a Bialystoker if bialys were an everyday
food or a luxury. ``Dahling!'' he answered. ``Food vas a luxury!''

TWO SENIORS DRIVE LATEST FAST COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running with Fast Company has always seemed a younger person's
game. Its design, typography, and even its ads ooze hiptitude.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as a surprise that two of the better offerings in
another fulfilling issue spring from senior citizens. It's not that
the magazine is slowing down, it's that these folks aren't either.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, for example, is 74, and age isn't the only way
in which she goes against form. The movie version of life would
never cast a short, gray-haired grandmotherly type as the nation's
top cyber cop, but as chief of the bureau of consumer protection in
the Federal Trade Commission, that's what she does.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the well-paced story by Daniel H. Pink, she
does it well. In her tenure, he writes, she has brought more than
100 federal cases of Internet fraud, and recouped $80 million for
duped consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein isn't particularly Net-enamored herself. She rarely
uses e-mail, and has only purchased pantyhose online, she tells
Pink. But during a tour of FTC field offices upon her taking the
job in 1995, she asked where the new scams were, and everyone said
``the Internet.'' She didn't need to be a netizen to know she'd
found a new arena in which to fight fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has not only given hucksters a new place for old
tricks, such as pyramid schemes and lying ads. It has also opened
clever new vistas, such as the Moldovan modem jacker, which enticed
surfers with naked women, then underhandedly switched the computer
connection to an incredibly expensive server in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Pink points out that her visage makes for great visuals when she
goes on television to publicize the scams the bureau has uncovered:
``As a public official,'' Pink writes, ``she is a TV producer's
dream: John Wayne's persona stuffed into Jessica Tandy's person.''
</P>
<P>
   More in character is Bragi Arnason, who could easily pass for
what he is: a 65-year-old Icelandic chemistry professor. For more
than 20 years, he has been touting hydrogen as the new energy
source, and now some very large entities have begun to listen. His
techniques allow hydroelectric and geothermal energy, both
plentiful in his homeland, to be used to make hydrogen for
eco-friendly fuel cells. Ian Wylie's story is a quick hit, but
enticing and informative nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Such brevity is a blessing, actually, in this heavy-magazine
season. Newsstands are groaning right now under the weight of
2-plus-pounders for which heft seems to be the height of success:
Vogue, In Style, Modern Bride, Harper's Bazaar, Martha Stewart
Living; one bloated book after another. Even last week's New York
Times Magazine was so big it had to be bound.
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly evident that size matters at GQ, where the
first headline word is ``biggest.'' Sometimes big is good, but in
the new GQ, it's not. For people who want to read instead of just
looking at the pictures, all that real estate is annoying; one has
to slog through 139 pages before finding the first real editorial
content.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a concomitant problem as well: With so many pages to
fill, there's no urgency to edit, and many of these stories are
just too long. A prime example is columnist Terrance Rafferty's
opus on crime novelists, triggered by the titanic publicity machine
behind Elmore Leonard's new book. I adore the great Leonard, but
even I gave up before reaching the end. It doesn't look that long,
but it reads that way.
</P>
<P>
   The other Leonard piece in the issue _ how's that for effective
publicity? _ is more to my liking. It not only holds to one page,
but it's written by Leonard himself, on the topic, ``How I write.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An alien in Cuba
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The October Men's Journal delivers a tasty mixture of advice and
entertainment, but there's one story above all that lured me in:
Bill Lee goes to Cuba. What a great idea, a road trip with the
Spaceman, and to Cuba, no less, where Lee's unalloyed love for the
game fits in better than it ever could in the States.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wayne White writes that Lee has never quit playing the
game; they met in the Senior Professional Baseball League. The
stated purpose for the trip is to equip youngsters to play on a
team founded by Ernest Hemingway in the '50s; the team fell dormant
after Hemingway died.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, with the former Red Sox star, motives run deeper.
Here's some vintage Lee, as told to White upon being invited:
``We're not just discussing a destination. I think we're tapping
into a very powerful karmic dynamic: literature, baseball,
communism _ plus I hear the island distillers make excellent rum.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plenty at 20
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discover magazine for October celebrates its 20th anniversary,
and 20s are wild: 20 ways the world could end suddenly, 20 species
we may lose in the next 20 years, 20 things that will be obsolete
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts are illuminating, as they should be: The doomsday
stuff is well thought out, and I had missed more than a few of the
``20 of the greatest blunders in science in the last 20 years.''
Only the ``what you'll need to know in 20 years that you don't know
now'' is a clunker; it's embarrassingly boilerplate, and
uncomfortably stuffed into the 20s format.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the ``20 scientists to watch in the next 20 years''
delivered some deflating news for Hub chauvinists: only one at
Harvard (physics professor Juan Maldacena, 32), and only one at MIT
(chemistry professor Christopher C. ``Kit'' Cummins, 34). Forty
percent of the list cogitates in California, including Jereon
Tromp, 34, who traded Harvard for Caltech a few months ago. But at
least it's easy to see why: he's a theoretical seismologist, and he
went where the temblors are.

MOTHER'S LONG-KEPT SECRET SOWED SEEDS OF `REBELLION'

Eleanor's Rebellion: A Mother, Her Son, and Her Secret 
By David Siff 
Knopf, 320 pp., $25 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 25 years since David Siff's life was turned upside
down. Yet Siff's new memoir gives the impression that the
cataclysmic events of his past have left indelible scars.
</P>
<P>
   At age 40, with children of his own, Siff finds out that he was
adopted shortly after his birth. What makes his discovery all the
more painful is that he stumbles upon it after a blunder by a clerk
at the New York Department of Health. When confronted with her
son's discovery, his mother lies and tells him that he was indeed
the son of her and the man he knew as his father, and had been
formally adopted only because he was born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleanor's Rebellion: A Mother, Her Son, and Her Secret'' is
the true story of a man's vexing journey into his family's past. As
the title suggests, almost nothing Siff had grown up knowing about
his parents _ or himself _ is true.
</P>
<P>
   The full truth doesn't come easy to Siff, or for his mother.
More secrets and lies are uncovered after Siff finds his
confidential birth certificate at the Health Department. These
revelations come months after the death of the man whom he thought
of as his father, and only add to his misery. Not only does he find
out that he was born out of wedlock, but he learns that he spent
the first 14 months of his life in an orphanage, only to be adopted
by his own birth mother. His biological father was not the man who
had raised him, but a man he had never met, the actor Van Heflin.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Segal is 19 and unmarried when she becomes pregnant in
1935 with her firstborn son. From a conventional immigrant Jewish
family, she is forced by relatives to put her child up for
adoption. After Eleanor has reclaimed her son from the Hebrew Home
for Infants in Hoboken, N.J., her husband, parents, aunts, uncles,
and friends help maintain decades of deception.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as Siff tries to get his mother to open up about their
past, she resists. In ``Eleanor's Rebellion,'' Siff recounts the
painful process by which he comes to learn who his mother really
was. Siff discovers the rebellious young socialist who molded
herself into the role of traditional wife and mother. He is forced
to confront gnawing questions: Did his mother love Heflin _ or his
stepfather? Had Heflin known about his birth? What led her to an
affair with the actor? How did his stepfather feel about raising
him?
</P>
<P>
   Through exhaustive research and lengthy interviews, Siff is
successful at answering a few pestiferous questions, but not
without a price.
</P>
<P>
   His vulnerability takes him on a downward spiral of excessive
drinking, extramarital affairs, and compulsive shoplifting. Like
Heflin, he fathers a child that he never meets. His wife and two
children watch helplessly as he abandons his present and tries to
convince himself how deeply he is following in Heflin's footsteps.
``I was someone who had lost any sense of who I was, where I had
come from,'' he writes. As Siff faces his true identity in middle
age, readers will find themselves in his corner, rooting for his
self-discovery and self-acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Siff will come to discover how and why he became his birth
father's son. Like his father, he pursues a career in acting.
Siff's research on behaviorism and genetics bolsters his findings,
but his frequent use of psychological, psychiatric, and academic
studies to explain his actions and the events of his life bog down
the memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Siff's determination and candor propel the narrative, but the
story is marred by Eleanor's resolve to keep lifelong secrets.Her
story probably would have been more convincing and more stirring if
it were told by Eleanor herself.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the memoir is its heartfelt honesty. Siff ably
moves the reader through his shock, bitterness, and eventually
acceptance. What starts off as an artless memoir turns out to be a
unsparing tribute to a strong-willed woman. Siff's journey toward
understanding is one that only he could make.
</P>
<P>
   His cold war with his mother is most telling. ``I lost all sense
of affection I had for her, my stepfather, aunt, uncle, and all the
relative I had grown up with. I had no past, only a future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the narrative ends on an affirmative note as Siff struggles
to come to terms with his past. The reader only can hope the book
was as therapeutic as it is troubling.

INDIAN TRIBES DISPUTE HARVARD ON ANCESTORS' REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Before there was a Massachusetts or Rhode
Island, the nations of Narragansett and Wampanoag ruled much of
what is now known as New England. Over the centuries, the two
Indian tribes made war and peace. Today, their descendants are
battling again, and instead of blaming one another, they're aiming
their ire at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is which tribe should be the real heir to the remains
of ancestors and holy tribal items long part of the vast collection
held at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has been reviewing hundreds of claims from Indian tribes
since 1990, when Congress passed the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act. The law requires federally funded
museums, universities, and government agencies to return all sacred
objects, cultural patrimony, and human remains to their rightful
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Peabody Museum, which has the largest collection of American
Indian remains outside the Smithsonian Institution, has already
repatriated some of its 11,857 individual human remains and nearly
5,000 sacred objects to tribes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the fracas over the local remains _ about two-dozen bodies,
bones, and artifacts buried with them _ is proving to be one of
Harvard's most contentious cases.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both the Narragansett and Wampanoag tribes have laid
claim to the items. They view their ancestor's remains as a
spiritual force and say that it is a desecration to keep the
remains in a museum storage space, rather than burying them in
their native land.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Barbara Isaac, the assistant director of
Harvard's Peabody Museum, John Brown, the Narragansett tribe's
historic preservation officer, lambasted Harvard for what he said
was a flawed interpretation of Indian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another setting, your actions would simply be considered
laughable, sad, and pitiful,'' Brown wrote. ``Your abysmal
ignorance is, clearly, something to be pitied, but considering the
backdrop of federal law, your actions are . . . criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that you, through negligence, sloth,
bad-faith dealings . . . have attempted to frustrate and obfuscate
federal law,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After years of compiling a detailed inventory of the remains it
holds, Harvard last month published a notice in the Federal
Register listing all the remains it has from within the borders of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Through scientific analysis and after checking the two tribes'
oral histories and archeologists' records, officials at the Peabody
Museum say the evidence suggests that most of the remains belong to
the Wampanoag tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings take into account the totality of the evidence,''
Isaac said in an interview at the stately brick-faced museum just
off Harvard Yard. ``Mr. Brown has the right to contest our
findings. But we have many other tribes and claims to deal with.
And, frankly, he is taking up a lot of our time for really only a
few funerary objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has already taken action.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after learning about Harvard's posting in the Federal
Register, he wrote a letter to the Cultural Resources Stewardship
and Partnership Division of the National Park Service, complaining
about Harvard's ``lack of proper consultation, faulty historical
documentation, as well as falsification of the record.''
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of the Wampanoag tribe, Brown demanded a
hearing before the museum repatriates any of the Rhode Island
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard University is attempting to change the historical
record with respect to the government-to-government relationship
that the Narragansett Indian Tribe and the United States enjoy,''
Brown wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Narragansetts argument with Harvard is that
the United States recognizes that the tribe has inhabited all the
land of Rhode Island, from antiquity to the present. In contrast,
Peabody museum officials and Wampanoag leaders assert that the
Wampanoag tribe also dwelt in parts of Rhode Island, specifically
on the eastern side of Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of a handful of disputed claims reaching a low
boil on several backburners around the country,'' said Sam Ball, an
archeologist for the National Park Service who is advising a
federal committee reviewing competing Indian claims. ``We will be
assessing Brown's claims.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Wampanoags are trying not to get caught in
the imbroglio. They, too, are upset that the Peabody Museum reached
its conclusions without much participation from the tribe itself,
even though the decision favored the tribe. And they certainly
differ with Brown in his interpretation of history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they have invited members of the Narragansett tribe to
join a future burial ceremony and are focusing on getting the
bodies and sacred items back for proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing to native people why Harvard has behaved so
aloof and has not properly consulted us,'' said Ramona Peters,
coordinator of the Wampanoag repatriation project. ``Unfortunately,
Harvard has been at the center of this controversy, and they have
created problems between the Narragansett and the Wampanoag tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as John Brown's historical interpretations, they
contradict our oral traditions,'' she added. ``We have the facts.
He himself is trying to change the history.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials suggest they would prefer not to be involved
in the conflict as they try to return objects as required by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel some of these issues are bigger and beyond us,'' the
museum's Isaac said. ``We're dealing with them as we can.''

MUSIC TEACHER HEARS A SYMPHONY IN SLAVES' SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SANDY COLEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they worked the fields long ago, the pain oozed out of slaves
in melodic moans and groans. Sung in minor keys, and usually in
vowel sounds, their field hollers were low, deep, and haunting.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Brookline (Mass.) High music director Geoffrey
Dana Hicks played recordings of slave hollers for his students, it
was the teacher who was struck by what he thought he already knew:
Music, even the sorrowful sounds of despair, can sustain you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to them and I just started crying,'' said Hicks,
46. ``Out of all this pain, they were still able to sustain
themselves, managing all this pain.''
</P>
<P>
   And it inspired Hicks to launch an ambitious attempt to write a
symphony based on those same field hollers, a tribute to some real
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Oo-oh, oo-ooh, aa-ah, aa-aah, yea-e-yeahe,(unitals) Hicks
sang recently as he recalled the recordings from the Smithsonian
Institution that moved him. ``It teaches us the value of music,''
he said. ``It gives us the ability to endure such grotesque
hardships.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating an orchestral narrative of slave music _
from hollers to work songs to spirituals _ Hicks wants his symphony
to underscore the music's power. He consciously chose to take an
African art form and transform it into a classical work, hoping to
elevate the hollers and give them stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a symphony piece, people take you a little more
seriously,'' said Hicks, who is trying to establish himself as a
composer. ``This is something all of us can draw our strength from.
It transcends color.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of an American diplomat who grew up in Germany, Hicks
has used music to erase the lines often drawn between race,
religion, class, and age.
</P>
<P>
   He was at it recently one afternoon in his third-floor music
room at Brookline High.
</P>
<P>
   School was over, but a girl rushed in on platform flip-flops to
audition for the school choir.
</P>
<P>
   But which one? Concert choir? Gospel choir?
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Can a Jewish girl sing in a gospel choir? she wondered out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hicks told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it for fun, not to preach. The whole point of having the
gospel choir is to bring kids together, not to divide, not to say
you can't sing gospel choir because you're not black,'' Hicks told
the student as he sat at a piano.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the girl sing a soulful ``Lift Every Voice,''
Hicks' response: ``You sing with a lot of emotion. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the girl she could join the gospel choir and she left to
fill out papers, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has taught in Brookline for 17 years. In that span, he has
written orchestral pieces and conducted several choirs, including
the New England Conservatory Youth Chorale. In 1995, he conducted a
citywide 120-voice youth choir for the dedication of the New
England Holocaust Memorial in downtown Boston. This summer, he took
an intergenerational choir on a singing tour in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But ``this is my first symphony,'' said Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   And, it hasn't been easy. He has been working on it since 1993
and has completed and recorded only one of the symphony's four
movements. The first movement, which features violins, flutes, and
trumpets, is based on field hollers. The others will deal with
slave call-and-response work songs and spirituals.

<P>
   Hopefully, the symphony will be finished by Christmas, he said.
Orchestras in Italy and New Mexico are interested in performing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven only wrote nine symphonies,'' Hicks is quick to
point out, compensating for the time it is taking.
</P>
<P>
   He is committed, he said, no matter how long it takes, and wakes
up at 4 a.m. each day to work on it before school. He hopes it will
be an example for his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my students to believe in their dreams, in themselves.
I tell my kids all it takes is dedication and preparation,'' he
said. ``You've got to really want it.''

<P>
   CANYON COUNTRY, Calif. _ The two sisters cried Tuesday as they
watched the video of their first meeting, tears of happiness mixed
with the sadness of knowing 40 years had passed before they met.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Rogers of Canyon Country, northwest of Los Angeles, and her
older sister, Twilight Paige, met for the first time Saturday when
Paige arrived at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The treasured videotape shows passengers on Paige's flight,
aware of the impending reunion, lining up inside the terminal to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Paige stepped off the plane, Rogers ran to her,
screaming, ``Oh, my gosh! It's her, it's her!'' while a stunned
Paige wrapped her arms around her newfound sister and shut her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the sisters sat in Rogers' home and talked of their
instant love for one another, their shared dream of spending the
second half of life together and the common ache to know why their
parents split two sisters born just a year apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was I put up for adoption and she was kept?'' asked
Rogers, 40. ``It's all pretty much water under the bridge now, but
the thing that gets me is why? We'll probably never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Rogers was adopted by a Los Angeles couple when
she was 2 days old. Her biological parents never brought her home
from the hospital to meet her big sister, now 41.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year, Rogers managed to track down Paige in
Oklahoma using her birth records and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Rogers and Paige led separate lives and had no idea
the other existed. Now they have discovered they had more in common
than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite conflicting personal images _ Rogers is matronly and
conservative while Paige's tattoos suggest a more adventuresome
lifestyle _ both are self-described ``neat freaks'' with willful
stubbornness and high-strung temperaments.
</P>
<P>
   They are also haunted by the same nagging question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was some kind of joke when she called and said
she thought she was my sister,'' said Paige, 41. ``But she knew
things about our mom and dad that no one else knew. I've been in
shock ever since. I still can't believe she's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have found each other, they say they want to spend
as much time together as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to talk to each other about anything,''
Rogers said. ``I can call her and say: I'm having a real bad day,
the kids are driving me crazy, and she'll understand. She's someone
I can just love and be close to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, geographic distance remains a problem. Rogers is firmly
rooted in Santa Clarita and devotes much of her time to her two
sons, Daniel, 9, and Chad, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Paige has purchased a mobile home on two acres near Noble,
Okla., and recently built a pool and deck in her back yard. She
said she wants to keep the property to provide financial security
for her 19-year-old daughter, Gypsy Rose Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me 41 years to get where I'm at and Ed McMahon
hasn't come to my door yet,'' Paige said. ``My daughter doesn't
understand this yet, but that property is her security. Everything
out here is very, very expensive, and way too commercialized and
crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rogers is urging her sister to move back to
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting any younger,'' she said. ``I'd like to have
her here for the holidays, and it would be nice to have someone to
do things with. We could go shopping together, go to the movies or
just go to lunch. I definitely would like to have her closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige is planning to return to Santa Clarita north of Los
Angeles in February to see her 73-year-old father for the first
time in more than 20 years. For Rogers, the meeting will be her
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   Though both say they would like to ask him why he and their
mother gave up Rogers for adoption, they also say it might be
pointless at this stage to raise painful questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't confronted him with anything yet and I don't know if
I will,'' Rogers said. ``It's all in the past now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers learned her father's name about six months ago when she
won the rights to see her birth records from a Los Angeles Superior
Court judge. She then persuaded the local Social Security office to
mail a personal letter to an Oroville man she believed to be her
biological father, and got a return letter from him within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' father, James Powell, told her she had a sister, but
that her mother had died of a heart attack in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers typed a note to her sister on an Internet message board,
and a woman who called herself a ``Search Angel'' responded
immediately with information about Paige. Rogers learned her sister
had lived in Orange County and had been married to a man with the
surname Been. She then tracked down Paige's former sister-in-law
through the phone directory and learned her sister's current name
and address.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been history in the making,'' Rogers said. ``I've
always wanted a sister and I can't believe I've had one all
along.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Has anyone changed the world as utterly and gotten as little
credit for it as Joseph-Nicephore Niepce?
 &HT;    People with any notion at all of who invented photography
usually think it was that other Frenchman, Daguerre _ he of the
daguerreotype _ but Daguerre got the idea from Niepce.
 &HT;    Niepce's camera was a cubical wooden box, about a foot on a
side. His film was a tin or stone plate coated with asphalt, which
hardened where the light struck it. With this unlikely apparatus
Niepce took the world's first photographs, in 1824, from a window
of his manor house in Burgundy.
 &HT;    The results were surprisingly sharp: Far across the courtyard,
behind the dovecote, you can make out a pear tree with a gap in its
foliage.
 &HT;    ``Even though it was asphalt, it's still the ancestor of all the
processes we use today,'' says Jacqueline Belloni, a physical
chemist at the University of Paris-South at Orsay.
 &HT;    In the late 1980s, Belloni helped elucidate the fundamental
chemistry of film developing. Now she has developed a new method of
``doping'' film emulsions that promises to make them five times
better at capturing light.
 &HT;    ``If it can be widely applied,'' says chemist Rolf Steiger of
Ilford, a film manufacturer, ``it will certainly be one of the
greatest inventions in photography in the last 60 years.''
 &HT;    Ever since Daguerre (give him credit too), the crucial
light-sensitive material in photography has been silver halide.
Film is basically a lot of silver halide crystals suspended in
gelatin on a plastic backing.
 &HT;    When a camera's shutter opens, light photons stream through the
lens, fall on some of the crystals and dislodge electrons from the
halide ions. Some of the electrons glom onto nearby ions of silver,
converting them to neutral atoms. The atoms then cluster together,
forming a tiny black speck of metallic silver on each exposed
crystal. Millions of such specks form the image.
 &HT;    But to make the image visible, even to a microscope, a
photographer has to wash the film in a chemical developer (another
contribution of Daguerre's), which finishes the work the light
started.
 &HT;    ``The developer gives electrons to those crystals that want them
the most, and not to the others,'' Belloni says.
 &HT;    If a silver halide crystal already has a light-blackened cluster
containing a critical minimum of silver atoms _ four, typically _
that cluster's electric field draws electrons to the silver ions
around it, and the whole billion-ion crystal is quickly blackened.
All the other crystals, unexposed or barely exposed, the developer
leaves alone; the crystals react individually because the gelatin
isolates them from one another.
 &HT;    The result, after the undeveloped crystals are washed away, is a
black-and-white negative image: Bright areas of the subject produce
concentrations of black crystals; dark areas become transparent.
 &HT;    There are 10 billion crystals in a frame of ordinary film _ the
equivalent of 20 million digital pixels. (Even today's sharpest
digital images have only 2 million pixels.) To make a positive
print, you shine a light through the negative onto a paper covered
with the same kind of film emulsion, and then develop that.
 &HT;    Color film is more complicated. It's a stack of silver halide
emulsions, each designed to record red, green or blue. But the
first step _ light striking a silver halide crystal and creating
silver atoms _ is always the same.
 &HT;    ``The first step determines everything _ how much information
you capture,'' says Jon Kapecki, a chemist at Kodak. ``There's
nothing you can do afterward to change that. You can use the
information, or you can squander it.''
 &HT;    Most photons that strike film are squandered: The electrons they
liberate, one electron per photon, fall right back into the
``holes'' in the halide ions. Film today thus requires 10 or more
photons to make its quota of four silver atoms per crystal _ that
is, it wastes 60 percent of the light.
 &HT;    ``So when we managed to catch all the light,'' Belloni says,
``and even to double it _ that made an impression on people.''
 &HT;    Since the problem was holes gobbling up light-generated
electrons, Belloni reasoned, the solution was to dope the film with
a hole-gobbler.
 &HT;    The dopant would have to be a negatively charged ion, like a
halide, so it could substitute for a halide in the crystal lattice.
To neutralize a hole it would have to be willing to give up an
electron, but not too eager, or else it would start neutralizing
silver ions and blackening film that was still in the box. Belloni
figured that formate ions would work.
 &HT;    It was an inspired hunch. Experiments done by Rene De Keyzer, a
chemist at Agfa-Gevaert, the German-Belgian firm that helps fund
Belloni's research, showed that formate scavenges all the holes
produced by light in a silver bromide emulsion.
 &HT;    Moreover, each time a formate ion neutralizes a hole, the
reaction releases a second electron that darkens a second silver
ion. Instead of requiring 10 photons to expose a silver halide
crystal, or four, or even three _ the previous theoretical limit _
a crystal doped with formate does the job with just two. Less than
one part per million formate is enough.
 &HT;    One of the most wonderful benefits to consumers will be
high-speed films that are much less grainy. In order to catch 10
photons per crystal in poorer light, today's ASA 400 films must
have crystals four times larger _ and correspondingly less numerous
_ than those in ASA 100 film. If formate can reduce the photon
requirement to two, then ASA 400 film could have smaller crystals
and better resolution than ASA 100 does today.
 &HT;    Single-use cameras, which are loaded with ASA 800 because their
cheap lenses scatter so many photons, will improve even more
strikingly, giving millions of vacationers sharper, more easily
enlargeable memories to take home.
 &HT;    De Keyzer and his colleagues at Agfa have yet to prove that
formate-doped emulsions will have a reasonable shelf life, that
they can be manufactured on an industrial scale and that formate
will work well with all the silver halides used in photography.
 &HT;    But De Keyzer is optimistic: He predicts Agfa will have doped
films on the market within four years. And Belloni doubts formate
will be the last word in film-doping.
 &HT;    ``It's probable we could push this farther by combining formate
with something else,'' she says. ``But we've opened a door no one
had opened before.'

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York is marching to a retro beat, with a bit of flashy
glamour thrown in for good measure.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TAWFIK MOUNAYER: UP FOR THE PART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``I love clothes _ that's the bottom line,'' declared Tawfik
Mounayer while fussing around a model done up in his long purple
chiffon dress.
 &HT;    Last week, Tawfik staged his first-ever runway show, thanks to
the blood, sweat and tears of family and friends.
 &HT;    ``This show,'' he says, ``was built on favor upon favor.''
 &HT;    It was also built on beautiful clothes, a fresh, graceful
display that crossed an appealing sportswear attitude with a
healthy dose of youthful Saint Laurent reverence. Not bad for a
young man _ he's 25 _ who only graduated from the Parsons School of
Design last year.
 &HT;    But then, this is a guy who has faced tougher challenges: He
notes in passing that surgery for a benign brain tumor kept him in
school an extra year. When a visitor comments on his blase tone, he
says, ``It's all gone now.''
 &HT;    At Parsons, Mounayer had internships at Isaac Mizrahi and
Chanel, and after graduation went to work as an assistant designer
at Ann Taylor, where he learned the nuts and bolts of the fashion
business: sourcing, production, how to cut fabric and how to make a
``two-cent button look like a million bucks.''
 &HT;    Although his experience there was invaluable, he was frustrated
creatively and started designing on his own at home in the
evenings.
 &HT;    Before he knew it, he had quite a few pieces, and friends urged
him to do a show. Seven months later, models marched down the
runway wearing his spring 2001 collection, which the designer aptly
called ``Audition.''
 &HT;    Of course, it remains to be seen whether he gets the part. Right
now, Mounayer says he would love to do something small _ very
small, which he would produce himself _ for an adventurous retailer
willing to pay up front. Prices would wholesale from about $150 to
$1,000.
 &HT;    In addition to Saint Laurent, Mounayer cites Claire McCardell,
all American sportswear, and most importantly, his mother Nadia,
who passed away while he was in high school, as his inspirations.
 &HT;    ``My mother was my biggest influence,'' he says. ``I loved
rummaging through her closet as a kid, and by age 11, I was sewing
and designing full Barbie collections.'' (The closet was in
Syracuse, N.Y., where the Palestinian Mounayer was raised.)
 &HT;    He adds that his mother and aunts had a penchant for glitz:
''`Solve it with a sequin' was always my mother's mantra.
 &HT;    ``I just want to design real clothes that make women look
good,'' he continues.
 &HT;    To that end, he recently quit his job with Ann Taylor (he said
his former bosses and co-workers are very supportive) so he can
pursue his own collection full time, and he'll even wait tables if
that's what it takes to survive.
 &HT;    ``Of course I am looking for backers _ look what happened to
Miguel (Adrover). He was a big inspiration to have my show.''
 &HT;    Right now though, everything has exceeded his expectations.
 &HT;    ``I really just wanted to introduce myself,'' Mounayer explains,
``and say 'Hey, I design clothes' and get some feedback.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York's fashion cup runneth over. What was once a single week
of fashion shows has been extended to nearly two, with a huge
number of designers on the schedule. And as the action got underway
this week, there were some definite highpoints, often with a retro
attitude.
 &HT;    One hit was Russell Bennett's ``In the Now'' collection. Bennett
travelled back in time, returning with a swanky assortment of '20s-
and '40s-inspired looks. He hit Art Deco and gangster sex appeal on
the mark with graceful printed dresses and suits finished with
fedoras and gold chain necklaces.
 &HT;    Gabrielle Hamill called her show ``Cakewalk'', inspired, she
said, by memories of her grandmother's expert cake decorating for
the county fair. Guests sat at tables featuring elaborate Barbie
doll cakes and delicious cupcakes from Angelika Torn and Cupcake
Cafe.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, however, that homey mood sometimes translated to
dowdy clothes with a Fifties-homemaker feel in tweed apron dresses
paired with a pleated hem skirts and embroidered cotton dresses.
 &HT;    Shin Choi also took a stroll down memory lane for her first
show. Although known for streamlined stretch sportswear, this time
she opted for a softer, more gentle look. That meant tossing her
sleek monochromatic numbers and replacing them with herringbone
suits, butterfly sequined blouses and zig-zag patterns a la Marcia
Brady.
 &HT;    Some of the sweetness played well, but in the end, all those
stripes and florals were a little too much to handle.
 &HT;    Not all of these early birds were in a nostalgic mood. CD Greene
has always had some sizzlers in his evening collections, but now he
showed a whimsical side via dresses with Lucite puzzle pieces as
well as others done up with those predictable paillettes.
 &HT;    Greene worked his puzzles on neon-bright jersey gowns or as
cutouts edging asymmetric leather minis. But while these were
appealing, some of the other looks _ jumpsuits and illusion dresses
in particular _ needed their tart-quotient turned down to simmer.
 &HT;    Donna Haag opted for a ``Tropical Chic'' theme, and whisked her
audience away to a South Pacific paradise. Underneath a ceiling of
tropical fronds, guests enjoyed fresh mango juice and coconut,
while Haag's colorful floral dresses breezed by.
 &HT;    The orchid and bird of paradise-print dresses looked fresh and
fun, as did the rhinestone-speckled skirts and tops. But the knits
hit way under par, right alongside the floral scuba looks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ESCADA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Although Escada is well known in the U.S., the German company
has never had a formal runway presentation during New York fashion
week.
 &HT;    The show on Sept. 13, held in conjunction with the G&AMP;P
Foundation, a charitable organization for cancer, was a first for
the company.
 &HT;    ``Escada has been a very loyal patron to the G&AMP;P,'' said its
founder Denise Rich. ``We have a good partnership. They believe in
our cause.''
 &HT;    One of the evening's objectives, which included a dinner after
the show, was to focus attention on G&AMP;P's annual charity event, the
Angel Ball, scheduled for Nov. 30.
 &HT;    The front row sported a motley crew, including Ivana Trump,
Raquel Welch, Jane Seymour, Christian Campbell of ``Trick,'' Adam
Goldberg from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Eddie Cibrian from ``Third
Watch,'' Janine Turner and S. Epatha Merkerson of ``Law and
Order.''
 &HT;    Goldie Hawn showed up during dinner.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' Welch said, ``this is the first show I've been to
since the '60s, when I was first discovered and flown over to Paris
for the Saint Laurent show.''
 &HT;    This time out she was decked in pinstriped Escada.
 &HT;    ``I like Escada because it's tailored,'' she said. ``This is not
going to be the Britney Spears kind of show. I liked what she wore
to MTV, which is great if you're performing on stage. But it's not
for me. I never really wore see-through things before. Did I? Well,
maybe I did.''
 &HT;    On the runway, Escada didn't show sheer, but there were lots of
racy little sequined pieces to supply the sizzle factor which was
sometimes tempered with crisp white shirts tied at the waist.
 &HT;    While sparkly bras and bikinis have limited real-life range,
that tailoring that Raquel loves is another story. There was plenty
of that, too, in a diverse lineup of suits and jackets, with an
emphasis on leather and shantung.
 &HT;    For evening, sparkle ruled again, in sexy, elaborately encrusted
evening gowns. But those with a truly dramatic bent might go for
the over-the-top gold matador suit or red tiered lace ``Carmen''
gown. Ole!
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GEN ART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What do Jennifer Love Hewitt, cell phones, Polly Allen Mellen
and a 1970s Halston model-turned-cyber entrepreneur have in common?
 &HT;    Quite possibly nothing, but that didn't hurt the vibe at the
sixth annual Gen Art Fresh Faces in Fashion Show, held Wednesday
night at the Metropolitan Pavilion. The venue accommodated a
capacity crowd, in which Christina Aguilera look-alikes easily
outnumbered Britney Spears types.
 &HT;    The show was sponsored by Nokia and Ford Motor Co., as well as
IPnetworks.com, a Web enterprise that has taken upon itself the
heady task of ``bringing licensing to cyberspace.''
 &HT;    Chris Royer, the director of fashion for the year-old
IPnetworks.com, was a Halston model during the designer's heyday.
Despite her mentor's licensing nightmares, Royer still believes
that upstart designers can benefit from the type of exposure
cyberspace licensing can provide.
 &HT;    ``Young designers especially need to know the empowering side of
licensing,'' Royer said. ``If it's developed in the correct way it
can give them global exposure.''
 &HT;    After a brief delay, the evening got started as Gen Art
executive director Ian Gerard ceded the stage to Jennifer Love
Hewitt, clad in Diane Von Furstenberg, at which time the actress
presented a $2,500 award for best cell-phone accessory.
 &HT;    The winner, a succinct Kenny Hwang, said: ``This just proves you
have to have a good time doing what you're doing.''
 &HT;    Love then relinquished the stage to designer Michael Kors, who
made a tender speech in honor of Polly Allen Mellen, which
highlighted her commitment to unearthing emerging fashion talent by
any means necessary. He then presented her with a 60-page,
hand-illustrated story book designed by Ruben Toledo.
 &HT;    Mellen made a rousing speech, asserting that ``using the same
designers over and over again is a cop-out,'' and then revealed her
scintillating head-to-toe Kors outfit to a clamor of applause.
 &HT;    Then the show began, each designer or design team prefacing
their runway offering with an extreme close-up, MTV-style video
resume. Memorable lines included: ``By accident of life I started
doing nothing,'' ``I was born in France some time ago,'' ``I want a
bite of the big American pie,'' and ``My clothes are not
necessarily meant for mass production.''
 &HT;    As for the clothes, of the 12 designers, Alicia Bell was the
standout. Bell's fitted corset blouses with lace trims, skirts with
pleated godets and lots of zigzag and fishtail hems with pleats had
a romantic turn-of-the-century appeal. Other noteworthy designers
included Maia Madariaga with her soft, buttery leather looks in
strong colors as well as pieces adorned with silver chain trim to
create fringe-like effects.
 &HT;    There was also quirky knitwear from French native, Pierrot,
whose collection revolved around the kitsch factor of French
nationalism. The design duo known as Trosman-Churba presented its
``fun-tional artwear,'' which translated to such looks as a fitted
denim jacket with a gold foil leaf print.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LORO PIANA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Everyone knows Loro Piana has luscious cashmeres. But at the
informal presentation of the spring collection, the company showed
its design range _ and it goes way beyond the precious fiber for
which it's famous.
 &HT;    Luxury was a top priority, delivered in silk, leather and linen
as well as cashmere, of course. Fun little bomber jackets,
HotPants, suits with ruffled blouses and a provocative wrap halter
proved that sexy and tasteful can co-exist.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIBERTY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Making a push for a stronger U.S. business, London-based Liberty
decided to take its show on the road with a presentation in New
York hosted by Thomas Harris, the British Consul General, and his
wife.
 &HT;    Designers Claire Corrigan and Corinne Barker showed 20 pieces in
an informal showing at Boylan Studios, and not surprisingly,
fabrics were the big draw. Those traditional Liberty florals showed
up in a teeny bikini and a classic topper, updated with a slick
nylon coating.
 &HT;    The duo also dug into the archives and revived an Art Nouveau
fan pattern for full pants and little shells. But they didn't just
rely on the past. For example, a brand new psychedelic floral
turned up on a gown, complete with train and matching scarf. While
the pattern play was dizzying at times, for Liberty fans, it's all
in good fun.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ALMOST PARADISE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Where were you in '73?
 &HT;    If you were sitting in your bedroom listening to The Who, Joni
or Yes, you can definitely relate to William Miller, the hero of
Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film, ``Almost
Famous,'' about his experience as a teen-age journalist for Rolling
Stone.
 &HT;    At the recent premiere at the Chelsea West Cinema in Manhattan,
sponsored by the now-venerable music magazine, celebrities of all
ages _ including John Leguizamo, Donovan Leitch, Bebe Neuwirth,
Mariska Hargitay and Fisher Stevens _ heartily applauded the film.
 &HT;    The clapping was certainly music to the ears of Dreamworks
co-head Jeffrey Katzenberg, director Crowe and the performers in
attendance: Billy Crudup (who arrived with gal pal Mary Louise
Parker), Frances McDormand (can you say Oscar nomination?), Philip
Seymour Hoffman (magnificent as always as renegade rock critic
Lester Bangs), Oscar winner Anna Paquin and Patrick Fugit, who
plays Miller.
 &HT;    Especially radiant was leading lady Kate Hudson, who sat next to
her very famous mom, Goldie Hawn. The young actress, who looks like
the love child of Hawn and Drew Barrymore, is a star in the making.
 &HT;    However, one performer _ albeit in a cameo performance as a
taxicab passenger _ was noticeably absent: Rolling Stone founder
Jann Wenner.
 &HT;    After the screening, designer (and noted rock-and-roll fan)
Tommy Hilfiger _ nattily attired in a window-pane suit _ pronounced
the film ``entertaining and engaging.''
 &HT;    ``Third Watch'' hunk Eddie Cibrian was also full of praise. ``I
really liked it even though I was born in 1973,'' he remarked.
 &HT;    Also giving the film high marks at the post-screening party at
Centro-Fly, which was renamed for the evening (but not redecorated)
in honor of the legendary Max's Kansas City, were a gray-bearded
Tim Robbins, who came with stepdaughter Eva Amurri (the spitting
image of mom Susan Sarandon) and Ethan Hawke (minus Uma), who
decided to make a bowling shirt his fashion statement.
 &HT;    Along with film, theater was on the mind of some of the guests:
A decidedly scruffy Kevin Bacon (maybe he was just trying to look
like a rock star?) came with wife Kyra Sedgwick, who is working
``hard, hard, hard'' on ``Stranger,'' a new play that begins
previews later this month at Off-Broadway's Vineyard Theatre.
 &HT;    ``Cabaret's'' new leading lady, former sitcom star Lea Thompson,
was still riding the high of a thunderous ovation at the ``Broadway
on Broadway'' concert in Times Square. ``I was so scared, and I am
so glad it went well. It's such a great part.''
 &HT;    And the ageless Michele Lee, preparing for her return to
Broadway in Charles Busch's hilarious ``The Tale of the Allergist's
Wife,'' confided the show is even better than it was during its
sold-out run earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Oscars are still many months away, but the fierce battle to
bejewel next year's nominees is already heating up.
 &HT;    In an unprecedented bid to encourage actresses to wear its
baubles at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony, the Italian jeweler
Bulgari will allow a select number of nominees and presenters to
design their own necklaces.
 &HT;    No word yet on how much leeway the ladies will have with their
designs _ or whether they'll be allowed to keep them _ but the
company is likely to have some fairly stylish necks to adorn. Last
year, its jewels turned up on the likes of Winona Ryder, Chloe
Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PRADA NEWS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is red the new color at Prada?
 &HT;    Sources say the Italian fashion house is scouting locations for
a party during Paris fashion week to celebrate its new Miu Miu
boutique _ and one of the spots they're considering is none other
than the Communist Party headquarters in the 10th arrondissement, a
futuristic-in-a-'70s-way cement structure by architect Oscar
Niemeyer.
 &HT;    It would be a fitting choice, given that Miuccia Prada was once
an ardent left-winger.
 &HT;    Although Prada declined to confirm that location, a spokeswoman
assured it would choose a venue based on its architecture, not its
politics.

 By JESSICA KERWIN 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Running along one side of a dusty, dead-end street
deep in the Valley, there it is: the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
 &HT;    Not really. The striped awning is a prop that's been left
hanging outside the soundstage where Aaron Spelling's ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' was once filmed and which now accommodates his new
production, ``Titans.''
 &HT;    Inside, a couple of neon letters from the old ``Peach Pit'' sign
still cling to the wall, but in the center of the dimly lit expanse
sits a brand new, big, fake Beverly Hills mansion. Its study is
wood-paneled; the living room is prim and chilly and a
double-barreled staircase could accommodate a grand entrance or a
dramatic spill.
 &HT;    It's perfectly Spelling, and though he'd bristle at the thought,
a bit reminiscent of his '80s hit, ``Dynasty.''
 &HT;    But if the ``Titans'' set brings the good old days to mind,
Spelling promises that its fashion won't allude to Nolan Miller's
famously strong-shouldered moment, even though Miller has designed
a wedding dress for the first show.
 &HT;    ``Nolan tells me that they're showing broad-shouldered suits for
women in Paris,'' says Spelling, whose voice on the phone is grave
and has a sassy Hollywood twang. ``But we don't want to be
associated with `Dynasty,' so we won't be showing any. I guarantee,
not one shoulder pad.''
 &HT;    To that end Spelling brought in another former collaborator,
Cathyrn Wagner, who put together the show's jet-setting wardrobe.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner behind the stately stage, her studio is
bursting with enough campy, vampy and stunning clothes to herald
the dawning of a new era. The get-ups Yasmine Bleeth will don as
Heather Lane during the show's debut season, which kicks off on NBC
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 4, take high-style hysterics to the brink.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bleeth's foil, Gwen Williams, played by Victorial
Principal, aims for something a little more chic, swathed in
Giorgio Armani, Ferragamo, Anne Klein and Richard Tyler.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Spelling likes clothing. He likes women and he loves women
dressed up,'' says Wagner, who served previously as the costume
stylist on ''90210.'' ``Sometimes, he'll call and say `What's with
all the leopard, Sweetheart?' But he's fair.''
 &HT;    Just as Wagner won't emulate the ``Dynasty'' look, the clothes
won't say ''90210,'' either. As Wagner likes to put it, she's moved
her shopping off of Melrose Avenue and onto Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    ``Yasmine's character, Heather, is basically a shop girl who
married way up,'' Wagner says, flipping through Bleeth's bright
rack. ``Now she wants everybody in the universe to see just how
wealthy she is and how well she's done.''
 &HT;    There's the crystal studded Versace top, the new Christian Dior
saddle bag, full-length Pucci gown from episode four, the sequined
logo-print pants by Bottega Veneta, pieces from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
Diane Von Furstenberg, a handful of rhinestone belts and vintage
Yves Saint Laurent, all in the gold, red, turquoise and fuchsia
that are the character's hallmark.
 &HT;    The ultimate piece, however, is a tiny mink bikini which is worn
on the show with loads of jewelry and sky-high heels.
 &HT;    ``When we put it together it gets a little tarty,'' Wagner says.
``Heather is very `Valley of the Dolls.' That's how we refer to her
_ but that's the most complimentary name.''
 &HT;    Heather's look is sexy, to be sure. ``Men who don't watch serial
television will be watching,'' says Spelling, who is an executive
producer of the show. ``We couldn't find smaller bathing suits.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect Bleeth to be shown hanging out of said bikini.
``I hate it when you see that,'' he continues. ``Call me square,
but they won't be dressed like sluts.''
 &HT;    Fashion victim might be the more accurate term. ``When we first
spoke, Yasmine said she wanted her character to look like the cover
of Vogue every week,'' Wagner recalls. ``I said `If you do that,
you realize that every once in a while there has to be a zinger _
something that just doesn't work.' And she said `I know, I know!
That's exactly what I want.'''
 &HT;    For the boardroom, it's Emporio Armani's fuchsia jacket and a
pair of white pants, or Tehen's curvy red suit, a Spelling
favorite.
 &HT;    ''`Titans' is about fashion and passion,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, he's so passionate about fashion that he preapproves
every costume.
 &HT;    ``I'm a nut about it. You're going to laugh, but before we film
I look over a book of Polaroids showing three different ideas for
each change.''
 &HT;    After all, Bleeth's Heather is the head of Dress2K.com, a
fashion Web site of her very own. In episode three, she even hosts
a runway show, featuring clothes that come courtesy of Nolan
Miller, whose assistant Mark Zanino designed the lot. Miller also
personally designed a wedding dress for Bleeth's character.
 &HT;    For her own part, however, Wagner sticks to shopping. It's what
she does best.
 &HT;    ``There is a lot of great stuff out there. Why design
something?'' she says.
 &HT;    Though she can't discuss her budget, Wagner has been shopping
almost every day since July to supply the 70 or so costume changes
that occur in every episode.
 &HT;    ``At this point, in the shops I sound like a kid collecting
baseball cards: got it, got it, don't got it, don't want it,''
Wagner says, laughing. ``Sometimes Yasmine could have as many as
seven costume changes,'' she adds. ``Of course, one might be naked
under the covers, so it's usually five or six.''
 &HT;    But life could get a whole lot easier for Wagner once the
fashion world tunes in. Bottega Veneta's reps have already sent in
some clothes; ABS lets Wagner pull right from the racks in the
factory downtown and Wagner has struck up a relationship with
Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.
 &HT;    ``On `90210,' people would give us stuff and I would usually
give them a photo from the show,'' she says. ``I mean a photo of
Yasmine Bleeth wearing your bikini sitting on the table during
market week is going to sell that suit fifty times over.''
 &HT;    Wagner was part of the Armani team who launched A(AT)X on the
West Coast, and she worked at Ralph Lauren as a buyer and for Donna
Karan merchandising, before making the switch to costuming.
 &HT;    In college, however, she majored in acting and had performed in
plays during her high school years in Los Angeles alongside Val
Kilmer and Kevin Spacey, who was also her prom date.
 &HT;    ``This is sort of a synthesis of fashion and theater,'' she
says. ``Clothing can transform an actor into a character.''
 &HT;    Big name designers became interested in gaining screen time for
their wares after ``Sex and the City'' began offering prime-time
placement.
 &HT;    Though Wagner wants to work with designers, she won't risk
sending out anything that might upstage her actors _ like the
glitzy $900 handbags she finds distracting on that show.
 &HT;    ``If the clothing is too exorbitant or too silly, it detracts,''
she says. ``It should be appropriate to the scene and then turned
up a notch. It should be just a little bit better than reality
is.''
 &HT;    And that, of course, is what Spelling is all about.
 &HT;    ``Wait until you see it,'' he concludes. ``You're gonna
scream.''

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON _ The fashion industry is at it again in the nation's
capital and this time it's Tommy Hilfiger who's helping to make
history.
 &HT;    Hilfiger has agreed to contribute at least $5 million over the
next three years toward the building of a Martin Luther King Jr.
memorial here. His company is the first corporate sponsor to back
the project and at a recent ceremony unveiling the memorial's
design, he and Hilfiger CEO Joel Horowitz weren't short of reasons
why they were eager to participate.
 &HT;    Hilfiger called the slain civil rights leader ``an individual
who had an immeasurable impact on all our lives.'' He said that
through the donation and commitment, he hoped to help raise more
money for the project ``to educate Americans and people around the
world about the life and work of Martin Luther King.''
 &HT;    King's ideals of working for equality through non-violent
protest has contributed to Hilfiger's influences.
 &HT;    ``As a fashion designer, I've always been inspired by America,
by our history, diversity, by youthful and pioneering spirits, our
energy, our ability to be a place of hope and opportunity.''
 &HT;    Horowitz told the audience of about 200 people, including King's
widow, Coretta Scott King, and the Rev. Andrew Young, about how his
parents attended the Aug. 28, 1963, March on Washington where King
delivered his seminal ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
 &HT;    Horowitz's parents were active in the civil rights struggles in
their Lakeview, Long Island, N.Y., town where some white residents
the year before protested desegregation of schools.
 &HT;    ``Many people began to put their homes up for sale. But not my
parents,'' Horowitz said. ``They, along with other white families,
posted signs in front of their homes clearly stating `This house is
not for sale.
 &HT;    ``I can still picture my father today on the front lawn
hammering the sign into the ground.''
 &HT;    Fashion companies are becoming familiar in Washington. Ralph
Lauren donated $13 million to the Smithsonian Institution to
restore Old Glory _ the 187-year-old flag flown over Fort McHenry
in Baltimore, Md., during a battle with the British that inspired
Francis Scott Key to write the poem that became the national
anthem.
 &HT;    A $2.5 million donation by Target Corp. and an additional $4
million in fund-raising efforts helped pay for the $10 million
facelift of the Washington Monument, which reopened this year.
 &HT;    Planning for the King memorial began in 1983. The project went
into high gear two years ago when Congress approved a site on the
National Mall along the Tidal Basin, half way between the Jefferson
Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial where King gave the ``I Have a
Dream'' speech.
 &HT;    An international panel of jurors picked a design for the
memorial submitted by a San Francisco architectural firm. The
winning design by ROMA Design Group was selected from among 900
entrants and will include a rising berm with cascading falls and a
path along which other participants in the civil rights movement
will be commemorated. In the center will be King's profile facing
the Jefferson Memorial.
 &HT;    The designers said they wanted the memorial to embody King's
ideals. In doing so, it makes references to some of his speeches,
such as the ``Mountain of Despair'' and the ``Stone of Hope,'' said
Boris Dramov, a leader of the ROMA design team.
 &HT;    ``We used rough stones to create the entrance and smooth stones
toward the edge of the Tidal Basin to reflect the power of the
movement,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``It is not intended to be about death,'' said Dramov. ``It is
about life and the pursuit of possible human achievement.''
 &HT;    Toward that end, his co-designer and landscape architect Bonnie
Fisher noted that the historic cherry trees encircling the Tidal
Basin, which will serve as a backdrop to the King memorial,
``happen to bloom at the moment of Martin Luther King's death.'' He
was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis.
 &HT;    Coretta Scott King called the memorial ``a uniquely beautiful
and meaningful design'' she hopes won't be altered as the project
is vetted through various panels overseeing the National Mall.
Memorial organizers say they can't estimate yet how much the
project will cost.
 &HT;    In the audience was at least one other fashion figure who said
he's ready to write a check. Designer and record producer Russell
Simmons said the King memorial was the second event he attended
that day. The other was a breakfast with President Clinton
regarding his presidential library.
 &HT;    ``I guess I will be supporting both,'' Simmons said of the
projects.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Imitation of Christ's fall show was a remarkable fashion moment
_ quite beautiful but with a funeral theme _ while, elsewhere, Tom
Ford unveiled his lush, racy and much-awaited new campaign for
YSL's Opium.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMITATION OF CHRIST
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drop-dead gorgeous. With the mandatory silly pun duly recorded,
it can be said that the Imitation of Christ collection shown on
Sept. 17 by Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave was that, and a whole lot
more.
 &HT;    The presentation passed from merely creepy _ a fashion show
impersonating a wake _ to genuinely bizarre, in that a real funeral
parlor, the Peter Jarema Funeral Home on East Seventh Street,
allowed the faux mourning on its premises.
 &HT;    Reactions ranged from fashionably blase to uncomfortable to
offended, while Subkoff's mom Cheryl wrote the schtick off to
showbiz: ``There was a lot of drama and flair. But what else would
you expect? Tara is a movie actress!''
 &HT;    One young woman who works with the design team projected piety
onto the venue selection: ``Tara's uncle passed away recently, and
she felt this was the right setting now.''
 &HT;    Someone else noted that Subkoff cleared the idea with her aunt,
a Catholic nun. But backstage, Subkoff refused to get personal:
``Let's just say no comment. Well, there's someone in my family who
is very involved in the Catholic church. I wouldn't do anything to
hurt her. I don't want to say anything else about her. It's
tacky.''
 &HT;    Fine with us, because the show offered plenty to ruminate on
without involving religious relatives. Questions such as, What
makes a designer? How does one quantify the value of a celebrity
connection? Is the very notion of anti-fashion a myth?
 &HT;    In one whirlwind season, Subkoff and Damhave have proclaimed
their disdain for the fashion system, billing themselves as purists
in a cauldron of mercenary scum. At the same time, they have
operated like a pair of crafty vets.
 &HT;    Initially they flaunted their famous friend, Chloe Sevigny, at
every photo op, and, for this show, embraced her as an artistic
collaborator.
 &HT;    Listed as ``creative director'' on their program, Sevigny worked
tirelessly backstage, dressing models, barking orders, demanding
that ``anyone not part of the production get off the scrim!''
 &HT;    She then came out _ just in time for the wailing to begin _
taking her front-row seat beside Natasha Lyonne. After the show,
Chloe said she's ``feeling for the men's stuff _ and I'm going to
wear it.'' She then went on to explain the essence of the clothes:
``I had seen the stuff already, so I know that a huge amount of
work went into it. But what I want to know is whether the audience
will get that.''
 &HT;    Which again goes back to the issue of what makes a designer. The
premise behind IOC is ``fashion resurrected'' _ rethought,
reworked, recycled. The clothes Subkoff and Damhave showed
indicated all of the above, to varying degrees.
 &HT;    Some pieces were heavily amended; others looked barely touched.
Some dripped with chic. Others dripped with fake blood and gory
pathos; bandages wrapped one young man's wrists, as if after a
suicide attempt.
 &HT;    Despite such indulgences, what was very clear was that someone
here has fabulous taste, a discerning eye, a savvy feel for what
looks chic. And yes, with all of the one-of-a-kind surprises, one
could extract themes, most notably a military motif, and black _ of
course _ for a bounty of dresses from '40s-ish lace to haute
construction run amok. Is it all any less valid than the work of
designers who routinely send out near-verbatim retro looks?
 &HT;    Apparently, the stores think not. The presentation ended with a
handsome young man dressed as a priest advising mourners that the
wake was now over. Afterwards, Beth Sheperd and Sarah Hailes of
Kirna Zabete rushed backstage.
 &HT;    ``The show was deeply disturbing,'' said Shepard. ``But the
clothes were amazing.''
 &HT;    And although nothing has been signed, if the gods of fashion are
smiling on Barneys New York, that store could be imitating Christ _
with the entire collection on the floor.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OPIUM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Opium, whose rich scent and provocative name has always had a
taste for the forbidden, is living up to its reputation.
 &HT;    Its first international ad campaign under Tom Ford, Yves Saint
Laurent's creative director features a nude photograph of Sophie
Dahl clutching her breast with her eyes closed. Actually the only
things she's wearing are a jeweled bracelet, necklace and
high-heeled sandals. The ad was photographed by Steven Meisel.
 &HT;    The Opium campaign, which is Ford's first for YSL, is intended
to breathe new life into what is the company's best-selling
fragrance. The new ads also represent the most dramatic step Ford
and Chantal Roos, president of YSL Beaute, have taken in
revitalizing YSL Beaute's franchise.
 &HT;    Describing the campaign as ``sexy and provocative,'' Ford said
the image of Dahl in an erotic repose ``relates to the history of
the house,'' and the personality of the fragrance itself.
 &HT;    ``Opium, for me, is something that's forbidden, something that's
rich,'' he said. ``I just didn't want a skinny, starved, girl
model.''
 &HT;    Enter the voluptuous, womanly, uninhibited Dahl.
 &HT;    ``I wanted someone who looks like she's had too much of
everything: too much food, too much sex, too much love,'' he said.
``I mean, this is a woman who doesn't deny herself anything.''
 &HT;    To underline the richness and decadence of the fragrance, Ford
had Dahl's hair dyed a deep red and had her recline on a blanket of
dark fur.
 &HT;    ``And even though she's nude, I wanted her to appear as though
she's dressed, so she's wearing high-heeled shoes and yellow
jewels,'' he said.
 &HT;    Ford acknowledged that the image is bound to evoke strong
reactions, but he reasoned that ``a fragrance is supposed to be
sexy'' since it's worn on the skin, applied when one is in a state
of undress and fully appreciated in close, intimate situations.
 &HT;    Of course, given the enormous curiosity of how Ford will
reinterpret the legendary YSL style, one might be prone to
extrapolate from this image that it will be represent Ford's
direction for the French brand. Not so, said Ford.
 &HT;    ``It's not indicative at all of the collection I'll be showing
in three weeks because obviously she's not wearing any clothes,''
he said. ``It's one of the first things I did creatively and there
are certain aspects of it that are indicative of what we'll see in
the future,'' in terms of the attitude and expression of the brand.
 &HT;    As for his next act, Ford said he plans to shoot spring-summer
2001 campaigns for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent after the
international runway season ends in mid-October. After that, he'll
turn his attention to the stable of other YSL fragrances and the
French fragrance and jewelry house Boucheron, which Gucci Group
bought last May.
 &HT;    Ford said he's been an admirer of Meisel's work for years and,
``I've been waiting for the perfect moment to work with him. I was
so impressed with Steven and his entire team. They were so
completely open to ideas.''
 &HT;    ``Opium was definitely a priority at YSL Beaute,'' said Roos,
who launched the brand in 1977 during her first tenure at YSL.
Opium went on to become the bellwether of the Eighties blockbuster
scents, and a scandal in its own right with its druggy name and its
ad campaigns featuring an insensate Jerry Hall.
 &HT;    ``We consider it as a main pillar of the brand,'' said Roos.
``We could address it very quickly [with a revamp], whereas
developing new lines takes a period of time. Tom and I decided that
the most important thing was to address the revamping of the Opium
campaign.''
 &HT;    The print ad campaign breaks in the October Vogue and will run
worldwide in November in women's magazines. Beginning in December,
ads featuring Dahl will also run in European cinemas.
 &HT;    ``There will be a huge concentration on Opium through media and
such things as window displays featuring the ad,'' said Roos. The
company declined to reveal its fall budget.
 &HT;    Since Opium's inception in 1977, the fragrance has embraced
fantasy and has lived on the daring side. Earlier this year, Opium
was banned in China because the Chinese government business bureau
decided its name was ``improper.''
 &HT;    For the new ad campaign, Meisel went to Los Angeles and shot
Dahl in the manner of a modern icon. Pat McGrath did the makeup and
Orlando Pita styled the hair.
 &HT;    The ad is intended to be a portrait of luxury and lust with
Dahl's pearly white body and red hair against a background of fur
and black leather. The fragrance bottle is conspicuous in its
absence. A YSL spokesman said the company has encountered no
problems in running the nude image in the magazines it has
contracted with for fall.
 &HT;    Curiosity about what Ford will do with the legendary brand is
running extremely high in Paris. Shoppers got a small glimpse last
month when YSL boutiques and trendy store Colette received a
shipment of new fall bags, the first designed by Ford's team.
 &HT;    Colette reported brisk sales of the two styles it's carrying: a
leather tote with trapunto stitching in a ``Y'' formation and a
shoulder bag with a chain link strap.
 &HT;    Tongues have also been wagging about the YSL shop on the
Faubourg Saint-Honore in Paris, which was closed in August for
minor renovations and sprucing up. It's not a new retail concept,
Saint Laurent officials say, but industry types have been
commenting that the shop is already feeling a lot hipper, the sales
staff all dressed sleekly in black.
 &HT;    A small pre-spring collection designed by Ford won't be
delivered to stores until November, meaning the fashion pack will
have to wait until Oct. 13 to see his interpretation of YSL. That's
when he'll show his spring collection at the Musee Rodin on the
last day of Paris fashion week.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WILLIAM REID
 &HT;    
 &HT;    He's best known for his men's wear. But William Reid's
collaboration with Tony Smith, formerly of The Smiths, who served
as creative director on Reid's first women's collection, will
certainly help put that line on the map. Charm school finesse
surfaced in the form of sweet eyelet and lace skirts shown with
polished jersey blouses.
 &HT;    And, although the overall feeling was clearly feminine, there
were touches of men's wear tailoring in such looks as a great gray
wool skirt and cool pleated pants. The fresh details included
twisted straps on a striped tank dress, a tulle overlay on a
gingham dress and suede insets on a denim jacket.
 &HT;    Reid's solid presentation wasn't the only cause for celebration,
however _ there was also the fact that it was shown at his new,
bigger space on West 28th St.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DANA BUCHMAN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Classic sportswear _ that's what brings the Buchman customer
back season after season. But for spring 2001, the designer
ventured beyond her basic fare to reveal a sassy side.
 &HT;    For starters, she's doing lots of leather in a range of fruity
colors. Then she added hip tank tops paired with narrow skirts and
even a pair of red-hot metallic pants. A sexy one-shouldered dress
in a tropical print had Palm Beach written all over it.
 &HT;    Buchman's more conservative clients, however, shouldn't despair.
Forties-style glen plaid pantsuits a la Marlene Dietrich and
jackets with large-scale houndstooth patterns should fill the bill.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MARC ECKO
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ecko wants to play with the big boys, and, because his Ecko
Unlimited collection has grown into a multimillion-dollar business
in the six years since it was started, he has the means to do so.
 &HT;    This season, for his Ecko Red women's collection, he showed just
18 looks, all sexy and streamlined _ a dramatic and positive change
from last season's overly deconstructed pieces of ``art.''
 &HT;    What worked best were the circle-print halter, the stenciled
looks and the flag kimono, part of a group that depicted political
figures _ a hot topic in this election year. The single-sleeve
treatments, layered box-pleated skirts and culottes a la Girbaud,
however, should have been left behind.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SOLD
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Sometimes it's not such a bad thing to forgo the runway. At
Sold, Jenisa Washington opted to pass on a formal presentation,
showing her hip safari and ladylike looks on 20 mannequins. And the
results were just right.
 &HT;    There were plenty of her beautiful signature leathers, including
a jungle-ready goat suede wrap dress and a classy shift with a
leather bouquet, all in soft blush, straw and chocolate tones.
Washington also cut some mean wovens _ a frayed-edged safari
jacket, little denim shorts and cuffed culottes. For a
four-season-old business, she's off to a great start _ she's
already selling to Barneys New York, Ultimo and Fred Segal.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MOET &AMP; CHANDON
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Showcasing up-and-coming design talents has been a pet project
for Moet &AMP; Chandon for four seasons now. And at Sunday's show, the
lineup featured three of downtown's favorite ``It'' girls: Sally
Penn, Alice Roi and Lizzy Disney. For Penn, who has become one to
watch, persistence has paid off.
 &HT;    In a collection that was more sophisticated and polished than
usual, she managed to mix comfort and cool. Highlights included the
open-back voile tops and tennis skirts, a Swiss dot pintuck dress
and wide-leg pants. The ``thong'' skirts, which provided a
visible-panty-line effect, were imaginative, but not what you'd
call flattering.
 &HT;    Roi, who likes to reinvent the '80s in a wearable but campy way,
went for the ``Dynasty''/Giorgio Beverly Hills scene this time _
with a naughty edge. She did lots of miniskirts, while some of her
best looks were the appliqued velour pieces, the strapless
minidress and the tuxedo bib dress.
 &HT;    The designer should stay away from those hard-to-fit swimwear
shapes, however. Bikinis bulged in an unsightly way, and the
handkerchief hems were a tad too short.
 &HT;    Disney, the last to show, did a disappointing collection. The
dropped-back satin top and dress worked well, and some of the pants
had intriguing cuff details, but she lost her way with the
``falling down'' pieces, styled to fall off the body, and the
detached, open-back, cape-like sleeves, which simply looked
awkward.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    FASHION SCOOPS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Circular Thinking: Some celebrities just can't get over how nice
the fashion business is. To them, anyway.
 &HT;    ``It used to be about fashion and actresses, but now maybe it's
fashion and books,'' said writer Candace Bushnell as she arrived at
the DKNY store on Madison Avenue on Thursday night to launch the
store's Literary Series with her bestseller, ''4 Blondes.'' She was
impressed that the shop had provided her a red leather miniskirt,
sweater and matching patent leather boots for the event.
 &HT;    ``I actually wanted to wear this hat that I found that is so
Petula Clark with these boots,'' she said, then took a detour on
that train of thought and commented that the boots, because of
their loose fit, were actually ``very Christopher Robin. I'm
feeling very Pooh right now.''
 &HT;    So what does Christopher Robin have to do with Petula Clark?
 &HT;    ``They're both English, I guess,'' she continued, grabbing a
Piper mini from a waiter and changing course once more. ``I never
drank champagne from a straw before. Does that make you drunk
faster? I'm always afraid they've dropped a shot of whiskey in
these anyway.''
 &HT;    Going back to the original subject at hand, Bushnell mused at
the DKNY-clad turnout for her book signing, which included actress
Kim Cattrall from the Bushnell-inspired ``Sex and the City'' show
as well as the three current members of Destiny's Child _ Kelly,
Beyonce and Michelle.
 &HT;    ``Whoever said fashion was shallow?'' Bushnell asked. ``It's
changing. It reads!''
 &HT;    The singers were certainly impressed as well. The trio plan to
take a day off from their concert tour to attend several runway
shows, including DKNY's.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe they're putting us in the front row,'' said
Beyonce.
 &HT;    ...And then...Perhaps they weren't so naive after all. Destiny's
Child wore gold paillette dresses, sweaters and sparkly pants to
the DKNY party, all company-provided, naturally.
 &HT;    ``We dress alike because we are a group,'' Beyonce said. ``I
feel it's important that when people see us in a room that it's
obvious we're a group, like the Supremes or En Vogue.''
 &HT;    But Beyonce made a quick change into some simple sportswear on
her way downtown to Visionaire's seasonal fest, this time
celebrating punk with an exhibit at the publication's Mercer Street
gallery of the Seventies work of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm
McLaren.
 &HT;    Also on hand were artist Tom Sachs and Belgium men's wear
designer Dirk Schonberger, who was amused at the idea that a party
celebrating the punk movement would draw musicians of such a
breadth of style as Destiny's Child and Bjork.
 &HT;    ``What is it with Americans always having parties to celebrate
things that already happened?'' he asked.
 &HT;    Well then, a toast to things in the future _ the designer,
picked up by stores like Jeffrey and Barneys New York, disclosed
that he'll give women's wear a shot next year.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Beach Bound: Shoshanna Lonstein is launching a new swimwear
line. The social celebrity turned designer, whose two-year-old
dress business has been a hit at retail, said she will introduce
the line of bikinis in January at Bloomingdale's.
 &HT;    ``Since my early adolescence, I have been unable to find a
bikini that fits me properly,'' Lonstein said. ``I hope that my
swim collection fills the void in the market that has made going to
the beach such a challenge for so many.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Question and Answer: Indie actresses Summer Phoenix and Natasha
Lyonne turned out for Moet &AMP; Chandon's Designer Debut to support
their friend Lizzy Disney, one of three participating designers.
They were somewhat annoyed, however, at the phalanx of
photographers that greeted them.
 &HT;    While sitting in the front row, Lyonne lit up a cigarette, and
later offered one to Phoenix, who was somewhat less recognizable in
the crowd. One photographer, in fact, asked her, ``Are you
Summer?''
 &HT;    ``Yes, I am someone,'' she replied.
 &HT;    She answered the same perfunctory questions, over and over _
``Lizzy is a close friend I met a long time ago _ I like her
clothes because they are sexy and casual.''
 &HT;    Her next film is ``Esther Kahn,'' her first starring role,
playing a young Jewish girl in late 19th-century London who aspires
to be an actress; she's now working on some independent projects.
 &HT;    When Lauren Ezersky of ``Behind the Velvet Rope'' came over,
thrusting her mike into Lyonne's face, Phoenix turned to her
neighbor and proved her acting ability. ``Can I ask you a
question?'' she repeated in Ezersky's Queens-meets-Valley Girl
accent, somehow stretching out her nose and crossing her eyes for
added effect.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Pamela's New Bag: See what a little extra backing can do? At
today's show, Pamela Dennis, now owned by Pegasus Apparel Group,
will unveil the first few pieces of what will become a full-fledged
evening bag collection.
 &HT;    Dennis focuses on delicate barrel, square and frame shapes
crafted in silk satin, lizard and crocodile in classic shades of
black, gunmetal and silver. The complete line will debut during the
November accessories market and hit stores in the spring at prices
ranging from $650 to $1,000.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York is marching to a retro beat, with a bit of flashy
glamour thrown in for good measure.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TAWFIK MOUNAYER: UP FOR THE PART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``I love clothes _ that's the bottom line,'' declared Tawfik
Mounayer while fussing around a model done up in his long purple
chiffon dress.
 &HT;    Last week, Tawfik staged his first-ever runway show, thanks to
the blood, sweat and tears of family and friends.
 &HT;    ``This show,'' he says, ``was built on favor upon favor.''
 &HT;    It was also built on beautiful clothes, a fresh, graceful
display that crossed an appealing sportswear attitude with a
healthy dose of youthful Saint Laurent reverence. Not bad for a
young man _ he's 25 _ who only graduated from the Parsons School of
Design last year.
 &HT;    But then, this is a guy who has faced tougher challenges: He
notes in passing that surgery for a benign brain tumor kept him in
school an extra year. When a visitor comments on his blase tone, he
says, ``It's all gone now.''
 &HT;    At Parsons, Mounayer had internships at Isaac Mizrahi and
Chanel, and after graduation went to work as an assistant designer
at Ann Taylor, where he learned the nuts and bolts of the fashion
business: sourcing, production, how to cut fabric and how to make a
``two-cent button look like a million bucks.''
 &HT;    Although his experience there was invaluable, he was frustrated
creatively and started designing on his own at home in the
evenings.
 &HT;    Before he knew it, he had quite a few pieces, and friends urged
him to do a show. Seven months later, models marched down the
runway wearing his spring 2001 collection, which the designer aptly
called ``Audition.''
 &HT;    Of course, it remains to be seen whether he gets the part. Right
now, Mounayer says he would love to do something small _ very
small, which he would produce himself _ for an adventurous retailer
willing to pay up front. Prices would wholesale from about $150 to
$1,000.
 &HT;    In addition to Saint Laurent, Mounayer cites Claire McCardell,
all American sportswear, and most importantly, his mother Nadia,
who passed away while he was in high school, as his inspirations.
 &HT;    ``My mother was my biggest influence,'' he says. ``I loved
rummaging through her closet as a kid, and by age 11, I was sewing
and designing full Barbie collections.'' (The closet was in
Syracuse, N.Y., where the Palestinian Mounayer was raised.)
 &HT;    He adds that his mother and aunts had a penchant for glitz:
''`Solve it with a sequin' was always my mother's mantra.
 &HT;    ``I just want to design real clothes that make women look
good,'' he continues.
 &HT;    To that end, he recently quit his job with Ann Taylor (he said
his former bosses and co-workers are very supportive) so he can
pursue his own collection full time, and he'll even wait tables if
that's what it takes to survive.
 &HT;    ``Of course I am looking for backers _ look what happened to
Miguel (Adrover). He was a big inspiration to have my show.''
 &HT;    Right now though, everything has exceeded his expectations.
 &HT;    ``I really just wanted to introduce myself,'' Mounayer explains,
``and say 'Hey, I design clothes' and get some feedback.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES
 &HT;    
 &HT;    New York's fashion cup runneth over. What was once a single week
of fashion shows has been extended to nearly two, with a huge
number of designers on the schedule. And as the action got underway
this week, there were some definite highpoints, often with a retro
attitude.
 &HT;    One hit was Russell Bennett's ``In the Now'' collection. Bennett
travelled back in time, returning with a swanky assortment of '20s-
and '40s-inspired looks. He hit Art Deco and gangster sex appeal on
the mark with graceful printed dresses and suits finished with
fedoras and gold chain necklaces.
 &HT;    Gabrielle Hamill called her show ``Cakewalk'', inspired, she
said, by memories of her grandmother's expert cake decorating for
the county fair. Guests sat at tables featuring elaborate Barbie
doll cakes and delicious cupcakes from Angelika Torn and Cupcake
Cafe.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, however, that homey mood sometimes translated to
dowdy clothes with a Fifties-homemaker feel in tweed apron dresses
paired with a pleated hem skirts and embroidered cotton dresses.
 &HT;    Shin Choi also took a stroll down memory lane for her first
show. Although known for streamlined stretch sportswear, this time
she opted for a softer, more gentle look. That meant tossing her
sleek monochromatic numbers and replacing them with herringbone
suits, butterfly sequined blouses and zig-zag patterns a la Marcia
Brady.
 &HT;    Some of the sweetness played well, but in the end, all those
stripes and florals were a little too much to handle.
 &HT;    Not all of these early birds were in a nostalgic mood. CD Greene
has always had some sizzlers in his evening collections, but now he
showed a whimsical side via dresses with Lucite puzzle pieces as
well as others done up with those predictable paillettes.
 &HT;    Greene worked his puzzles on neon-bright jersey gowns or as
cutouts edging asymmetric leather minis. But while these were
appealing, some of the other looks _ jumpsuits and illusion dresses
in particular _ needed their tart-quotient turned down to simmer.
 &HT;    Donna Haag opted for a ``Tropical Chic'' theme, and whisked her
audience away to a South Pacific paradise. Underneath a ceiling of
tropical fronds, guests enjoyed fresh mango juice and coconut,
while Haag's colorful floral dresses breezed by.
 &HT;    The orchid and bird of paradise-print dresses looked fresh and
fun, as did the rhinestone-speckled skirts and tops. But the knits
hit way under par, right alongside the floral scuba looks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ESCADA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Although Escada is well known in the U.S., the German company
has never had a formal runway presentation during New York fashion
week.
 &HT;    The show on Sept. 13, held in conjunction with the G&AMP;P
Foundation, a charitable organization for cancer, was a first for
the company.
 &HT;    ``Escada has been a very loyal patron to the G&AMP;P,'' said its
founder Denise Rich. ``We have a good partnership. They believe in
our cause.''
 &HT;    One of the evening's objectives, which included a dinner after
the show, was to focus attention on G&AMP;P's annual charity event, the
Angel Ball, scheduled for Nov. 30.
 &HT;    The front row sported a motley crew, including Ivana Trump,
Raquel Welch, Jane Seymour, Christian Campbell of ``Trick,'' Adam
Goldberg from ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Eddie Cibrian from ``Third
Watch,'' Janine Turner and S. Epatha Merkerson of ``Law and
Order.''
 &HT;    Goldie Hawn showed up during dinner.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' Welch said, ``this is the first show I've been to
since the '60s, when I was first discovered and flown over to Paris
for the Saint Laurent show.''
 &HT;    This time out she was decked in pinstriped Escada.
 &HT;    ``I like Escada because it's tailored,'' she said. ``This is not
going to be the Britney Spears kind of show. I liked what she wore
to MTV, which is great if you're performing on stage. But it's not
for me. I never really wore see-through things before. Did I? Well,
maybe I did.''
 &HT;    On the runway, Escada didn't show sheer, but there were lots of
racy little sequined pieces to supply the sizzle factor which was
sometimes tempered with crisp white shirts tied at the waist.
 &HT;    While sparkly bras and bikinis have limited real-life range,
that tailoring that Raquel loves is another story. There was plenty
of that, too, in a diverse lineup of suits and jackets, with an
emphasis on leather and shantung.
 &HT;    For evening, sparkle ruled again, in sexy, elaborately encrusted
evening gowns. But those with a truly dramatic bent might go for
the over-the-top gold matador suit or red tiered lace ``Carmen''
gown. Ole!
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GEN ART
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What do Jennifer Love Hewitt, cell phones, Polly Allen Mellen
and a 1970s Halston model-turned-cyber entrepreneur have in common?
 &HT;    Quite possibly nothing, but that didn't hurt the vibe at the
sixth annual Gen Art Fresh Faces in Fashion Show, held Wednesday
night at the Metropolitan Pavilion. The venue accommodated a
capacity crowd, in which Christina Aguilera look-alikes easily
outnumbered Britney Spears types.
 &HT;    The show was sponsored by Nokia and Ford Motor Co., as well as
IPnetworks.com, a Web enterprise that has taken upon itself the
heady task of ``bringing licensing to cyberspace.''
 &HT;    Chris Royer, the director of fashion for the year-old
IPnetworks.com, was a Halston model during the designer's heyday.
Despite her mentor's licensing nightmares, Royer still believes
that upstart designers can benefit from the type of exposure
cyberspace licensing can provide.
 &HT;    ``Young designers especially need to know the empowering side of
licensing,'' Royer said. ``If it's developed in the correct way it
can give them global exposure.''
 &HT;    After a brief delay, the evening got started as Gen Art
executive director Ian Gerard ceded the stage to Jennifer Love
Hewitt, clad in Diane Von Furstenberg, at which time the actress
presented a $2,500 award for best cell-phone accessory.
 &HT;    The winner, a succinct Kenny Hwang, said: ``This just proves you
have to have a good time doing what you're doing.''
 &HT;    Love then relinquished the stage to designer Michael Kors, who
made a tender speech in honor of Polly Allen Mellen, which
highlighted her commitment to unearthing emerging fashion talent by
any means necessary. He then presented her with a 60-page,
hand-illustrated story book designed by Ruben Toledo.
 &HT;    Mellen made a rousing speech, asserting that ``using the same
designers over and over again is a cop-out,'' and then revealed her
scintillating head-to-toe Kors outfit to a clamor of applause.
 &HT;    Then the show began, each designer or design team prefacing
their runway offering with an extreme close-up, MTV-style video
resume. Memorable lines included: ``By accident of life I started
doing nothing,'' ``I was born in France some time ago,'' ``I want a
bite of the big American pie,'' and ``My clothes are not
necessarily meant for mass production.''
 &HT;    As for the clothes, of the 12 designers, Alicia Bell was the
standout. Bell's fitted corset blouses with lace trims, skirts with
pleated godets and lots of zigzag and fishtail hems with pleats had
a romantic turn-of-the-century appeal. Other noteworthy designers
included Maia Madariaga with her soft, buttery leather looks in
strong colors as well as pieces adorned with silver chain trim to
create fringe-like effects.
 &HT;    There was also quirky knitwear from French native, Pierrot,
whose collection revolved around the kitsch factor of French
nationalism. The design duo known as Trosman-Churba presented its
``fun-tional artwear,'' which translated to such looks as a fitted
denim jacket with a gold foil leaf print.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LORO PIANA
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Everyone knows Loro Piana has luscious cashmeres. But at the
informal presentation of the spring collection, the company showed
its design range _ and it goes way beyond the precious fiber for
which it's famous.
 &HT;    Luxury was a top priority, delivered in silk, leather and linen
as well as cashmere, of course. Fun little bomber jackets,
HotPants, suits with ruffled blouses and a provocative wrap halter
proved that sexy and tasteful can co-exist.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIBERTY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Making a push for a stronger U.S. business, London-based Liberty
decided to take its show on the road with a presentation in New
York hosted by Thomas Harris, the British Consul General, and his
wife.
 &HT;    Designers Claire Corrigan and Corinne Barker showed 20 pieces in
an informal showing at Boylan Studios, and not surprisingly,
fabrics were the big draw. Those traditional Liberty florals showed
up in a teeny bikini and a classic topper, updated with a slick
nylon coating.
 &HT;    The duo also dug into the archives and revived an Art Nouveau
fan pattern for full pants and little shells. But they didn't just
rely on the past. For example, a brand new psychedelic floral
turned up on a gown, complete with train and matching scarf. While
the pattern play was dizzying at times, for Liberty fans, it's all
in good fun.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ALMOST PARADISE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Where were you in '73?
 &HT;    If you were sitting in your bedroom listening to The Who, Joni
or Yes, you can definitely relate to William Miller, the hero of
Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film, ``Almost
Famous,'' about his experience as a teen-age journalist for Rolling
Stone.
 &HT;    At the recent premiere at the Chelsea West Cinema in Manhattan,
sponsored by the now-venerable music magazine, celebrities of all
ages _ including John Leguizamo, Donovan Leitch, Bebe Neuwirth,
Mariska Hargitay and Fisher Stevens _ heartily applauded the film.
 &HT;    The clapping was certainly music to the ears of Dreamworks
co-head Jeffrey Katzenberg, director Crowe and the performers in
attendance: Billy Crudup (who arrived with gal pal Mary Louise
Parker), Frances McDormand (can you say Oscar nomination?), Philip
Seymour Hoffman (magnificent as always as renegade rock critic
Lester Bangs), Oscar winner Anna Paquin and Patrick Fugit, who
plays Miller.
 &HT;    Especially radiant was leading lady Kate Hudson, who sat next to
her very famous mom, Goldie Hawn. The young actress, who looks like
the love child of Hawn and Drew Barrymore, is a star in the making.
 &HT;    However, one performer _ albeit in a cameo performance as a
taxicab passenger _ was noticeably absent: Rolling Stone founder
Jann Wenner.
 &HT;    After the screening, designer (and noted rock-and-roll fan)
Tommy Hilfiger _ nattily attired in a window-pane suit _ pronounced
the film ``entertaining and engaging.''
 &HT;    ``Third Watch'' hunk Eddie Cibrian was also full of praise. ``I
really liked it even though I was born in 1973,'' he remarked.
 &HT;    Also giving the film high marks at the post-screening party at
Centro-Fly, which was renamed for the evening (but not redecorated)
in honor of the legendary Max's Kansas City, were a gray-bearded
Tim Robbins, who came with stepdaughter Eva Amurri (the spitting
image of mom Susan Sarandon) and Ethan Hawke (minus Uma), who
decided to make a bowling shirt his fashion statement.
 &HT;    Along with film, theater was on the mind of some of the guests:
A decidedly scruffy Kevin Bacon (maybe he was just trying to look
like a rock star?) came with wife Kyra Sedgwick, who is working
``hard, hard, hard'' on ``Stranger,'' a new play that begins
previews later this month at Off-Broadway's Vineyard Theatre.
 &HT;    ``Cabaret's'' new leading lady, former sitcom star Lea Thompson,
was still riding the high of a thunderous ovation at the ``Broadway
on Broadway'' concert in Times Square. ``I was so scared, and I am
so glad it went well. It's such a great part.''
 &HT;    And the ageless Michele Lee, preparing for her return to
Broadway in Charles Busch's hilarious ``The Tale of the Allergist's
Wife,'' confided the show is even better than it was during its
sold-out run earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Oscars are still many months away, but the fierce battle to
bejewel next year's nominees is already heating up.
 &HT;    In an unprecedented bid to encourage actresses to wear its
baubles at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony, the Italian jeweler
Bulgari will allow a select number of nominees and presenters to
design their own necklaces.
 &HT;    No word yet on how much leeway the ladies will have with their
designs _ or whether they'll be allowed to keep them _ but the
company is likely to have some fairly stylish necks to adorn. Last
year, its jewels turned up on the likes of Winona Ryder, Chloe
Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PRADA NEWS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is red the new color at Prada?
 &HT;    Sources say the Italian fashion house is scouting locations for
a party during Paris fashion week to celebrate its new Miu Miu
boutique _ and one of the spots they're considering is none other
than the Communist Party headquarters in the 10th arrondissement, a
futuristic-in-a-'70s-way cement structure by architect Oscar
Niemeyer.
 &HT;    It would be a fitting choice, given that Miuccia Prada was once
an ardent left-winger.
 &HT;    Although Prada declined to confirm that location, a spokeswoman
assured it would choose a venue based on its architecture, not its
politics.

 By JESSICA KERWIN 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Running along one side of a dusty, dead-end street
deep in the Valley, there it is: the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
 &HT;    Not really. The striped awning is a prop that's been left
hanging outside the soundstage where Aaron Spelling's ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' was once filmed and which now accommodates his new
production, ``Titans.''
 &HT;    Inside, a couple of neon letters from the old ``Peach Pit'' sign
still cling to the wall, but in the center of the dimly lit expanse
sits a brand new, big, fake Beverly Hills mansion. Its study is
wood-paneled; the living room is prim and chilly and a
double-barreled staircase could accommodate a grand entrance or a
dramatic spill.
 &HT;    It's perfectly Spelling, and though he'd bristle at the thought,
a bit reminiscent of his '80s hit, ``Dynasty.''
 &HT;    But if the ``Titans'' set brings the good old days to mind,
Spelling promises that its fashion won't allude to Nolan Miller's
famously strong-shouldered moment, even though Miller has designed
a wedding dress for the first show.
 &HT;    ``Nolan tells me that they're showing broad-shouldered suits for
women in Paris,'' says Spelling, whose voice on the phone is grave
and has a sassy Hollywood twang. ``But we don't want to be
associated with `Dynasty,' so we won't be showing any. I guarantee,
not one shoulder pad.''
 &HT;    To that end Spelling brought in another former collaborator,
Cathyrn Wagner, who put together the show's jet-setting wardrobe.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner behind the stately stage, her studio is
bursting with enough campy, vampy and stunning clothes to herald
the dawning of a new era. The get-ups Yasmine Bleeth will don as
Heather Lane during the show's debut season, which kicks off on NBC
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 4, take high-style hysterics to the brink.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bleeth's foil, Gwen Williams, played by Victorial
Principal, aims for something a little more chic, swathed in
Giorgio Armani, Ferragamo, Anne Klein and Richard Tyler.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Spelling likes clothing. He likes women and he loves women
dressed up,'' says Wagner, who served previously as the costume
stylist on ''90210.'' ``Sometimes, he'll call and say `What's with
all the leopard, Sweetheart?' But he's fair.''
 &HT;    Just as Wagner won't emulate the ``Dynasty'' look, the clothes
won't say ''90210,'' either. As Wagner likes to put it, she's moved
her shopping off of Melrose Avenue and onto Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    ``Yasmine's character, Heather, is basically a shop girl who
married way up,'' Wagner says, flipping through Bleeth's bright
rack. ``Now she wants everybody in the universe to see just how
wealthy she is and how well she's done.''
 &HT;    There's the crystal studded Versace top, the new Christian Dior
saddle bag, full-length Pucci gown from episode four, the sequined
logo-print pants by Bottega Veneta, pieces from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
Diane Von Furstenberg, a handful of rhinestone belts and vintage
Yves Saint Laurent, all in the gold, red, turquoise and fuchsia
that are the character's hallmark.
 &HT;    The ultimate piece, however, is a tiny mink bikini which is worn
on the show with loads of jewelry and sky-high heels.
 &HT;    ``When we put it together it gets a little tarty,'' Wagner says.
``Heather is very `Valley of the Dolls.' That's how we refer to her
_ but that's the most complimentary name.''
 &HT;    Heather's look is sexy, to be sure. ``Men who don't watch serial
television will be watching,'' says Spelling, who is an executive
producer of the show. ``We couldn't find smaller bathing suits.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect Bleeth to be shown hanging out of said bikini.
``I hate it when you see that,'' he continues. ``Call me square,
but they won't be dressed like sluts.''
 &HT;    Fashion victim might be the more accurate term. ``When we first
spoke, Yasmine said she wanted her character to look like the cover
of Vogue every week,'' Wagner recalls. ``I said `If you do that,
you realize that every once in a while there has to be a zinger _
something that just doesn't work.' And she said `I know, I know!
That's exactly what I want.'''
 &HT;    For the boardroom, it's Emporio Armani's fuchsia jacket and a
pair of white pants, or Tehen's curvy red suit, a Spelling
favorite.
 &HT;    ''`Titans' is about fashion and passion,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, he's so passionate about fashion that he preapproves
every costume.
 &HT;    ``I'm a nut about it. You're going to laugh, but before we film
I look over a book of Polaroids showing three different ideas for
each change.''
 &HT;    After all, Bleeth's Heather is the head of Dress2K.com, a
fashion Web site of her very own. In episode three, she even hosts
a runway show, featuring clothes that come courtesy of Nolan
Miller, whose assistant Mark Zanino designed the lot. Miller also
personally designed a wedding dress for Bleeth's character.
 &HT;    For her own part, however, Wagner sticks to shopping. It's what
she does best.
 &HT;    ``There is a lot of great stuff out there. Why design
something?'' she says.
 &HT;    Though she can't discuss her budget, Wagner has been shopping
almost every day since July to supply the 70 or so costume changes
that occur in every episode.
 &HT;    ``At this point, in the shops I sound like a kid collecting
baseball cards: got it, got it, don't got it, don't want it,''
Wagner says, laughing. ``Sometimes Yasmine could have as many as
seven costume changes,'' she adds. ``Of course, one might be naked
under the covers, so it's usually five or six.''
 &HT;    But life could get a whole lot easier for Wagner once the
fashion world tunes in. Bottega Veneta's reps have already sent in
some clothes; ABS lets Wagner pull right from the racks in the
factory downtown and Wagner has struck up a relationship with
Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.
 &HT;    ``On `90210,' people would give us stuff and I would usually
give them a photo from the show,'' she says. ``I mean a photo of
Yasmine Bleeth wearing your bikini sitting on the table during
market week is going to sell that suit fifty times over.''
 &HT;    Wagner was part of the Armani team who launched A(AT)X on the
West Coast, and she worked at Ralph Lauren as a buyer and for Donna
Karan merchandising, before making the switch to costuming.
 &HT;    In college, however, she majored in acting and had performed in
plays during her high school years in Los Angeles alongside Val
Kilmer and Kevin Spacey, who was also her prom date.
 &HT;    ``This is sort of a synthesis of fashion and theater,'' she
says. ``Clothing can transform an actor into a character.''
 &HT;    Big name designers became interested in gaining screen time for
their wares after ``Sex and the City'' began offering prime-time
placement.
 &HT;    Though Wagner wants to work with designers, she won't risk
sending out anything that might upstage her actors _ like the
glitzy $900 handbags she finds distracting on that show.
 &HT;    ``If the clothing is too exorbitant or too silly, it detracts,''
she says. ``It should be appropriate to the scene and then turned
up a notch. It should be just a little bit better than reality
is.''
 &HT;    And that, of course, is what Spelling is all about.
 &HT;    ``Wait until you see it,'' he concludes. ``You're gonna
scream.''

 By ROSEMARY FEITELBERG 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Activewear makers are looking for gold in Australia.
 &HT;    Having invested in athlete-endorsement deals for years,
activewear makers are anxious to reap some big-time brand awareness
at the Summer Olympics in Sydney.
 &HT;    With about 4,000 women lined up to go for the gold in Sydney _
the strongest female turnout in any Olympiad _ manufacturers are
counting on a few key athletes to tout their brands.
 &HT;    While Speedo has its eyes on swimmers Jenny Thompson and Dara
Torres, Nike and Adidas are banking on track star Marion Jones and
weightlifter Cheryl Haworth, respectively.
 &HT;    Knowing that Adidas, the official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, will suit up American athletes on the awards podium,
other activewear makers are hoping for some prize-winning
competitive moments.
 &HT;    Think Michael Johnson winning the 400m in his gold Nike shoes or
gymnast Kerri Strug landing on an injured leg to cinch the gold
medal for the U.S. in Atlanta. Those type of snapshots reinforce
the brand's authenticity, reflect a commitment to sports and help
raise awareness about those sports, executives said. That winning
moment can help define a brand better than any commercial, they
added.
 &HT;    Speedo, which is expected to outfit about 85 percent of all
Olympic swimmers, is banking on Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres to
build brand awareness in Sydney, according to Stu Isaacs, vice
president of team sales and sports marketing.
 &HT;    Thompson is set to compete in four or five events, and Torres is
ready for five or six events. Thompson, a five-time gold medalist,
aims to become the most decorated American female athlete, and
Torres will be at her fourth Olympics after a seven-year hiatus
from swimming.
 &HT;    Both swimmers are expected to compete in Speedo's Fastskin, a
full bodysuit designed to reduce a swimmer's drag in the water. The
suit should ``resonate'' more with fans who do not follow swimming
than those who do, Isaacs said. Swimmers are familiar with the
brand due to its dominance in the swimwear market, he added.
 &HT;    Non-swimmers tend to look at athletes and their products, Isaacs
said. TV ratings among women are generally higher during the
Olympics compared to most televised sports events, Isaac noted.
 &HT;    Speedo now plans to relaunch its Web site with more
informational tidbits and bios about its athletes.
 &HT;    Adidas, the sponsor of 3,500 athletes in 26 sports, is counting
on Cheryl Haworth and Tara Knott, two U.S. team members in the
debut of women's weightlifting as an Olympic sport, to boost brand
awareness. Viewers should be drawn to the sport since they are
unaccustomed to seeing women compete in it, the Adidas spokeswoman
pointed out.
 &HT;    In addition, Adidas' two favorites approach the sport in
different weight classes. The 17-year-old Haworth will compete in
the 75-kg class, and the petite Knott will be in a lighter one.
Both athletes will compete in new Adidas footwear and apparel
that's been designed specifically for their sport. Both athletes
will also be featured on the Adidas Web site, the spokeswoman said.
 &HT;    ``The fact of the matter is that just like advertising, there's
no easy way to draw a direct correlation from an athlete's
performance to the brand,'' she said. ``It's not like everyone is
going to go out to buy weightlifting equipment. What is more likely
to happen is increased awareness in those sports. I don't think
we're defined by one athlete.''
 &HT;    Pleased with the attention Serena Williams has grabbed for her
tie-dye tennis dresses at the U.S. Open, Puma expects her Olympic
attire to generate interest in the brand, said Alden Sheets,
president of worldwide apparel and accessories. Williams will
compete for the U.S. in women's doubles.
 &HT;    During the WWDMAGIC trade show, retailers visiting the Puma
booth wanted to know when they could get the dress Williams had
just worn in the first round at the U.S. Open. The interest was so
strong that the company decided to produce the item for consumers,
even though that was not planned, Sheets said.
 &HT;    Puma is now going to wait and see how sports fans respond to
Williams' Olympic look, before they go ahead with a production run
or in-store appearances.
 &HT;    ``If the exposure is there, we're prepared to turn quickly,''
Sheets said. ``Her travel schedule is too intense right now. Serena
wants to stay focused on the U.S. Open and the Olympics.''
 &HT;    Win or lose, Williams and her sister, Venus, a Reebok-sponsored
athlete, should shine in the spotlight in Sydney, Sheets said.
 &HT;    ``It's a rags-to-riches story. They hadn't been involved in the
junior circuit, but they've been successful right off the bat,'' he
said.
 &HT;    Nike is turning its attention to Jones, the most hyped female
amateur athlete since Wilma Rudolph, with the hope she will burn
some records on the track. A current Nike commercial spotlights
Jones, who will compete in five events.
 &HT;    ``She has a great story,'' said Jackie Thomas, director of
women's marketing for Nike. ``She's entered in so many different
events. She's incredibly charismatic.''
 &HT;    Nike also expects soccer players Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain,
track star Cathy Freeman and basketball player Chamique Holdsclaw,
to rev up interest in the brand, she added. For the first time,
Holdsclaw will sport her signature shoe, which is imprinted with a
logo instead of her name.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Running along one side of a dusty, dead-end street
deep in the Valley, there it is: the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
 &HT;    Not really. The striped awning is a prop that's been left
hanging outside the soundstage where Aaron Spelling's ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' was once filmed and which now accommodates his new
production, ``Titans.''
 &HT;    Inside, a couple of neon letters from the old ``Peach Pit'' sign
still cling to the wall, but in the center of the dimly lit expanse
sits a brand new, big, fake Beverly Hills mansion. Its study is
wood-paneled; the living room is prim and chilly and a
double-barreled staircase could accommodate a grand entrance or a
dramatic spill.
 &HT;    It's perfectly Spelling, and though he'd bristle at the thought,
a bit reminiscent of his '80s hit, ``Dynasty.''
 &HT;    But if the ``Titans'' set brings the good old days to mind,
Spelling promises that its fashion won't allude to Nolan Miller's
famously strong-shouldered moment, even though Miller has designed
a wedding dress for the first show.
 &HT;    ``Nolan tells me that they're showing broad-shouldered suits for
women in Paris,'' says Spelling, whose voice on the phone is grave
and has a sassy Hollywood twang. ``But we don't want to be
associated with `Dynasty,' so we won't be showing any. I guarantee,
not one shoulder pad.''
 &HT;    To that end Spelling brought in another former collaborator,
Cathyrn Wagner, who put together the show's jet-setting wardrobe.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner behind the stately stage, her studio is
bursting with enough campy, vampy and stunning clothes to herald
the dawning of a new era. The get-ups Yasmine Bleeth will don as
Heather Lane during the show's debut season, which kicks off on NBC
at 8 p.m. on Oct. 4, take high-style hysterics to the brink.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bleeth's foil, Gwen Williams, played by Victorial
Principal, aims for something a little more chic, swathed in
Giorgio Armani, Ferragamo, Anne Klein and Richard Tyler.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Spelling likes clothing. He likes women and he loves women
dressed up,'' says Wagner, who served previously as the costume
stylist on ''90210.'' ``Sometimes, he'll call and say `What's with
all the leopard, Sweetheart?' But he's fair.''
 &HT;    Just as Wagner won't emulate the ``Dynasty'' look, the clothes
won't say ''90210,'' either. As Wagner likes to put it, she's moved
her shopping off of Melrose Avenue and onto Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    ``Yasmine's character, Heather, is basically a shop girl who
married way up,'' Wagner says, flipping through Bleeth's bright
rack. ``Now she wants everybody in the universe to see just how
wealthy she is and how well she's done.''
 &HT;    There's the crystal studded Versace top, the new Christian Dior
saddle bag, full-length Pucci gown from episode four, the sequined
logo-print pants by Bottega Veneta, pieces from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
Diane Von Furstenberg, a handful of rhinestone belts and vintage
Yves Saint Laurent, all in the gold, red, turquoise and fuchsia
that are the character's hallmark.
 &HT;    The ultimate piece, however, is a tiny mink bikini which is worn
on the show with loads of jewelry and sky-high heels.
 &HT;    ``When we put it together it gets a little tarty,'' Wagner says.
``Heather is very `Valley of the Dolls.' That's how we refer to her
_ but that's the most complimentary name.''
 &HT;    Heather's look is sexy, to be sure. ``Men who don't watch serial
television will be watching,'' says Spelling, who is an executive
producer of the show. ``We couldn't find smaller bathing suits.''
 &HT;    Just don't expect Bleeth to be shown hanging out of said bikini.
``I hate it when you see that,'' he continues. ``Call me square,
but they won't be dressed like sluts.''
 &HT;    Fashion victim might be the more accurate term. ``When we first
spoke, Yasmine said she wanted her character to look like the cover
of Vogue every week,'' Wagner recalls. ``I said `If you do that,
you realize that every once in a while there has to be a zinger _
something that just doesn't work.' And she said `I know, I know!
That's exactly what I want.'''
 &HT;    For the boardroom, it's Emporio Armani's fuchsia jacket and a
pair of white pants, or Tehen's curvy red suit, a Spelling
favorite.
 &HT;    ''`Titans' is about fashion and passion,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, he's so passionate about fashion that he preapproves
every costume.
 &HT;    ``I'm a nut about it. You're going to laugh, but before we film
I look over a book of Polaroids showing three different ideas for
each change.''
 &HT;    After all, Bleeth's Heather is the head of Dress2K.com, a
fashion Web site of her very own. In episode three, she even hosts
a runway show, featuring clothes that come courtesy of Nolan
Miller, whose assistant Mark Zanino designed the lot. Miller also
personally designed a wedding dress for Bleeth's character.
 &HT;    For her own part, however, Wagner sticks to shopping. It's what
she does best.
 &HT;    ``There is a lot of great stuff out there. Why design
something?'' she says.
 &HT;    Though she can't discuss her budget, Wagner has been shopping
almost every day since July to supply the 70 or so costume changes
that occur in every episode.
 &HT;    ``At this point, in the shops I sound like a kid collecting
baseball cards: got it, got it, don't got it, don't want it,''
Wagner says, laughing. ``Sometimes Yasmine could have as many as
seven costume changes,'' she adds. ``Of course, one might be naked
under the covers, so it's usually five or six.''
 &HT;    But life could get a whole lot easier for Wagner once the
fashion world tunes in. Bottega Veneta's reps have already sent in
some clothes; ABS lets Wagner pull right from the racks in the
factory downtown and Wagner has struck up a relationship with
Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.
 &HT;    ``On `90210,' people would give us stuff and I would usually
give them a photo from the show,'' she says. ``I mean a photo of
Yasmine Bleeth wearing your bikini sitting on the table during
market week is going to sell that suit fifty times over.''
 &HT;    Wagner was part of the Armani team who launched A(AT)X on the
West Coast, and she worked at Ralph Lauren as a buyer and for Donna
Karan merchandising, before making the switch to costuming.
 &HT;    In college, however, she majored in acting and had performed in
plays during her high school years in Los Angeles alongside Val
Kilmer and Kevin Spacey, who was also her prom date.
 &HT;    ``This is sort of a synthesis of fashion and theater,'' she
says. ``Clothing can transform an actor into a character.''
 &HT;    Big name designers became interested in gaining screen time for
their wares after ``Sex and the City'' began offering prime-time
placement.
 &HT;    Though Wagner wants to work with designers, she won't risk
sending out anything that might upstage her actors _ like the
glitzy $900 handbags she finds distracting on that show.
 &HT;    ``If the clothing is too exorbitant or too silly, it detracts,''
she says. ``It should be appropriate to the scene and then turned
up a notch. It should be just a little bit better than reality
is.''
 &HT;    And that, of course, is what Spelling is all about.
 &HT;    ``Wait until you see it,'' he concludes. ``You're gonna
scream.''

&HT;     A TV SEASON WITH A FEW THINGS WORTH WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: All times Eastern, check local listings)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new TV season is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But most people can't stomach the idea of watching all the fall
offerings in hopes of adding a handful of them to their viewing
schedule _ particularly if they are only now getting on the ``Sex
and the City'' bandwagon and taping reruns of ``The West Wing'' so
they have something to say at the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing wisely you can eliminate mistakes and streamline
your viewing. The new season looks woefully bad, so sticking to
these options puts more time back on your life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Three dramas to watch:
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' (Wednesdays, 9 p.m.): Who says smart
television can't be popular? This NBC show moves with electric
precision. The dialogue is crisp, the stories sharp and emotional.
It won this year's Emmy for best drama. It's worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' (Sundays, 9 p.m.): This HBO program is the best
show on television, packed with layered performances, brute realism
and dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' (Sundays, 10 p.m.): ABC's lawyers-and-courts
series slipped badly last year but will undoubtedly reverse that
trend. This show is packed with high drama and weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Another to consider: ``Once and Again'' (Tuesdays, 10 p.m.).
From the creators of ``thirtysomething,'' this ABC drama is
basically ``fortysomething.'' Want a romantic drama about starting
over? Have kids and can relate? Sela Ward got this year's Emmy for
her acting.
</P>
<P>
   Four dramas no one is watching but should be:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull'' (Mondays and Tuesdays, 10 p.m.), a great new Wall
Street adrenaline rush in its first season on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars &AMP; Choosers'' (Tuesdays, 10 p.m.), a Showtime comedy
created by Brandon Tartikoff that wonderfully skewers the TV
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now'' (Sundays, 8 p.m.) is Lifetime's best show and
captures friendship and race relations like few others.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Network began to turn around its reputation for schlock
with ``Cover Me: Based on the True Life of an FBI Family
(Wednesdays, 9 p.m.), a series that breaks the standard
cookie-cutter foundation and delivers fresh story lines and
tempo-altering humor.
</P>
<P>
   Four comedies everybody is watching:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' (Sundays, 9 p.m.): Now that you have HBO
for ``The Sopranos,'' welcome to one of TV's finest half-hours.
Like its mobster-in-crisis stablemate, this show about four
thirtysomething women in New York looking for love (or something)
has received a ton of ink. And it lives up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle'' (Sundays, 8:30 p.m.): This Fox series
is brutally funny and presents us with the most hilariously
dysfunctional family since ``The Simpsons.'' And it's smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (Thursdays, 9 p.m.). The Emmy-winner for best
comedy, this NBC series about a gay man and his straight female
friend battles ``Malcolm'' as the funniest half-hour on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (Mondays, 9 p.m.): This CBS
production is a more traditional sitcom _ tamer than the other
three _ and these laughs about family life can be shared with your
own.
</P>
<P>
   Four comedies nobody is watching but should:
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Next Door'' and ``Manhattan, AZ'' (Sundays, 9 and 9:30
p.m.). Coming out of nowhere, these decidedly bent offerings give
USA Network another something to brag about. The first is a kind of
live-action ``Spy vs. Spy'' where the good guy and the bad guy both
move to the suburbs and kill each other repeatedly. Yes,
repeatedly. ``Manhattan, AZ'' is cornering the market on quirky as
just about anything goes in this fictional town filled with odd
birds and ricochet one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central's ``Strangers With Candy'' and ``The League of
Gentlemen'' (Mondays, 10 and 10:30 p.m.) are two shows that are
jaw-droppingly freaky. The first, about an older woman returning to
high school, is indeed strange but often hilarious. The latter is a
British sketch show that is dark, surreal and very British (the
show's current season is on BBC America; the Comedy Central version
is one season behind).
</P>
<P>
   Current cult hit soon to be national phenomenon that you should
be watching: ``The Powerpuff Girls'' (Mondays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays,
12:20 p.m.). It's a Cartoon Network show ostensibly aimed at young
girls but appeals to, well, the whole world. Flat-out brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Late night talk show, other than David Letterman, worth adding
to your list: ``The Chris Rock Show'' (Fridays, midnight, HBO).
</P>
<P>
   If you hate network news but want the headlines and a lot of
great punch lines: ``The Daily Show'' (11 p.m., Comedy Central)
with Jon Stewart steering us on the good ship irony.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate network news but want actual substance at the
perfect time: ``The NewsHour'' (7 p.m. weeknights) with Jim Lehrer.
This PBS show is like a visual New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Greatest sports highlight show on the planet: ``SportsCenter''
(daily, multiple showings, ESPN). Absolutely mandatory for all
sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   The best animal show on television, if you like those things:
``The Crocodile Hunter'' (Sundays, 9 p.m., Animal Planet). Steve
Irwin is becoming a legend.
</P>
<P>
   If you absolutely have to watch a game show: ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire?'' (Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m.; Thursday and Sunday,
9 p.m., ABC). We don't like what it ushered in. But it's dramatic
and better than most.

   RELIGION-POLITICS (Washington) _ A new poll shows that 70
percent of registered voters believe it is important for
politicians to have religious beliefs, but half say they are
``uncomfortable'' when the pols talk about how religious they are.
The survey was sponsored by two think tanks here, the Pew Research
Center and the Brookings Institution. By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY.

   HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart can hardly wipe the smile off his face in a farewell
interview as he prepares to leave his high-wire post. He seems to
be saying, ``I'm outta here.'' He says he has no regrets about the
way he has handled crises and describes his job this way: ``The
highs are as high as you can get and the lows are as challenging as
you can get.'' By HELEN THOMAS.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ A move by Republicans to build a
memorial to Ronald Reagan on the National Mall is a troubling
exercise in which some GOP lawmakers seek to subvert
congressionally approved procedures controlling the erection of
monuments on that hallowed strip of land. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

<P>
   Remember when IBM was a case study in complacency? IBM's
executives were too busy fighting their endless turf battles to
notice that the company's leadership position was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The company that held the top spot on Fortune's list of most
admired corporations for four years running in the mid-1980s was in
dire need of saving by the early 1990s. Fujitsu, Digital Equipment
and Compaq were hammering down hardware margins. EDS and Andersen
Consulting were stealing the hearts of CIOs. Intel and Microsoft
were running away with PC profits.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1994, Lou Gerstner's first full year as CEO, the
company had racked up $15 billion in cumulative losses over the
previous three years, and its market cap had plummeted from a high
of $105 billion to $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   How did a company that had lagged behind every computer trend
since the mainframe catch the Internet wave _ a wave that even Bill
Gates and Microsoft originally missed? Much of the credit goes to a
small band of activists who built a bonfire under IBM's rather
broad behind. This is their story.
</P>
<P>
   MISSING AN OLYMPIC OPPORTUNITY
</P>
<P>
   The first match was struck in 1994 in the backwoods of IBM's
empire, in Ithaca, N.Y., by a programmer. David Grossman was a
midlevel IBMer stationed at Cornell University's Theory Center.
Using a supercomputer connected to an early version of the
Internet, Grossman was one of the first people in the world to
download the Mosaic browser and experience the Web. His fecund
imagination quickly conjured up a wealth of interesting
applications for the nascent technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Olympics had just started in Lillehammer, Norway, and
IBM was its official technology sponsor, responsible for collecting
and displaying all the results. Watching the games at home,
Grossman saw the IBM logo on his TV screen and watched ads touting
IBM's contribution to the event. But when he sat in front of his
UNIX workstation and surfed the Web, he got a totally different
picture. A rogue Olympics Web site, run by Sun Microsystems, was
taking IBM's raw data feed and presenting it under the Sun banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM didn't have a clue as to what was happening on the open
Internet,'' Grossman say.
</P>
<P>
   He logged on to the corporate directory and looked up the name
of the senior executive in charge of all IBM marketing, Abby
Kohnstamm. Then he sent her a message informing her that IBM's
Olympic feed was being ripped off. Shortly thereafter, IBM's
diligent legal department sent Sun a cease-and-desist letter, which
succeeded in shutting down the site.
</P>
<P>
   Most front-line employees would have left it at that. But
Grossman felt IBM was missing a bigger point: Sun was about to eat
Big Blue's lunch. After everyone had come back from the Olympics,
he drove down to IBM's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., to personally
show Kohnstamm the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A VIRTUAL TEAM TAKES SHAPE
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Grossman walked in unattended, a UNIX
workstation in his arms. Borrowing a T1 line, he strung it down the
hall to a storage closet where he plugged it into the back of his
workstation. He was now ready for his demo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kohnstamm, two others were present at that first
demo _ Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of the supercomputer division
where Grossman worked, and John Patrick, who sat on a strategy task
force with Wladawsky-Berger. Patrick, a career IBMer, had been head
of marketing for the ThinkPad laptop computer and was scouting for
his next big project.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the Web for the first time, all the bells and
whistles went off,'' Patrick says. ``Its ability to include
colorful, interesting graphics and to link to audio and video
content blew my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Grossman's demo, Patrick hired him, and they soon
hooked up with David Singer, a researcher for IBM in Alameda,
Calif., who had written one of the first Gopher programs, which
fetched information off the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman and Singer started building a primitive corporate
intranet, and Patrick published a nine-page manifesto extolling the
Web. Entitled ``Get Connected,'' the manifesto outlined six ways
IBM could leverage the Web:
</P>
<P>
   1. Replace paper communications with e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Give every employee an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make top executives available to customers and investors
online.
</P>
<P>
   4. Build a home page to better communicate with customers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Print a Web address on everything, and put all marketing
online.
</P>
<P>
   6. Use the home page for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Get Connected paper, distributed informally by e-mail, found
a ready audience among IBM's Internet aficionados. The next step
was to set up an online news group that allowed IBM's underground
hackers to trade technical tidbits. Within months, more than 300
enthusiasts would join the virtual Get Connected team.
</P>
<P>
   As Patrick's group began to blossom, some argued that he should
``go corporate'' and turn the Web initiative into an officially
sanctioned project. But Patrick's boss, senior VP for strategy and
development Jim Canavino, told him to keep the grass-roots approach
as long as possible. Patrick needed to infiltrate IBM rather than
manage some splendidly isolated project. But Canavino did decree
that nobody could build a site without Patrick's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick had become IBM's semiofficial Internet czar.
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE'S THE BUY BUTTON?'
</P>
<P>
   Patrick gathered his renegades, including Grossman, at his
vacation house in western Pennsylvania. There they cobbled together
a mock-up of an IBM home page. The next step was to show it to
Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerstner saw the mock-up, his first question was, ``Where's
the buy button?'' Gerstner wasn't a quick study _ he was an instant
study. But Grossman and Patrick knew that an intrigued CEO wasn't
enough. There were thousands of others who still needed to get the
Internet religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their first chance for a mass conversion came at a meeting of
IBM's top 300 officers on May 11, 1994. Having schemed to get
himself on the agenda, Patrick drove his point home hard. He showed
IBM's top brass other sites, including ones done by
Hewlett-Packard; Sun Microsystems; the Red Sage restaurant in
Washington, D.C.; and Grossman's 6-year-old son Andrew. His point:
Everyone could have a virtual presence.
</P>
<P>
   Then he unveiled a mock-up of www.ibm.com, complete with a
36.2-second video clip of Gerstner saying, ``My name is Lou
Gerstner. Welcome to IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many IBM old-timers remained skeptical. Recalls Patrick:
``A lot of people were saying, 'How do you make money at this?' I
said, 'I have no idea. All I know is that this is the most
powerful, important form of communication both inside and outside
the company that has ever existed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the May meeting, Patrick and a few colleagues
showed up at one of the first Internet World trade conventions. The
star of the show was rival Digital Equipment. When the convention's
organizers auctioned off space for the next show, scheduled for
December, Patrick signed IBM up for the biggest display, at a cost
of tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was money I did not have,'' Patrick admits, ``but I knew I
could find it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick sent letters to the general managers of all the business
units asking for anything they had that smelled like the Internet.
They would have to put in only a little money, he promised, and he
would coordinate everything.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that IBM had a lot more Web technology brewing
than even he had expected. But none of it was really ready to go to
market. Still, by December, Patrick was able to showcase IBM's
Global Network as the world's largest Internet service provider, as
well as a Web browser that preceded both Netscape's Navigator and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   IBM stole the show and became a fixture at every Internet World
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   THROWING HAND GRENADES
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was a relentless campaigner, spreading the good word
about the Internet in countless speeches inside and outside IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe it, you've got to be out there constantly
talking about it, not sometimes, but all the time,'' Patrick says.
``If you know you're right, you just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gerstner was fanning the flames from above. He
insisted that the company put its annual and quarterly reports on
the Web, and gave a keynote address at Internet World.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM finally set up a small, formal Internet group, with
Patrick as chief technical officer, he insisted that the team stay
separate from IBM's traditional software development organization.
His logic: ``I do believe there's a benefit in being separate.
Otherwise, we'd have to start going to meetings. Pretty soon we'd
be part of someone else's organization, and a budget cut would come
along, and we'd be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the formal unit in place, Patrick and Grossman didn't
disband their grass-roots coalition. As the 1996 Summer Olympics
approached, the group went through several watershed events.
Patrick lent Grossman out for 18 months to corporate marketing,
which was in charge of the Olympics project. For the first time,
the Olympics would have an official Web site, and IBM would build
it.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the Olympics, Grossman and his team had also
started developing Web sites for other sporting events. For the
U.S. Open site, he gave a couple of college interns from MIT the
task of writing a program to connect a scoring database to the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the summer,'' Grossman remembers, ``we were
sitting in a trailer, barely keeping together a Web site with a
million people a day pounding away at it for scores.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics site had to be able to withstand anything. Patrick
got three supercomputers and about 100 people to help. By the time
it was over, IBM had built what was then the world's largest Web
site, which withstood up to 17 million hits a day with few
shutdowns. The content on the site was replicated on servers across
four continents.
</P>
<P>
   IBM even learned how to do a little e-commerce when a demo site
for online ticket sales attracted a flood of credit card numbers
and $5 million in orders.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and Grossman are today recognized for their pivotal
contribution to their company's e-business metamorphosis. With the
support of a pro-change CEO, these two unlikely heroes helped IBM
do something it hadn't done for a couple of decades: lead from the
front.

   OLY-SWIM-ARCH _ SYDNEY _ While swimmer Eric Moussambani from
Equatorial Guinea was awkward and slow as he competed in the
100-meter freestyle prelims, the 17,500 fans in the crowd stood and
cheered his every stroke. For one minute 52.72 seconds _ which is
nearly 2 1/2 times slower than it took Aussie Michael Klim to swim
the same distance in world record time during Saturday's 400-meter
relay _ Moussambani thrashed and flailed and tried desperately to
make it the pool wall. The Sydney Olympics had a hero reminiscent
of Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, the myopic ski jumper at the 1988
Calgary Olympics or, better yet, John Akhwari, the Tanzanian
marathon runner who came limping into the stadium more than hour
behind the rest of the field at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico
City. Moussambani _ a 22-year-old student from the inland town of
Molabu in his West African country _ just learned how to swim in
January. He trained in a hotel pool that was just 20-meters long

herd on all the other kids, you might wonder what was going on at
his own home. Were his kids toeing the line? Or, where they running
all over the place? Both. At least that's the way it sounded as you
listened to the tale his daughter, Joetta Clark Diggs, was telling
Wednesday in Sydney. (Archdeacon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   COXNET FOOD 0919: BUILDING A BETTER BANANA _ In the modern world
of the nation's fruit processing facilities, an increased number of
store chains have built banana ripening rooms designed to turn out
fruit just the right colors at the right time. In these
climate-controlled places, computers and temperature probes, forced
air and pressurized doors combine to bring bananas to a buff
condition 365 days a year. It's a far cry from the days of storing
bananas in a humid warehouse. (Crider, Austin American Statesman)

cheese, meat loaf, homemade rolls. But then ask folks what THEIR

   HOMES-ELECTRICITY _ Let's face it; even if a person does all his

don't expect to fool with anything electrical yourself, it pays to
have a general understanding about how your home's electrical
system works. And it also helps to know how professional electrical
contractors go about the jobs they commonly do in people's houses.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Call

fine gardens race through gardeners' heads like baseball players
rounding first after slamming one deep to center; we have, at last,
reached the fall renewal. Leaves tell the story. As the sourwoods
redden and the maples yellow, we, energized by the prospect of the
cool and maybe even the wet, can plant what we could not during the
hellish days of summer, appreciate what survived _ and perhaps most
important of all, anticipate next year. Next year. It'll be the
greatest, because of the plans we lay out now. (May, Atlanta

   KITCHEN-GARDEN _ The yard man said my backyard would never be
Shangri-la and I took his word for it, content to merely let him
spray and blow and bag and go. But then I tasted a potato for the
first time. Until you've tasted one that has just been dug up, you
haven't tasted a potato. And I knew that sunny hillside in my
backyard would someday be my Eden. Despite drought, work began this
summer, starting with a consultation with a garden designer. The
herb garden is in place; fall vegetables soon to go in the ground.

   SEASONS-BEST _ First, they suffered heat stroke. Then they got

they simply bade a sad farewell. If those tender plants you so
gingerly set out in beds last spring are now tumbleweed slammed
against the Herbie Curbie, chin up. Sure, days are still plenty
warm, water is still rationed, and those six packs of begonias look
more like six packs of Bud. But you and your yard are about to be
granted a second lease on gardening. Friday marks the official
opening of fall _ the best gardening season of all _ so get
organized. Here's a 10-point list of gardening projects for each of
the next three months to help you plan for fall, winter and spring.

Green is in town to promote his latest thriller, ``The Letter of

   BOOKS-PUBLISHERS _ Not since the invention of the printing press
has there been so much buzz in the book business. As the Publishers
Association of the South and the Southeast Booksellers Association
members gather at Atlanta's Merchandise Mart this weekend for their
annual convention, discussion topics will range from the threat of
chain stores to the future of books themselves. ``The very
definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom Payton, president of
Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the lovingly composed, designed
and printed paper artifact to that of bits and bytes downloaded
onto handheld readers.'' To deal with some of these uncertainties,
Payton and other members of the Publishers Association of the South
have arranged a quarterly series of roundtable discussions open to
the public. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.

<P>
   Remember when IBM was a case study in complacency? IBM's
executives were too busy fighting their endless turf battles to
notice that the company's leadership position was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The company that held the top spot on Fortune's list of most
admired corporations for four years running in the mid-1980s was in
dire need of saving by the early 1990s. Fujitsu, Digital Equipment
and Compaq were hammering down hardware margins. EDS and Andersen
Consulting were stealing the hearts of CIOs. Intel and Microsoft
were running away with PC profits.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1994, Lou Gerstner's first full year as CEO, the
company had racked up $15 billion in cumulative losses over the
previous three years, and its market cap had plummeted from a high
of $105 billion to $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   How did a company that had lagged behind every computer trend
since the mainframe catch the Internet wave _ a wave that even Bill
Gates and Microsoft originally missed? Much of the credit goes to a
small band of activists who built a bonfire under IBM's rather
broad behind. This is their story.
</P>
<P>
   MISSING AN OLYMPIC OPPORTUNITY
</P>
<P>
   The first match was struck in 1994 in the backwoods of IBM's
empire, in Ithaca, N.Y., by a programmer. David Grossman was a
midlevel IBMer stationed at Cornell University's Theory Center.
Using a supercomputer connected to an early version of the
Internet, Grossman was one of the first people in the world to
download the Mosaic browser and experience the Web. His fecund
imagination quickly conjured up a wealth of interesting
applications for the nascent technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Olympics had just started in Lillehammer, Norway, and
IBM was its official technology sponsor, responsible for collecting
and displaying all the results. Watching the games at home,
Grossman saw the IBM logo on his TV screen and watched ads touting
IBM's contribution to the event. But when he sat in front of his
UNIX workstation and surfed the Web, he got a totally different
picture. A rogue Olympics Web site, run by Sun Microsystems, was
taking IBM's raw data feed and presenting it under the Sun banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM didn't have a clue as to what was happening on the open
Internet,'' Grossman say.
</P>
<P>
   He logged on to the corporate directory and looked up the name
of the senior executive in charge of all IBM marketing, Abby
Kohnstamm. Then he sent her a message informing her that IBM's
Olympic feed was being ripped off. Shortly thereafter, IBM's
diligent legal department sent Sun a cease-and-desist letter, which
succeeded in shutting down the site.
</P>
<P>
   Most front-line employees would have left it at that. But
Grossman felt IBM was missing a bigger point: Sun was about to eat
Big Blue's lunch. After everyone had come back from the Olympics,
he drove down to IBM's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., to personally
show Kohnstamm the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A VIRTUAL TEAM TAKES SHAPE
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Grossman walked in unattended, a UNIX
workstation in his arms. Borrowing a T1 line, he strung it down the
hall to a storage closet where he plugged it into the back of his
workstation. He was now ready for his demo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kohnstamm, two others were present at that first
demo _ Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of the supercomputer division
where Grossman worked, and John Patrick, who sat on a strategy task
force with Wladawsky-Berger. Patrick, a career IBMer, had been head
of marketing for the ThinkPad laptop computer and was scouting for
his next big project.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the Web for the first time, all the bells and
whistles went off,'' Patrick says. ``Its ability to include
colorful, interesting graphics and to link to audio and video
content blew my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Grossman's demo, Patrick hired him, and they soon
hooked up with David Singer, a researcher for IBM in Alameda,
Calif., who had written one of the first Gopher programs, which
fetched information off the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman and Singer started building a primitive corporate
intranet, and Patrick published a nine-page manifesto extolling the
Web. Entitled ``Get Connected,'' the manifesto outlined six ways
IBM could leverage the Web:
</P>
<P>
   1. Replace paper communications with e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Give every employee an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make top executives available to customers and investors
online.
</P>
<P>
   4. Build a home page to better communicate with customers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Print a Web address on everything, and put all marketing
online.
</P>
<P>
   6. Use the home page for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Get Connected paper, distributed informally by e-mail, found
a ready audience among IBM's Internet aficionados. The next step
was to set up an online news group that allowed IBM's underground
hackers to trade technical tidbits. Within months, more than 300
enthusiasts would join the virtual Get Connected team.
</P>
<P>
   As Patrick's group began to blossom, some argued that he should
``go corporate'' and turn the Web initiative into an officially
sanctioned project. But Patrick's boss, senior VP for strategy and
development Jim Canavino, told him to keep the grass-roots approach
as long as possible. Patrick needed to infiltrate IBM rather than
manage some splendidly isolated project. But Canavino did decree
that nobody could build a site without Patrick's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick had become IBM's semiofficial Internet czar.
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE'S THE BUY BUTTON?'
</P>
<P>
   Patrick gathered his renegades, including Grossman, at his
vacation house in western Pennsylvania. There they cobbled together
a mock-up of an IBM home page. The next step was to show it to
Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerstner saw the mock-up, his first question was, ``Where's
the buy button?'' Gerstner wasn't a quick study _ he was an instant
study. But Grossman and Patrick knew that an intrigued CEO wasn't
enough. There were thousands of others who still needed to get the
Internet religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their first chance for a mass conversion came at a meeting of
IBM's top 300 officers on May 11, 1994. Having schemed to get
himself on the agenda, Patrick drove his point home hard. He showed
IBM's top brass other sites, including ones done by
Hewlett-Packard; Sun Microsystems; the Red Sage restaurant in
Washington, D.C.; and Grossman's 6-year-old son Andrew. His point:
Everyone could have a virtual presence.
</P>
<P>
   Then he unveiled a mock-up of www.ibm.com, complete with a
36.2-second video clip of Gerstner saying, ``My name is Lou
Gerstner. Welcome to IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many IBM old-timers remained skeptical. Recalls Patrick:
``A lot of people were saying, 'How do you make money at this?' I
said, 'I have no idea. All I know is that this is the most
powerful, important form of communication both inside and outside
the company that has ever existed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the May meeting, Patrick and a few colleagues
showed up at one of the first Internet World trade conventions. The
star of the show was rival Digital Equipment. When the convention's
organizers auctioned off space for the next show, scheduled for
December, Patrick signed IBM up for the biggest display, at a cost
of tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was money I did not have,'' Patrick admits, ``but I knew I
could find it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick sent letters to the general managers of all the business
units asking for anything they had that smelled like the Internet.
They would have to put in only a little money, he promised, and he
would coordinate everything.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that IBM had a lot more Web technology brewing
than even he had expected. But none of it was really ready to go to
market. Still, by December, Patrick was able to showcase IBM's
Global Network as the world's largest Internet service provider, as
well as a Web browser that preceded both Netscape's Navigator and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   IBM stole the show and became a fixture at every Internet World
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   THROWING HAND GRENADES
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was a relentless campaigner, spreading the good word
about the Internet in countless speeches inside and outside IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe it, you've got to be out there constantly
talking about it, not sometimes, but all the time,'' Patrick says.
``If you know you're right, you just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gerstner was fanning the flames from above. He
insisted that the company put its annual and quarterly reports on
the Web, and gave a keynote address at Internet World.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM finally set up a small, formal Internet group, with
Patrick as chief technical officer, he insisted that the team stay
separate from IBM's traditional software development organization.
His logic: ``I do believe there's a benefit in being separate.
Otherwise, we'd have to start going to meetings. Pretty soon we'd
be part of someone else's organization, and a budget cut would come
along, and we'd be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the formal unit in place, Patrick and Grossman didn't
disband their grass-roots coalition. As the 1996 Summer Olympics
approached, the group went through several watershed events.
Patrick lent Grossman out for 18 months to corporate marketing,
which was in charge of the Olympics project. For the first time,
the Olympics would have an official Web site, and IBM would build
it.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the Olympics, Grossman and his team had also
started developing Web sites for other sporting events. For the
U.S. Open site, he gave a couple of college interns from MIT the
task of writing a program to connect a scoring database to the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the summer,'' Grossman remembers, ``we were
sitting in a trailer, barely keeping together a Web site with a
million people a day pounding away at it for scores.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics site had to be able to withstand anything. Patrick
got three supercomputers and about 100 people to help. By the time
it was over, IBM had built what was then the world's largest Web
site, which withstood up to 17 million hits a day with few
shutdowns. The content on the site was replicated on servers across
four continents.
</P>
<P>
   IBM even learned how to do a little e-commerce when a demo site
for online ticket sales attracted a flood of credit card numbers
and $5 million in orders.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and Grossman are today recognized for their pivotal
contribution to their company's e-business metamorphosis. With the
support of a pro-change CEO, these two unlikely heroes helped IBM
do something it hadn't done for a couple of decades: lead from the
front.

<P>
   When entrepreneurs want money to grow their business, their
first port of call is often the venture capitalist. They know that
such financing means a loss of control _ VCs demand big equity
stakes and a seat on the board and often bring in outside managers
to supervise the business _ but the benefits have traditionally
outweighed the costs.
</P>
<P>
   For some entrepreneurs, however, the scales are now tipping in
the other direction. For them, loss of control is no longer the
only _ or even the biggest _ downside of VC funding. Rather, it's
the fear that the intensive networking of VC firms may compromise
the ideas on which their new companies are founded.
</P>
<P>
   Many start-ups depend not on a new, patentable technology but on
a new application of an existing technology. Their business models
are highly susceptible to imitation, and any potential breach of
security is cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the entrepreneurs question the integrity of
individual venture capitalists. Rather, they worry that
strategically sensitive information could leak out as the VC firm
discusses the new venture with outside partners and experts.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Thimmesch, founder of Arizona-based Visitalk.com, says,
``It's not so much that the VC firms are consciously indiscreet.
It's more that many of the people they talk to _ and even their
employees _ may well be working with one of our competitors next
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs such as Thimmesch are searching for other sources
of money. And they are often finding new kinds of investors who are
not only tightlipped but also more willing to align themselves with
the founders' vision and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING TO ANGELS
</P>
<P>
   For Visitalk, a supplier of Internet telephony, growth financing
has come entirely from individual investors. Raised in a wealthy
family, Thimmesch was fortunate to have ready access to a group of
people who were willing to invest large amounts of cash. And he
soon came to find that expanding that base was fairly easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's rich,'' he comments, ``always knows someone else
who's really rich.'' In the company's second round of financing, he
was able to quickly raise $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   From Thimmesch's viewpoint, angel investors have many advantages
over VCs. For a start, they aren't that interested in obtaining
exhaustive information about a company and its plans. In many
cases, an impressive product demo is all it takes to get them to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike VC firms, private investors are usually not
interested in a quick, five-year exit. They often invest to be part
of the excitement of the new economy _ it's as much an adventure as
a financial deal. As a result, they tend to be highly supportive of
management's vision and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shareholder meetings,'' Thimmesch says, ``are like church
revivals!
</P>
<P>
   Even better, private investors put the company's interests above
their own. Thimmesch had no difficulty getting shareholders to
release the company from the obligation to include existing
investors in subsequent financing rounds; that's freed the
company's hand in dealing with potential corporate investors and
strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
   RAIDING CORPORATE COFFERS
</P>
<P>
   Corporate investment, too, is on the rise. Last year, in fact,
Intel was one of the country's largest investors in new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Amadon, co-founder of TeraBeam, a company that makes
equipment for wireless optical data transmission, drew on a group
of corporate investors to reduce his reliance on VCs. He has found
those investors to be supportive and discreet partners in the
company's early development.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike VCs, corporate investors are usually quite happy to sign
nondisclosure agreements. As businesses themselves, they understand
a company's concern that strategic information will leak to
competitors. They also have sound commercial reasons for giving a
new venture the confidentiality and space it needs.
</P>
<P>
   In TeraBeam's case, corporate investors wanted privileged access
to a new technology that could change their businesses. The last
thing they wanted was for news about TeraBeam to end up in the
hands of their competitors. As Amadon puts it, ``They were
interested in getting an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some corporate investors operate much like VC firms,
others more closely resemble private investors in their enthusiasm.
That's usually because they are close to the technology themselves,
and their managers often share the outlook of _ and may even
personally know _ the venture's founders.
</P>
<P>
   RALLYING EMPLOYEES
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have all the money they need under their noses.
InfoSpace, an Internet and wireless infrastructure company, was
entirely funded by its employees until its IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious benefit of employee ownership is that it strengthens
organizational enthusiasm and commitment. But InfoSpace chairman
and founder Naveen Jain believes that it also helps companies stay
focused on profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases,'' he says, ``the money from outside investors
like VC firms goes to PR firms, advertising media and so forth.
That's great for getting name recognition ahead of an IPO, but it
doesn't help you build a successful business model.'
</P>
<P>
   Discreet and cooperative investors can make a founder's life
safer and easier. And the benefits don't stop there.
Nonprofessional investors are much less likely than professional
VCs to haggle over money. Entrepreneurs who look beyond the VC
firms for capital may find that they end up keeping a bigger chunk
of their company for themselves.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not much into predicting the future of professional
wrestling storylines, but this weekend will be a moment that
changes the future of a group of wrestlers and the World Wrestling
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's ``Unforgiven'' pay-per-view, ``Stone Cold'' Steve
Austin _ sidelined for the past year because of neck surgery _
returns to the WWF storyline with a return to the ring expected by
the end of the year. Austin's spot as the top draw for the WWF has
been taken over by The Rock. Now what will the WWF do with two
incredibly strong 'face' draws?
</P>
<P>
   I found it curious on Monday night that The Rock was pinned by
The Undertaker _ his first loss by pin since he won the WWF title
in the spring. Although the WWF does a good job of keeping its
storylines under wraps, I think the pinfall gives a clue as to what
will happen down the line.
</P>
<P>
   This is how I see it. This Sunday, Austin is expected to find
the person who ran him over with a car and ``caused'' Austin's neck
injury (it was actually injured years before and just got worse
over time). The Rock will be competing with The Undertaker, Kane
and Chris Benoit in the main event
</P>
<P>
   for The Rock's WWF title (Monday's match was non-title). Expect
to see Austin blame The Rock for his car accident and cause The
Rock to lose his title to The Undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock will claim he has been unjustly accused and engage in a
battle of words with Austin. That will lead to a showdown with
Austin (although not a match) at the next pay-per-view. The time
out of the ring will help give The Rock time to heal from nearly
nine months of nonstop working.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Undertaker will feud with his ``brother'' Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he is physically ready, Austin should meet The Rock in
the ring in the December pay-per-view. The match should be a
number-one contender's match and Austin will pull out the victory
because he wouldn't risk permanent injury for anything less than
being the top draw.
</P>
<P>
   They will follow that up with a ``Raw'' show in which The
Undertaker and Austin will jaw before The Undertaker gets the best
of Austin and hits a Tombstone piledriver on the Rattlesnake. Such
a move will of course lead to an ``injury'' to Austin that will be
promoted as career-ending. That will
</P>
<P>
   move The Rock back to the top and a feud with The Undertaker _
that sets up the January ``King of the Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, everything is built around ``Wrestlemania'' in
April and Austin or The Undertaker will call it a career at the
2001 ``Wrestlemania.'' Expect a career match between these two
injured superstars, and if Austin is healthy, expect him to win and
begin a year-long feud with The Rock. If not, Austin will lose and
that will be the end of the wrestler who made the WWF the top
wrestling organization.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wrestling got a little too real on Sunday at the WCW's ``Fall
Brawl'' pay-per-view. Longtime wrestler and one of the top teachers
at the Power Palnt, Paul Orndorff suffered what is being called a
stinger in his neck after a mishap in a piledriver. The match was
stopped after Orndorff lay motionless in the ring for a full
minute. Orndorff felt a twinge in his neck during the piledriver
and could not move. He was taken to the hospital where his neck was
examined and x-rayed. He has complete range of motion.

InfoSpace, an Internet and wireless infrastructure company, was
entirely funded by its employees until its IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious benefit of employee ownership is that it strengthens
organizational enthusiasm and commitment. But InfoSpace chairman
and founder Naveen Jain believes that it also helps companies stay
focused on profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases,'' he says, ``the money from outside investors
like VC firms goes to PR firms, advertising media and so forth.
That's great for getting name recognition ahead of an IPO, but it
doesn't help you build a successful business model.'
</P>
<P>
   Discreet and cooperative investors can make a founder's life
safer and easier. And the benefits don't stop there.
Nonprofessional investors are much less likely than professional
VCs to haggle over money. Entrepreneurs who look beyond the VC
firms for capital may find that they end up keeping a bigger chunk
of their company for themselves.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - It is because of the FCAT, and the
impossible, asinine expectations that the state is putting on the
fourteenth largest school district and its classroom teachers in
Palm Beach County, that I resigned from my teaching position on
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Now understand, this was not a decision I made willy-nilly, out
of frustration or anger. I simply no longer want to be part of a
system that puts the importance of test scores over the well-being
of the child and its community. Anyone who can tell me that a
school that receives lower test scores should lose state funding
never spent a day doing what I did for ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the classroom was an emotional decision. I'm in a sort
of mourning for the class I won't know this year. I would have been
a hypocrite, though, if I had stayed another year and deprived 30
small third-graders of what I used to provide before the FCAT came
along. Granted, I know Florida doesn't have the best education
record in the country, but penalizing kids, families and
professionals for not scoring a certain percentile on a test that's
culturally biased is downright criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. I used to like my job. I would drive over the
bridge to school every morning feeling so lucky to be a teacher and
getting paid for something I loved to do. I used to teach history
and science and health, besides reading, writing and math. We used
to put on plays. We used to do tons of art projects _ not just once
a week. We used to go outside EVERY DAY and exercise (and the
surgeon general is concerned about obese adolescents?).
</P>
<P>
   I used to teach an entire unit on tolerance and use the
Holocaust as a springboard to teach children and families about
what we can never allow to happen again. Gosh, it made a
difference, and the kids really appreciated discussing their
cultural diversity. I learned so much!
</P>
<P>
   I used to feel stimulated in the morning and live for the
spontaneity of what we might do that day depending on the vibe in
the room. And in doing all that, I was still able to teach the
county objectives for each subject and feel like the kids actually
liked coming to school. I used to feel that I provided a
well-rounded education for my students, the kind of education my
parents and I had in elementary school, when being 8 was fun. I
never remember getting stomachaches because I couldn't remember the
formula to find the volume of a cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to school wasn't fun anymore ... for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   For the last half of my teaching career, I taught to the test.
But even doing that could never prepare an 8-year-old for writing
an extended essay (8-14 lines) on the uses of ``composting'' for
the FCAT reading portion. Tell me, how is it that a Guatemalan
immigrant in third or fourth grade who sleeps on rolled-up Publix
bags at night with no running water and a limited command of the
English language is supposed to know what composting is? I suppose
if we all lived on a farm in Iowa we might have a fighting chance.
This is West Palm Beach. Why is this question determining whether
or not our inner-city schools lose money? How about asking them a
question about how to make a box of macaroni last for three days
among six people. I bet they'd score higher than some of the kids
in ``A'' schools...
</P>
<P>
   I've always felt you've been pretty right on as far as what's
happening in the schools, and I thought maybe looking at the
impossible demands the FCAT is putting on teachers might make for a
good article sometime.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know is I'm going to wake up Wednesday morning and do
something very different than I've done for the last 10 years _ be
a spectator to the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>

this letter at the beginning of the school year, after deciding
over the summer to quit her teaching job at Palm Beach Public.

 &HT;    What is Florida's obsession with standardized scoring doing to
our teachers _ not to mention our kids?
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Janet Janke likes to tell this story:
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, she says, that the FCAT is a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   A still photograph.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of what a certain child with a certain history knows
at a certain hour on a certain day.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, too, that this is not the very best day of this child's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't it be that the night before, the family cat died? Or
Daddy hit Mommy. Again. Couldn't it be that it's raining outside
and his tummy hurts inside and his nose is runny and he doesn't
feel well?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there he is, white Velcro-tab sneakers positioned just so
under his desk. There he is, reading the FCAT prompt, thinking,
wrapping his coarse hair around his soft finger, trying to remember
all the things he knows he knows.
</P>
<P>
   He has a minute or two to read the question, another minute or
so to go back and find the answers and then a minute or so to write
his response: the introduction, the three points, the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that how everybody writes?
</P>
<P>
   So, this is Janke's point to the story she likes to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't this child's life be told, not in still photography,
but in video?
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we see that just two years ago, this child shuffled
into school, not speaking a lick of English and now he not only
speaks it, he yells it on the playground _ or at least he does when
the kids are allowed to go outside?
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we see that he's improved _ oh, how he's improved _
and while he might not do as well as the rich white kids, he is,
for the most part, an amazing child with amazing potential? So
sweet. So kind. So smart with numbers. And he has friends!
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we see where this boy started and where he's headed,
not where he landed on any given test day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think teaching used to be more global. Learning was a little
more exciting,'' says Janke, who teaches in the Glades. ``But now,
it's all geared toward the test. It's almost a survival thing
because they have to pass the test and we have to teach to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to force this.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Janke, 62, soft spoken, kind and a public school teacher
for nearly 30 years, is not one to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, one to question what the state of Florida is
doing to its kids.
</P>
<P>
   What has the FCAT _ the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test _
really done to classroom teaching? What's different now?
</P>
<P>
   Allow us to enlighten you, with more stories.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anthony, 42, not his real name because he's about to spew
FCAT venom and he might want to teach again in this county someday,
used to work with this really interesting woman.
</P>
<P>
   She was the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, she'd turn her classroom into a mini-city. Her desk
was town hall. The rows of desks were the streets. The kids got
their homework in their ``mailboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   After they started giving the FCAT in 1998, she gave all that
up. There wasn't time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because of pressure over test performances, teachers time
kids when they read, which is to say: They urge beginning readers
to hurry up and finish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they stay away from science and social studies. There are
fewer and fewer lessons on the explorers _ how they came over, the
land bridge, the Native Americans. Christopher Columbus. Magellan.
It's mostly all gone in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Anthony taped the Weather Channel and used the
tapes to teach science. But he had to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   No time. The math book and all the little FCAT worksheets were
calling to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, they couldn't wait,'' he says. ``Even the most
disruptive kids in the class were so into that. Science and social
studies are things kids drool over at that age. They can't get
enough of making maps and putting potions together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kara Schwarz, 28, who taught kindergarten and fifth grade in the
public schools until she had a third child and took some time off,
said she couldn't teach from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have time for geography. You don't have time to
teach a lesson on the Olympics,'' says Schwarz, who wants to go
back. She thinks. ``The kids are just so burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of whole lessons on the waves of the ocean and how they
work, teachers have to be content to just sneak ``ocean'' words
onto the spelling list. That's science! There's more homework
because there's more to cover, and teachers can't cover it all in
the classroom. So, they have to send it home to even pretend it's
getting done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get through all the stuff,'' says Schwarz. ``So you
end up sending home work that they barely understood in class. It
just went against the way I teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers don't have recess.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have class pets.
</P>
<P>
   They don't turn their classrooms into cities.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Marge Keller, who has taught at various elementary
grades for 17 years, says even her favorite list of classroom
speakers _ the community helper _ doesn't click with the state's
revised plan for a good education.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, it doesn't fit into any Sunshine State
Standards to have the fireman come in,'' she said. But even with
these tougher new standards, ``half the kids still think they live
in the state of West Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good teachers either get out, because they can't take it,
or they kind of stay and do the best they can,'' Keller said.
``Like my mantra right now is: I'm doing the best I can. I'm doing
the best I can. If that isn't good enough, then somebody else has
to come in here and try it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that this kind of classroom frustration is
widespread throughout the county, if not the state. But the
district does not keep track of so-called FCAT resignations, nor
does it keep track of teachers who transfer to another grade or
another school because the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morale is terrible,'' says Schwarz. ``They're leaving the
schools in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge Keller: ``In some cases, I think it has made teachers
better, because some of them would just play all the time. But it's
like they went from the ridiculous to the sublime.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fireman talk she loves so much? Keller does it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese tested citizens as early as 210 B.C. to find the
most able men for civil service jobs. They gave tests during the
Middle Ages to decide which men would be scholars and study the
liberal arts. And the multiple choice test debuted in America after
World War I as a way to quickly assess a man's brains. They were
also easier to grade. Yet, with all our society's history on
testing, present-day educators still have not figured out a good
way to test students to see if they are learning.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is not the only state struggling with standardized
tests. The tests are creating controversy in Texas, Michigan,
Colorado and Massachusetts. Opponents in all those states have
organized lawsuits or boycotts. And, so pressurized are schools in
some of these states that teachers and administrators in a half
dozen places, including Florida, have been fired for fudging
results.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's test was designed by Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, a former
Martin County educator and administrator and former state education
commissioner, to increase standards throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough kids were learning, Brogan said. Too many schools
were producing failing children, he said. Teachers, said Brogan,
needed to be accountable.
</P>
<P>
   And so it began.
</P>
<P>
   The first real FCAT test was given in 1998; the money awarded
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the money. If a school does well, if it gets an A on the
FCAT, it gets extra state money. If it improves its test scores
from one year to the next, it gets extra state money.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, nada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had national testing,'' says Janke, the woman who
teaches ESOL students at Glade View Elementary School in Belle
Glade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had national testing so we could compare our students to
students across the country. We did not use the test the way
they're using it today. They were shared with parents, but never
published in the newspaper. They were never used for grading and
rewards. That's the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, there are the students.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Krenz, 37, a Palm Beach County mother of three, is
torn about the test. On the one hand, schools can't turn out
dummies. But, on the other hand, she's tired of the stress. She has
a 10-year-old daughter who took the FCAT last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt a real responsibility to do well,'' Krenz said.
``Along with that responsibility to do well came migraines and
vomiting and tension. It's a shame that we have to do this to our
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Clough, 39, another mother of three who is on the Student
Advisory Council at South Olive Elementary School in West Palm
Beach, said her fourth-grade son is already hesitant about the
FCAT. He's had stomachaches and has begged to miss school. ``He's
already a little stressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clough is just now helping to decide how their school
will spend their test money from last year _ they improved their
grade _ she said she'd rather give it away to a D or F school than
deal with the FCATs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students scored well. But I don't know at what cost it
was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many little children were afraid to go to school?''

 &HT;    NUMBER OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES SKYROCKETS IN CHINA
 &HT;    900&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 24
 &HT;    With Photos
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ You can find them in any bar or disco or any of the
myriad beauty parlors, saunas and karaoke lounges that litter every
town in China. From the toniest hotels to the seediest roadside
stalls, millions of women are trying to make a living in the new
market economy by working in the world's oldest profession.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution is rampant in China. And experts say it is one of
the primary reasons for the skyrocketing number of cases of
syphilis, gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
</P>
<P>
   The growth rate has averaged a stunning 30 percent annually for
the last several years and has reached nearly 40 percent this year,
according to the Chinese Ministry of Health. At a time when STD
levels in Western countries are generally dropping, the annual rate
of increase in some Chinese provinces has reached 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government is starting to recognize the seriousness
of the problem, few believe it will be brought under control
anytime soon. With an ever-more mobile population, a dismal level
of sex education for young people who are becoming increasingly
sexually active, and a sex industry that is almost
institutionalized, government efforts to limit the spread of STDs
seem like a drop in the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Health announced a major STD campaign this
spring. Its budget: a paltry $360,000. With that money, it plans to
train doctors, establish new clinics and educate the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the trend, and the trend is very clear,'' said
William Stewart, technical advisor to a European Union STD training
program in China. ``There's been a year-on-year increase for the
last 15 years. It's not being effectively controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, health experts fear the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases will further aggravate a worsening AIDS
problem. While HIV in China is now linked mainly to intravenous
drug use, sexual contact is becoming a more important means of
transmission in some regions, such as China's booming southeastern
coast.
</P>
<P>
   With HIV rates also are climbing by about 30 percent annually,
the government says. Top Chinese AIDS researcher Zeng Yi has warned
of AIDS becoming a ``national disaster'' if the government does not
step up funding and testing, both of which have declined in recent
years. China spends less on AIDS than much smaller countries, such
as Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since many sexually transmitted diseases enhance the spread of
HIV by making carriers more infectious and non-carriers more
susceptible to infection, health experts fear unsafe sex will
overtake needle sharing as the primary transmission channel,
further complicating prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some health officials still push sexual abstinence as the only
appropriate means of prevention in a socialist country. But other
health agencies have recognized the realities _ namely, that
attitudes towards sex have loosened dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing Family Planning Commission has installed about 200
condom dispensers at universities and in other public places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've broken through the conservatism,'' said Chen Xiaoyu,
manager of the state-run Adam and Eve Health Center, a sex shop in
Beijing. ``People's faces used to turn pale at the mere mention of
the word 'sex.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since Adam and Eve opened in 1992, it has been followed by at
least a couple hundred more sex shops in Beijing selling a variety
of condoms, sex toys and aphrodisiacs. When customers, many of whom
are middle-aged, ask questions about how a certain toy is used, the
elderly female doctors answer clinically but specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have girls coming in and asking me, 'is this soft?' 'does
this feel good?''' said Han Qiang, a former army medical student
who dropped out five years ago to open a chain of sex shops.
``They're not embarrassed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While sex shops may have helped adults re-light the flames in
some bedrooms, it's the youth that are being ignored in China's sex
revolution. And surveys show they are becoming more sexually
active.
</P>
<P>
   ``What China needs most is sex education, not these adult
shops,'' said Chen. ``Especially for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevention education for so-called ``sex workers'' is also
essentially non-existent. The government's main attitude towards
prostitution is to launch anti-vice campaigns every once in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think it's essential (to educate sex workers),''
said Stewart. ``In current circumstances, it would be very
difficult to eradicate STDs simply by cracking down on
prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But even government crackdowns are sometimes for show because
some establishments operate with official backing and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some local government and party officials ... mistakenly
believe that allowing prostitution, gambling and drugs can improve
the investment environment,'' said a commentary in the official
People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party. ``Certain
localities even set aside so-called forbidden zones where law
enforcement agencies are not allowed to inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   When businessmen want to entertain potential clients or
officials want to ingratiate themselves with visiting higher-ups, a
massage parlor or karaoke lounge is the destination of choice.
</P>
<P>
   A batch of ``waitresses'' will come in and the guest of honor is
allowed first choice to pick his companion. She will then be his
companion for the evening _ dancing and sitting closely with him,
lighting his cigarettes, feeding him fruit and then, if he likes,
offering sexual services. Such evenings are often paid for with
public money.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Those dance halls, karaokes, saunas _ I haven't been to
them,'' said Dr. Wang Peizhong with an air of disgust tempered by
resignation. ``(My patients) say they got drunk, got confused. Who
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wang went to medical school more than 30 years ago,
sexually transmitted diseases were never even mentioned. That's
because the Communists virtually eradicated them by the early
1960s, about 15 years after they came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Now working at Beijing's Xuanwu Hospital, Wang was among the
first doctors to be trained in STD treatment in the 1980s. The
Ministry of Health acknowledges there are still too many
unqualified doctors, some of whom make sexual infections worse by
misdiagnosing the problem or prescribing the wrong medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Training of medical professionals has been slow. In the southern
city of Shenzhen, of 800 workers at STD clinics given written tests
on medical knowledge, only 23 percent passed, according to a
dispatch from Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   With the old socialist health care system moving rapidly to a
for-profit basis, treatment costs can be prohibitive. A case of
syphilis or gonorrhea can cost 400 renminbi ($48), equivalent to a
month's wages for many laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of STD services in China must be the highest in the
world,'' said Stewart. ``There's a belief among doctors that people
with STDs must be rich because they have money to play around.
They'll choose more diagnostic tests or more expensive drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stewart says the picture is not completely bleak. China's
total number of STD cases _ about 8 million, including fewer than
600,000 with HIV _ is still relatively low compared to its
population of 1.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As for protection, ``most people know condoms prevent disease,
but some think they're unnecessary or uncomfortable,'' said Han
Qiang, the Beijing sex shop owner. ``Or some people get to that
point with a girl, but they're not going to stop and think about a
disease and go out and buy a condom.''

 &HT;    Nothstein wins gold, overcomes memories of 1996 2nd place finish
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Every day, for four years, American cyclist Marty
Nothstein thought about his second-place finish at the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about the mental mistake he made that kept him from
the gold medal. He thought about how his nemesis, Jens Fiedler of
Germany, beat him by a mere tire width. And he thought about
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing in Atlanta has been haunting me ever since that day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, those unrelenting thoughts went away for good Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein captured the gold medal in the sprint finals after
first defeating Fiedler in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable. Unbelievable,'' Nothstein said after becoming
the first American cyclist to win the individual sprint since Steve
Hegg did it at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I have been training for,'' said the 29-year-old
father of two from Trexlertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one thing on my mind the last four years, getting across
the finish line first. It's been a lot of tears, a lot of skin
lost. ... My dream finally came true. ... A big burden has been
lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   But not before a tough semi-finals against Fiedler, a two-time
Olympic gold medalist. Nothstein blamed his defeat in Atlanta on
becoming overconfident against Fiedler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got ahead of myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no mental mistakes this time.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein came from behind to surge past Fiedler between the
third and final turns, beating him by a nose in the first race of a
best two-out-of-three contest. His time for the 200 meters was
10.93 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein then used a similar strategy in the second race to get
by Fiedler and into the finals.
</P>
<P>
   There, Nothstein handily defeated Florian Rousseau of France,
finishing the last of two races by waving his fist in the air from
the final turn to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was a victory lap with the American flag, and hugs and
kisses from his family.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a frequent experience for U.S. cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that besides myself and (road racer) Lance
(Armstrong), we're not deep in cycling,'' Nothstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed a large part of his success to his disciplined and
rigorous training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to commit yourself to the sport 100 percent,'' he
said. ``Every little thing I thought I could improve on I did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That included losing 12 pounds and building muscle, both of
which added to his strength and speed. He's down to only 5 percent
body fat.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nothstein has a chance to win another medal in the
Keirin.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler, meanwhile, had to settle for the bronze medal in
Wednesday's sprint after defeating Laurent Gane of France.

 &HT;    Hyman upsets Aussies' 'Madame Butterfly'
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Play Misty for them. An adoring crowd poised to send
Australian Susie O'Neill into retirement with another Olympic gold
medal was stunned when U.S. swimmer Misty Hyman stole the show
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman swam more than three seconds faster than she ever had i to
win the 200-meter butterfly and defeat O'Neill, known as ``Madame
Butterfly,'' the world record holder, 1996 gold medalist and most
adored swimmer in Australia. Hyman almost nabbed the record, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played it over so many times in my head, but I never
thought it would come true,'' said Hyman, who, discouraged by
health problems and slow times, was ready to quit swimming in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix native's time of 2:05.88 seconds was .07 off
O'Neill's record, but seven-tenths faster than O'Neill swam.
O'Neill, who won the 200-meter freestyle, also added a silver in
the 800-meter freestyle relay won by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In another upset, 200-meter freestyle champion Pieter van den
Hoogenband blocked Alexander Popov's bid to become the first man to
win three Olympic 100-meter titles in a row. The Flying Dutchman
didn't swim as fast as he did in the semifinals, but had a time of
48.30 to the Russian's 48.69.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. of the United States, the 1996 silver medalist,
took the bronze, out-touching by .01 Australia's Michael Klim, who
held the world record for three days earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson won her seventh Olympic gold medal in a relay by
anchoring the 800-meter freestyle relay. University of Georgia
swmmer Kim Black also won a gold medal for swimming the
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thompson's goal of winning an individual gold grew less
likely with Inge de Bruijn's world record in the 100-meter
freestyle semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   With a time of 53.77 seconds, de Bruijn broke her own mark of
53.80 seconds set in May. Hyman, a 21-year-old Stanford student,
led from the start. O'Neill made a move in the last 25 meters, but
Hyman held her off. When she turned and saw the scoreboard, she
said, ``Ohmigod'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it came from my heart when I pushed off that last
wall,'' Hyman said. ``So many times I struggled coming home, and I
thought, `I can do this.'''

 &HT;    How professional contractors tackle the most common household
electrical jobs
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Beads of sweat popped out on Tim Ashley's
forehead as he wrestled a heavy light fixture into place over a
pool table. Being a residential electrician doesn't require as much
heavy lifting as some home-improvement jobs, but it has its share.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, being an electrician is about knowing which wire
goes where.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley of Larkin Electric Co. in Dayton has been able to put
most of his know-how into the remodeling job he's working on in
Oakwood. The job entailed doubling the power supply to the house
and setting up a new service panel, the electrical nerve center of
a house, and wiring a new garage and recreation room.
</P>
<P>
   But you can call an electrical contractor for a job that takes
less than an hour as well as for jobs that take days or even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can come out and put in a single ground fault interrupter
outlet, if that's what you want,'' said Joe Ryan, owner of Reliable
Electric in Centerville. ``But it's a good idea to save up all the
electrical jobs in the `honey-do jar' until you have several. That
way you only pay for one service call.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it; even if a person does all his own lawn work,
minor plumbing, carpentry, landscaping and other jobs around the
house, he may fear electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   In most people's minds, making an electrical repair has three
possible outcomes: You could be successful, you could be
electrocuted or you could think you were successful until your
house burns down the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't expect to fool with anything electrical
yourself, it pays to have a general understanding about how your
home's electrical system works.
</P>
<P>
   And it also helps to know how professional electrical
contractors go about the jobs they commonly do in people's houses.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is such a complicated subject that most people
assume they'll never understand it and don't try. But the basic
principles aren't that hard to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to think of the electricity we use at home as being
like water held in pipes under pressure. Volts measure the pressure
of electricity in the line and amps and watts measure the rate of
power flow.
</P>
<P>
   Each electrical cord is like a pipe and each lamp, air
conditioner or other appliance draws a given amount of energy
through that pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing you need to remember is that alternating
current, the type of electricity we use at home, travels in loops.
One wire, called the hot wire, carries electricity to our outlets
and switches, and another wire, called the neutral wire, carries
electricity back to the service panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Power and Light Co. generates electricity and
transmits it through power lines to most houses in the Dayton area.
The utility company uses equipment in the transmission system to
deliver the required amount of electricity to each house.
</P>
<P>
   At each house, DP&AMP;L's electricity flows through a meter that
measures the amount of electricity being used and then into a
service panel, that metal box filled with wires and fuses or
circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   An electrician sets up the service panel to divide the
electricity circulating around the house into circuits, which are
basically just power loops made up of wall receptacles and
switches. Electricity flows out through the loop on hot wires and
flows back to the service panel on neutral wires.
</P>
<P>
   Each circuit is designed to carry electricity only at a certain
rate of flow. A 15-amp circuit, for example, could handle five
appliances that pull in power at 3 amps each. If you turn on too
many appliances at once, the appliances draw power through the
circuit at a rate it can't handle, and a fuse will burn out or a
circuit breaker will trip to keep the wires in the circuit from
overheating and burning.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity, like water, would flow into the ground if it
weren't held in check. But like water, electricity flows in the
direction of least resistance, and metal wires within the circuits
in our homes provide a continuous low-resistance path that keeps
electricity safely within its loops.
</P>
<P>
   But if a wire breaks or becomes detached the electricity looks
for the best alternative path to reach the ground. The casing of an
electrical device can become charged with electricity with no place
to go, and if a person touches that device the human body can
provide a path for the electricity to get to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ground wires provide extra protection. Grounded circuits have a
wire that is attached to cold-water pipes and to a rod buried in
the ground. The ground wire gives electricity a safe path into the
ground if the loop formed by the hot wire and neutral wire is
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ryan and Jeff Gutridge, residential manager for Larkin
Electric, said most shocks received in homes aren't life
threatening because normal household electrical circuits don't
carry enough power. Heavy-duty circuits, such as those for electric
ranges or clothes dryers, carry more power and pose a bigger
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get shocked doing electrical work, it's usually
because you're doing something wrong,'' Gutridge said. ``We usually
don't get hurt from the shock itself, it's the reaction to the
shock. You can fall or jerk your hand back and slam it into
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said a competent do-it-yourselfer can read a manual and
follow instructions to do many minor electric tasks without
professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I stress is that you have to cut the power to
the circuit you're working on and use a detector to confirm the
power is cut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus I would never recommend that any nonprofessional try to
wire a hot tub or a pool or a spa or anything else that involves
water,'' Ryan said. ``The potential danger is just too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Common electrician jobs
</P>
<P>
   If you have work around the house that requires the expertise of
a professional electrical contractor, you find one the way you find
any home-improvement contractor. Start by polling friends and
associates to see if they know a reliable company.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau, professional building-trade
organizations, remodelers and builders may also be a source for
suggestions. If the job is substantial, meet with and get estimates
from at least two contractors before choosing one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New service panel. Circuit-breaker panels have become
standard, but many older houses still have fuse boxes. Fuse boxes
often have a lower total capacity than circuit breaker panels _ 60
amp fuse boxes are common compared with 100 amp minimum
circuit-breaker panels _ so one reason for changing to circuit
breakers is to increase a house's available power.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in some cases the plastics used in fuse boxes can become
brittle from years of heat, or home owners just aren't comfortable
with the idea of changing fuses instead of flipping a
circuit-breaker switch.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said circuit breakers are a better technology than fuses,
but that doesn't mean fuses are unsafe or that all fuse boxes
should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of a service panel takes about five to seven
hours in most cases, and usually costs $750 to $1,000. Moving a
panel to a different location adds costs, as do other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the electrical capacity to 200 amps instead of the
basic 100 may cost about $200 more.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said some people ask if they should have their entire house
rewired when they replace their service panels. He generally
recommends against it.
</P>
<P>
   Copper wiring behind the walls doesn't break down significantly
over time from carrying voltage, and it generally lasts as long as
the house. Aluminum wiring, however, which was popular in the
1960s, can be a problem. If your house was built during that
period, it might be wise to have an electrician inspect your
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New switches and receptacles. It doesn't make much sense to
call in an electrician to install one or two new switches or
electrical outlets _ most of the cost for the job will go toward
the service call.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're having something else done _ such as installing a
new service panel _ you might want to replace some switches and
receptacles at the same time. Each switch will take only a few
minutes to replace, and the cost of materials isn't high unless you
want custom fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at most outlets you'll notice that one slot is
longer than the other. This feature makes sure that when you plug
in a device it is properly polarized, meaning the current comes in
on the hot wire and out on the neutral wire in a way consistent
with the device's design.
</P>
<P>
   Some older homes have outlets with two identical slots, and
replacing those old outlets with polarized outlets will help
protect devices designed for a polarized power flow.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing old switches and receptacles is something most
homeowners can do themselves. The trick is connecting the right
wire in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   An inexpensive device called a voltage detector will help you
identify which wires are hot wires and which are neutral, and
switches and receptacles are color coded so you know where the
attachments should be made.
</P>
<P>
   The hot wire goes to the copper-colored connector, and the
neutral wire goes to the silver connector. When a ground wire is
involved, the ground connector is green.
</P>
<P>
   Another old electrical component you might want to consider
replacing after a few decades is the flush-mounted ceiling light of
the type found in closets, hallways and kitchens, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the heat from the light bulbs can cause the insulation
on the fixture to deteriorate and fall off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ground fault interrupter outlets. In any area where electrical
outlets are close to water or dampness, ground fault interrupter
outlets should be used. That includes kitchens, bathrooms, garages,
outdoor outlets and basements.
</P>
<P>
   A ground fault interrupter has a built-in device that monitors
the current in the hot wire coming in and in the neutral wire going
out. An imbalance between the currents on the two sides of the
circuit indicates electricity is leaking somewhere and trying to
get to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That loose electricity presents a shock hazard, so the ground
fault interrupter cuts power to the outlet. Once you remove
whatever was creating the imbalance _ unplugging a faulty toaster,
for example _ the outlet can be reset.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about ground fault interrupter outlets is
that you can use them on a circuit that is not grounded. Instead of
using a ground wire to carry away loose electricity, a ground fault
interrupter shuts down the power flow completely.
</P>
<P>
   Again, installing a ground fault interrupter is something many
do-it-yourselfers can do on their own. Or it can be added to the
list of jobs for the electrician's next visit.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Adding a ceiling fan or heavy chandelier. Replacing a ceiling
light with a ceiling fan is fairly simple, but adding a ceiling fan
to a ceiling that hasn't been previously wired can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   The electrician must open a hole in the ceiling of the room and
then somehow stretch an electric cable to a convenient nearby power
source.
</P>
<P>
   If the room is under an attic, the power line usually can be run
between or through the floor joists, then lowered through the space
between wall studs and tied into an existing power line.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley connected the light fixture in the Oakwood remodeling job
by using a spring metal ``fishing'' device to pull wires through an
opening between floor joists in an adjacent unfinished area of the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wires are in place, the electrician installs a special
bracket to hold the weight of the fan or chandelier and makes the
electrical connections.
</P>
<P>
   Barring complications, the job costs about $100 to $200. Expect
to pay a little more if you want things such as separate wall
switches to control the fan and its lights.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New circuit. It seems that houses never have quite enough
outlets, and circuits often become overloaded as new appliances
with heavy power demands are added.
</P>
<P>
   A way to get extra power where it's needed is to add a circuit
at the service panel and run wires for the new circuit to the spot
where power is needed. It's commonly done for microwave ovens and
computers particularly.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said putting a computer on a separate, grounded circuit is
an excellent idea. He said computers use the ground wire as a
reference point and to protect delicate components.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a computer or any hotsy-totsy electronic
home-entertainment equipment really needs to get it on a grounded
circuit,'' he said. ``I know people who use their computers on a
two-prong outlet for years without problems, and then one day they
find they've fried their mother board.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said adding a ground fault interrupter on an outlet for the
computer isn't enough. Adding a ground fault interrupter doesn't
add grounding to a circuit that isn't grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a circuit typically takes less than two hours and will
cost about $125 if the circumstances are simple.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no easy way to run a wire to the spot where you need
an outlet, you may have to pay for conduit to run along baseboards
or up an outside wall, and that will add significantly to the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Attic exhaust fan. A thermostatically controlled fan is placed
in the attic to push hot air out of the house on summer days.
</P>
<P>
   When the fan kicks on, it can lower the attic temperature 50
degrees, and that greatly reduces the radiant heat pouring into
upstairs rooms through their ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of automatic exhaust fans varies between contractors,
but $250 to $300 is typical. The price will be affected by the
quality of the fan used, and the difficulty of wiring it into your
attic.
</P>
<P>
   But the fan should pay for itself quickly in reduced
air-conditioning costs and improved comfort.

 &HT;    Aussies cheer competitor who has only been swimming since
January
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - No swimmer _ besides the home-grown Australians _ has
mesmerized the crowds at the Sydney international Aquatic Center
like Eric Moussambani.
</P>
<P>
   As the sprinter _ and we use that term loosely _ from Equatorial
Guinea competed in the 100-meter freestyle prelims, the 17,500 fans
stood and cheered his every stroke.
</P>
<P>
   And that means, they cheered and cheered and cheered some more.
For one minute 52.72 seconds Moussambani thrashed and flailed and
tried desperately to make it the pool wall.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers, vendors and other athletes stopped their duties to
watch the drama unfold. Lifeguards were at the ready and more than
one prayer was said.
</P>
<P>
   When Moussambani finally made it back to starting blocks _ and
through bizarre circumstance ended up the winner of his heat _ the
place went nuts. Local stars Klim, Ian Thorpe or Susie O'Neill
haven't heard any more deafening cheers here this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympics had a hero reminiscent of Eddie ``The
Eagle'' Edwards, the myopic ski jumper at the 1988 Calgary Olympics
or, better yet, John Akhwari, the Tanzanian marathon runner who
came limping into the stadium more than hour behind the rest of the
field at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Moussambani _ a 22-year-old student from the inland town of
Molabu in his West African country _ just learned to swim in
January. He trained in a hotel pool only 20-meters long and _
because tourists there had first dibs _ he rarely got access to the
facility. His country _ a former Spanish colony _ just began an
Olympic swimming federation four months ago and has no 50-meter
pools. And so coming into Sydney, Moussambani had never before swum
50 meters, much less 100 _ the event in which he was entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might be too much,'' he said through an
interpreter, ``but my coach said I should go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude Moussambani has taken through this whole
Olympic experience. Although this is the first international trip
he ever has made, he looked right at home carrying his nation's
flag in the Opening Ceremonies on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the blocks for his heat, he again held his position when the
only other two swimmers in the race _ Nigeria's Karim Bare and
Tajikistan's Farkhood Oripov _ lost their balance on the starters'
blocks and fell into the pool before the starter's pistol had
fired.
</P>
<P>
   When they were disqualified _ with the crowd loudly booing the
rules-enforcing officials _ Moussambani suddenly found himself
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   With an awkward flop into the pool at the start, Moussambani _
whose swimming stroke is akin to Shaquille O'Neal's free throw
touch or Garo Yepremian's passing arm _ worked his way across the
first 50 meters in 40 seconds. After the turn he began to flounder
and gasp for breath. His body was mostly under water, his arms were
wind-milling like some fast-pitch softball pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to send hugs and kisses to the crowd because it was
their cheering that kept me going,'' he said after the race. ``I
was surprised by the reaction of the people. And most of all, I'm
thankful I made it. I think I am very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was likely no one back home yet knew what he had
done.

<P>
   ``It's night time back there and my family is sleeping,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Olympic Games are shown via delayed telecast, he said
he wouldn't try contacting them until much later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to be surprised by their son,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   And when he returned to the Athlete's Village, Moussambani got a
surprise of his own. In the window of his room, someone had put up
a big sign.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``Home of Eric the Swimmer.''

 &HT;    Tripped breaker? It's a warning about your home's electrical
system
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know what to do when a fuse blows or a circuit breaker
trips: Turn some things off, unplug a few things, then put in a new
fuse or reset the circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
   But you're not doing yourself any favors if everything you
disconnected ends up back on the same circuit a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   A blown fuse or tripped breaker is a warning: Something you're
doing with your electrical system is wrong, and you need to correct
it.
</P>
<P>
   A circuit is all of the electrical outlets or fixtures connected
to one fuse or circuit breaker. Usually, a circuit will supply
power to one or two rooms or to one or two major appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Home circuits for your lights, television and other small
appliances are 120-volt circuits. Circuits for large appliances
such as clothes dryers generally carry twice as much power at 240
volts.
</P>
<P>
   Each circuit in your house is rated to carry a certain number of
amps, short for amperes or amperage, a measure of the current flow
used by an electrical device. Each fuse in your fuse box and each
circuit breaker switch is marked with a number indicating the
number of amps allowed on the circuit it controls.
</P>
<P>
   Most devices have an amp rating printed on them, usually
somewhere in the back where the power cord is attached. Small
motors _ such as can openers, fans, vacuum cleaners _ usually pull
about one to three amps. Things that heat up _ water heaters,
ranges, hot plates, heaters _ tend to draw in the 10- to 40-amp
range.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, like amps, indicate current flow. The number of watts a
device uses is equal to the voltage of the circuit multiplied by
the amps of the device. In other words, a three-amp motor on a
120-volt circuit uses 360 watts of power.
</P>
<P>
   To keep circuits from being overloaded, you have to make sure
that the total number of amps demanded by the things plugged into
the circuit don't exceed the maximum number printed on the fuse or
circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
   An overloaded circuit generates heat, and that makes it a fire
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The first step to managing circuit loads is know which circuit
controls every electric outlet, every ceiling light and every other
electric device in your house.
</P>
<P>
   If you look inside the service panel, the box that holds the
fuses or circuit breakers, you'll find a circuit list. But in many
cases the list is vague and incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't done so before, do a complete survey of each room
in your house to check which outlets are on each circuit and make a
circuit map.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, one person carries a floor plan with the outlets and
switches marked for each room. A second person stands at the
service panel to remove fuses or turn circuit breakers off. Mark
each outlet location on the floor plan with the number of the fuse
or circuit breaker that controls its circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Keep one copy of the circuit map near the service panel and
another with your appliance warranties and other important papers.
</P>
<P>
   Use the map to plan the arrangement of electrical devices around
your house. For example, don't try to use a 10-amp portable heater
and a 7-amp trash compactor on the same 15-amp circuit at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   You should also be aware of which outlets in your house are
grounded, and which are not. Modern homes have electric outlets
with three holes; in grounded circuits, the third prong on an
appliance cord goes into the third hole on the outlet and hooks up
with a path for electricity to be sent safely into the ground in
case of a break in the normal electrical flow. The ground wire
reduces the chance of dangerous electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy an appliance with a three-prong plug, you can get it
to work in a two-prong outlet by attaching an adapter, but
utility-company officials say that could be dangerous because
you're defeating the shock protection.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not every receptacle with three prongs is truly grounded.
You can buy inexpensive circuit testers at home-improvement stores
to test the grounding of your outlets.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a device, such as a computer, that needs a grounded
outlet, a qualified electrician can add one where it's required.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,
problems in home wiring, such as arcing and sparking, are
associated with more than 40,000 home fires each year. These fires
annually claim more than 350 lives and injure 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   A new electrical safety device for homes, called an arc fault
circuit interrupter or AFCI, reduces the risk of arcing and will be
required in the bedrooms of newly constructed homes in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission says typical household fuses and circuit
breakers don't respond to early arcing and sparking conditions in
home wiring. By the time a fuse or circuit breaker opens a circuit
to cut power to an arcing wire, a fire might already have begun.
</P>
<P>
   AFCIs are different from ground fault circuit interrupters.
Ground fault interrupters are installed as power outlets
particularly near water sources, and they protect people from
electrical shocks. AFCIs are installed in service panels to prevent
fires.
</P>
<P>
   AFCIs can be installed in any 15- or 20-ampere branch circuit in
homes today and are currently available as circuit breakers with
built-in AFCI features. In the near future, other types of devices
with AFCI protection will be available, the safety commission says.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in arc fault circuit interrupters, contact
an electrician. Installing them is not a do-it-yourself project.

San Diego's secrets revealed

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Some of Balboa Park's most impressive treasures lie
indoors _ the place is a museum crawler's nirvana. Some of the
highlights of exhibits that will continue for the next several
weeks include:
</P>
<P>
   __ An exhibit at the San Diego Museum of Man showcases the work
of three artists who were inspired by ancient pottery found near
the village of Mata Ortiz in Chihuahua, Mexico. One of the artists,
Maria Martinez, was brought to Balboa Park for the 1915 expo to
craft her distinctive, black-on-black pottery. The exhibit runs
through mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   __ There is a clever array of made-for-children science exhibits
at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center. On loan from the
Exploratorium in San Francisco, it uses echo tubes, listening
vessels and giant guitar strings to make various scientific
principles interesting. It runs through June. Also at the science
center is an IMAX movie that explores the world of dolphins,
accompanied by a soundtrack that features Sting (through October).
</P>
<P>
   __ Artes de Mexico, at the Mingei International Museum, features
dance masks, baskets and burnished-clay water vessels and
figurines. Some of the work of famed potter Teodora Blanco of
Oaxaca, Mexico, is on display. The exhibit runs through December.
</P>
<P>
   -- Women aviators are celebrated at the San Diego Aerospace
Museum, an exhibit that chronicles such pioneers as commercial
pilot Helen Richey, military pilot Barbara Rainey, and, of course,
Amelia Earhart _ including an examination on her ill-fated attempt
to circumnavigate the globe in 1937. It runs for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another current exhibit seems to be enjoying a perverse
popularity. It is titled ``Inquisition: Torture and Intolerance''
and runs through November at the Museum of Man. We had to walk past
a dreadful-looking guillotine on display outside, but otherwise had
no desire to look over implements of sadism from the 15th, 16th and
17th centuries, when Europe was practicing religious conversion by
terror.

POSTCARDS FROM THE PARK
</HEADLINE>
  There's always something to do in picturesque Southern California 
(For use by New York Times Wire Service clients) 
(Eds: With sidebar, `Museums.' Fact box below.)

IF YOU GO 
GETTING THERE: Balboa Park is northeast of downtown San Diego,
about 130 miles from Los Angeles. The freeway exits to the park are
well-marked off the 5 and 163 routes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   COSTS: There is no charge to enter or park in Balboa Park. Most
of the park's museums have admission charges, but passports are a
great value. For $25, you get a coupon book that permits one
entrance to each of 12 museums and is good for one week.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: For general information on the park (or on the
museum passport), contact the visitors center at (619) 239-0512.
Web: www.balboapark.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ It was slapped together for a lark, constructed of
cheap lath and chicken wire, with plaster slopped on. It was never
intended to last more than a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the years slipped past _ 85 of them, to be precise. The
cluster of ornate Spanish Colonial Revival buildings at the heart
of San Diego's Balboa Park came to grow on the city and its
inhabitants. And now it has gained a distinct sense of permanence _
refurbished, retrofitted and irretrievably here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is the soul of a sprawling, 1,200-acre urban park
just northeast of downtown, and has proven to be a powerful lure
for residents and visitors. Amidst its grounds, you'll find a
cavernous organ pavilion, a vintage merry-go-round, more than a
dozen museums, a botanical garden in an enormous redwood cage, a
stylish new restaurant and an open-air theater partial to (and
fiercely faithful to) the works of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In most cities, this would probably be more than enough to reel
in the tourists. But Balboa Park has other, more subtle attributes.
</P>
<P>
   For a park in the middle of a metropolis, it is remarkably
soothing. There seem to be fountains everywhere _ spectacular ones
that send 60-foot gushers into the air, simple ones that gurgle
quietly in the middle of an out-of-the-way garden or plaza. The
Spanish architecture, meanwhile, features broad, shady arcades
along the fronts of buildings _ ideal for casual strolling.
</P>
<P>
   People come for the museum exhibits, organ concerts, perhaps a
patio lunch, but you also notice a great number of visitors setting
up lawn chairs or spreading a blanket beneath a shady tree for no
particular purpose. They seem content to sit, do nothing, perhaps
read or nap, and simply savor the place.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? It is a park of postcard images. This close to San
Diego Bay (a little more than a mile, as the gull flies), the sky
tends to be bright blue after the morning marine layer lifts, often
accented with delicate wisps of clouds. Pause during a visit and
gaze off in any direction; you're likely to see sandcastle-like
towers jutting out of a leafy canopy of eucalyptus trees, set off
by that sky. Or a fountain framed by a dramatic archway.
</P>
<P>
   The clock chimes in the venerable California Tower sound the
quarter hours, and sometimes gong out a hymn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my job, I'm always looking for glitches or something that's
not right,'' said city park ranger Kim Duclo, a 37-year resident of
San Diego, ``but every once in awhile, you stop for a moment and
look at it with fresh eyes and realize what a spectacularly
beautiful place it is. Especially very early in the morning, or on
a walk down the prado late, late at night, I find that it's still
magical for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Balboa Park was established in 1868, but in arid, pre-aqueduct
California, it was a park in name only. Horticulturist Kate O.
Sessions began planting trees on the parched expanse just before
the turn of the century. Then came the event that would, quite
unintentionally, establish its identity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, local businessmen chose Balboa Park as the site for the
Panama-California Exposition, an event to celebrate the completion
of a canal that would have a profound impact on the commerce of
this state. A number of exhibit halls were thrown up, but only a
couple of the structures were intended to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, before the temporary buildings could be torn down,
the U.S. military, in need of some work space (there was a war on),
moved in, then didn't seem to be in any rush to leave. And the city
started getting used to the look of the place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, San Diego decided to hold another expo in the park.
Some of the existing buildings were refurbished. A number of others
_ more permanent this time _ were added.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in recent years, a systematic project was undertaken to
remake the remaining Hollywood-set-like structures into something
more lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Builders, while being true to the Spanish Colonial Revival
design, in some cases opted for fiberglass rather than constructing
imposing edifices of concrete or adobe. The ornate facades were
assembled like jigsaw puzzles, such that if you approach an
impressive-looking pillar at the front of the Casa de Balboa and
rap on it with your knuckles, you might be startled to find that it
rings hollow. Given the history of the complex, though, it seems
strangely fitting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more compelling aspects of Balboa Park is the
compactness of its central gathering place. In most cities (Los
Angeles included), museums, gardens, cultural sites and performance
venues are scattered all over town. Here, a great number of these
are clustered in an area about a half-mile square.
</P>
<P>
   The drawbacks of the park might be predictable for a place
mapped out at a time when a transcontinental phone call was big
news. There is a rather serious shortage of rest rooms, such that
chemical toilets dot the landscape like sentries. And the few
parking areas can quickly get overwhelmed, particularly on
weekends. (The San Diego Zoo abuts the central complex to the north
and can put quite a squeeze on parking spaces).
</P>
<P>
   There is a free tram, however, that operates from parking lots
at the south end of the park (intersection of Park Boulevard and
President's Way, convenient to both the 5 and 163 freeways).
</P>
<P>
   Free, one-hour tours of the park's heart, led by city park
rangers, are offered at 1 p.m. on Tuesdays and Sundays (they meet
at the visitors center in the House of Hospitality). If you're
fortunate enough to draw Duclo as your guide, you'll be treated to
architectural and horticultural information richly interlaced with
humor, as well as a few playful tales about the park's quirky
history.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fun to explore independently.
</P>
<P>
   The Lily Pond, which stretches out between the bird-cage-like
Botanical Building and the House of Hospitality, has a lively
history. Over the years, it has been home to various creatures,
some introduced to the pond (turtles, koi fish), some of which
found it naturally (migrating mallard ducks that decided they no
longer needed to migrate).
</P>
<P>
   Duclo explained that two great blue herons used to perch high
atop the Botanical Building as baby ducks scampered around the
edges of the pool _ ``almost always,'' he said, ``when several
groups of school girls would be here eating their lunches.'' The
herons would occasionally swoop down on the scene for lunches of
koi or duckling, sometimes not making a clean grab, an event that
would trigger a wave of squealing horror among the visitors. Homes
have since been found for the pond's various critters.
</P>
<P>
   The Spreckels Organ Pavilion is another park oddity. It and its
massive pipe organ _ the largest such outdoor organ in the world _
were donated to Balboa Park by sugar magnates John D. and Adolph
Spreckels at the start of the 1915 expo, on one condition: that a
free public organ concert be held every Sunday in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   It may have played well in the days before CDs, electric guitars
and John Williams, but it was clear on a recent visit that French
symphonic music blasted through the instrument's 4,518 pipes is a
decidedly acquired taste. It seemed a lot of visitors sat and
listened for only a few minutes before slipping out en route to
another attraction. At least civic organist Robert Plimpton
revealed the impressive organ in all its glory _ even drowning out
jumbo jets on approach to nearby San Diego International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Another throwback feature of the park is the Carousel, a 1910
relic that retains its original, hand-carved menagerie and a
calliope that belts out military band music. It even allows riders
on the outside row of animals to grab for the brass ring, which
extends from an overhanging arm; if you snatch it, you get to ride
again free.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds of the park are lush, having been planted with
thousands of trees and shrubs. The Parker Rose Garden is worth a
visit, particularly in spring and summer, as it boasts 2,406 rose
bushes of 190 varieties. Not surprisingly, it is a popular site for
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain in the Plaza de Balboa is also impressive, and on
blistering days attracts a lot of little ones in bathing suits.
There seems to be no definable pattern to the fountain _ until you
learn that the height of its spout is governed by a wind sensor; it
will soar to 60 feet in dead calm.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to work up an appetite in a park such as
this, and the culinary choices cover a wide range. Ethnic food is
served up each Sunday at the International Cottages, with a
different country featured every week (Ecuadorean empanadas,
anyone?). Hot-dog stands at various points in the park can provide
quick snacks.
</P>
<P>
   For finer dining, it's hard to beat The Prado, which opened
early this year in a wing of the House of Hospitality. Its
offerings are described as Latin-Italian fusion _ skirt-steak tacos
and crab quesadillas alongside panini sandwiches and ziti with
roasted red peppers.
</P>
<P>
   One of The Prado's noteworthy features is its variety of seating
areas. You can dine indoors, or on a kind of sun porch, or beneath
an umbrella or arbor on an outdoor patio. Or, when they're busy
(and they often have a waiting list at lunch), it's a snap to make
a light meal of appetizers and sandwiches in the airy bar.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is an excellent option for people attending an
evening play at the Old Globe Theatre, which is steps away across
the Plaza de Panama. But heed this warning: If you've allowed
plenty of time for dinner before the play, don't inform the server
of your evening's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Our waitress thought she'd do us a big favor by turning in our
main- course order early. We were not two bites into an elaborate
platter of bruschetta, barely one sip into our bottle of Seghesio
pinot noir, when the entrees suddenly arrived. It was 6:50 p.m.,
and curtain wasn't until 8.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a considerable disappointment, the entrees
getting cold as we tried to linger over the bruschetta, the olive
tapanade utterly overpowering a steamed seabass and even a pork
prime rib when we tried to eat both courses simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   This might be a recurrent issue at the restaurant. The next day,
at lunch in the bar, our main courses were delivered seconds after
the soup arrived. But in three visits to The Prado over as many
days, the food, drink and setting _ particularly the garden-rimmed
patio _ were found to be exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   As a Sunday evening fell, the show went on at the Old Globe.
There are three stages here, but the open-air festival theater is
particularly inviting in the warmth of summer and early fall.
Currently showing, through Oct. 14, is Euripides' ``The Trojan
Women.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater is intimate (612 seats) and simple, with the
stage-light rigging suspended from rough, telephone-pole-like
timbers.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of the airport and the wild animals of the
adjacent zoo can introduce sounds wholly incongruous with ancient
Greece, but the experience is nonetheless memorable, as the dark
silhouettes of towering eucalyptus trees frame the stage and the
cool ocean air settles in.
</P>
<P>
   The boosters of the Panama-California Exposition may not have
envisioned this kind of ambiance _ much less the permanence and
popularity of Balboa Park's central complex _ when they set about
putting on a simple fair 85 years ago. But they obviously picked
the site well.
</P>
<P>
   And once the buildings, the walkways, the fountains and the
gardens went in, San Diego and its visitors were simply in no hurry
to let go. &QL;

 (ATTN: Minn., the Netherlands, Cuba, SKorea)   By BILL PENNINGTON

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The U.S. Olympic baseball team, many of them
unheralded minor leaguers and major league castoffs, knows that
they are no one's idea of a Dream Team. They might call themselves
Olympic baseball's little-known secret.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, winning with drama and defense, is undefeated
after four games of the Olympic baseball tournament, and the mighty
Cubans, losers Wednesday to the Netherlands, are not.
</P>
<P>
   The medal round in baseball is still a week away, and Cuba is
still favored. But after another climactic late-inning victory
Wednesday, the Americans are enjoying a spotlight they did not
foresee and gathering self-esteem in the wake of their engaging
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hero for the United States was first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz, a Minnesota Twins farmhand who hit a towering,
two-out eighth-inning grand slam that turned a scoreless game into
a 4-0 U.S. victory over South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For Mientkiewicz, who played all of 1999 with the Twins, it was
his biggest swing since he hit a home run at Yankee Stadium off
David Cone last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it wasn't a big hit because it didn't win the game, but
it was my biggest relief,'' Mientkiewicz said of the home run off
Cone. He was in a deep slump at the time. ``I couldn't believe I
got a hit, I was running around the bases like a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Mientkiewicz, 26, behaved with more
aplomb Wednesday. He even stood in the batter's box to watch his
home run, then flipped his bat and raised his left index finger
before circling the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I probably overdid it,'' said Mientkiewicz, who played
this season with the Twins' Class AAA affiliate in Salt Lake City.
``But when it's the biggest hit of your life, I really don't
care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. team seems to thrive in these emotional games, and the
Americans have already had a couple. Mientkiewicz, in fact, said he
was emulating his teammate Mike Neill with his batter's box
finger-waving. Neill won the opening game against Japan with a
13th-inning two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are careful not to boast about their chances and
have little to say about the Cubans, whom they will play in a
preliminary round game Saturday. But the U.S. team likes its
chances and seems to be relishing the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say we're a rag-tag group or whatever,'' outfielder
Ernie Young said. ``We know we've got a lot of talent. And most of
all, we've been playing like a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven shutout innings by the starting pitcher Roy Oswalt and
spectacular fielding by shortstop Adam Everett and third baseman
Mike Kinkade kept the United States in the game. South Korea, with
several players from their professional league, left 11 runners on
base and squandered several chances to score.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has lost three of four games and been a
disappointment, but as the U.S. catcher Pat Borders said, ``They
have a bunch of guys you could put in a major league uniform and
they wouldn't embarrass themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders, the most valuable player of the 1992 World Series when
he was with the Toronto Blue Jays, is the eldest on the American
team at 37. Borders, who spent most of this year playing for the
Durham Bulls in North Carolina, epitomizes the team's enthusiasm
for the Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was going to be fun, but it's been much more
than that,'' Borders said. ``I'm so glad I'm here. I get nervous
before the games, nervous in the games, and as a player you like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressful in a different way than playing in the major
leagues. You don't want to make a big mistake and know you've cost
your country a game. That's pretty important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders said there was a form sent around in April, asking
players if they were interested in playing for the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I filled it out, sent it back and never thought about it
again,'' Borders said. ``When they called, I was surprised. I knew
I wanted to go, but my wife never gave me a choice anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said: `Pat, you're going. That's it.' I'm so glad I did. I
love just walking around the Olympic Village and hearing all the
different languages and seeing the different clothes. It's a great
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our team's playing pretty good, too,'' he added.  &QL;

   Defeat crushing for favored Shipley
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Tierney
</P>
<P>
   c. 200 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia - Head down, Scott Shipley gently paddled his
bright blue kayak with yellow swirling stripes to a low wall of
rocks beyond the finish line. He propped himself, sat and stared
vacantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new leader _ Scott Shipley,'' the P.A. announcer's
voice rang out Wednesday at Penrith Whitewater Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley knew better. Five kayaks, all ahead of him after the
first leg of the slalom finals, had yet to run. One by one, they
passed him. One by one, with a single exception, he dropped a
notch.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth in the Olympics. Respectable, but crushingly below the
goal of the Atlantan, 29, who regularly goes home to his apartment
on the Chattahoochee River with World Cup awards stuffed in his
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was Thomas Schmidt of Germany first. Paul Ratcliffe of
Great Britain second. Pierpaolo Ferrazzi of Italy third. Shipley
had beaten them all, and often.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley had craved an Olympic medal after a 27th in 1992 and a
12th in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he knows it's time to move to another life phase. To
complete his Georgia Tech requirements in mechanical engineering, a
quest that began a decade ago. To stop living out of a backpack and
settle down.
</P>
<P>
   The hurt was evident. Normally, his answers to interviewers'
questions can run sermon-length. Here are today's sound bites:
</P>
<P>
   Why did you stay long in the finish-line pool?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wanted to see who would win.''
</P>
<P>
   Were you nervous, coming off the past two Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Felt good warming up.''
</P>
<P>
   What about touching the gate, which cost you two penalty points?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubbin's racing.''
</P>
<P>
   How important were these Games?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Will you continue competing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go back and re-evaluate things.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Athens in 2004?
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably my last Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began promisingly under a glistening sun at the ultimate
water park, a manmade venue of roaring waters directed by plastic
cylinders and fake boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley zig-zagged the opening third of his first run faster
than anyone. But he got bogged down in the middle. His shoulder
brushed the 16th of 23 gates when he cut it too narrowly, and he
stood sixth afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He touched nothing but air on his second run but went nearly
three seconds slower than the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got stuck around gate 15 and left time there,'' he said.
``That was the easiest part of the course, and I lost time on it
both runs.''

 &HT;    U.S. track and field stars await shot at spotlight
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Maurice Greene is talking world record. So is the man
of the golden shoes, Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The diva who would rule the track, Marion Jones, is cooly eyeing
five _ gold medals, that is. While the Aussie's new favorite
daughter, Cathy Freeman, is in the spotlight to bring home the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam Nelson, the Ivy League shot putter, is determined to
prove his summer's meteoric rise isn't a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   As the track and field competition begins Friday, the marquee
names of the sport immediately step on center stage in opening
round races. Greene and Jones each have two rounds of the 100
meters, followed by the semis and finals Saturday. Johnson and
Freeman, who faces an eventual showdown with tempermental French
star Marie Jose-Perec, go to the start line in the first of four
daily races over 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The wait won't be so painfully long for Nelson, with shot put
qualifying Friday morning and the final later that night in the
110,000-seat Olympic Stadium. No complaint from Nelson who four
years ago was last at the Olympic trials. After emerging as the
world's top thrower this season, the Dartmouth College grad is
favored for gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great summer, so I'm very confident going into this
meet,'' Nelson said. ``I'm just here to do what I need to do _
throw far.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the NBC cameras will capture the stories of the great
international stars on a nightly basis. Telling, for instance, of
the quest by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj _ who sadly fell in
Atlanta _ for 1,500-meter gold and the distance-double attempt by
Gabriela Szabo of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   For the athletes, this is their Super Bowl and World Series
wrapped into one. Some track stars earn annual salaries in six
figures, but an Olympic medal is still what stamps their greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing brings out the best in me like the Olympics,''
Johnson said. ``When you win the Olympics, you can say `I beat the
best at their best.'''
</P>
<P>
   But of the some 10,000 athletes competing in the 27th summer
Olympics, none steps onto the track here with greater expectations
or a more daunting workload than Jones. Nor more primed for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old has brashly staked her claim on five gold
medals, a feat that has never been seriously attempted. If she
claims gold in her first two events _ and she surely should in the
100 and 200 _ then her quest to keep her dream alive figures to
evolve into a nightly mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really tired of talking about it now,'' Jones said of the
buildup. ``I think all the athletes in general are getting that
sentiment. We just want all this to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Southern California, Jones caught the Olympic bug
watching the 1984 Los Angeles Games. It was then that she wrote on
her chalkboard: I want to be an Olympic champion. The chance is
here for that and more.

 &HT;    U.S. softball team on ropes after another loss
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, New South Wales, Australia - Here on the outskirts of
metropolitan Sydney, near a major amusement park called Wonderland,
the once invincible USA softball team has vanished, just like the
fictional Alice, down a deep, dark hole.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as an abandoned diamond mine, if you like, or the
Black Hole of Blacktown. Call into it the names of America's
stirring 1996 gold medal team _ Dot Richardson, Lisa Fernandez,
Michele Smith and the rest _ but don't expect much of a response.
The way things are going, Wednesday's 14-inning loss to China
included, there's not enough energy to send an echo back to the
sunlit surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we've opened up a can of worms,'' said Fernandez, ``
as far as teams thinking they have an opportunity to shut us
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, identified in Olympic previews as Team USA's toughest
rival, gets the next shot today. It is a dangerous time for the
American women, who are dealing with the devastation of a two-game
losing streak after running off 112 victories in a row. There still
should be a place in the semifinals, this 2-2 start far from fatal
in a round-robin format, but is there anything truly certain
anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Smith launched 185 pitches in Wednesday's 2-0 loss to China, a
doubleheader of a defeat considering world-class softball games are
supposed to be settled in seven innings. She struck out 19 Chinese
batters and allowed just two hits, one by the game's opening hitter
and another with two outs in the 14th. Smitty was Nolan Ryan at
twilight, Gary Cooper at high noon, and yet all she's got to show
for it is a left arm encased in ice and the surreal memory of
automatic sprinklers chasing her weary teammates around in the
outfield just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One more soaking for Team USA, that's what it was. One more rude
surprise for a dynamic power-hitting team that's scored just one
run in the past 27 innings during epic losses to Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm drained,'' said Smith, beaten in the end by a sharp
grounder that cracked off her leg and was handled badly on the
carom by second baseman Jennifer McFalls. ``I felt good about my
performance, keeping our team in position to win the game. Every
time I walked off the field, I believed it was the last inning.
Emotionally, when the game was over, I was just stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for China pitcher Yanqing Zhang, who struck out 16 and
went the whole, dastardly distance, too. This isn't your back-yard
brand of slow-pitch softball, remember, but a spring-loaded game in
which the ball is submarined toward the plate at speeds approaching
70 mph. Batters swing at some pitches and flinch at others, but
always there is the idea that somebody will get enough aluminum on
that big grapefruit of a ball to knock down the walls and maybe
even the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Team USA rallies now to win another gold, the nightmare
of these past two days will never be explained. The loss to Japan
took 11 innings, longer than any game in the brief history of
Olympic softball.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the great stall of China, trumping the fresh record by
three innings. If not for the rule that calls for each team to
begin the 10th inning and all innings thereafter with a baserunner
on second, coach Ralph Raymond might still be planted in that
chilly dugout, wondering if Fernandez, his No. 3 hitter, is ever
going to get a hit. Now 0-for-18 in
</P>
<P>
   the tournament, she will try to make a difference on the mound
today against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we would go into a slump as an entire team,''
said Raymond, who had just 12 hours to get his girls ready for
another, bigger game. ``It's very hard to believe. It just doesn't
seem as if it's the same ballclub as we saw even one week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, a drive like the one Stacey Nuveman hit in the 13th
inning Wednesday would have stayed fair. The line drive Leah
O'Brien-Amico hit to center in the 10th would have dropped in for a
game-winning hit instead of being caught and turned into a double
play. Christie Ambrosi would have gotten a hand on home plate in
the 11th rather than getting tagged out trying to score from third
on a wild pitch.

   ``Nothing's coming easy, but anything worth winning is worth
fighting for. That's what we're going to have to do to win the
Olympics,''
</P>

   said Fernandez.

LED BY ARTISTIC PASSION, JANET COLLINS BROKE THE COLOR BARRIER IN
DANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Janet Collins, ballerina and modern dancer,
accomplished the most beautiful turn, the most graceful pirouette,
the most stunning spin that shook up the dance world and left it
forever changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, she became the first African-American prima ballerina
at the Metropolitan Opera, leaping the color barrier as if it
didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 83, Collins is newly arrived in Arlington, drawn to
Texas to be near relatives in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ballet Arlington will pay special tribute to a
woman who helped change prejudices gradually, one pirouette at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in between the first and last acts of her own
ballet is a triumph of the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says she was born in March 1917 with the talent that
took her to the top. She was a natural, a girl who grew up playing
under California palms, swaying with the rhythm of the fronds in
the breeze. She had high arches, strong legs and an artistic sense
so strong she not only mastered modern dance and ballet, but also
painted in oils.
</P>
<P>
   She had no role models. ``There were no African-American dancers
when I was growing up,'' at least none given center stage, Collins
says.
</P>
<P>
   She loved the movement, the way she could express herself
without speaking. But in 1930s Los Angeles, the young,
dusky-skinned beauty was turned away from whites-only dance
studios. ``Sorry, all full,'' they'd tell her. ``Sorry, no room in
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The petite dancer, 5-feet 2-inches tall, strong and graceful in
spirit and body, turned to a private tutor. Collins excelled under
the one-on-one guidance, as she might not have in a class where she
was unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   She successfully auditioned for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo
when she was 15, only to turn down the chance when she was told
she'd have to powder herself white to match the other dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and her father, a tailor, wanted her to study typing
or learn some other skill. She danced in Los Angeles, attended
junior college and art school. LA critics praised her, but Collins
says wide critical acclaim came only in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 she went to New York City, the heart of the dance world.
She was 32 years old.
</P>
<P>
   She taught at the School of American Ballet. Her first class had
50 male students, many with tuition paid by the GI Bill.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted a serious dance venue, not Broadway. She wanted to be
a concert dancer, a star with lengthy solos. Few dancers achieve
that. Her first role in New York was in the Broadway musical ``Out
of this World'' in 1950-51. She won the Donaldson Award for the
best dancer on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And then the break, the big one. The Metropolitan Opera hired
her as a solo ballerina, the first to perform at the Met. From
1951-54, she danced in four productions as prima ballerina. It was
challenging to interpret opera into dance, but she won cheers and
rave reviews dancing in ``Aida, Sampson and Delilah, Carmen,'' and
``La Gioconda.''
</P>
<P>
   The company toured during the off-season, and Collins was told
that she must stay behind because she was black and would not be
allowed to perform with white dancers in the South. She met up with
the company when it traveled north and performed in Bloomington,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collins says she was treated wonderfully at the Met.
Artists treated her well, she says, because they judged her on her
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she left the performance world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not spiritually fulfilled on the stage,'' says Collins,
a deeply religious Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   She had sought out the fulfillment. She had used her artistic
skill to design many of her costumes. She had used her intellectual
prowess to examine why she danced. Dancing is not about self, she
once wrote, but about seeking and communicating fundamental truths.
</P>
<P>
   So when she left the stage, she left to teach dance at the St.
Joseph School for the Deaf in the Bronx. Dancers and the deaf are
linked through their communication through movement, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Collins moved back to Los Angeles, where she taught
African-American dancers in Watts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, at age 57, she left the dance world. She moved to
Seattle to be near sisters and returned to one of her early arts.
She began painting again.
</P>
<P>
   Age does what it will, and in 1998 Collins had a toe amputated.
It had been damaged during her years in the hard-toed slippers that
dancers call point shoes, the shoes that allow them to balance on
the tips of their toes. She contracted pneumonia after she broke
her hip last year, and that was followed by two cataract surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother Ernest and sister-in-law, Linda, in Fort Worth moved
her to Texas in March. Collins has no children, although she was
briefly married.
</P>
<P>
   She is now ensconced in the Arlington New Beginnings home for
seniors, run by Mount Olive Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   She uses a walker or a wheelchair only when absolutely
necessary. She still paints, but she says she is tired and mostly
rests and reads the Bible. She occasionally turns to a book of
Emily Dickinson's poems and a biography of Mother Teresa, and to an
art project; she is painting portraits of Jesus' apostles. She has
also accepted a position on the Ballet Arlington board.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says her life has been a gift, a present that she
accepted gratefully, so gratefully that she never lingered over the
imperfect parts. If there were obstacles, and there were, she
couldn't see them. She was too busy dancing. &QL;

 &HT;    Federal sentences for two-bit players are out of proportion
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if Amy Pofahl did wrong, she didn't do 24 years worth of
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not clear that she did anything worth prison, much
less a decade of it.
</P>
<P>
   In July, after nearly 10 years behind bars, Pofahl was one of a
handful of drug offenders whose federal sentences were commuted by
President Clinton. Their freedom is a result of a campaign by
citizens concerned about sentencing overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahl, convicted in Waco in 1990 and sentenced on drug
conspiracy and money laundering charges, could be the syndrome's
poster figure. Her ex-husband, who was running an Ecstasy ring, cut
a deal that resulted in her facing federal charges for a peripheral
role, handling some of her then-spouse's money.
</P>
<P>
   He cooperated with authorities and got a six-year sentence,
serving four years.
</P>
<P>
   Believing herself innocent, she refused a plea bargain. She got
24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Key to her incredibly harsh penalty are the mandatory minimum
sentences built into the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Critics have
assailed it for treating small-time drug defendants as if they were
kingpins. Certainly that would be borne out by Pofahl's story.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory sentences are a mistake. Judges have complained about
the way mandatory minimum laws tie their hands. Even conservative
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist has urged a
re-examination of the law.
</P>
<P>
   America now has over 2 million people in prison. Of that,
roughly half are in on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of Pofahl and others should concern every American.
Few would dispute the need to put away the kingpins who profit the
most from illegal drug sales and the misery they produce. But
simply linking an individual to the drug trade should not be
sufficient to lock that person away indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for Clinton's intervention in her case, Pofahl would
have been required to serve 85 percent of her sentence _ 20 years
and five months _ before coming up for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Many rapists and armed assailants don't serve that long. But
then they aren't subject to get-tough federal mandatory minimum
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In May Congress held hearings on abolishing mandatory minimum
drug laws or limiting them by taking away the conspiracy charge as
a grounds for triggering them. Congress needs to reintroduce sanity
to drug sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   This nation must pull back from its pack-the-prisons approach to
drugs. First on the list should be to pull the plug on mandatory
minimums.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phenomenal growth of the U.S. economy springs
from the combined genius of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the way
Democrats tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, say Republicans, who award the Clinton-Gore team
zero credit for the nation's robust economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies in between.
</P>
<P>
   That should matter to voters trying to decide if Democrat Gore,
Clinton's vice president, should be the next president, or whether
it is time for new leaders and new policies, meaning Republican
George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, pollster Peter Hart found that 47 percent of
Americans surveyed would vote for ``continuity'' and exactly the
same percentage were ready to vote for ``change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the good times rolling'' is the gut message of the Gore
campaign. Bush says he can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who is in charge? The answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts believe that bad decisions by elected
leaders certainly can wreck an economy. But they also argue that no
administration can really be said to control or manage all the
complex and interrelated forces that build or destroy wealth,
create or erase jobs, and raise or lower living standards for
American families.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces include competition, interest rates, oil prices,
fiscal policy, work-force education and training, technological
innovation, capital formation, entrepreneurial enterprise, consumer
confidence, taxes and trends in global trade. And these are just
some of the factors that drive or impede the U.S. economy in
differing degrees, at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential authority over most of these factors is limited, at
best. Clinton may be entitled to substantial credit for things he
didn't do as well as things he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's dictum, `first, do no harm,' may be applied to
much of Clinton's economic policy,'' said Bruce A. Wallin, a
political science professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
``It has moderately contributed to economic expansion, and has not
done much to get in its way. A Republican president might have done
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   How? By prematurely cutting taxes, which probably would have led
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates, according to
Thomas A. Ferguson,a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really Alan Greenspan's economy, in Ferguson's view. ``It's
Greenspan who gets the credit,'' he said, referring to the Federal
Reserve Board chairman's manipulation of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wallin and Ferguson, like many other experts, say presidents get
more blame and more credit for performance of the economy than they
deserve. Wallin put it bluntly: ``Our current economic growth
likely would have happened no matter who was in office. Timing is
everything, and it may be better sometimes to be lucky than good.''
</P>
<P>
   When historians distribute credit for the current economy,
Wallin believes,a big share should go to a late leader of the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not Bill Clinton or Al Gore who gets credit, but more
appropriately Nikita Khrushchev who caused it by launching Sputnik,
and subsequently America, into a technological revolution,'' Wallin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an axiom of politics that success has a hundred fathers
and failure is an orphan. Other candidates for paternity of the
economic boom include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President George Bush, whose 1990 budget imposed limits
on spending and began a pay-as-you-go policy for entitlement and
revenue changes, as well as a tax increase that may have cost him
his job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ross Perot, for elevating deficit reduction as a key issue in
the 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican
Congress, whose ``Contract With America'' prodded Clinton to cut
deficits further.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President Ronald Reagan, whose anti-regulation,
anti-tax, pro-business administration coincided with the start of
an 18-year growth period interrupted only briefly by six months of
recession under Bush, and continuing through the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration gets a lot of credit for the 1993
budget, but it is inevitable that political leaders would like to
claim credit for things that come from the private economy,'' says
economist Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for
Economic Development, a nonpartisan group of business and education
leaders who study policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 budget, passed without the support of a single
Republican in Congress, was pivotal because with it, Clinton
postponed his election-year promise of a middle-class tax cut and
substituted a package of spending cuts and tax increases on
upper-income Americans to achieve deficit reductions. It was a
political risk, and many Democratic members of Congress paid the
price in elections the following year, when the Republicans seized
control of both House and Senate. But the economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration can certainly claim they had very
successful stewardship of the economy in the last eight years,''
Ooms said. ``On the other hand, one has to recognize that
stewardship happens on the edges of an economy that is basically
driven by the private sector. They had the capacity to screw things
up, and didn't, and should get credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats with White House experience acknowledge that
Clinton-Gore claims of responsibility for the economic good times
may be a bit inflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents don't literally manage the economy,'' said Jack
Watson, who served as White House chief of staff for Democrat Jimmy
Carter. ``They can calibrate the budget, and fiscal policy is
important to the success of the economy, but not determinative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economy doesn't run by itself, on automatic pilot.
``You've got to give the guy (Clinton) some credit for it,'' says
Bryan Jones, director of the Center for American Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jones points to Clinton's support for trade globalization and
deficit reduction as key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is good but Clinton was just as good,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Economics is hardly an exact science in which right and wrong
answers can be tested and determined in advance, and the
consequences of policy changes known with accuracy. What worked
yesterday may not work today.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Clinton's chief economic adviser,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are eternal truths in economic policy, but
that economic policies have to be adapted to circumstances,''
Summers recently told a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Summers thinks a lot more than luck was involved
in the economic growth spurt on Clinton's watch. He recalls the
bitter struggle with Republicans over Clinton's 1993
deficit-cutting budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, during the 1993 budget debate there were
people, like the president, who said this was crucial to turning
the economy around, and there were people like Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich who said it risked recession,'' Summers said. ``But there
was nobody who said it was inconsequential and it really wouldn't
be very important to the future of the outcome. So everybody
thought at the time that it was consequential, and things turned
out much better. That suggests that it was consequential.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't all Clinton-Gore brilliance at work,
Summers concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I like to think about it is that moving to the right
kinds of policy unlocked the energy that was there in the economy,
without which the deficits would have stifled that energy. That's
not to say that if you didn't have entrepreneurs, if you didn't
have information technology, there would have been success. Those
things were absolutely necessary for success. But for them to
succeed, you needed a change in the national policies that were in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supplied the change, Summers said, and it is impossible
to calibrate with precision how much of the resulting success was
due to the president, how much to Greenspan, how much to other
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to walk comfortably, I need both my right shoe and my
left shoe and it's sort of fruitless to try to define what fraction
of my comfort is due to my right shoe and what fraction of my
comfort is due to my left shoe, because both are necessary,''
Summers said. ``And that's the right way to think about the success
of the American economy.''

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: THE FRAGILE NATURE OF A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ First there was a twinge, then tightness,
then a screaming, hot pain. Finally, Inger Miller had to face the
moment of reckoning. She got down in the starting blocks last week
and tried to explode. She couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   How could fate be so cruel? Last Friday Miller told her coach,
John Smith, that she would have to give up her spot in the Olympic
100 meters. Train for four years, wait for four years, and it comes
down to this? Why here. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' Miller said Wednesday. ``These things
aren't in your hands, you're not in control of this kind of stuff.
That's what you have to contend with. And it's hard. You have these
goals set, you know what you're capable of doing, you see the
potential that you have. Then it doesn't come to fruition at the
pinnacle of your career or of your season and that's the Olympics.
It's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   She was left with the consolation of the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Some disappointments take place in a great spotlight, on center
stage. But most of the agony takes place in anonymous corridors of
Olympic venues:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman judo player writhed in agony in the hallway leading
from the arena to the dressing rooms. Her wrist appeared to be
broken and her shoulder was out of place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Karim Bare of Niger and Farkhod Oripov of Tajikistan came all
the way to Australia to swim in one race. One heat with three
competitors. On Tuesday they were disqualified for false starts.
The person who swam in that race _ Eric Moussambani of Equatorial
Guinea, who only began swimming competitively in January, barely
finished the race and became an Olympic folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   Here we see disappointments come in bunches: Two, three, four
times a day. We celebrate the highs but the reality is that there
are only three medals _ gold, silver and bronze. Everyone else is
left to lick wounds, take comfort from being an Olympian, from
coming close.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a U.S. sports week, disappointment comes and
goes. There's always the next game; there's usually a hefty check
to deaden the pain.
</P>
<P>
   For Olympians, however, the Games represent one chance that must
last until the next one rolls around in four years. And who knows
what will happen in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the fourth consecutive day I covered someone's
upset, someone's frustration, someone's dream that was supposed to
happen but did didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at the velodrome, Chris Witty attempted to become the
second Olympian ever to medal in the Summer and Winter Olympic
Games. She fell short.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Jimmy Pedro, the reigning world judo champion at 73
kilograms, was the favorite to win the first U.S. gold medal in the
sport. Pedro was knocked out of gold contention in his very first
match, then lost a chance for any medal at all. At the end of the
day, Pedro was in tears. Why here. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Jenny Thompson, so brilliant in relay races _ the
only women to win seven gold medals in swimming _ was also in
tears, after failing yet again to win her first individual medal.
She finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Now on Wednesday, Inger Miller had to pull out of the 100
meters. Why here? Why now?
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that Miller and Thompson offered a similar
remarks about their disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said, ``I have to remember that swimming is not most
important thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ``This is not the end of the world. It really is
not the end of the world. There's another Olympic Games and there's
world championships next year.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows how fragile an Olympic athlete's world is,
Maurice Greene does. Greene and Michael Johnson were primed for a
200-meter duel during the U.S. Olympic track trials. The race came
off but Greene and Johnson each sustained muscle pulls and failed
to qualify for the 200 here. On Wednesday in a crowded press
conference at the Sydney media center, Greene, the cocky 100-meter
sprinter, stood on a podium with Ato Boldon, Jon Drummond and
Curtis Johnson cracking jokes, making light of the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Johnson, who finished second to Greene in the 100 at the
trials, then distanced himself from the hijinks. He said that
Greene, for all of his talk, was affected by his adversity at the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   He said if you listened carefully to Greene, you would notice a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realizes that nothing is guaranteed,'' Johnson
said. ``That's why today he said, `We'll see,' as opposed to `I'm
going to do this, do that, whatever.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Miller said her father, the former Olympic sprinter
Lennox Miller, tried to find a way to comfort her. ``He said to me,
`I wish there was something I could say to you that would make it
all better.' But there isn't. I have to go through my own
disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty. Pedro. Thompson. Miller. They reinforce in dramatic ways
what we already know: Dreams are so fragile. They also make the
point that the key to surviving punctured hopes lies not so much in
keeping dreams from falling apart, but finding a way to put them
back together when they shatter.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Was a definitive conclusion ever reached on whether the plant
in Sudan bombed by the United States was making pharmaceuticals or
chemical weapons?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It remains a case of each country saying something
different. The United States bombed a pharmaceutical factory in
Khartoum in 1998 on the grounds that the factory had links with
Saudi-born Islamist Osama bin Laden and that it was preparing to
produce chemical weapons. Khartoum has maintained all along that
the plant manufactured only medicines and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States has launched a lobbying campaign to
stop Sudan from getting Africa's seat on the U.N. Security Council
next year, arguing that it is ``an unsuitable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States doesn't use the term ``rogue state'' any
longer for Sudan and some other countries, but has Sudan on its
list of ``state sponsors of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the Sydney Olympics mascots?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three: Millie, an echidna (spiny anteater); Olly, a
kookaburra (member of the kingfisher family); and Syd, a platypus.
Their names are derived from the words millennium, Olympics and
Sydney. Information online:
www.olympics.com/eng/about/mascots/home.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that comic legend Oliver Hardy is buried in
Georgia. Where is the site, and is it open to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is misinformation. Hardy, who died in 1957 at age 65
after a paralytic stroke, is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park in
Burbank, Calif. His gravesite, in the Garden of Hope at the second
wall to the right of Heritage Fountain, can be visited.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion probably stems from the fact that Hardy was born
in Columbia County, Georgia, in 1892. Although historians disagree
on his exact birthplace, Harlem, 16 miles west of Augusta, has a
state historical marker stating that he was born there. Hardy's
parents are buried in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the expression ``King's English''? Does it
refer to King James, or to any reigning monarch, which now would be
a queen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't refer to any particular monarch, and means simply
``proper English, English as it should be spoken.'' The idea may be
traced to the 14th century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, who
wrote, ``God save the king, that is lord of this language.''
Shakespeare also referred to it in ``The Merry Wives of Windsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the military draft start in the United States? Was
there one during World War II?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the United States, conscription dates to colonial times,
when the colonies drafted men to serve in their militias. During
the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy drafted men.
</P>
<P>
   There was a draft in both world wars, and others as well. During
World War I, the United States drafted about 2.7 million men. About
10.1 million men were drafted during World War II. About 1 1/2
million men were drafted at the time of the Korean War (1950-53),
and about 1 3/4 million men were drafted during America's heaviest
military involvement in the Vietnam War (1965-73).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, Wal-Mart encountered a legal problem. Its
stores in Canada were selling pajamas made in Cuba. This was
against U.S. laws dealing with Cuban trade. But if Wal-Mart pulled
the Cuba-made products from its Canadian stores, it would be
breaking Canadian laws. How was this resolved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dispute arose in 1997 after Wal-Mart pulled the
Cuban-made pajamas off its shelves to conform with a U.S. embargo
against Cuba. Wal-Mart's Canadian stores were involved because the
company is based in Arkansas and therefore falls under U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, meanwhile, is one of Cuba's top trading partners, and
when the U.S. Treasury Department considered sanctions against
Wal-Mart over this issue, Canada's Parliament retaliated by voting
to punish Canadian firms that comply with the U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   After a comprehensive review and discussions with legal advisers
and the Canadian government, Wal-Mart said it would resume selling
the Cuban-made pajamas at its Canadian stores, and nothing has been
heard about the issue since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What languages of the world are spoken by the most people as
their first, or ``native,'' language?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mandarin, spoken by 885 million people, ranks first,
according to The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000. It's is
followed by Hindi, 375 million; Spanish, 358 million; English, 347
million; Arabic, 211 million; Bengali, 210 million; Portuguese, 178
million; Russian, 165 million; Japanese, 125 million; German, 100
million; French, 77 million; Cantonese, 70 million; and
Malay-Indonesian, 58 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the purpose of the black strip in paper money? Can
metal detectors at airports detect the strips and tell how much
money a person has?
</P>
<P>
   A: The polymer strip is imbedded in bills and positioned in a
``unique spot'' as one of several measures to guard against
counterfeiting, says the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The
strip, or thread, which is visible when the bill is held up to a
bright light, contains microprinting: the letters USA, the
denomination, and on the $50 and $20 bills, a flag. When viewed
under ultraviolet light, the thread glows a distinctive color for
each denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The only purpose of the security threads is to deter
counterfeiting, according to the Treasury Department. They
``absolutely'' do not allow bills to be tracked, agency spokeswoman
Fran McDonald told Q&AMP;A. Since they're polyester, not metal, they
can't be detected by security or X-ray checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the members of the Commission on Presidential
Debates?
</P>
<P>
   A: The commission co-chairmen are Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. and Paul
Kirk Jr., former chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national
committees, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Directors are Clifford Alexander Jr., president of Alexander
Associates, a corporate consulting firm in Washington, and who was
secretary of the Army under President Carter; Howard Buffett,
president of GSI Group, an agricultural manufacturing company in
Assumption, Ill., and son of Warren Buffett; John Danforth, former
Republican senator from Missouri; Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.);
Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense
and Education Fund; Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; Newton Minow,
former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission; Paul
O'Neill, formerly with the White House Office of Management and
Budget; and Dorothy Ridings, foundation administrator and former
president of the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary co-chairmen are former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The court hearing for 17-year-old Albert Gore III for
speeding 97 miles an hour in a 55-mph zone was supposed to have
been held Sep. 13. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial, on two traffic charges, was postponed until after
the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to be tried in Currituck County, N.C., on
charges of speeding and reckless driving, but the cases were
continued until Nov. 22 at the request of William Brumsey III, his
attorney. Brumsey said the timing of Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid wasn't a factor in the delay. ``That has never
been discussed with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Brothers, deputy clerk of court in Currituck County, said
the postponement of a traffic case is routine and requires only the
agreement of the prosecutor. Everyone is allowed one continuance,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A defense memo said young Gore attends school in the Washington
area and a court date at the start of his Thanksgiving break would
reduce the loss of school time. The memo also said he doesn't deny
that there is a factual basis for the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Michael Conwell of the N.C. Highway Patrol arrested Gore
on Aug. 12 in the rural county near the Outer Banks, where he had
been vacationing with his family. In addition to speeding, Gore was
charged with operating a vehicle ``without due caution and
circumspection at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger persons
and property.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Has the United States abandoned its proposed switch to the
metric system?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It remains the ``preferred system'' of weights and
measures for U.S. trade and commerce, as established by Congress in
1988. But public acceptance remains limited.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the global market may force U.S. businesses to
make ever-greater use of metric units, in which case public
interest may pick up. But considering that a decimal measuring
system for the United States first was proposed in 1790 by
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and it still hasn't fully been
implemented, it's not likely to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the background of U.S. District Judge James Parker,
who scolded administration officials and apologized on behalf of
the nation in the Wen Ho Lee case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Parker, 63, was born in Houston. He earned a bachelor's
degree in mechanical engineering from Houston's Rice University in
1959, and a law degree in 1962 from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next several decades in private practice in
Albuquerque with New Mexico's largest law firm, Modrall, Sperling,
Roehl, Harris &AMP; Sisk, specializing in civil litigation,
particularly medical and legal malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was nominated for a federal judgeship on July 10, 1987,
by President Reagan, and was sworn in later that year. He took over
as chief judge of the federal district of New Mexico on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this month with the New York Times,
Parker said he was quite comfortable making even unpopular
decisions if he felt they were supported by a strict reading of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintenances and others familiar with Parker said he is known
for his fairness, patience and thoughtfulness. As quoted by The
Associated Press, New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Gene Franchini
said, ``I've always thought that Jim has a fine legal mind and a
good heart. . . . He's a courageous man, and it takes courage to be
a trial judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who still owns a ranch in Texas, is married and has a
son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm new to the Internet. When I send e-mail, I notice a
``Cc'' and a ``Bcc'' heading by the address. I have figured out
these are some sort of copies, but what do they stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are holdover terms from the days of typewriters. CC
(upper or lower case) indicates carbon copy; BCC, blind carbon
copy. A blind carbon copy bears no evidence that the original was
sent to anyone besides the person addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While I was on a trip recently, I crossed the longest bridge
I've ever seen on I-10, west of Baton Rouge, La. How long is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bridge is the Atchafalaya Floodway Crossing. It runs
through three parishes (counties) and is 17.9 miles long. Actually,
there's a longer Interstate-system bridge in Louisiana, the
LaPlace-Frenier section of I-10 and I-55 running through St. John
and Tangipahoa parishes. It's 23.08 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The longest over-the-water bridge in the world also is in
Louisiana, but isn't not part of the federal Interstate highway
system. It's the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway (23.87 miles), which
connects New Orleans to the north shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the times of day relate between Sydney, Australia, and
the East Coast of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sydney and the rest of New South Wales in eastern Australia
currently are 15 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast, with both
areas being on Daylight Saving Time. So when it's 10 a.m. EST in
the United States, it's 1 a.m. the following day in Sydney.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the chrome-plated trucks used in the opening
ceremonies of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A: They were sent to dealers around the country after the
``chrome'' _ actually a layer of aluminum foil _ was removed by
workers sent to Atlanta by GM.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Height seems to be a factor in presidential elections, with
the taller candidate usually winning. How tall are George W. Bush
and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A: We can't vouch for any correlation between a candidate's
height and winning or losing an election. But, for the record,
their respective campaign offices tell Q&AMP;A that Bush is 5 feet, 11
inches; Gore is 6 feet, 1 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Ecuador switching its national currency from
sucres to U.S. dollars said Ecuador was joining a number of other
countries in which the U.S. dollar is legal tender. What are those
other countries?
</P>
<P>
   A: The International Monetary Fund lists the countries (or
territories) as Panama, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia,
Palau, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the British Virgin Islands and
the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a Web site defining Australian terms such as
``billy''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here are several: www.koalanet.com/australian-slang.html;
www.ockersdinkum.co.uk/; and
www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Breakers/8092/slanga-f.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy,'' by the way, is Australian slang for a metal pan for
boiling water on an open fire (alternatively, billycan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent obituary stated that the person died of
complications of Lewy body dementia. What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dementia with Lewy bodies is a preferred term that describes
several common disorders causing dementia. In many hospitals this
is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The name comes from the presence of abnormal lumps, called Lewy
bodies, that develop inside nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Vice President Al Gore appeared on Oprah Winfrey's TV
show, he was asked his favorite quote. Can you print that?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``He not busy being born is busy dying'' (Bob Dylan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you reprint the address and rules for donating hair to
``Locks of Love''?
</P>
<P>

&HT;     LEVI CHIEF OPTIMISTIC AMID TOUGH TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Phil Marineau never said turning around Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. would be a quick patch job.
</P>
<P>
   But Marineau, as he approaches his first anniversary next week
as the chief executive of the San Francisco-based jeans maker, said
the company is actually ahead of schedule in his three-year plan to
put Levi Strauss back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to really stabilize the business anywhere
from nine to 12 months ahead of that plan,'' said Marineau, who
left his job as president of PepsiCo Inc.'s North American beverage
unit to run the troubled clothing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not claiming the turnaround has occurred yet. We said
all along this was a multiyear process,'' he said. ``The turnaround
is under way, but don't declare victory yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is declaring that victory based on the third-quarter
earnings the 147-year-old company reported Tuesday. The decline in
sales continues, this time falling 8 percent to $1.13 billion for
the quarter ended Aug. 27 from $1.23 billion for the same period a
year earlier. Net income dropped 31 percent to $37.8 million for
the quarter ended Aug. 27 from $55.2 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has had success in improving profitability and
reducing debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gross margins, which is profit made on each item sold, improved
to 41.2 percent from 39 percent a year earlier. The improved
margins reflected the manufacturing plants the apparel maker closed
in North America and western Europe and corresponding job cuts, as
well as some other cost reductions.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to 1999, Levi Strauss closed 29 plants in North
America and cut 18,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that says is your basic underlying profit margins are up
a couple of points relative to a year ago, which is exactly what we
were trying to do,'' Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sales declined in single digits when the company
still expected double-digit drops. Levi's classic five-pocket jeans
are responsible for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report was only the second time Levi Strauss has
released quarterly financial data since the company went private in
1985. But the company recently registered bonds with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, a move that requires the financial
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter results were complicated by some special
circumstances, the company said. For example, third-quarter
operating income was $105.8 million, down from $140.4 million for
the same quarter last year, because the company had to add $20
million in bonuses based on improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons with last year's third quarter were also skewed,
Marineau said, but bonuses were removed. ``Last year, we had such a
terrible year nobody was getting paid a bonus,'' he said. ``The
profits a year ago were artificially high because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Company debt fell from to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion on May
28 and $2.7 billion on Nov. 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This makes some analysts confident that Levi is heading in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook is far more promising than it has been for some
time,'' said Todd Slater, who covers specially retailers and
apparel for Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Levi's is making
meaningful strides in what I would character a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult time is what many in the apparel industry are
characterizing as a softening of the retail sector and increased
competition from many other jeans makers, including Tommy Hilfiger,
Calvin Klein and Nautica.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Gap Inc. has been struggling under faltering
sales and falling stock values, but Slater said that makes Levi's
improvement all the more real: ``It appears Levi's is improving
while Gap is heading in the opposite direction.''

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was a definitive conclusion ever reached on whether the plant
in Sudan bombed by the United States was making pharmaceuticals or
chemical weapons?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It remains a case of each country saying something
different. The United States bombed a pharmaceutical factory in
Khartoum in 1998 on the grounds that the factory had links with
Saudi-born Islamist Osama bin Laden and that it was preparing to
produce chemical weapons. Khartoum has maintained all along that
the plant manufactured only medicines and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States has launched a lobbying campaign to
stop Sudan from getting Africa's seat on the U.N. Security Council
next year, arguing that it is ``an unsuitable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States doesn't use the term ``rogue state'' any
longer for Sudan and some other countries, but has Sudan on its
list of ``state sponsors of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the Sydney Olympics mascots?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three: Millie, an echidna (spiny anteater); Olly, a
kookaburra (member of the kingfisher family); and Syd, a platypus.
Their names are derived from the words millennium, Olympics and
Sydney. Information online:
www.olympics.com/eng/about/mascots/home.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that comic legend Oliver Hardy is buried in
Georgia. Where is the site, and is it open to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is misinformation. Hardy, who died in 1957 at age 65
after a paralytic stroke, is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park in
Burbank, Calif. His gravesite, in the Garden of Hope at the second
wall to the right of Heritage Fountain, can be visited.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion probably stems from the fact that Hardy was born
in Columbia County, Georgia, in 1892. Although historians disagree
on his exact birthplace, Harlem, 16 miles west of Augusta, has a
state historical marker stating that he was born there. Hardy's
parents are buried in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the expression ``King's English''? Does it
refer to King James, or to any reigning monarch, which now would be
a queen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't refer to any particular monarch, and means simply
``proper English, English as it should be spoken.'' The idea may be
traced to the 14th century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, who
wrote, ``God save the king, that is lord of this language.''
Shakespeare also referred to it in ``The Merry Wives of Windsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the military draft start in the United States? Was
there one during World War II?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the United States, conscription dates to colonial times,
when the colonies drafted men to serve in their militias. During
the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy drafted men.
</P>
<P>
   There was a draft in both world wars, and others as well. During
World War I, the United States drafted about 2.7 million men. About
10.1 million men were drafted during World War II. About 1 1/2
million men were drafted at the time of the Korean War (1950-53),
and about 1 3/4 million men were drafted during America's heaviest
military involvement in the Vietnam War (1965-73).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, Wal-Mart encountered a legal problem. Its
stores in Canada were selling pajamas made in Cuba. This was
against U.S. laws dealing with Cuban trade. But if Wal-Mart pulled
the Cuba-made products from its Canadian stores, it would be
breaking Canadian laws. How was this resolved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dispute arose in 1997 after Wal-Mart pulled the
Cuban-made pajamas off its shelves to conform with a U.S. embargo
against Cuba. Wal-Mart's Canadian stores were involved because the
company is based in Arkansas and therefore falls under U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, meanwhile, is one of Cuba's top trading partners, and
when the U.S. Treasury Department considered sanctions against
Wal-Mart over this issue, Canada's Parliament retaliated by voting
to punish Canadian firms that comply with the U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   After a comprehensive review and discussions with legal advisers
and the Canadian government, Wal-Mart said it would resume selling
the Cuban-made pajamas at its Canadian stores, and nothing has been
heard about the issue since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What languages of the world are spoken by the most people as
their first, or ``native,'' language?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mandarin, spoken by 885 million people, ranks first,
according to The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000. It's is
followed by Hindi, 375 million; Spanish, 358 million; English, 347
million; Arabic, 211 million; Bengali, 210 million; Portuguese, 178
million; Russian, 165 million; Japanese, 125 million; German, 100
million; French, 77 million; Cantonese, 70 million; and
Malay-Indonesian, 58 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the purpose of the black strip in paper money? Can
metal detectors at airports detect the strips and tell how much
money a person has?
</P>
<P>
   A: The polymer strip is imbedded in bills and positioned in a
``unique spot'' as one of several measures to guard against
counterfeiting, says the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The
strip, or thread, which is visible when the bill is held up to a
bright light, contains microprinting: the letters USA, the
denomination, and on the $50 and $20 bills, a flag. When viewed
under ultraviolet light, the thread glows a distinctive color for
each denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The only purpose of the security threads is to deter
counterfeiting, according to the Treasury Department. They
``absolutely'' do not allow bills to be tracked, agency spokeswoman
Fran McDonald told Q&AMP;A. Since they're polyester, not metal, they
can't be detected by security or X-ray checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the members of the Commission on Presidential
Debates?
</P>
<P>
   A: The commission co-chairmen are Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. and Paul
Kirk Jr., former chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national
committees, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Directors are Clifford Alexander Jr., president of Alexander
Associates, a corporate consulting firm in Washington, and who was
secretary of the Army under President Carter; Howard Buffett,
president of GSI Group, an agricultural manufacturing company in
Assumption, Ill., and son of Warren Buffett; John Danforth, former
Republican senator from Missouri; Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.);
Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense
and Education Fund; Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; Newton Minow,
former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission; Paul
O'Neill, formerly with the White House Office of Management and
Budget; and Dorothy Ridings, foundation administrator and former
president of the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary co-chairmen are former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The court hearing for 17-year-old Albert Gore III for
speeding 97 miles an hour in a 55-mph zone was supposed to have
been held Sep. 13. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial, on two traffic charges, was postponed until after
the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to be tried in Currituck County, N.C., on
charges of speeding and reckless driving, but the cases were
continued until Nov. 22 at the request of William Brumsey III, his
attorney. Brumsey said the timing of Vice President Al Gore's
presidential bid wasn't a factor in the delay. ``That has never
been discussed with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Brothers, deputy clerk of court in Currituck County, said
the postponement of a traffic case is routine and requires only the
agreement of the prosecutor. Everyone is allowed one continuance,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A defense memo said young Gore attends school in the Washington
area and a court date at the start of his Thanksgiving break would
reduce the loss of school time. The memo also said he doesn't deny
that there is a factual basis for the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Michael Conwell of the N.C. Highway Patrol arrested Gore
on Aug. 12 in the rural county near the Outer Banks, where he had
been vacationing with his family. In addition to speeding, Gore was
charged with operating a vehicle ``without due caution and
circumspection at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger persons
and property.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Has the United States abandoned its proposed switch to the
metric system?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It remains the ``preferred system'' of weights and
measures for U.S. trade and commerce, as established by Congress in
1988. But public acceptance remains limited.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the global market may force U.S. businesses to
make ever-greater use of metric units, in which case public
interest may pick up. But considering that a decimal measuring
system for the United States first was proposed in 1790 by
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and it still hasn't fully been
implemented, it's not likely to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the background of U.S. District Judge James Parker,
who scolded administration officials and apologized on behalf of
the nation in the Wen Ho Lee case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Parker, 63, was born in Houston. He earned a bachelor's
degree in mechanical engineering from Houston's Rice University in
1959, and a law degree in 1962 from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next several decades in private practice in
Albuquerque with New Mexico's largest law firm, Modrall, Sperling,
Roehl, Harris &AMP; Sisk, specializing in civil litigation,
particularly medical and legal malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was nominated for a federal judgeship on July 10, 1987,
by President Reagan, and was sworn in later that year. He took over
as chief judge of the federal district of New Mexico on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this month with the New York Times,
Parker said he was quite comfortable making even unpopular
decisions if he felt they were supported by a strict reading of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintenances and others familiar with Parker said he is known
for his fairness, patience and thoughtfulness. As quoted by The
Associated Press, New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Gene Franchini
said, ``I've always thought that Jim has a fine legal mind and a
good heart. . . . He's a courageous man, and it takes courage to be
a trial judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who still owns a ranch in Texas, is married and has a
son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm new to the Internet. When I send e-mail, I notice a
``Cc'' and a ``Bcc'' heading by the address. I have figured out
these are some sort of copies, but what do they stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are holdover terms from the days of typewriters. CC
(upper or lower case) indicates carbon copy; BCC, blind carbon
copy. A blind carbon copy bears no evidence that the original was
sent to anyone besides the person addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While I was on a trip recently, I crossed the longest bridge
I've ever seen on I-10, west of Baton Rouge, La. How long is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bridge is the Atchafalaya Floodway Crossing. It runs
through three parishes (counties) and is 17.9 miles long. Actually,
there's a longer Interstate-system bridge in Louisiana, the
LaPlace-Frenier section of I-10 and I-55 running through St. John
and Tangipahoa parishes. It's 23.08 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The longest over-the-water bridge in the world also is in
Louisiana, but isn't not part of the federal Interstate highway
system. It's the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway (23.87 miles), which
connects New Orleans to the north shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the times of day relate between Sydney, Australia, and
the East Coast of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sydney and the rest of New South Wales in eastern Australia
currently are 15 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast, with both
areas being on Daylight Saving Time. So when it's 10 a.m. EST in
the United States, it's 1 a.m. the following day in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   To check the current time in Sydney online:

</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the chrome-plated trucks used in the opening
ceremonies of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A: They were sent to dealers around the country after the
``chrome'' _ actually a layer of aluminum foil _ was removed by
workers sent to Atlanta by GM.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Height seems to be a factor in presidential elections, with
the taller candidate usually winning. How tall are George W. Bush
and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A: We can't vouch for any correlation between a candidate's
height and winning or losing an election. But, for the record,
their respective campaign offices tell Q&AMP;A that Bush is 5 feet, 11
inches; Gore is 6 feet, 1 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Ecuador switching its national currency from
sucres to U.S. dollars said Ecuador was joining a number of other
countries in which the U.S. dollar is legal tender. What are those
other countries?
</P>
<P>
   A: The International Monetary Fund lists the countries (or
territories) as Panama, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia,
Palau, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the British Virgin Islands and
the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a Web site defining Australian terms such as
``billy''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here are several: www.koalanet.com/australian-slang.html;
www.ockersdinkum.co.uk/; and
www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Breakers/8092/slanga-f.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy,'' by the way, is Australian slang for a metal pan for
boiling water on an open fire (alternatively, billycan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent obituary stated that the person died of
complications of Lewy body dementia. What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dementia with Lewy bodies is a preferred term that describes
several common disorders causing dementia. In many hospitals this
is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The name comes from the presence of abnormal lumps, called Lewy
bodies, that develop inside nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Vice President Al Gore appeared on Oprah Winfrey's TV
show, he was asked his favorite quote. Can you print that?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``He not busy being born is busy dying'' (Bob Dylan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you reprint the address and rules for donating hair to
``Locks of Love''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Locks of Love is a not-for-profit organization that provides
hairpieces to financially disadvantaged children younger than 18
with medical hair loss.
</P>
<P>
   Donated hair must be at least 10 inches (preferably 12 inches)
long; bundled in a pony tail or braid; clean and dry, and free of
hair damaged by chemical processing; and mailed in a plastic bag
inside a padded envelope to Locks of Love, 1640 S. Congress Ave.,
Suite 104, Palm Springs, FL 33461.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My husband is planning to paint the outside of our two-story
house and he will have to use a tall extension ladder to reach the
higher places.
 &HT;    I am worried about him doing this, but he says that he will be
careful and knows how to use this ladder safely.
 &HT;    Can you give me some suggestions as to what precautions should
be taken when setting up such a ladder?
 &HT;    A: The ladder should be set up at the safest angle, which is 4:1
_ that is, the bottom of the ladder should be 1 foot away from the
base of the house wall for every 4 feet of ladder height.
 &HT;    In addition, make sure the ladder sits on a solid surface that
is relatively flat and level.
 &HT;    If the ladder must sit on soft soil or irregular ground, place a
wide, flat board under the ladder legs before setting it up.
 &HT;    To keep the legs from slipping off this board or shifting in any
way, drive a heavy stake into the ground behind the ladder and tie
the bottom of the ladder to this with a stout length of rope.
 &HT;    When climbing the ladder, he should use both hands to hold on
and keep his body between the rails at all times.
 &HT;    Instead of carrying paint or tools up with him, they should be
hauled up with a rope afterwards.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My 6-year-old kitchen counters are in relatively good
condition but in a few places the plastic laminate has lost its
shine.
 &HT;    I find that counter-top polishes tend to make the whole counter
shinier, so the contrast makes the dull spots look even more
noticeable.
 &HT;    What can you recommend?
 &HT;    A: The only suggestion I can offer is to apply a first coat of
the polish to the dull sections only, blending it in around the
edges so there is no noticeable difference with the unpolished
areas.
 &HT;    If this still looks duller than the rest of the surface apply a
second coat.
 &HT;    Then apply one or two more coats over the entire counter top so
that all will have a uniform shine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have sliding glass doors that connect our living room with
the outdoor patio next to the house.
 &HT;    These doors are secured with a simple sliding latch or lock that
is set into the aluminum door frame.
 &HT;    I feel this is not enough to secure these doors when we are not
at home.
 &HT;    Can you suggest an inexpensive method to provide added
protection against forced entry when we're out?
 &HT;    A: The simplest method is to drop a bar or rod into the inside
track at the bottom of the door so that it fits snugly into the
space between the edge of the movable door (when it is closed) and
the vertical frame or fixed door at the other end of the track.
 &HT;    This will prevent a burglar from forcing the sliding door open
even if the latch or lock doesn't hold.
 &HT;    For this bar, use a length of metal pipe or a heavy wood dowel
at least 3/4'' in diameter. Cut it long enough so that when dropped
down into the track it will just fit between the door and the
frame, but can be easily lifted out of the way from the inside when
you want to open the door.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The fireplace in our basement is just below the one in our
living room and both share the same chimney, although each has its
own flue.
 &HT;    When we build a fire in the basement fireplace we get a strong
smell of smoke in the living room.
 &HT;    What do you think could be causing this problem?
 &HT;    A: It could be that either one or both of the flue liners inside
that chimney structure are cracked, or that there may be no flue
liners at all.
 &HT;    This would allow smoke to leak from one flue into the other,
although it should not happen if that flue (the one being used) is
drawing properly.
 &HT;    However, it could happen if there are down drafts in a high
wind, especially if the chimney is not properly capped, with a
divider between the two flue openings at the top.
 &HT;    I suggest you call in a chimney expert to check out the
structure since this could also be a fire hazard.

 WOMAN'S YARD HAS GONE TO THE BIRDS
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TIM MADIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Don't be fooled. Life in Tweetville is not
as sanguine as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Blue jays live in Tweetville, for starters, and everyone knows
how annoying they can be. Wherever you find a blue jay, discord
surely lurks. Tweetville's resident cardinals are beautiful, no
doubt, but predictably stand-offish. They come to drink and eat
without a chirp to the other birds, and then disappear. Then there
is the thrasher, the muscular bird that terrorizes Tweetville's
smaller residents, inviting himself into their homes, helping
himself to eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Jeane Andrews happily observes this
sometimes-fractious pageant. Always a new drama in Tweetville. Who
would have thought?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Andrews, a Fort Worth widow merely seeking a way
to salvage something from the maple tree that succumbed last year
to the drought. She had been enamored with nature since childhood,
with birds and flowers particularly, and for the past few years has
subscribed to ``Birds and Blooms'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in a recent issue, was her solution. A reader wrote
to say that he had transformed a dead oak into his version of
Tweetville, and he sent the magazine a photograph. Andrews,
intrigued, set to work.
</P>
<P>
   She purchased her first three birdhouses at Wal-Mart for $3
apiece. Her daughter in Alabama and a granddaughter in California
bought birdhouses, painted them and shipped them to Texas. Others
came as birthday presents.
</P>
<P>
   Tweetville was incorporated this spring. It has grown to
encompass 15 birdhouses, four bird feeders, an outdoor thermometer
and an American flag. Among the structures are a bird church, a
bird school, a bird barn, a 2-story bird apartment complex, a bird
A-frame, a bird farmhouse, a bird log cabin and a bird dwelling
constructed from a Hawaiian coconut. The son of a friend helped
Andrews trim the tree and place the houses on the limbs. He also
built a bird castle from plastic pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The airspace in Tweetville is now a bit cramped. In addition to
the blue jays, cardinals and thrashers, the Tweetville census
includes sparrows, wrens, mockingbirds, hummingbirds and a few
species that Andrews cannot identify. The wrens are her favorites.
They are human-friendly, she says, are doting toward their young
and are particularly cooperative with their mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people worked together like birds do, it would be a lot
better world,'' Andrews says.
</P>
<P>
   But then she remembers the dark twists of the mesmerizing
pageant outside her window each day. Yes, it is heartwarming to
watch the mother sparrow feed her baby, seed by seed. But then come
the overbearing blue jay, the stuck-up cardinal, and the thrasher
who scares the little birds and invites himself to supper.

<P>
   Katherine Marshall e-mailed, requesting recipes for two of the
soup served at the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth. Buffet maven
Shelby Schafer is always most kind with requests. Here are the
recipes, but make a note _ the Kimbell is publishing a cookbook,
which should be available by the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the further adventures of searching for a salmon pie
recipe, Emmie McWhorter sends one she makes from a vintage ``Better
Homes and Gardens Meal Cook Books'' _ and judging from the title,
my guess would be that it had a pre-Vatican II publication date.

GREAT GIFTS FOR GIRLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's another birthday party, and you're back in the Barbie aisle
or running through the Gap, loading merchandise into your arms and
wondering what else the birthday girl might want, because you're
tired of the same old gifts. With a little creativity, we've come
up with four great birthday present ideas, all about 15 bucks or
less.
</P>
<P>
   1. Makeup at the mall. Take a young teen to a trendy cosmetics
counter at a department store and let the experts go to work. As
your gift, get her one or two of the items used in her beauty
transformation. Our favorite: a tube of lipstick or gloss in a
fashion-forward color.
</P>
<P>
   2. Something fishy. Would you like to get the birthday girl a
pet, but don't have the money for a kitten or puppy _ or know
whether her parents would be happy if you did? Try Aquababies,
miniature fish tanks that include a small fish, snail or frog. It's
a low-maintenance pet that parents probably won't mind. Target,
$15.99. (So it's more than $15; 99 cents isn't going to kill you,
is it?)
</P>
<P>
   3. Bear-riffic! Stuffed animals are always a good choice, but
why not make it extra special _ make it yourself. Head over to a
Build-A-Bear Workshop at the mall and choose from more than 20
animals, from classic teddy bears to frogs. Lovingly fill your
animal with cotton, insert a heart, sew it up and fluff it. You can
even add music, sound effects or a personal message. Each animal
comes with a carrying case and birth certificate. Bears range from
$10 to $25 without music.
</P>
<P>
   4. Classic toys. For the young (or young at heart) birthday
girl, you can't go wrong with a basic traditional toy. Nothing
trendy _ just simple fun. This bowling set from KB Toys, for
example, is great for hours of solo play or team tournaments and is
just $7.99. Or get two Hula Hoops (and challenge her to a contest),
a big red playground ball for some SPUD and dodgeball action, or a
basketball for some hoop-it-up fun.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Questions and Answers'' it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My husband is planning to paint the outside of our two-story
house and he will have to use a tall extension ladder to reach the
higher places.
 &HT;    I am worried about him doing this, but he says that he will be
careful and knows how to use this ladder safely.
 &HT;    Can you give me some suggestions as to what precautions should
be taken when setting up such a ladder?
 &HT;    A: The ladder should be set up at the safest angle, which is 4:1
_ that is, the bottom of the ladder should be 1 foot away from the
base of the house wall for every 4 feet of ladder height.
 &HT;    In addition, make sure the ladder sits on a solid surface that
is relatively flat and level.
 &HT;    If the ladder must sit on soft soil or irregular ground, place a
wide, flat board under the ladder legs before setting it up.
 &HT;    To keep the legs from slipping off this board or shifting in any
way, drive a heavy stake into the ground behind the ladder and tie
the bottom of the ladder to this with a stout length of rope.
 &HT;    When climbing the ladder, he should use both hands to hold on
and keep his body between the rails at all times.
 &HT;    Instead of carrying paint or tools up with him, they should be
hauled up with a rope afterwards.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My 6-year-old kitchen counters are in relatively good
condition but in a few places the plastic laminate has lost its
shine.
 &HT;    I find that counter-top polishes tend to make the whole counter
shinier, so the contrast makes the dull spots look even more
noticeable.
 &HT;    What can you recommend?
 &HT;    A: The only suggestion I can offer is to apply a first coat of
the polish to the dull sections only, blending it in around the
edges so there is no noticeable difference with the unpolished
areas.
 &HT;    If this still looks duller than the rest of the surface apply a
second coat.
 &HT;    Then apply one or two more coats over the entire counter top so
that all will have a uniform shine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have sliding glass doors that connect our living room with
the outdoor patio next to the house.
 &HT;    These doors are secured with a simple sliding latch or lock that
is set into the aluminum door frame.
 &HT;    I feel this is not enough to secure these doors when we are not
at home.
 &HT;    Can you suggest an inexpensive method to provide added
protection against forced entry when we're out?
 &HT;    A: The simplest method is to drop a bar or rod into the inside
track at the bottom of the door so that it fits snugly into the
space between the edge of the movable door (when it is closed) and
the vertical frame or fixed door at the other end of the track.
 &HT;    This will prevent a burglar from forcing the sliding door open
even if the latch or lock doesn't hold.
 &HT;    For this bar, use a length of metal pipe or a heavy wood dowel
at least 3/4'' in diameter. Cut it long enough so that when dropped
down into the track it will just fit between the door and the
frame, but can be easily lifted out of the way from the inside when
you want to open the door.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The fireplace in our basement is just below the one in our
living room and both share the same chimney, although each has its
own flue.
 &HT;    When we build a fire in the basement fireplace we get a strong
smell of smoke in the living room.
 &HT;    What do you think could be causing this problem?
 &HT;    A: It could be that either one or both of the flue liners inside
that chimney structure are cracked, or that there may be no flue
liners at all.
 &HT;    This would allow smoke to leak from one flue into the other,
although it should not happen if that flue (the one being used) is
drawing properly.
 &HT;    However, it could happen if there are down drafts in a high
wind, especially if the chimney is not properly capped, with a
divider between the two flue openings at the top.
 &HT;    I suggest you call in a chimney expert to check out the
structure since this could also be a fire hazard.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to

 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``USING A BOARD FOR SETTING UP A SAFE

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even the world's ultimate playing field can
teach you an awful lot about work. Here are seven things you can
learn about your career from watching the Olympics, regardless of
whether you're a medal winner or you're feeling down under:
</P>
<P>
   _ No matter how pure you try to be, you can't escape politics.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic history is filled with boycotts and biased judging, and
the Summer Olympics were canceled three times during the 20th
century because the world was at war.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace politics are present in every office. No matter how
fair a boss tries to be or how much a company tries to wipe out
bias, you can't legislate human nature. Bosses will have certain
workers who make them feel comfortable and others who get on their
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the bias could be there because of race, sex, age or
sexual orientation, but it's usually there just because of human
nature and how people interact. Look at the people who are the
boss's favorites. What are they doing that you aren't? Are there
ways you can change to get on the boss's good side without feeling
like a brown-noser?
</P>
<P>
   Politics also can work in your favor, although then you're more
likely to chalk it up to talent than politics, of course. Some
people will dislike you more than you deserve, but others will give
you more credit than you deserve. Don't dwell on the negative.
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympics, Mary Lou Retton and Jesse Owens were both
talented athletes, but politics helped to magnify their
accomplishments. Retton might never have won her gymnastics gold
medal if the Soviet Union and several other communist nations
hadn't boycotted the 1984 Olympics, but the important thing is that
she took advantage of the break that life gave her. A lot of
workers don't.
</P>
<P>
   Owens and Carl Lewis each won four track and field gold medals
in a single Olympics, but Owens' accomplishment was a much greater
milestone. Against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's talk of a master
Aryan race, the 22-year-old black man won his medals in 1936 in
Berlin, Hitler's home court.
</P>
<P>
   _ A little brilliance can change the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only a die-hard gymnastics fan would have heard of Olga Korbut
before the 1972 Summer Olympics, but her charm and brilliance
turned many little girls into budding gymnasts _ and did a lot to
warm up the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   People who get ahead at work are rarely those who stick to their
assigned jobs, even if they do them well. What great idea have you
come up with? Have you suggested anything that's saved your company
money? Did you come up with a way to do your job markedly better
than anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   Good bosses look for flashes of brilliance when they promote
people. If you convince a boss that you have the potential to do
great things, you'll move up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even in a world of specialists, there is room for someone with
great all-around talent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee was a terrific long jumper, but she won two
gold medals, a silver and a bronze in the heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stand out in one particular area are the ones most
likely to move up, whether it's within a company or by starting
their own businesses. But everyone needs someone they can count on,
the person others turn to when they need to know about a client's
history or have to get something done right or need help figuring
out the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   You can go a long way being a ``right-hand man,'' even if you're
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes you've got to play hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable scenes from any Olympics was in the
1984 women's marathon, when Gabriela Andersen-Schiess _ exhausted
nearly to the point of unconsciousness _ staggered and struggled
her way to the finish line. She was far out of contention for a
medal, but the drama of her trying to complete the race drew more
appreciation from fans than even the winners received.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, you should go to work when you're
healthy and stay home when you're sick, but you can derail your
career if you don't appreciate the nuances.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think the office can get along without you, you're
probably kidding yourself. If you come in wheezing and infect
everybody else for just an ordinary workday, what you see as
dedication could come across as idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if a key project is due and everyone is
counting on you, crawl to the office if you need to _ unless you
have something that is potentially life-threatening. Two things
people will always remember in any workplace: how you let them
down, or how you struggled to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes the best moments in life are tape-delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the greatest moment in U.S. sports history was when the
hockey team beat the Soviet Union in the 1980 Olympics, but the
game wasn't televised live here _ nor are any events in this year's
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Work and training can be frustrating when you don't see
immediate results, but that doesn't mean your efforts are not
worthy. Keep trying and keep learning, even if there is no reward
in sight. Breaks have a way of evening out, even if you don't
believe in miracles.
</P>
<P>
   _ No matter how good you are, you won't always win.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Decker Slaney and Jim Ryun were two of the greatest runners
in U.S. history, but they didn't win any gold medals. Life isn't
always fair.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you get passed over for a promotion or lose a
client or get laid off, keep in mind the Olympic Creed: ``The most
important thing in the Olympic games is not to win, but to take
part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph,
but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered, but
to have fought well.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Never forget who got you there.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to accomplish anything of significance
completely on your own; if people help you along the way, make sure
they understand how much you appreciate it. Return favors and say
``thank you'' with sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``100 Greatest Moments in Olympic History,'' Bud
Greenspan describes how American Bill Havens would have been one of
the favorites for a gold medal in canoeing at the 1924 Olympics in
Paris. After several days of soul-searching, though, he decided not
to make the two-week overseas boat trip to Paris; his wife was due
to give birth to their child around that time, and he wanted to be
at her bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Frank, was born four days after the Olympics ended,
so Havens certainly would have missed the birth had he competed.
Still, he was plagued with second thoughts about the gold medal
that might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take almost three decades before he realized he made
the correct decision,'' Greenspan writes, ``for in the summer of
1952 he received a telegram from Helsinki, Finland, the scene of
the Olympics. The telegram read:
</P>
<P>
   ```Dear Dad, Thanks for waiting around for me to get born in
1924. I'm coming home with the gold medal you should have won.' It
was signed, `Your loving son, Frank.' Frank Havens had just won the
gold medal in the singles 10,000 meters canoeing event.''

&HT;     LOCKHART HAS NO REGRETS AS HE DEPARTS WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart says he
had an ``out of body experience'' the first time he stood at the
podium in the White House press center and briefed skeptical
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers said he looked like a deer caught in the
headlights. Lockhart had a hard act to follow. His predecessor _
Michael McCurry _ was a smooth, popular, former State Department
spokesman who was the master of the nuance, especially when the
Monica Lewinsky story broke in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart took over the press secretary's job from his post as
deputy spokesman when McCurry resigned in October 1998. He had no
illusions about the post _ the second toughest in the White House _
and now, almost two years later, he will happily hang up his cleats
on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell interview, he could hardly wipe a smile off his
face. He seemed to be saying, ``I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   On his desk was a four-inch stack of unanswered telephone
messages, three eight balls from sympathetic friends, photos of his
wife Laura and daughter Clare, age 6. Clare's colorful drawings
decorated the wall behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart had his baptism of fire as the president's chief
spokesman when the House voted to impeach the president on Dec. 19,
1998, and throughout the Senate impeachment trial, which ended in
Clinton's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   After that ordeal, he became more confident and is today a much
wiser man who can field almost anything thrown at him.
</P>
<P>
   As for his future, he doesn't want to make precipitous
decisions. He expects to be on the speaking circuit this fall. Some
morning, he says, he will wake up and say: ``That's what I want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants ``to do something relevant'' in the public policy
field. He probably will take a job in communications.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart says he is leaving a job that ``is the most interesting
thing I'll ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The highs are as high as you can get,'' he explains, and ``the
lows are as challenging as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has ``no regrets'' in the way he has handled some of
the crisis moments.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart says he has never lied to reporters but concedes:
``I've certainly withheld information for a variety of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House press secretary has to wear two hats. On the one
hand, he is the mouthpiece for the president, the federal
government and the United States. On the other hand, the press
secretary must be responsive to the news media, which serve as a
pipeline to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said a good spokesman has to have the ``confidence of
the president and credibility with the press.'' That could lead to
a split personality, which Lockhart doesn't have. You always know
where he stands. He insists that the president's attitude is ``tell
them (reporters) what they need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   I take that with a grain of salt since the president's initial
approach to the White House press was hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart says the president doesn't like the prep sessions
before a news conference, but he does enjoy the give and take with
reporters and his attitude is ``give me the best shot you have.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters noted that Clinton has not held a formal news
conference since Aug. 30 and asked Lockhart when there would be
one, he quipped `October 2'' _ after he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   The high point for Lockhart in the job John F. Kennedy called
``the bull's eye'' on the national stage was when the U.S. stopped
the bombing of Belgrade in the Kosovo crisis. The saddest times,
and most painful times, he said, were when he traveled with the
Clintons to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the bombing of the
federal building on April 19,1995 and to Colorado to grieve with
the relatives of the students who lost their lives after the April
20, 1999 massacre at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was serving as the deputy White House spokesman on
those sad missions.
</P>
<P>
   His proudest moment, he said, was when he was able to implement
his plan to have Clinton rename the White House press room in honor
of former press secretary James S. Brady who was shot and wounded
in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan on March 30,
1981. Brady, who was paralyzed in the assault, and his wife Sarah
attended the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his predecessors, he can be intimidating when he's
in a tight spot, and his response is based on the theory that a
good offense is the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked recently about a report by Internet _gossip
columnist Matt Drudge that Hillary Rodham Clinton had invited some
of the donors to her Senate campaign to stay overnight at Camp
David and the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House, he angrily
dismissed the question, saying he does not answer questions based
on reports from ``rumor mongers.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Lockhart said he did not know about Camp David,
but ``over the last seven and a half years,'' the Clintons ``always
welcomed their friends and supporters and political officials
around the country, prominent members of the arts community to stay
at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within that group,'' he confirmed, ``there certainly have been
people, friends, who supported them financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if those invitations were a ``payoff,'' he hastily
replied: ``No, No.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart says it's time to go, time to do ``something
different.'' He is leaving with no regrets.

GAMES WITH NARY A DROP OF BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much fuss has been made over the Federal Trade Commission
saying that game companies market M-rated titles to teens that we
decided _ for this week at least _ to be M-game free.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the games reviewed this week has a drop of blood. Not
one bad word. Not a single half-naked hero. Not one bit of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   NFL 2K1 (Sega for Dreamcast, all ages): OK, maybe a little
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But it's football, people _ you know, throw the ball, then
attack the poor guy who catches it. NFL 2K1 is the sequel to
Dreamcast's NFL 2K, which just came out a year ago when the system
launched. Kinda strange that a sequel would arrive so soon, but you
gotta remember, we're only a month away from the landing of Sony's
PlayStation 2. Yep, Sega better release all the killer games it
can.
</P>
<P>
   This one will do it. With its accurate commentary and nicely
done graphics, the first NFL 2K raised the bar on football titles.
2K1 raises it even higher, with crisper graphics, more realistic
(and easier to control) moves and a wider selection of gaming
options.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Rush 2049 (Midway for Dreamcast, all ages): You
got cars exploding here (like kids haven't seen that on the Disney
network), but that's about as violent as it gets. So this still
counts as a non-bad game; it's even rated E.
</P>
<P>
   That E could also stand for ``excellent.'' Midway's line of San
Fran Rush games has been hit and miss, and their mediocrity often
gets them lost in the ever-increasing pile of racing games.
</P>
<P>
   But this one stands out for putting an interesting spin on
futuristic racing, a spin not borrowed from Wipeout, which always
gets copped by lazy game-makers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many cool things is that players' cars can sprout
wings and teeter between flying and driving. You can also rack up
extra points by doing midair stunts, such as flips. If you're gonna
come in last place, might as well have fun along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are also very well-detailed. One of the 19 tracks
pits the cars whirling near the Golden Gate bridge as the sun's
going down. Very pretty scene. And a very cool game.
</P>
<P>
   And not one drop of blood. It is possible, you know.

DUNGY OF THE BUCCANEERS: A STICKLER FOR THE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ He was a rookie and was ready to play in his first
preseason game in 1977. Tony Dungy was a Pittsburgh defensive back
and the Steelers were at New England, at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I didn't play a down _ not one play,'' Dungy recalled the
other day. ``The first preseason game, and you don't get in for one
play? I just knew I was going to get cut the next day. But I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Dungy started and played the entire game the next week
against Philadelphia. He would play two seasons and eventually work
as a Steelers assistant coach for eight years, learning from that
franchise that defense wins games.
</P>
<P>
   And what he learned there, he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy grew up in Jackson, Mich., a city he describes as ``a
small industrial town where all parents looked after all kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 10 to 12 close buddies who I played ball with all the
way from elementary to high school,'' he said. ``That is where I
learned to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And there _ from his mom, Cleo, and his dad, Will, along with
three siblings _ Dungy learned the value of good manners and family
commitment and how he would conduct himself in whatever profession
he chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what I learned there, I believe in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy said he believes that big-play offenses are in vogue
in pro football but there remains a place for tough-minded,
defense-led teams. Dungy is a firm believer that winning teams have
quickness and explosiveness on defense.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that the difference between winning players and
losing ones at the pro level is a state of mind, a willingness to
perform individual tasks in the framework of a team.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy believes in his Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   This is his fifth season as Buccaneers coach, and this team is
unlike his first four in terms of talent and offensive propensity.
The Buccaneers are 3-0 because they have a defense that has allowed
only two touchdowns (none rushing) and earned 18 sacks and 8
turnovers. The Buccaneers are 8-2 with Shaun King starting at
quarterback and are averaging 31 points a game with receiver
Keyshawn Johnson in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy's teams were 6-10, 10-6, 8-8 and 11-5 in his first four
seasons. Last year Tampa Bay lost, 11-6, to St. Louis in the
National Football Conference championship game. It was a game that
Tampa Bay led in the fourth quarter, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to win and feel like we should have won that game,
6-5, and should have played Tennessee in the Super Bowl,'' Dungy
said. ``That's how everybody here feels about it because we had the
lead late in the game. And we would not have apologized for
winning, 6-5. I learned from Chuck Noll in Pittsburgh that speed
and explosiveness on defense is the way to build a team. Both are
difficult for your opponent to assimilate in practice and then in
games it is even harder to match. I was surprised when we played
the Rams last year that not many people gave our defense much of a
chance to slow them down. I mean, we've been very good at what we
do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers are a throwback team with a coach who could lead
in any season, any decade.
</P>
<P>
   There are few people in the National Football League _ owners,
coaches, players, the league office _ who command the respect Dungy
does. He is more than a players' coach. He is a people coach. He
exudes class and charisma and intelligence. No wonder the people in
this community consider him one of their own, along with his team.
</P>
<P>
   He has built the Bucs with defense but all the while has
tinkered with the offense. King started the final five games of
last season, replacing Trent Dilfer, who had been Dungy's
quarterback during his entire Bucs tenure. Les Steckel left
Tennessee and joined Tampa Bay as offensive coordinator. There was
the addition of the Pro Bowl linemen Jeff Christy and Randall
McDaniel from Minnesota. And, of course, there was the trade with
the Jets for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that offense will overshadow defense on any
Dungy team.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers feature four down linemen, led by Warren Sapp,
who create havoc and pressure. For Dungy, that is key, along with
outhitting opponents and each player knowing his responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the way Dungy learned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running the punt team once in Pittsburgh, and Coach
Noll came over and told me that I was the wide guy and there was no
way that I could let those two guys out wide blocking me keep me
from getting down field and making the tackle,'' Dungy said. ``I
mean, he was emphatic about it. So, the next day, I was working on
the receiving side of the punts as one of the two wide guys
blocking. And Coach Noll came over and said there was no way the
two of us could let that one wide guy get downfield and make the
tackle. And I made the mistake of asking him how yesterday I was
over there on that side and today I'm over here and you're telling
me no way on both sides. And he looked at me and said, `Son, it's a
state of mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   And football, life, is like that for Dungy, a state of mind. He
has made his choices on how his team will play the game, how he
will coach it and how he will conduct himself. His team will win
with defense, he will coach with tenacity and he will conduct
himself with class.
</P>
<P>
   His parents will be here from Michigan for the Jets game on
Sunday. Last week, when Tampa Bay won at Detroit, Dungy relished 86
family members attending.
</P>
<P>
   He saw Pittsburgh win four Super Bowl rings and he was a part of
one, as a player, in Super Bowl XIII. He started this season by
winning at New England, at Foxboro Stadium, winding up in the same
locker room he was in 23 years ago as the rookie who did not play.
If he can win the Super Bowl for Tampa Bay this season in a game
that will be played right here in Raymond James Stadium, it would
be another stamp on all that he believes in. Another way to teach
his three sons that his beliefs are winning ones.
</P>
<P>
   That his remarkable reputation is not an accident _ it was
earned. &QL;

   LEON PANETTA: ON THE FIRING LINE
</P>
<P>
   FORMER-CHIEF-OF-STAFF-SPEAKS-HARVARD-NEWSLETTERS _ Leon Panetta
became a household name during his stint as Bill Clinton's chief of
staff from July 1994 to January 1997 and is widely credited with
bringing order to White House operations and policy making.
However, he is perhaps better known for frequent media appearances
where he fielded reporters' questions with enviable equanimity.
Here, Panetta speaks with writer Richard Bierck about his days on
the public firing line. By the editorial staff of the Harvard

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Leon Panetta became a household name during his stint as Bill
Clinton's chief of staff from July 1994 to January 1997. The
principal negotiator of the successful 1996 budget compromise,
Panetta is also widely credited with bringing order to White House
operations and policy making.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps more widely known for frequent media appearances
where he fielded reporters' questions with enviable equanimity.
From 1977 to 1993 Panetta was a congressman from what is now
California's 17th District. He left Congress in 1993 to become
director of the Office of Management and Budget. Now he and his
wife, Sylvia, co-direct the Leon &AMP; Sylvia Panetta Institute for
Public Policy at California State University at Monterey Bay, which
prepares students for careers in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Panetta speaks with writer Richard Bierck about his days
on the public firing line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You made yourself available to the media on a regular basis,
perhaps more than your predecessors. How did you assess the risk?
</P>
<P>
   A: Having been in politics myself, I had developed a certain
comfort level in dealing with reporters, both those who were kind
and those who were aggressive. I developed a sense that no matter
what's coming at me, I'm able to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, those interviews are not totally spontaneous. I used
to spend Saturdays walking through with staff the various questions
that might come up and developing possible responses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I think there were not a lot of others who were anxious to
go on and play that role. For example, Clinton's national security
adviser at that time, Anthony Lake, wasn't interested in doing
Sunday shows. The vice president's time was limited. There were
others who were not anxious to do that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the president or his top advisers ever feel that you'd
gone too far in these appearances _ that you'd been too candid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president never watched those things. As to advisers, if
I went too far out of line, somebody might give me a call. But
unless we were totally blindsided by a question that we hadn't
anticipated, everybody was pretty comfortable with my appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you ever able to set boundaries with reporters about the
kinds of things you'd go into in the interviews?
</P>
<P>
   A: You really don't have much ability to control what's going to
come at you. I think we had a pretty good sense of what the
questions were going to be.
</P>
<P>
   I think the only really dicey point, usually, was that we had to
rotate the Sunday shows so that if ``Meet the Press'' called first,
I would go on ``Meet the Press,'' even if ``Face the Nation''
called within a few minutes. So what developed was a cycle in which
we did ``Meet the Press'' and then ``Face the Nation,'' and we
would rotate those so that each got a fair shot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of air to be had on CNNfn, CNBC and the like.
What are some guidelines for businesses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think there's any substitute for the truth. I know
that everybody is told that you have to spin your own message, no
matter what the question is _ that you go back to that message as
candidates do over and over again. I assume that there are probably
some corporate heads who feel the same way. But in reality,
sincerity and truthfulness are key because the public isn't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever worry that you might reveal too much?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you always are concerned that there will be one slip,
one flash of anger, one comment that comes back and gets headlines.
I mean, there is a kind of unwritten rule in this business that
basically says, if you haven't made any headlines in the
interviews, you've done well. So you can imagine that when you're
on some dicey issues, the last thing you want to do is make a
headline.
</P>
<P>
   Once I did one of those luncheons with reporters in which they
fire questions at you. A guy from the Los Angeles Times asked a
question about the pending North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). He said: ``How do you think NAFTA would do if Congress
voted on it today?'' I said, ``Well, I think it probably would fail
now, but I'm sure we'll be able to win it when the real vote
comes.'' The headlines the next morning were, ``Panetta Says
NAFTA's Dead.'' It's the kind of thing you worry about, because it
doesn't take much for one reporter to grab you on an offhand
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the moral of this story: Be candid but with your guard up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Always keep your guard up. You want to be friendly, and you
want to be able to talk to reporters in a candid way. But you
almost always have to go into those situations thinking, you know,
if this part of the sentence is pulled out of context, what will it
read like if it's a headline in the Washington Post?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with electronic communication on the rise and the cost of
air travel skyrocketing, the business trip isn't exactly
disappearing. Case in point: 22 percent of U.S. managers traveled
on business in 1999, and the number is expected to grow by
one-third over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   How can you make the most of the time you have to spend out of
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Two time-and-task-management experts offer a handful of tips for
avoiding much of the productivity loss that comes with business
travel.
</P>
<P>
   SCHEDULE CALL-IN TIMES WITH YOUR ASSISTANT BEFORE YOU LEAVE
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, you'll avoid playing phone tag, says Mildred
Saunders, founder and president of Milsaun &AMP; Co., a Flushing,
N.Y.-based executive coaching firm. The assistant can relay any
messages you have for others. Someone who really needs to speak to
you in person can join your assistant for the call-in time.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNATE SOMEONE TO MAKE DECISIONS IN YOUR ABSENCE
</P>
<P>
   Clue the person in on situations that might occur while you're
away, including crises, and agree on the decision-making authority
he or she will have, Saunders says.
</P>
<P>
   Communicate your choice not only to your boss but also to your
staff. Make sure everyone knows whom to see for anything from a
signature on a form to a solution to a customer problem.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, problems that could have been resolved in your
absence are allowed to fester on your desk because the person left
in charge is unclear about his or her responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARE FOUR COPIES OF YOUR ITINERARY
</P>
<P>
   Since emergencies, by definition, don't occur around prearranged
call in times, prepare one copy for you, one for your assistant,
one for your spouse or partner and one for the hotel desk at your
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary should include hotels, appointments and contact
information for the people you'll be meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Not all emergencies occur around prearranged call-in times, so
this itinerary ensures you'll be reachable.
</P>
<P>
   SCHEDULE A FEW HOURS, IF NOT A FULL DAY, FOR RE-ENTRY
</P>
<P>
   Spend that time catching up with assistants, staff members and
your boss. Ask your assistant to sort your mail while you're gone,
so that you can easily tell what needs to be tackled first when you
get back.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside 30 minutes each day while on the road to stay
connected to the office. Use this time to read e-mail from the
office and to keep projects moving forward while you're away, says
Julie Morgenstern, founder of TASK MASTERS, a New York City-based
task-management consulting firm, and author of the soon-to-be
published ``Time Management from the Inside Out'' (Holt &AMP; Owl
Books).
</P>
<P>
   Have your assistant e-mail or overnight any paperwork that
requires immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIZE YOUR BRIEFCASE
</P>
<P>
   If you usually bring home more paperwork from a trip than you
left with, buy an expandable briefcase. The expandable files will
help you organize paperwork chronologically, by meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Put important business documents in plastic or vinyl covers to
prevent bending or tearing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use travel time to catch up on your reading, pack
reports and other paperwork. But be realistic _ let past practice
be your guide about how much you can actually get done.
</P>
<P>
   CREATE A MASTER PACKING LIST
</P>
<P>
   Include everything you would generally need on a trip, from
business files to clothes and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern suggests developing different lists depending on the
length or nature of the business trip _ for example, one list for
an overnight trip, one for a week's trip to one place, one for a
week's trip to two or more locations. It sounds obsessive, but it
can help streamline your packing, freeing you to focus on the
purpose of the trip and any special paperwork you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: WHEN YOU'RE AT A CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   View a business conference as an exercise in knowledge
management. Below, some advice from Julie Morgenstern about how to
make the most of the experience:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attend only those information or networking sessions that
address your business needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ When someone gives you a business card, write a note on the
back to help you remember the follow-up action you want to take.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the business cards you collect in one place in your
briefcase. Upon your return, add them to your Rolodex or electronic
contact file. On your return flight, develop an action plan for
implementing what you learned at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't lose good ideas that you can't put to use right away.
Put them in a ``back burner'' file and then review it periodically.

   ARCHERY
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The Australia-U.S. rivalry that has become a
thread through the Olympic Games surfaced again Wednesday in the
men's individual archery finals. But it was less a story of fervent
nationalistic competition than the tale of two single-minded
athletes who met for the ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Simon Fairweather won the gold medal, defeating Vic
Wunderle of Mason City, Ill., in the final, 113-106. Afterward,
both men acknowledged that archery was a consuming passion that
left room for little else, and neither seemed particularly
distressed by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 12 years of shooting internationally,'' said
Fairweather, who turned 31 earlier this month. ``It's pretty much
all I've been doing.'' He has lived in Canberra training at the
national sports institute there for the last two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Wunderle, 24, has been shooting since he was a boy. His father,
Terry, who coached archery, made a bow out of a willow branch and
had young Vic take aim at a distant tree. He is rigorous about
training, sometimes shooting up to 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much, from the time I get up to the time I go to sleep,
I work on my shooting in one way or another,'' he said. He
acknowledged that he took time out for certain things: ``Eating and
opening mail.''
</P>
<P>
   With his father to help teach him and his sister, Sally, once an
international competitor, to show him the way, Wunderle developed
rapidly. He won the junior world championships in 1991 and 1994. He
has studied at Texas A&AMP;M, but took a year off to train, and said he
planned to complete his degree after the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the U.S. archery federation, he has lived and trained
with other athletes at Chula Vista, Calif., and was clearly the top
U.S. shooter at the Olympic trials when he blew away the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's final, Fairweather took a 4-point lead over
Wunderle after the first three arrows, and over all he hit 6
bullseyes out of 12 arrows, each worth 10 points, despite a
shifting breeze. Wunderle had only two bulls-eyes. Fairweather shot
superbly, recapturing for one day the form he showed when he won
the world championship in 1991. As a joyous home crowd cheered and
waved flags, Fairweather said that he thought he would retire from
competition. ``Probably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't sound too convincing, not nearly as convincing as the
12 arrows that flew through the air toward gold.

   BOXING
</P>
<P>
   The American light welterweight Ricardo Williams, Jr. didn't
want to become the first U.S. boxer to lose his first-round fight.
</P>
<P>
   Williams felt the pressure, especially when he fell behind on
points in the first round of his bout with Australian Henry
Collins, who was supported by a small but boisterous home crowd at
the boxing venue in Sydney's Darling Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, at 19 the youngest fighter on the U.S. team,
rallied and easily won the second and third rounds, building such a
commanding lead the bout was stopped because Williams had a
15-point lead against Collins. The Americans have now won each of
their nine first-round fights.

   DIVING
</P>
<P>
   With world and Olympic records rapidly dissolving in the Olympic
swimming pool, will there be a ripple effect for divers in the
adjacent, deeper pool just a few feet away?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team's diving coach, Jay Lerew, says it's possible, and
his divers say they like the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of water feels good to divers,'' Lerew said
Wednesday, a week before the Games' diving competition begins. ``It
has a nice fluffy feel and you can see a lot better on entries.''
</P>
<P>
   The pools at Sydney International Aquatic Center use nearly
identical circulation systems, producing remarkably clear water
containing few of the harsh chemicals, such as chlorine, that
irritate divers. Water quality has been cited by competitors and
experts as one reason Olympic swimmers have excelled in the
50-meter swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The diving pool often elicits praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this pool,'' said Michelle Davison, a 3-meter
springboard diver from the United States. ``The water is great. The
boards are great.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Troy Dumais, also a 3-meter springboard diver, said
he has enjoyed practicing in the pool, but added that the center is
not perfect. He said that relatively minor drawbacks include
fluctuating temperatures in the showers and Jacuzzis, and a cool
breeze in the locker room that sometimes chills athletes between
dives. ``But if one person has to deal with it, we all have to deal
with it,'' he said. ``It's a great pool.''

   FUTURE SITES
</P>
<P>
   The mayors of several would-be Olympic cities have been making
the rounds in Sydney _ cozying up to members of the International
Olympic Committee, getting tips and taking in the city's sights.
</P>
<P>
   Two mayors of East Coast cities turned up Wednesday for a harbor
cruise arranged by the deputy lord mayor of Sydney, Lucy Hughes
Turnbull. Anthony Williams, of Washington, D.C., and Martin
O'Malley, of Baltimore, were aboard and also mingled with members
of Sydney's political and business elite.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Baltimore are planning to make a joint bid for
the 2012 Olympics. To hear the mayors tell it, potential rivals
like New York City will face an uphill struggle. Williams said
Washington would give the Games a quintessentially American
character. O'Malley said the cities were exploring construction of
a high-speed, magnetic rail link to tie them together.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both Tampa and Orlando, Fla., also sang the
praises of their planned joint bid. New York City officials were
nowhere to be seen. _ MARK LANDLER

 &HT;    
 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Leon Panetta became a household name during his stint as Bill
Clinton's chief of staff from July 1994 to January 1997. The
principal negotiator of the successful 1996 budget compromise,
Panetta is also widely credited with bringing order to White House
operations and policy making.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps more widely known for frequent media appearances
where he fielded reporters' questions with enviable equanimity.
From 1977 to 1993 Panetta was a congressman from what is now
California's 17th District. He left Congress in 1993 to become
director of the Office of Management and Budget. Now he and his
wife, Sylvia, co-direct the Leon &AMP; Sylvia Panetta Institute for
Public Policy at California State University at Monterey Bay, which
prepares students for careers in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Panetta speaks with writer Richard Bierck about his days
on the public firing line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You made yourself available to the media on a regular basis,
perhaps more than your predecessors. How did you assess the risk?
</P>
<P>
   A: Having been in politics myself, I had developed a certain
comfort level in dealing with reporters, both those who were kind
and those who were aggressive. I developed a sense that no matter
what's coming at me, I'm able to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, those interviews are not totally spontaneous. I used
to spend Saturdays walking through with staff the various questions
that might come up and developing possible responses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I think there were not a lot of others who were anxious to
go on and play that role. For example, Clinton's national security
adviser at that time, Anthony Lake, wasn't interested in doing
Sunday shows. The vice president's time was limited. There were
others who were not anxious to do that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the president or his top advisers ever feel that you'd
gone too far in these appearances _ that you'd been too candid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president never watched those things. As to advisers, if
I went too far out of line, somebody might give me a call. But
unless we were totally blindsided by a question that we hadn't
anticipated, everybody was pretty comfortable with my appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you ever able to set boundaries with reporters about the
kinds of things you'd go into in the interviews?
</P>
<P>
   A: You really don't have much ability to control what's going to
come at you. I think we had a pretty good sense of what the
questions were going to be.
</P>
<P>
   I think the only really dicey point, usually, was that we had to
rotate the Sunday shows so that if ``Meet the Press'' called first,
I would go on ``Meet the Press,'' even if ``Face the Nation''
called within a few minutes. So what developed was a cycle in which
we did ``Meet the Press'' and then ``Face the Nation,'' and we
would rotate those so that each got a fair shot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of air to be had on CNNfn, CNBC and the like.
What are some guidelines for businesses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think there's any substitute for the truth. I know
that everybody is told that you have to spin your own message, no
matter what the question is _ that you go back to that message as
candidates do over and over again. I assume that there are probably
some corporate heads who feel the same way. But in reality,
sincerity and truthfulness are key because the public isn't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever worry that you might reveal too much?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you always are concerned that there will be one slip,
one flash of anger, one comment that comes back and gets headlines.
I mean, there is a kind of unwritten rule in this business that
basically says, if you haven't made any headlines in the
interviews, you've done well. So you can imagine that when you're
on some dicey issues, the last thing you want to do is make a
headline.
</P>
<P>
   Once I did one of those luncheons with reporters in which they
fire questions at you. A guy from the Los Angeles Times asked a
question about the pending North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). He said: ``How do you think NAFTA would do if Congress
voted on it today?'' I said, ``Well, I think it probably would fail
now, but I'm sure we'll be able to win it when the real vote
comes.'' The headlines the next morning were, ``Panetta Says
NAFTA's Dead.'' It's the kind of thing you worry about, because it
doesn't take much for one reporter to grab you on an offhand
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the moral of this story: Be candid but with your guard up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Always keep your guard up. You want to be friendly, and you
want to be able to talk to reporters in a candid way. But you
almost always have to go into those situations thinking, you know,
if this part of the sentence is pulled out of context, what will it
read like if it's a headline in the Washington Post?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with electronic communication on the rise and the cost of
air travel skyrocketing, the business trip isn't exactly
disappearing. Case in point: 22 percent of U.S. managers traveled
on business in 1999, and the number is expected to grow by
one-third over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   How can you make the most of the time you have to spend out of
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Two time-and-task-management experts offer a handful of tips for
avoiding much of the productivity loss that comes with business
travel.
</P>
<P>
   SCHEDULE CALL-IN TIMES WITH YOUR ASSISTANT BEFORE YOU LEAVE
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, you'll avoid playing phone tag, says Mildred
Saunders, founder and president of Milsaun &AMP; Co., a Flushing,
N.Y.-based executive coaching firm. The assistant can relay any
messages you have for others. Someone who really needs to speak to
you in person can join your assistant for the call-in time.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNATE SOMEONE TO MAKE DECISIONS IN YOUR ABSENCE
</P>
<P>
   Clue the person in on situations that might occur while you're
away, including crises, and agree on the decision-making authority
he or she will have, Saunders says.
</P>
<P>
   Communicate your choice not only to your boss but also to your
staff. Make sure everyone knows whom to see for anything from a
signature on a form to a solution to a customer problem.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, problems that could have been resolved in your
absence are allowed to fester on your desk because the person left
in charge is unclear about his or her responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARE FOUR COPIES OF YOUR ITINERARY
</P>
<P>
   Since emergencies, by definition, don't occur around prearranged
call in times, prepare one copy for you, one for your assistant,
one for your spouse or partner and one for the hotel desk at your
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary should include hotels, appointments and contact
information for the people you'll be meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Not all emergencies occur around prearranged call-in times, so
this itinerary ensures you'll be reachable.
</P>
<P>
   SCHEDULE A FEW HOURS, IF NOT A FULL DAY, FOR RE-ENTRY
</P>
<P>
   Spend that time catching up with assistants, staff members and
your boss. Ask your assistant to sort your mail while you're gone,
so that you can easily tell what needs to be tackled first when you
get back.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside 30 minutes each day while on the road to stay
connected to the office. Use this time to read e-mail from the
office and to keep projects moving forward while you're away, says
Julie Morgenstern, founder of TASK MASTERS, a New York City-based
task-management consulting firm, and author of the soon-to-be
published ``Time Management from the Inside Out'' (Holt &AMP; Owl
Books).
</P>
<P>
   Have your assistant e-mail or overnight any paperwork that
requires immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIZE YOUR BRIEFCASE
</P>
<P>
   If you usually bring home more paperwork from a trip than you
left with, buy an expandable briefcase. The expandable files will
help you organize paperwork chronologically, by meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Put important business documents in plastic or vinyl covers to
prevent bending or tearing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use travel time to catch up on your reading, pack
reports and other paperwork. But be realistic _ let past practice
be your guide about how much you can actually get done.
</P>
<P>
   CREATE A MASTER PACKING LIST
</P>
<P>
   Include everything you would generally need on a trip, from
business files to clothes and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern suggests developing different lists depending on the
length or nature of the business trip _ for example, one list for
an overnight trip, one for a week's trip to one place, one for a
week's trip to two or more locations. It sounds obsessive, but it
can help streamline your packing, freeing you to focus on the
purpose of the trip and any special paperwork you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: WHEN YOU'RE AT A CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   View a business conference as an exercise in knowledge
management. Below, some advice from Julie Morgenstern about how to
make the most of the experience:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attend only those information or networking sessions that
address your business needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ When someone gives you a business card, write a note on the
back to help you remember the follow-up action you want to take.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the business cards you collect in one place in your
briefcase. Upon your return, add them to your Rolodex or electronic
contact file. On your return flight, develop an action plan for
implementing what you learned at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't lose good ideas that you can't put to use right away.
Put them in a ``back burner'' file and then review it periodically.

REDSKINS MAY PAY PRICE FOR OPENING PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ The Giants, taking advantage of an obscure
National Football League rule, sent scouts daily to the training
camp practices of the Redskins this summer, accumulating dozens of
pieces of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   The data ranged from getting solid looks at potential free
agents, to picking up individual player tendencies. A small amount
of that information, according to a Giants coach who did not want
to be identified, has been incorporated into the team's game plan
against Washington on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were required to open their summer practices to
other team's scouts because they charged fans for admission. By
doing so, the team opened the door to the vault, and the Giants, a
bitter division opponent, said, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They opened up practices, and we went,'' said Ernie Accorsi,
the Giants general manager. ``I don't know how much you get from
it, but I know there were a lot of little individual ingredients,
and sometimes those individual things all add up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, off to a 3-0 start, did not break any league rules
by sending scouts to the Redskins' Ashburn, Va., training camp
facility.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Washington became the first team to charge fans
admission to training camp, which amounted to $10 for admission and
another $10 for parking. The team owner, Daniel Snyder, initiated
the charges as a way to offset the millions of dollars he paid for
stadium improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But by charging fans, the Redskins also opened themselves to
their competition. A little-used league rule states that any team
that makes fans pay to watch training camp can be scouted during
that time by opposing teams. Usually, clubs are forbidden from
sending scouts or other personnel to any team practice at any time
during the season.
</P>
<P>
   To opponents of the Redskins, it was suddenly a feast. It is
believed that every team in the league sent scouts to Washington's
practices this summer. The Giants were among the most aggressive.
The Giants scouted every Redskins' practice, gathering what the
team believes to be useful information.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants knew coming into this season that the Redskins would
be their most threatening division opponent and, as Accorsi said,
``It would have been arrogant for us not to send people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reese, the Giants' assistant director of pro personnel and
a six-year veteran of the scouting department, was a constant
presence at Washington's summer practices, from mid-July until
mid-August. David Gettleman, the team's director of pro personnel
who before joining the Giants was a scout for Denver and Buffalo,
also went to the practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' scouting department digested all of the information,
then handed it off to the coaching staff, who did their own
dissecting. The team believes it has practical information that
will be used against Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, members of both franchises try to play down the effect
of scouting the practices. They say little can be learned from
them. That, of course, is strategic in itself. Teams want to play
down that going to the practices are useful, hoping the Redskins
will continue to open them, and teams can continue to have access.
The Redskins, who are 1-2 this season, say nothing is learned from
them, hoping to minimize any public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, it is a different story. The Giants coach who did not
want to be identified also declined to say exactly what the
coaching staff had learned. But, he said, the information, while
not being a major factor, will provide a small edge in certain game
situations.
</P>
<P>
   A team cannot learn much about overall strategy from the summer
practices, but scouts say a surplus of information can be gathered.
Scouts can get a close view of backups who probably will not play
much this season, but might be attractive free agents in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Also, scouts may be able to pick up a player's tendencies, some
that might not show up in routine film study: For example, how an
offensive lineman sets before a play may give away if the play is a
pass or run. Again, nothing major, but an accumulation of these
tidbits, which are passed on to the players, might make a
difference on a critical play or series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some interesting information, but the bottom line is
that this Redskins team is extremely talented,'' Accorsi said.
``They scare me. This is going to be a tough game.''

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: REDSKINS CAN'T BUY A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ In Washington, the Redskins are more than a
professional sports team, they are also a passion, more valuable to
the city than the politicians who run it. Only someone who was born
and raised there might fully understand this. When the Redskins are
doing well, the crime doesn't seem so bad and the potholes are not
so numerous. When the Redskins aren't doing well, fans begin
begging for presidential intervention.
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be a great year in Washington, because the
win-now owner Daniel Snyder had whipped out his checkbook and
purchased an all-star team. The Redskins were hot again. They were
the talk of the town, and almost every other town, too.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why celebrities and politicians, knowing this
was as good a moment as any to get some television face time,
showed up at the Monday night game between Washington and Dallas.
This was a contest in which the Redskins were supposed to beat up
on the lowly Cowboys and start their Super Bowl run, and many
people wanted to catch the beginning of something great.
</P>
<P>
   There was the CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, a regular. There was New
York Gov. George Pataki and Orrin Hatch, the senator from Utah.
Even the former Knick Charles Oakley showed up, dressed in a dapper
suit that will probably appear later in an issue of GQ magazine.
They were all there to watch Washington romp. One big party.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Cowboys upset the Redskins, 27-21, there was a sense
of outrage from fans and celebrities alike, that the hype coming
into this season had been a mirage, that everyone had been
bamboozled. You could almost hear the senators, actors, Internet
moguls and cabdrivers say in unison: We skipped Jay Leno for this?
</P>
<P>
   As one politician was leaving his luxury box Monday night, a
member of his entourage said rather loudly, ``What a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   What a disaster, indeed. Very early, the Redskins are crumbling
under the crushing G-forces of their own expectations, and the
heavy hand of Snyder, the micromanager with the short fuse, who
sank lower into his chair as the ugly night dragged on. Super Bowl?
With a 1-2 record, a last-place spot in the division and a schedule
that includes a road game against the Giants on Sunday, followed by
games against Tampa Bay, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Jacksonville and
Tennessee _ teams with a combined 12-5 record _ the Redskins need
lower expectations. Can you say wild card?
</P>
<P>
   It may be unfair to declare that the Redskins are on life
support after only three games. After all, this team has oodles of
talent, like Deion Sanders, Bruce Smith and Stephen Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of top ballplayers on this team,'' wide
receiver Irvin Fryar said. ``We'll see if the guys with the big
names are going to pull us out of this, or is there going to be
finger-pointing. We're in the storm. We'll see how we handle
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfair, yes, but also realistic. One problem is the lack of
cohesion among all that talent. They may be a team of all-stars,
but unlike the less-talented Giants, who have more rhythm than a
marching band, the Redskins are a group of egos flailing around
like freshly netted fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, there is already a sense of dread.
``Everyone is hitting the panic button,'' wide receiver Andre Reed
said. ``We need to just calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has stayed out of the way so far, but everyone knows his
reputation for screaming at coaches, firing secretaries and
meddling with the football nuts and bolts. There is little question
coaches and players are walking delicately, waiting for a Snyder
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   What is hurting the Redskins the most are themselves, or better
yet, the threat of themselves. Fryar said, ``I'm sure coaches on
the teams we play are saying to the players, `They have all that
talent, but hard work beats talent every time.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what other teams are saying?'' Reed said. `` `The
Redskins are done.' I'm sure other owners are mocking what Mr.
Snyder did in assembling all these great players. We have to prove
them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime Monday, with the Redskins trailing, 14-7, the former
coach Joe Gibbs and the former Redskins stars Art Monk and Dexter
Manley were inducted into the team's Ring of Fame. When Snyder was
introduced to play host for the ceremony, he was roundly booed. If
the Redskins lose a few more games, celebrities may opt for the
hockey team instead. Nothing like some puck action to fire up the
town.
</P>
<P>
   Those potholes are looking bigger all the time.
</P>

STUMBLING INTO THE GAP BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MIKE AZZARA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-age angst is nothing. To understand real pain, consider the
grown man trying to buy a big-screen television in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Few give the television set purchase its due. People think cars
and houses are bigger purchase decisions, yet they trade in their
cars every three years and switch homes every seven. Compared with
that, buying a television set is a much longer-term emotional
commitment. My old 19-inch Sony Trinitron outlasted nine cars and
five homes _ it moved to California with us and back home to New
York _ in a 20-year career of crisply perfect pictures and total
color saturation. It failed only when our 9-year-old son
accidentally knocked it from its perch, about five feet off the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Having always been a movie lover, I began to miss them sorely
when baby sitters became extinct shortly after our triplets were
born in 1991. Video rentals are OK, but have two problems: picture
and sound. It's torture watching wide-screen movies on regular
television screens. I squirm and groan about all the picture I'm
missing and the inability of the almost-square screen to deliver
the ``director's vision.'' In occasional fits of pique over
particularly bad ``pan and scan'' conversions, I even shut off the
TV.
</P>
<P>
   I feel similarly about the pale ghost of a movie soundtrack that
most TV's can deliver, and pumping the sound through my big old
wood stereo speakers is much better but not quite good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to my problems is a home theater with a big-screen TV
and real movie-house-quality, rib-breaking surround sound. But a
decade ago, mere mortals couldn't afford a worthwhile home theater
system, and besides, access to widescreen movies was rare in that
pre-DVD era.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears, all the pieces are there and affordable.
Wide-screen versions of just about everything are available on DVD,
surround sound is cheap, and even the prices of big-screen
high-definition televisions are plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Any thinking person who tries to make an intelligent purchase in
the realm of big-screen TV right now must end up like me: desolate,
inconsolable, barking angrily at my wife when she dares speak to me
and muttering to myself in dark corners of the living room in ways
that frighten the children. We are all victims of a giant
conspiracy _ or gross incompetence, I can't decide which _
perpetrated by manufacturers, broadcasters, politicians and the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the essence of the problem for the man on the street with
a credit card burning a hole in his pocket. Old-fashioned analog
televisions sets, the kind that we all have in our living rooms,
bedrooms and playrooms, are officially dead. By FCC mandate,
broadcasters must be transmitting their programming via
high-definition digital signals by 2006. You'll undoubtedly find
analog broadcasts for a few years after that, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   So the first circle of this particular hell is the analog versus
digital question. Analog televisions, like Sony's flat-screen Wega,
are at the pinnacle of their art, inexpensive in comparison with
digital TVs and liable to last a lifetime. But analog signals may
not be around for that lifetime. Digital TVs exhibit extraordinary
picture quality when rendering images from a digital signal, but
there aren't very many digital signals around yet and there's no
telling when there will be, despite the FCC mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Digital televisions are also expensive and have many bugs yet to
be worked out. In all the product reviews, for instance, you can
read about ``digital artifacts,'' which are basically anything from
nearly invisible little bursts of seemingly random color on the
screen to seizures of the entire image's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait,'' I thought. ``I want this big-screen digital TV to
watch movies. I'll simply pair it with a DVD player, which delivers
the digital signal right into the set.''
</P>
<P>
   We bump up against the next circle of hell: aspect ratio. It is
deceptively simple at first. High-definition digital TVs come in
the rectangular 16:9 aspect ratio; old-fashioned televisions come
in the more square 4:3 aspect ratio. The set I've had my eye on
recently, the Mitsubishi Platinum Plus WS55807, has a
rear-projection, high-definition, 55-inch (diagonal) TV screen with
a 16:9 aspect ratio. It's specially enhanced to show DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   I was agog at the Mitsubishi's enhancements, having personally
driven crazy the sales manager at a local electronics store by
making him shift his DVD player around among a half-dozen sets,
showing multiple movies on each. So why not buy this magical movie
machine and then, when we want to watch regular analog TV, we'll
just watch it in its 4:3 aspect ratio in the middle of the
Mitsubishi's theater-size screen. It will still be a bigger picture
than our current 26-inch living-room set.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw it. It was a sign on the floor model. For brevity's
sake, I'll paraphrase it: You can't watch regular analog TV in the
middle of the screen for more than 15 percent of your viewing time,
or you'll ruin the screen. You'll get little ghost images of blank
bars on the parts of the screen where there was no image. For
myself, I could make the 15 percent argument, since I expect to
watch movies and little else. But who are we kidding? The three
9-year-olds are going to be the primary users of the television,
and judging by this sign, they'll destroy it in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of high-definition TV's have tried to skirt the
problem by offering various special screen ``modes,'' all of which
amount to some stretching, scrunching or otherwise fouling up of
the geometry of the analog picture so that it will fit the
wide-screen shape. It makes everything you watch look like you're
at a really bad circus.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I tore myself away from the WS55807 and set my
sights on its 4:3 aspect ratio cousin, a 50-inch (diagonal) model
that had essentially the same high-definition specs but with a
square screen. I reasoned that I'd trade off a little bit in size
for the movies I wanted to watch, but normal TV would fill the
whole screen (until 2006 _ ouch!), so the triplets couldn't really
hurt it. My wide-screen movies would probably account for around 15
percent of the viewing time, so the black or gray bars wouldn't
``burn'' the screen. It wasn't a perfect solution. But we're living
in a difficult transition period, I reasoned, so it would have to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-working sales manager plugged his DVD player showing a
wide-screen movie into the 4:3 television and my world collapsed.
The picture was all scrunched up in the middle of the screen.
Nothing either one of us did would get the movie to show properly.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say DVD players have a switch to let them know whether
they're connected to a wide-screen or a 4:3 television, so that
they can provide the correct picture. But on that day with that
particular DVD player, we just couldn't get it to work.
</P>
<P>
   I am, for now, a broken man. Desolate, inconsolable, off
muttering in the corner of the living room. The kids approach me
cautiously. I watch DVD movies on a 26-inch TV that looks like 15
or so inches when you display the whole wide-screen movie frame. My
wife and I squint from the loveseat, 14 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   I nearly bought one of those 36-inch analog Sony Wegas. ``Last
gasp of the analog world,'' I told myself. ``It's a work of art, a
classic, the best analog picture ever created.'' But it can't make
me happy. It's not quite big enough for watching movies in our
room. And every time I looked at it, I'd be reminded of the last
six weeks of research and analysis and utter failure.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd be bitter.

REFUGEES IN WEST TIMOR FACING STARVATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Tens of thousands of East Timor refugees
living in squalid camps on the West Timor border face starvation by
the end of the month because, government officials and aid workers
in the divided island said Wednesday, they are running out of food.
</P>
<P>
   The officials called for quick intervention from the central
government or the international community, saying they feared an
outbreak of violence if the refugees become desperate for food and
begin to riot.
</P>
<P>
   International aid organizations had been providing some food and
medical assistance to the refugee camps. But those groups withdrew
from West Timor early this month after the brutal slayings of three
U.N. workers by militia groups linked to the Indonesian military.
With little medicine and with food and water supplies dwindling,
conditions in the hot dusty camps, which house an estimated 120,000
refugees, have deteriorated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only enough food to last for a few more weeks, and
after that people will start to starve,'' Petrus Ribero, head of
the Indonesian Red Cross in the West Timor capital, Kupang, said in
a telephone interview. Ribero said that Red Cross workers, who are
no longer being harassed by the militia forces and are now freely
visiting the camps, do not have enough supplies to distribute. He
said the refugees are particularly in need of proper housing now
that the rainy season has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people fled East Timor last year when
pro-Indonesia militia groups went on a killing rampage after the
territory voted for independence from Indonesia in a referendum
organized by the United Nations. Aid groups have said that they
will not return to West Timor until Indonesia improves security
there. And the United States has warned Indonesia that if it does
not disband the militia in West Timor, it risks diplomatic and
economic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address international concerns over the
military, President Abdurrahman Wahid on Wednesday fired the deputy
commander of the armed forces, Gen. Fachrul Razi. The four-star
general's dismissal came just two days after Wahid replaced the
national police chief for failing to resolve a series of bomb
attacks in Jakarta and growing unrest across the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Wahid administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that the general lost his job because the president
was unhappy with the military's slow pace of reform and its failure
to stop the militia from killing the aid workers in West Timor.
Witnesses have said that the military and local police stood by and
watched the slayings. ``I suppose you could say that today's firing
was equivalent to why the police chief got sacked,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the military, which ruled Indonesia for 32 years under the
former dictator, Suharto, continues to exercise considerable power,
and the removal of one general is not expected to change much.
Indeed, some political analysts said that firing the deputy
military commander was intended more to address international
threats of sanctions than to restructure the armed forces, which
have played a heavy hand in the regional and religious violence
that is currently sweeping the country. Officials have said that
the military is fanning the fires of unrest to derail the
government's prosecution of Suharto on corruption charges and
military officials for human rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Indonesia's top security minister, Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, told the U.N. Security Council in New York that the
armed forces would start forcibly disarming the militias if they do
not surrender their weapons by next Tuesday. But Yudhoyono said
that Indonesia still does not plan to receive a proposed U.N.
delegation that wanted to visit West Timor to observe what steps
the government was taking to disband the militia and prosecute
those responsible for the deaths of the aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal of the United Nations and most international
aid organizations from West Timor, the refugees are more vulnerable
than ever to the pro-Indonesia militia. Father Alex, a Catholic
priest from the Atambua Church, which was involved in distributing
food to the camps, said that militiamen continued to roam the
streets without any interference from the military and that some
militia members were stopping vehicles and extorting food and
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today I have not seen any evidence of the security
forces disarming the militia,'' the priest said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear more violence because the refugees would do anything,
including rampaging on the church or government offices or
commercial warehouses where food and supplies are located.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of West Timor's social services department, Yos
Mamulak, said the local government had distributed 1,040 metric
tons of rice _ the last of its stock _ to the refugee camps on
Sept. 9. He noted, however, that to feed the estimated 120,000
refugees, the agency needed 2,400 metric tons. Mamulak said that
West Timor's provincial government was waiting for more supplies
from the central government and that he hoped that the militia and
refugees would not resort to violence. ``It is terrifying for us
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for Wahid, Dharmawan Ronodipuro, said that the
government remained committed to assisting the refugees and that
additional aid was forthcoming, although he could not say how soon
it would arrive.

NEW VIDEO DISPLAYS MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF TINY DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several years, the military has created its maps using
computers rather than drawing boards. But when it comes time to use
them in battle, things become decidedly low tech. ``They take a
paper map and staple it to a 4-by-8 piece of plywood,'' said Jim
Birch, business development director for microsystems and displays
at the Sarnoff Corp. ``That's the army we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the military turned to Sarnoff, the successor company
to the David Sarnoff Research Center and RCA Laboratories, to be
part of a project to develop electronic maps. Birch said that what
is emerging from the research, however, is a technology that may
find widespread use off the battlefield. It should, according to
Birch, create jumbo-size (3 feet by 6 feet initially),
high-resolution, flat-panel displays that could be used for
everything from medical imaging to displacing projected film in
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a display out there right now that can show high
resolution over a large area,'' Birch said. The gigantic computer
displays tacked on buildings in Times Square, along the strip in
Las Vegas and at sports stadiums around the world generally use
light-emitting diodes, but at best they offer very low resolution.
``They're good for viewing by crowds from a distance,'' Birch said.
Plasma displays, a more recent and costly large-screen panel system
for computers, also fall short when fine detail is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme of the display resolution world, the best
high-definition televisions can produce an image made up of two
million picture elements, or pixels. That sounds impressive, but
Birch said that a 35-mm film negative generally contains at least
twice that number of pixels. An ordinary X-ray may have 8 million
pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor project is based in part on existing technologies.
Anyone who has attended a rock concert knows that one way to
construct a huge video display is to pile several monitors together
and then electronically divide the overall image among the screens.
The downfall of such systems, however, is the obvious seams
separating the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that it has found a way to make the seams or
gaps invisible without sacrificing image quality. In the past, some
systems have tried to minimize the gaps by electronically making
images slightly fuzzy where the screens meet. Sarnoff's solution to
unsightly seams, a technique Birch called tiling, has come from the
optical world.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype system will start with six LCD screens assembled to
form a 3-by-6-foot display. To boost their brightness, the screens
will be backlighted by special white, light-emitting diodes rather
than fluorescent lamps like those normally employed in laptop
computers. Then a layer of tiny lenses will be added on top of the
screen grid: every LCD screen in the grid will be topped with
hundreds'' of individual lenses, Birch said, although he declined
to give the exact number.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses, in turn, will be aimed to project a seamless image
on a plastic screen that provides the final layer of the screen's
sandwich. Unlike bulky rear-projection systems now used for the
huge televisions favored by sports bars, the new Sarnoff system
will be just 10 inches thick regardless of the overall screen
display size. (Production models will probably be only eight inches
thick.) Not only is the system seamless, but Sarnoff estimates that
it will be able to display 30 million pixels.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for topographic map users but troubling for
engineers. The problem, quite simply, is that current computer
technologies can't move that much data from a computer's central
processing unit to the screen fast enough to allow, for example,
full-motion video. The image would be trapped in electronic
gridlock on its way to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of developing a new type of image server, Sarnoff solved
the problem in a 32-inch, 3-million-pixel demonstration prototype
by sharing the workload. Each of the LCDs in the system is fitted
with its own Pentium processor. Software developed by Sarnoff
allows the main computer controlling the on-screen action to do
only a portion of the actual image processing before sending the
problem off, as a highly compressed data file, to the screens. The
Pentium chips on the LCDs then take those bundles, expand them and
finish the image processing. The Sarnoff system also has a way
around another phenomenon known to concertgoers. When stacked in a
grid, differences in color, brightness and contrast between
individual screens becomes glaringly obvious. Sarnoff is giving its
system the ability to watch itself. A video camera will take in the
entire scene and feed the image to software that will ensure, for
example, that a wayward screen doesn't render a pop star's nose _
or any other object _ excessively red or unnaturally bright.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sarnoff lab finishes its first large prototypes,
probably in the next year and a half, the company's scientists
won't exactly be overwhelmed with the material they can watch on
it. Outside of the Pentagon's maps, Birch said he isn't aware of
any digital images currently available that could take full
advantage of a 30-million-pixel screen, and current scanners are
unable to convert images made using other media to digital formats
with that degree of fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans counting on Sarnoff to give them every drop of blood
from the big game shouldn't start saving their money. Birch
estimated that the high-resolution, 3-by-6-foot screen would cost
$30,000 although a lower-resolution version suitable for
high-definition television could be available for $10,000. But cost
aside, Birch said, the high-resolution system would be overkill,
even for the keenest sports fans. ``Nobody,'' he said, ``needs 30
million pixels in their home right now.''  &QL;

POP REVIEW: IN TALES OF LOSS AND LONELINESS, A SINGER FINALLY FINDS
HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suddenly Emmylou Harris is a full-fledged songwriter.
She has spent most of her 25-year career recording other people's
music, occasionally placing a song of her own on an album. But for
her new ``Red Dirt Girl'' (Nonesuch), she simply decided to write a
whole album, then proceeded to come up with 11 of its 12 songs.
That gave her a small problem with stage patter when she started a
three-night stand on Monday night at Joe's Pub here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually preface songs with who wrote them,'' she said
ruefully. ``But I wrote them, so I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs say enough on their own. After years at the
intersection of traditionalist country, country rock and folk rock,
Harris remade her music on her 1995 album, ``Wrecking Ball.''
Working with the producer and songwriter Daniel Lanois, she moved
her slender, reedy voice into a realm of echoing guitars and
muffled drums. Where she had once sung mostly about love, she took
up biblical language to sing about pilgrimages of heart and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   She has held on to Lanois' sound with her band Spyboy, which
envelops her voice rather than simply accompanies it. Above the
band's generally somber pulse, Harris' new songs contemplate
existential quests and pleas. ``Bang the drum slowly,'' she sang in
one, ``I'll speak of things holy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her melodies are rooted in hymns, fiddle tunes and the
rock-ribbed symmetry of old-time country songwriting, particularly
that of the Carter family. The Carters' songs are grounded in an
unswerving faith and a willingness to face inevitable loss and
death. Harris carries Appalachian simplicity into less certain
times when sorrow is guaranteed but redemption is not. ``We lift
our prayer against the odds,'' she sang on Monday night, ``And fear
the silence is the voice of God/And we cry Hallelujah.''
</P>
<P>
   She sang about desperate love, a lost child, an old man's death
and a friend's shattered dreams, with lyrics that easily moved
between personal detail and parable.
</P>
<P>
   The songs had the aphoristic concision of a seasoned songwriter:
``It was just another way for the heart to break/So she learned to
bend.'' To fight pretension, Harris sang quietly. Her voice has
never been pushy; it takes up the stoic clarity of mountain music,
adding a girlish sweetness. Now she often subdues it to a whisper,
or lets a pure note turn frayed and weary.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the air of fragility is the serene confidence of a singer
who knows the power of reticence to draw a listener closer. Harris'
voice inhabits her songs like a wraith, intangible but omnipresent.
</P>
<P>
   While the tunes seem classic, the music placed them in a modern
wilderness. Brady Blade on drums and Tony Hall on bass set up
marchlike cadences, while Buddy Miller played tolling guitar chords
that hung in the air. The music had undercurrents of country
shuffles and slow-rolling soul music. There were also broad,
deliberate spaces in the arrangements that were as resonant as a
cathedral ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   To vary the mood, Harris also had a few mountain gospel songs,
with vocal harmony from the band, and uptempo songs like Rodney
Crowell's ``I Ain't Livin' Long Like This,'' which gave Miller a
chance to show off some speed-fingered rockabilly and bluegrass
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the concert Harris kept the audience rapt with
music that was hushed and vulnerable, longing to be reverent. In
songs about lonely journeys and lost companions Harris has found
herself.

IT'S HARD TO ESCAPE CROWDS AT THE PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about getting tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a city north of Dallas, everybody is going to The Prison.
</P>
<P>
   A guy from Clyde Barrow's gang went there once. So did a guy
from the Charlie Manson cult.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody can go to the 1880-vintage county jail in
McKinney, reopened as The Prison, a Texas Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a private cell. The four remaining cells are
coveted seats for larger parties, but booths surround the cells on
the third floor of the jail, 115 S. Kentucky St.
</P>
<P>
   The old solitary confinement tank is now a full-service bar, The
Tank. The jailers' quarters and the old county sheriff's office are
dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to sit in a cell, and we just can't
accommodate them all,'' said Perry Moore, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing double the business we expected. We get visitors
from Florida and California who want to eat dinner in a Texas
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prison opened May 3, and two chefs have already escaped. The
menu has changed three times so the kitchen can handle crowds of
400 to 500 customers per night, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The jailhouse chicken-fried steak has been a steady seller,
along with a spicy black bean soup and several Southwestern
specialties. The Prison also offers a short menu of steaks, seafood
and grilled dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Prison is less crowded on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Moore
said. But _ just like always _ it's packed on Friday and Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any McKinney police officer for directions _ but be sure to
specify the ``cafe.'' &QL;

A TRIO OF SWEET, FRUITY RIESLINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By RENIE and STERLING STEVES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riesling is a perfect fit for Texas. It's light, refreshing and
the perfect complement to salads, seafood, or Thai and Pacific Rim
food on these still-warm fall evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma's Chateau St. Jean Johannisberg Riesling 1998 ($9) is a
deal. Orange blossom pops out in the aroma and in the taste. And
despite the sweetness of apricot and ripe pear, the taste is not
cloying. The off-dry Chateau St. Jean's riesling is a wine to be
conveniently kept in the refrigerator for an energizing glass after
work as you start dinner.
</P>
<P>
   From France's Alsatian region, Hugel et Fils Riesling ``Hugel''
1997 ($15) is classic with its vibrant, fresh taste in a lean
style. An underripe fruit taste of green apple, lemon, and
grapefruit offers good flavors with seafood dishes. Distinct floral
notes add to the complexity of this French riesling. The 1997
vintage had ideal weather conditions with just the right amount of
rain in the spring and plenty of sunshine in August and early
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this so different from the California riesling? It's
the soil, and its flinty mineral aspects. Australia has those same
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Blass Gold Label Riesling 1999 ($11.99) from South
Australia has a lime and passion fruit character with crisp
freshness that is delicious with Asian food. This is achieved
simply, but not without a great deal of thought to the end result.
The free run juice from the grapes is transferred to refrigerated
stainless-steel tanks to settle. No oak is used. Fermentation at
low temperatures preserves the fresh citric character. The
aftertaste continues with long and elegant citrus and floral
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Request these wines at your favorite wine shop.

   VIRTUAL-MUSEUMS _ Both the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate

about the presidential debates is full of candid comments from past

Reagan's quip about age. ``I was almost certain the campaign was

Clinton loved debating at a town meeting in 1992, but George Bush
could not help looking at his watch twice. ``I was glad when the
damn thing was over,'' Bush says. The special, ``Debating Our
Destiny: Forty Years of Presidential Debates,'' is based on

six of the debates, over a 10-year-period. By R.W. Apple. &QL;

   THEATER-PLAYWRIGHTS-ROUNDTABLE (New York) _ For the past 10
years, the Signature Theater Company, which devotes each of its
seasons to the work of one writer, has been home to many leading
playwrights, including Edward Albee and Arthur Miller. This season
it has invited each of its past nine resident writers to submit a
new play. The New York Times recently brought together some of
these playwrights to ask how their experiences at Signature had
affected their artistic process. The panel _ John Guare, Horten
Foote, Maria Irene Fornes, Miller and Albee _ was moderated by The
Times' theater columnist, Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-LIFEGAME-IMPROV (New York) _ Actors and producers of
``Lifegame'' say it is ``terrifying.'' Here's why. Every night, the
troupe takes a ``guest,'' preselected from volunteers, and quizzes
the guest about important events of his of her life. Then, the
seven-person troupe makes theater about that guest's life. On the
spot. For two hours. In front of an audience. Sometimes the troupe
might act out a guest's first kiss with puppets; other times the
guests might play themselves in a scene. Sometimes, the guest plays
God talking to an actor playing the guest. In short, no show is
ever the same. By Jesse McKinley.

   DANCE-WHEELDON-VIVALDI (Boston) _ Faced with a commission to
choreograph a 48-minute ballet to Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,''
Christopher Wheeldon listened to the composer's words inserted in
the score: ``In the winter, our feet chatter with cold. We shiver
in the snow.'' With that, Wheeldon's imagination took off as
everything else has for the 27-year-old choreographer. In 1993, he
took a guest class at the New York City Ballet and two days later
was offered a position in the company. Since last spring when he
announced he was retiring from performing, he has created new works
for City Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Ballet of
London and a workshop of a Marvin Hamlisch-John Guare musical,
``The Sweet Smell of Success.'' After the Vivaldi premier Thursday,
it's back to the City Ballet and then on to Calgary, Alberta, and

arena floor in front of the stage and high aloft in the gallery.
Lines of Prommers form outside on the day of a concert. Some wait
to buy tickets for less than $5. For the most part, the Prommers
spend the time before concerts collecting money for charities and
engaging in polite conversation, but once performances begin, the
intense silence is impressive. On the Last Night of Proms, as the
capstone is called, lunacy prevails and Prommers sing along, wave

those critical years. We see him at 23 with tousled hair, a bulbous
nose, a small mouth and round eyes. Two years later, having
achieved fame and some fortune, to a large extent from
experimenting with images of his own face, he moved from Leiden to
Amsterdam, the commercial and artistic center of the Netherlands.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA PROBES CASES INVOLING SUSPECT TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California is investigating whether the Ford
Motor Co. or Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. violated state laws in the
wake of revelations that unusually high accident fatality ratios
involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires were known long before
the companies called attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer recently assigned two
lawyers from his office to begin coordinating an investigation with
other states, including Florida, Michigan, Tennessee and South
Carolina, according to a California Department of Justice source
familiar with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The number of lawyers may be expanded as California's role in
the investigation becomes clearer and if any evidence of wrongdoing
emerges, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the advocacy group Consumers Union called on Lockyer
to launch an inquiry into whether either or both of the two
companies violated California's Corporate Criminal Liability Act,
which requires company officers to alert state officials to
dangerous product defects and allows for criminal penalties,
including jail time and fines, when they are convicted of failing
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Lockyer, would
only say that the attorney general was ``working with other states
to look into the Firestone tire matter, and we'll use all
appropriate enforcement tools.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of accident records related to
Firestone tires released by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday, there have been 19 deaths
stemming from 12 accidents over the last 14 years in California.
There have been a total of 393 such accidents in the state during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. has recalled 6.5 million ATX, ATX II
and Wilderness AT tires, and announced last week that it would
provide free replacements to owners of 1.4 million other tires that
the NHTSA said could be unsafe. It may take the company until the
end of the year to complete the recall and replacements program.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone tires were recalled in 16 foreign countries more than
a year before action was taken in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has accused Firestone of withholding data that could have
led to a quicker recall. Firestone has asserted the Explorer design
contributed to rollovers when blow-outs or tread separations
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 lawsuits have been filed nationwide against the auto
and tire makers, the bulk of them by about 10 lawyers, said Frank
Pitre, a lawyer representing the family of a California woman who
was killed in and accident involving a Ford Explorer with Firestone
Wilderness AT tires said.

HINTS OF THE FAR EAST AND EGYPTIAN VILLAGE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Some people here call it ``taste slippage,'' the
irrational craving that sometimes overtakes expatriates in Egypt to
fill their homes with lamps made from papier-mache camels,
recycled-glass pyramids, mirrors shaped like minarets and framed
hieroglyphics on papyrus.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic reproductions, whether kitschy or craftsy, fortunately
never tempted Michel Pastore, a Swiss potter turned fabric maker
and decorator, and Sylva Nasrallah, a Lebanese fashion designer.
Partners in a clothing and home furnishings business here called
Nagada, the two have instead managed a quirky kind of fusion that
hints simultaneously of the Orient and of Europe and borrows
architectural forms from the Far East and Egyptian village life.
</P>
<P>
   In the homes that they have designed and furnished, Nasrallah
and Pastore embrace pared-down simplicity. The same is true in
their geometrically cut clothing, wall hangings, upholstery,
linens, lamps and bedding, all fashioned from simply designed
Egyptian cotton. Their designs are not primitive so much as
calming, an antidote to this dusty, cacophonous city.
</P>
<P>
   The two have carved out a particular niche. Most modern design
in the Middle East tends toward the overwrought: lots of marble
floors, gilded furniture, ornate chandeliers and reception rooms
crammed with small tables loaded with figurines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aesthetic goes much further than what is in our own
environment,'' said Nasrallah, a Beirut-born dynamo of Armenian
heritage who came to Egypt to escape Lebanon's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realized over time is that you need to go to the roots
of things,'' she added. ``A lot of people say, `Your designs look
Japanese.' Others say they look South American. But these countries
all meet at the beginning _ look at the similarities of the ancient
jewelry and pottery. When you make clothes inspired by tradition,
they always meet up with other traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her design ethic married well with that of Pastore, a puckish
white-bearded artist who joined forces with her five years ago to
create Nagada. He, too, is a transplant to Egypt, and has lived for
30 years with his family, Robinson Crusoe style, in a sprawling mud
brick compound constructed bit by bit in a desert oasis on the
outskirts of Faiyum, about two hours southwest of Cairo. It is
shaded by date palms and suffused with the scent of hibiscus and
roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what comes from Europe and what comes from
Egypt,'' Pastore said. ``I can't isolate one from the other, and I
don't want to. What I believe, deeply, is that if you are creative,
you are creative and you have to let it come.''
</P>
<P>
   Their creative union, like the living spaces and clothing they
design, owes more to serendipity than to a master plan. They met
through a mutual friend at a time when Pastore was struggling to
revive production of traditional Egyptian hand-loomed cotton and
Nasrallah was scouring dusty Egyptian markets for interesting
fabrics to use in her dress designs.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry was right. Now, Nasrallah's husband, Ramzi,
manages the financial end of Nagada. The store's line of dinnerware
and pottery, hand-decorated with imaginary animals and fanciful
figures, is supplied by Pastore's longtime partner, Evelyne Porret,
who runs a pottery school in their Faiyum home. And Pastore, the
jack-of-all-trades in the enterprise, designed the Nasrallah
family's airy and eclectic home in a 1907 apartment house on an
island in the Nile, in central Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   It all began, though, in Nagada, one of the oldest inhabited
settlements in the world. In this weaving village in Upper Egypt,
the peasants had for generations produced a simple zigzag design on
local cotton using hand looms that were little changed from the
times of the Pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, after political tensions between Egypt and Sudan dried
up the traditional market, no one was buying the primitive
primary-color Nagada fabrics anymore. Pastore, recruited by friends
who worked in a Canadian-financed program to help revive Egypt's
impoverished south, installed himself in the village and coaxed the
weavers to teach him their craft _ wordlessly, since his Arabic was
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Working within the limitations of the hand looms, operated by
weavers on the ground in front of their homes, he brought new
inspiration to Nagada based on old designs: feathery symbols
resembling single stalks of grain; repeated pyramid shapes filled
in with subtle striping; muted pinstripes of mauves, blues and
grays.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagada fabric evokes classical Middle Eastern tapestry
design _ the simple geometric motifs of Coptic weaving from the
early centuries of Christianity and the bold lines of Islamic
embroidery _ but does not mimic it. ``My idea was to find the
richness of traditional design and make it modern and relevant,''
Pastore said. ``For me, the idea was to be modern in the sense of
primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   As their business, on the third floor at 8 Dar El Shefa Street,
in the Garden City neighborhood of Cairo, has become a place of
pilgrimage for expatriates, diplomats and hip young Egyptians (who
purchased 7,000 items last year), Pastore, 57, and Nasrallah, 39,
have ventured for variety beyond the Nagada village fabrics. (They
have also set up a site on the Internet, www.nagada.net, to help
promote their wares outside Egypt. In the United States,
information about Nagada products is available by e-mail from:
xs99(at)po.cwru.edu.)
</P>
<P>
   Pastore and Nasrallah now occasionally garnish their clothes and
linens with panels of Indian and Chinese silk. But they never
choose imported fabric that screams India or China, just as their
own cotton does not necessarily connote Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   That aversion to a stylized Orientalism comes through in
Pastore's interior designs. For the Nasrallahs' 2,700-square-foot
Cairo apartment, a typically sprawling space in its wealthy
neighborhood, he used color, staggered ceiling heights, Nagada
fabric and a bit of whimsy to create a comfortable home in which
the Middle East plays just one note.
</P>
<P>
   The overpowering height of the ceilings, 15 feet, made Nasrallah
and her husband feel they were living in a tower. To humanize the
dimensions, Pastore lowered the ceilings in the corridors, dressed
them with cotton in a muted geometric pattern that evokes a
Caucasian carpet, and added wood beams. To scale down the expanse
of wall in other rooms, he painted the uppermost few feet in dark
colors or broke up the space by painting minaret-shaped silhouettes
along the walls at eye level.
</P>
<P>
   In one renovated bathroom, Pastore playfully borrowed from
Egyptian village architecture, creating a roomy octagonal shower
stall that ascends to a dome punctured with holes for venting and
light. It looks like a traditional village house, built for summer
coolness and winter warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore has no problem with modernity, however. The Nasrallahs'
kitchen is brought down to family size by a steel grid stretching
across the room to hold spot halogen lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michel designs a space, he wants you to think everything
has always been there,'' said Nasrallah, whose lattice-work wooden
Egyptian furniture and collection of carved wooden doors now fit
seamlessly into the apartment. ``It's space, light and colors. Then
the objects are integrated. Nothing should stick out and shout.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In the house that Pastore and his family built in the Faiyum
oasis, he also took his cues from the environment. Originally a set
of four simple mud-brick rooms facing a central courtyard, the
walled compound now encompasses pottery workshops and a lush garden
of bougainvillea, hibiscus, flame trees, poinsettia and wild roses.
</P>
<P>
   Water from a nearby lake, visible as a ribbon of blue against
the backdrop of mauve desert hills, feeds a bathing pool and a
stream lined with reeds and filled with water lilies. Date palms
dot the property.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always like this. The original houses had been built
in 1967 by Porret, who is also Swiss, and her former husband. For
years they stood empty. When she returned with Pastore and their
two small children, in 1970, they found what they call ``a house in
a desert of stones.''
</P>
<P>
   As they renovated and added on, the family lived a rustic life.
The village, far from the center of Faiyum, had no running water or
electricity for 10 years. They built when they had money and
according to their needs and fancies. ``We saw that the village
houses had palm trees in the courtyard, and we loved that,'' Porret
recalled as she walked the winding pathway through the gardens of
her backyard. ``So when we started building, we built around the
palm trees that we found on the property.''
</P>
<P>
   They made their own bricks. ``We built according to concrete
needs,'' Pastore said. ``It was not anything terribly
intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   At first they enthusiastically planted everything they thought
might provide shade for them and a habitat for birds. Just about
everything but eucalyptus and cactus died. A covered bridge,
salvaged intact, stretches from the top of one building to another.
Corn grows in pockets of the garden, which is finally a colorful
jumble of plants. Mud brick benches, covered with pillows and
inlaid with bits of pottery, run along the inside of the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nagada, it is a work in progress. ``I never begin a project
with an idea that it must be this or that,'' Pastore said. ``I work
totally in the present _ from present to present.''

DESIGNERS STUMBLE WITH ``GIRLY'' CLOTHES &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
NEW YORK _ Now and then _ and increasingly too often _ a trend
comes along that goads even a hard-core aficionado of high fashion
to use the word dreck.
<P>
   Take the current runway craze for girly clothing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Girly may be the mildest adjective one can pin on a style that
runs the gamut from provocative necklines and snippets of
embroidery to sequined hot pants and beaded bikinis, styles that
crop up in the collections of both Oscar de la Renta and Marc
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Bryant Park tent, de la Renta's collection for spring 2001
began with nice &UR;  &LR; wood-beaded sweaters and crystal-pleated skirts
for day, but quickly slipped to colorfully striped crystal-pleated
tennis skirts. Skirts so short that, like tennis players, women
would need matching panties. Perhaps they could toss on one of the
designer's candy-striped mackintoshes when they need a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, de la Renta blundered into the revival of that '80s
abomination _ the pouf skirt. While some were of decent lengths,
even though they looked like colorful toadstools, one in hot pink
was short enough to resemble an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of seeing these tuffets, last popularized in modern
times by Christian Lacroix in the '80s, was enough to blunt the
senses to some of de la Renta's colorful yet wearable
mustard-yellow leathers and good black dresses, even if he felt the
poufs and ultraminis were only runway dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Jacobs, there was not much in his collection
that moved past the point of girlish style.
</P>
<P>
   Shown at night, in a clear tent specially constructed on a
corner in Greenwich Village, the colorful collection had retail
store buyers scratching their heads. Who is the potential buyer for
short, tiered cotton ruffle skirts and wide, hip-slung belts in a
market where Jacobs' cotton camp shirts sell for $300 and more?
</P>
<P>
   Accessorized with hair ornaments, silly jewelry, leather
bustiers, sheer jersey shirts and gaudy T-shirts, this collection
looked as if it belonged on the Girls Rule! runway. At least there
such labels as Planet Yumthing, Gasoline and CoolWear show denims,
hot pants and ruffled skirts priced for the appropriate audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' collection choices seem even stranger when viewed
alongside the launch of his new line, Marc. Admittedly not a
younger, cheaper version of his signature line, Marc is
nevertheless slated to sell at $80-$300, with leather from $500 to
$1,000 _ in other words, aimed at the woman who isn't likely to pay
$1,000 for one of Jacobs' signature sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Marc line includes more tiers of ruffles, safari shirts,
military coats, smocking, big buttons and references to fashions
from many decades. Which is fine, even accessorized with banana
hair clips and plastic dice. The line is not slated to be
derivative of Jacobs' signature line, but in a season when there
doesn't appear to be much in that collection for his customer who
adores fine but young tailoring, the Marc line could be the
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A passion for prints
</P>
<P>
   Even Linda Allard's spring designs for Ellen Tracy fell into
some of the traps of overly girly fashion. Exactly where would one
wear gilded leather shorts or black and white polka-dot sequined
hot pants?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Allard offers gilded linen blazers, a red
patent leather suit cutely piped in white, and deep cowl necklines
on sleeveless blouses and dresses. The latter are feminine, even
sexy, without displaying a lot of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Allard knows enough to add the now-trendy big loop earrings to
all her looks and scores with a khaki iridescent leather jacket
worn over a pale flesh-toned beaded chiffon camisole and matching
leather jeans. Mauve and lavender leathers and tweeds, as well as
shots of a fresh deco green add the spice of color Ellen Tracy
customers appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   There are prints here, too, as most designers accept these as
the next logical step after customers' acceptance of color. At
Ellen Tracy, prints begin with chartreuse and tangerine animal
spots and move on to stylized florals. At Nicole Miller, a designer
who built her reputation on patterns, prints include Op Art
triangles, bamboo leaves with sequins, Art Deco geometrics and
leopard print mixed with florals.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Miller messes up some fine architecturally cut
black evening dresses with daisy-chain ornaments and straps, and
splashes large gaudy floral pendants on many of her day looks.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh flavors
</P>
<P>
   Max Azria's designs for his BCBG women's wear collection include
graphic stripes and circles, stylized camouflage prints almost like
animal spots (seen in the menswear, too) and floral chiffons. In
colors from the '20s and '30s, such as rose, pistachio, mauve and
mulberry, they look fresh, not cloying.
</P>
<P>
   BCBG's tabard-style cashmere shells have slash armholes, merely
two pieces of fabric fit together, giving a new twist to a
safari-toned group that includes patent leather skirts.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, Azria still likes black with beaded strapless
dresses or cashmere shells with beaded cotton trousers, styles that
pleased audience members Vivica Fox and Lauren Holly.
</P>
<P>
   At Badgley Mischka, where Mary Steenburgen was in the crowd,
evenings are a bit more complicated with a hoard of Hollywood or
Las Vegas hard-edged glamour and glitz dresses. Especially stunning
was a gold-beaded wrap top with a white A-shaped skirt worn with
gold stiletto sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Then the designers, Mark Badgley and James Mischka, surprised
with the simplicity of jersey shirtdresses sprinkled with
rhinestones and deep V-neckline dresses with asymmetrical hems.

WILL STAR QUALITY PREVAIL?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe,'' Darren Star's new series premiering Friday on
the WB, is based on the idea that onscreen TV melodrama is nothing
compared with what happens when the cameras stop rolling. Probably
no series premise this fall is more true, as Star has discovered in
the run-up to the premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Star's reputation has prospered of late thanks to his HBO hit
``Sex and the City.'' So much so, in fact, that he is considered
one of the top writer/producers in the industry. He's also one of
the most prolific; he's soon to add ``The Street,'' centered on
Wall Street, giving him three series airing at once.
</P>
<P>
   Star, 39, last tried a TV hat trick when his ``Central Park
West'' joined ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Melrose Place'' some
years back, only to crash and send Star dashing for cable. At the
time, Star was lauded by network executives for his ability to lure
audiences. But what he used for bait _ melodramas soaked in lowbrow
fantasy, glamour and sometimes silliness _ hardly earned him the
respect he craved.
</P>
<P>
   The critically acclaimed ``Sex'' changed that, however, and with
the satirical ``Grosse Pointe'' he hopes to show that he can
continue to defy expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem is that ``Grosse Pointe,'' a
tongue-in-cheek look at a teen-ager-oriented TV serial not unlike
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' is being watched very closely by his
fellow _ and former _ colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Battle lines were drawn long before the premiere date, and so
far, Star seems to be in retreat. The most visible point of
contention thus far: The former ``90210'' producer created a
``Grosse Pointe'' character called Marcy Sternfeld, an insecure,
emotionally challenged girl whose family connections landed her a
part on the fictional series within the series. There was also an
episode in which the actress became sick because of an eating
disorder. Short on talent and tact (she appears to be the only one
unaware that she's a terrible actress who owes her job to her dad),
Marcy was one of the funniest parts of ``Grosse Pointe'' _ until
Tori Spelling, the former ``90210'' cast member whose father, Aaron
Spelling, produced ``90210'' and ``Melrose Place,'' learned about
the spoof and didn't find it all that humorous.
</P>
<P>
   Star says he never had Tori in mind when writing the character.
The problem with that defense is that the actress he cast as Marcy,
Lindsay Sloane, is a dead ringer for the young Spelling, in looks
and mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   Star got a call from Aaron Spelling, and Star not only changed
the character's hair color but also tossed out the nepotism back
story and the scene involving the eating disorder. (Tori Spelling,
like many impossibly thin actresses, has long denied tabloid
reports that she has an eating disorder.)
</P>
<P>
   After the near-universal acclaim he has received as
producer/writer for ``Sex and the City,'' Star must be a little
surprised that not everyone trusts him to do right by his
characters. But Aaron Spelling and others in the business are
probably remembering the Star of the ``90210'' and ``Melrose
Place'' years, when writing was actually dumbed down so as not to
confuse the beautiful people who were saying the lines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pleasures of Star's soapy series were almost
entirely campy ones. All his characters speak in stilted,
melodramatic sentences, and there are lots of bedroom scenes in
which the men are shirtless and sweaty and the women even more so _
although almost never without their high heels.
</P>
<P>
   The Star signature episode included gorgeous locales populated
by gorgeous airheads who were constantly playing power games and
pulling nasty schemes.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Sex,'' Star was finally allowed to write ``up,'' as he
calls it, challenging viewers to come along for a ride even if they
were unsure of the destination. His writing was often appropriately
glib and sanguine, and the characters were always vibrant and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In what has now become a template for all ``Sex'' writers, the
final moments of the comedy veer off into a kind of brave new world
that's not simply comedy or drama, but poignant and believable, and
certainly emotionally satisfying. It's the kind of creative device
David E. Kelley used successfully with ``Ally McBeal'' in its first
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Star, who grew up in suburban Washington, D.C., always saw
himself in Hollywood, doing what he's doing. He majored in creative
writing at the University of Southern California and UCLA,
graduating in 1983 and taking jobs as an assistant to a publicist
by day and a waiter by night.
</P>
<P>
   His talent was undeniable. He sold his first screenplay, ``Doin'
Time on Planet Earth,'' when he was all of 24. That gave him his
first taste of how Hollywood works; the movie was never made. But
Star earned enough money to quit his side jobs, and he started
churning out _ and selling _ one screenplay after another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Fox Television asked Star to write a show about
high-school life in Beverly Hills with Aaron Spelling's production
company. Star used his high school experiences _ or, more
precisely, his fantasies of high school _ to give the show that
certain something. ``Melrose Place,'' a ``90210'' spinoff, was
based partly on his experiences in a courtyard apartment complex he
lived in after college.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable Star-Spelling split occurred in 1996 when Star
moved to New York and launched ``Central Park West'' for CBS.
Star's critics jumped on the failure, saying he couldn't exist
without Spelling's guiding hand.
</P>
<P>
   The young writer/producer was determined to prove them wrong _
and his platform, he decided, would be sex. Star believed that
network TV writers simply didn't know how to stage sex, that they
had little idea how _ or simply weren't allowed _ to give it its
three necessary components: confrontation, honesty and sweetness.
They approached sex like teen-age boys, Star once said, using
euphemisms and often silly, generic terms.
</P>
<P>
   He is, needless to say, right. Sex is instrumental in the story
lines of most network series, from ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' to the
higher-minded scripts Aaron Sorkin turned out for ``Sports Night.''
But the jokes are always about what you can't say or do. (Seinfeld
was a master at that.) There was a gap between what people sitting
in the room thought was funny and what was actually on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Star was able to capture the honesty in his TV sexual
encounters by moving over to the no-holds-barred freedom of HBO, a
freedom he won't have with ``Grosse Pointe.'' The challenge for
Star _ and challenge is absolutely necessary _ is to succeed again
on network television, but this time with the elevated level of
quality he brought to ``Sex and the City.'' &QL;

<P>
   It is essential to prune the shade trees around your house at
least once a year. Sometimes the reasons for pruning are obvious. A
severe storm can break limbs and leave them dangling from the
trunk. Trees near the house with long limbs that hang over the roof
offer a path into your home for squirrels and raccoons. Also,
leaves falling from these limbs can collect in the gutters and clog
the downspouts. Even if these conditions do not exist, careful
pruning of diseased or dead limbs can produce healthier, fuller
shade trees.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to prune trees is during the winter into the early
spring when trees are dormant. The pruning will stimulate growth in
the later spring and as the trees come to life and start growing,
the pruning cuts will heal. Some deciduous trees, like maple,
birch, elm and walnut, may ooze sap when pruned in the winter.
While this is not a serious condition, it can be minimized by
pruning them earlier in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you will need tools for pruning. Start with a simple
hand pruner. These plier-like tools are good for trimming branches
up to 3/4 of an inch in diameter. For thicker branches of up to 1
1/2 inches in diameter, invest in lopping shears. These have
scissor jaws like the pruning shears but longer handles that give
you more cutting power.
</P>
<P>
   Shears like pruners or loppers have two types of blade
configurations: anvil or scissor. Shears with an anvil
configuration have one sharp blade. The other blade is thicker and
has no edge. This type of tool is useful for cutting back shrubs
with a lot of dead seasonal branches. Anvil shears, however,
actually crush and break the branches rather than cutting through
them. Scissor shears have two sharp blades that bypass each other
to make clean close cuts through the branch. These are the better
choice for careful pruning tasks.
</P>
<P>
   For large branches, you will need a pruning saw. There are two
types: the bow saw and the curved pruning saw. The bow saw has a
straight flat blade secured in a rigid aluminum frame. The saw is
lightweight and easy to handle, but the frame can be difficult to
maneuver in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The curved pruning saw has a thicker curved blade mounted in a
handle. Some curved saws have sockets in the handle that accept
extension handles. These enable you to cut high branches without a
ladder. Pruning trees is relatively safe work, but it's still a
good idea to don safety gear like heavy-duty gloves, goggles and
even a hard hat when you have to cut heavy overhead branches.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing any cutting, step back and survey the entire branch
structure of the tree. Look for branches that may be broken and
hanging. These pose a safety hazard and should be cut away first.
Next, look for dead or diseased branches. These should be cut
because they can spread their blight into the tree. When pruning
dead branches, always cut back to healthy wood.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for stubs jutting from the trunk. Stubs are short
projections resulting from bad pruning or a broken branch. Since
the stubs bear no leaves, they quickly die and turn into dead wood.
They should be cut from the trunk before they spread decay to the
interior of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Look for branches that cross and rub against each other. At
least one of these branches should be cut off before it gets too
big and weakens the overall structure of the tree. Finally, look at
the base of the tree for suckers. These are short sprouts that grow
vertically from the roots. They rob the tree of water and
nutrients, yet add nothing to its structure.
</P>
<P>
   When cutting a branch, do not cut it flush with the trunk; this
will create a wide wound that will take longer to heal. Instead,
cut the branch back to the growth collar, the swollen trunk area at
the base of the branch. Do not try to saw a branch through with one
cut because the weight of the branch will cause it to fall away and
tear a strip of bark from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the limb by making three cuts. The first cut should be
made below the branch about four inches from the trunk. Cut to a
depth of about one-third of the branch diameter. Make the second
cut by sawing down from the top of the branch into the bottom cut.
This will sever the branch and leave a short stub. Saw the stub off
at the growth collar.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it was the standard practice to coat a pruning
wound with either asphalt, paint or shellac, but today most experts
feel that this practice serves no purpose. In fact, it may possibly
damage the tree by sealing in moisture that could cause rot and
decay.

AT HOME WITH CHRISTOPHER GIBBS

 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON HAMPDEN, England _ ``I rather like the idea of a whole
new phase of life, with fewer possessions,'' Christopher Gibbs
said, somewhat unconvincingly. Gibbs, 62, was gazing wistfully at
the handsome stone exterior of the Manor House at Clifton Hampden,
a rambling three-story house in Oxfordshire built for his family in
the 1840s, which he reluctantly sold in July.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate collector, antiques dealer, bibliophile and
provenance fetishist, Gibbs plainly has mixed emotions about
bidding adieu to the house and most of its contents, which
Christie's will auction off in 802 lots on Monday and Tuesday in a
vast tent on the lawn. ``I wish I could stay here forever,'' he
admitted. ``But it's quite a caper to keep a place like this
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from as far as Cairo and Manhattan are expected to show
up at the manor, an hour from London, for the four-day viewing of
one of the most intriguing and eccentrically diverse English
country house sales in years.
</P>
<P>
   A connoisseur of the weird and wonderful _ among the items for
sale is a Victorian stuffed two-headed lamb (estimated at $300 to
$600) _ Gibbs is something of a legend in British and international
circles as a style guru and playmate to everyone from John Paul
Getty Jr. to Bob Geldof and Mick Jagger, whose various mansions he
has stocked with treasures.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a leading proponent of that elusive brand of
anti-decoration, high-bohemian taste favored by self-confident
Englishmen, a look based on well-worn grandeur, disarming charm and
unexpected contrasts. The magic is in the mix of masterpieces and
oddities _ like an assemblage of refined and wild-card house guests
who mysteriously combine to create the ideal convivial
country-house weekend. The allergy here is to the banal, not to
dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aesthetic that emanates from great culture and
personal passions _not from merely traipsing around the D&AMP;D
Building,'' said Peter Dunham, a Los Angeles-based interior
designer who planned to trek from Beverly Hills for the sale. ``I'm
going not just because there are wonderful things to buy, but
because I expect it to be an incredible learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that learning comes from seeing the items in situ.
Dunham had previously seen them only in the plump Christie's
catalog, though as a schoolboy he often visited Gibbs' London
store. ``It was an education in an alphabet of style quite
particular to Christopher Gibbs. A for atmosphere. B for beauty. C
for culture. And some would add D for decayed and E for
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last category might be the dining table cut from a slice
of wood thought to be one of the first pieces of mahogany
transported to England from the New World by Charles II's navy in
the 17th century, which should fetch $30,000 to $60,000, by
Christie's estimate. ``Pepys would probably have sat at this
table,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   He is besotted by objects that possess illustrious or peculiar
histories. One object of desire is an embroidered Elizabethan purse
that belonged to the first Lord Yarmouth, treasurer to James II,
containing a talismanlike fragment of the monarch's blue silk
garter enclosed in a wisp of paper bearing the words, ``King James'
Garter _ I touch and God cures.'' ($15,000 to $30,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrissie even knows the provenance of a pebble,'' said Min
Hogg, the editor of The World of Interiors and a friend of more
than 40 years. ``Taste is impossible to define, but his is absolute
perfection. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of sales and catalogs,
but I love that he can also be entranced by the beauty of a simple
glass cabinet full of nothing in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs plans to hold on to several objects that possess no
discernible value but delight. ``Oh, I could never part with
that,'' he said, pointing to a faded 1930s metal hamper in his
bathroom, bearing the words ``Soiled Linen.'' His favorite
treasure, also not for sale, is a fragment of a statue of a Greek
youth, or kouros _ ``you know, those young men with slanty eyes and
narrow hips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the waist to top of the thigh,'' he added. ``It was found
under a table at Villa Malcontenta by Bruce Chatwin, from whom I
bought it. It's always called `Chatwin's Bottom. ''
</P>
<P>
   Although ostensibly of sound mind, Gibbs appears to dote on
artworks that depict madness. ``There are lots of freaky people
here,'' he noted, alighting on a series of framed pictures adorning
the cluttered upstairs hall. One favorite is a 19th-century
portrait of John Nichols Thom, a onetime Cornish wine merchant
pictured in a dashing scarlet Maltese costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a famous con man, a deluded person who went under many
names,'' Gibbs said. ``He called himself Sir William Courtenay,
Knight of Malta, the Earl of Devon, and Count Moses Rothschild. It
all got a little out of hand when he tried passing himself off as
the King of Jerusalem and the Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a hand-colored lithograph of Dennis Collins, a
19th-century peg leg and rogue charged with trying to kill William
IV in Abingdon, a few miles down the road from here. ``Every loony
must go,'' Gibbs said, pointing to a red Christie's label attached
to the frame. (It is expected to bring $300 to $450.)
</P>
<P>
   While he will clearly miss the manor house and its contents _
along with the statuary-filled garden he has created along the
Thames since inheriting the property in 1980 _ Gibbs is hardly
homeless. He has four residences, including two houses in Morocco,
a splendid pied-a-terre in historic Albany (the traditional London
residence for those with grand country estates) and a thatched
cottage he has rented in Clifton Hampden. For now, he has no
intention of giving up his celebrated antiques shop in Dove Walk,
just off Pimlico Road in London. Recently, it was full of carved
Jacobean ebony chairs, Moroccan tribal rugs and gargantuan
18th-century bookcases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sentimental attachment to his ancestral home _ where
he went to live at 8 _ will be hard to shake, Gibbs said, noting
that the 12th-century church next door holds the remains of
numerous forebears. (He traces his aristocratic pedigree to the
16th century, with various titled ancestors along the way who
topped up the family fortunes by marrying heiresses.) But as a
single man, he said, ``there comes a moment in life that you feel
rather absurd living in a great big house on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer, the only other habitual occupant was Louisa
Wagland, his housekeeper of 25 years. Shelves in the kitchen hold
photographs from the 90th-birthday party Gibbs gave in her honor in
June, in a spectacular Moroccan tent he purchased for the occasion,
with all her great-grandchildren and friends from the village.
``She died two days later, which was very elegant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She had insisted on making his cups of tea to the very end. ``I
thought I was going to be arrested for employing someone so
antique,'' he said. The night before he was due to move to his new
cottage, he scattered Wagland's ashes in the manor garden, in
accordance with her wishes.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In a meadow at the edge of garden, overlooking a gentle bend in
the Thames, he recently erected a pinnacle from the roof of the
College Chapel at Eton. ``I thought I'd leave something behind,''
he said of the architectural fragment, which sits on a pedestal
engraved with a Latin inscription explaining that both the pinnacle
and Gibbs himself were expelled from Eton. The pinnacle was
timeworn, and had to be replaced. But why was Gibbs obliged to
leave?
</P>
<P>
   ``Various offenses,'' he said cheerfully. ``Illicit drinking,
panty raids of other boys' rooms _ that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the new monument was installed just days after Gibbs
completed paperwork to sell the estate, an event he referred to as
``signing the terrible deed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just terribly surprising to me,'' he recalled. ``I
thought lots of people would come and be instantly bewitched by the
place. Instead, they asked, `Is there only one radiator in this
room?'''
</P>
<P>
   (A Danish couple showed the appropriate enthusiasm and will take
possession of the property after the Christie's traveling circus of
security guards, auctioneers and packing crates has departed.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many aristocratic Englishmen reared mostly in
shivering-cold private schools, Gibbs seems to find a desire for
central heating faintly embarrassing. Objects that smack of newness
or have a gaudy shine are similarly infra dig. An elegantly faded
George II gilt wood girandole in the front hall has clearly not
been regilded since the 18th century _ the way Gibbs likes it.
Similarly, a tatty Victorian buttoned-leather chesterfield sofa
beside a William IV red-painted mahogany library table has a faded
patina that the catalog politely refers to as ``distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the estimates are hefty: Christie's predicts that the
table will bring $3,000 to $4,500. Hardly surprising, since
beaten-up treasures from Gibbs have never come cheap _ a phenomenon
he explained by insisting that he generally pays handsomely for
things himself, and has to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like things in their natural state _ people especially,'' he
said with a chuckle. ``As life goes by, that's what I admire.
Objects and people that are unmonkeyed with, that are themselves,
not trying to be something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs has recently been preoccupied with decorating his latest
house in Morocco and his new cottage in Clifton Hampton, in
anticipation of his retirement. ``Sixty-two is old enough to focus
your mind on the span that's likely to be allotted to you,'' he
said. ``The sense of mortality hones in.''
</P>
<P>
   Milly de Cabrol, a New York interior designer who visited him in
Tangier with mutual friends in August, was struck by how content
Gibbs seemed in his new mountainside home _ a simple but exquisite
house with an enormous garden overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar.
``He was wearing wonderful caftans,'' she recalled. ``And he looked
like Moses walking in the olive garden _ very peaceful, and looking
forward to spending more time there.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will achieve such sublime contentment on weekends at
his new Oxfordshire digs remains to be seen. After living in
tall-ceilinged splendor, he will have to adjust to the charming but
minuscule two-up, two-down cottage, which is notably smaller than
his former kitchen. Downstairs, the living room is barely taller
than his 6-foot-2 frame, and getting from his bedroom upstairs to
the bathroom requires bending almost double to clear the
four-foot-high doorway. Gibbs acknowledged that it was absolutely
tiny. ``But never mind,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started doing a bit of nest making,'' he added, gesturing
to the ornate but faded Moroccan textile fragment he has pinned up
on two sides of his cozy bedroom. ``Hopefully, with a few new
pretty bits and pieces, it'll be all right.''

FOR A KING MEMORIAL, WORDS SET IN STONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ga., Ala.)   By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As an orator, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. made rich use of metaphor, often alluding to landscape _
mountains, valleys and water, shade and sunlight _ to convey
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very fortunate; he understood what powerful imagery
landscape can evoke,'' said Bonnie Fisher, a landscape architect
and a partner in the ROMA Design Group, the San Francisco-based
architectural and landscape firm named last week as designer of the
Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, to be set among the
cherry trees along the Tidal Basin in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing King's own emotional power in a landscape will be the
formidable task of the memorial, to begin construction in 2003 on a
four-acre covelike bend in the basin, across from the Jefferson
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as the designer of the revitalized Embarcadero here,
a palm-studded oasis along the waterfront completed last June,
Fisher's firm specializes in public spaces, including the Third
Street Promenade in Santa Monica. The firm was chosen from among
870 entries in a design competition organized by the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity (King was a member), which Congress designated to
select the design and raise the money ``We didn't want it to be a
monument, but a living place,'' said Dr. Ed Jackson Jr., the
chairman of the design jury and the director of the Center for
Building Performance at the American Institute of Architects in
Washington. ``This design captured conceptually the words and
message of Dr. King.''
</P>
<P>
   The design was selected in a two-tiered jury process that
initially included the Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta and the
Indian architect Charles Correa, the designer of the Gandhi
memorial in Ahmedabad. The landscape of the new memorial is largely
inspired by imagery from the 1963 ``I have a dream'' speech,
drawing literally on metaphors, including the ``stone of hope''
hewn from the ``mountain of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   In consultation with Dr. Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University
history professor and the chief editor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. papers, Fisher and her partner Boris Dramov played off King's
references to hills and valleys, expressed in changes in grade;
smoothness and roughness, in various stone textures; and the
all-important symbolism of water, from streams to torrents (``we
will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and
righteousness like a mighty stream'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Water and mist will cool in the heat of the day,'' Fisher
said. ``Through water we wanted to build on King's words and the
crescendo effect of his sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Maya Lin's Civil Rights Memorial at the Southern Poverty
Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which also incorporates water, the
design embraces other martyrs to the civil rights movement,
including Medgar Evers and the four children killed in a bomb blast
at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. They will be
honored with 24 niches perched above a long crescent-shaped wall,
spaces of contemplation, from which water will flow.
</P>
<P>
   The wall will arc in a half circle to form a central open
gathering space. ``As in the civil rights movement,'' Dramov said,
``we wanted to express gathering force as well as personal
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will enter the memorial, the first site on the Mall to
commemorate an individual African-American, in numerous ways. The
formal entrance will be through two monolithic stone portals, to be
cut from Stone Mountain granite (``Let freedom ring from Stone
Mountain of Georgia''). Inscribed with King's words, the surfaces
will be polished but the edges left rough, like a boulder split
down the center. Its missing piece _ the ``stone of hope'' _ will
be visible near the perimeter of the Tidal Basin. Emerging from the
edge of this stone will be a sculptured image of King, ``as if he
embodies the stone itself,'' Dramov said.
</P>
<P>
   In what is perhaps a response to past design controversies,
especially at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the designers are
using a variety of techniques to tell their story, from water
flowing over inscriptions to nuanced sculpture. ``Some people
relate to words, some to pictures, some to symbols,'' Dramov said.
``We're committed to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added, ``If you have multiple experiences, it will
entice people to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The stone of hope will look out toward the Jefferson Memorial,
which is designed as a classical temple of democracy. It will be
inscribed with King's reference to democracy as ``a promissory note

   It will be pushed forward, ``to symbolize justice, hope and

``Remember, you guys made a promise.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When asked to describe ``Lifegame,'' the newest
import from the Improbable Theater in London, the show's creators
tend to use words like unfinished, imperfect and, most commonly,
scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying,'' said Lee Simpson, a performer and
co-director. ``It is, without a doubt, the show that remains the
most frightening of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the troupe takes a ``guest,'' preselected from a
group of volunteers and not (producers stress) a member of the
audience, and gently asks about the important events of his or her
lives. Then, from whatever the guest tells them, the seven-person
troupe makes theater about that guest's life. On the spot. For two
hours. In front of a paying audience.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the actual dramatic methodology also changes
from night to night. Sometimes the troupe might act out a guest's
first kiss with puppets; other times the guests might actually play
themselves in a scene. Sometimes, the guest literally plays God
talking to an actor playing the guest. (Confused?)
</P>
<P>
   In short, no show is ever the same. ``There's a point before we
go on where we say: `Is this actually a show? Is this going to be
of any interest to anyone?''' Simpson said with a laugh. ``And
there's no clue because the protagonist isn't there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of its actors' trepidation, ``Lifegame,'' which opens at
the Jane Street Theater on Thursday, comes to New York having wowed
audiences in London in 1998, and more recently, having sold out a
five-week run at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego over the
summer. In both incarnations, the show was also praised in reviews,
including the one in The Los Angeles Times, which described
``Lifegame'' as ``an ingenious twist on improvisational theater.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``Lifegame'' comes from the Improbable Theater is not a
complete surprise, considering the company's history of spooky and
eclectic work, including ``70 Hill Lane,'' a 1998 play that dealt
with a pesky poltergeist. Two of the group's artistic directors,
Simpson and Phelim McDermott, also directed last year's
``Shockheaded Peter,'' a hilariously subversive puppet show
featuring death, dismemberment and the world's creepiest sideshow
barker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifegame'' grew out of an exercise developed by Keith
Johnstone, the founder of the Royal Court Theater in London and an
expert in improvisation (or ``impro,'' as the Brits call it).
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, McDermott took part in a workshop with Johnstone in
Dorsett, England. He was surprised, he said, at the effect of the
exercise on the actors and &QL; 
the small audience of workshop participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impro, but it was things that were really memorable,''
McDermott said. So memorable, in fact, that McDermott said he was
committed to doing the show for a larger audience, though not in
the type of surroundings usually equated with improvisational
theater. ``I wanted to do it as a proper theater show, rather than
on the second floor of a pub,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the challenge of ``Lifegame'' has been avoiding the
pitfalls associated with improv, including treacle or easy laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing in the world is seeing people improvise and
thinking they're being really meaningful,'' said Simpson. ``It's
just silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of improv's lightweight image, producers have also made
a point of calling the piece ``spontaneous theater.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent preview, the volunteer was Alisa Kwitney, a novelist
and editor from Manhattan who watched as the seven-member troupe
glided through re-enactments of her mother's early hippy days
(incense, bongos), of Kwitney's first love (heartbreaking, of
course), and even of her imagined death (a shark was involved).
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the troupe hung out at the theater's bar, chatting
with about three-dozen audience members, many of whom spontaneously
offered up their own life stories. It is a phenomenon McDermott
says is both common _ and fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, it really stops you from seeing people in a
certain way,'' he said. ``After you've done the show, you walk down
the street and you see people's faces, and it's like a lens or
something. You just see all these stories.''

HEARTBURN: A HOT ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASE HEARTBURN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The all-too-familiar discomfort of heartburn may not have
anything to do with your heart, but it still burns, and it may mean
that you need prescription medication or surgery to avoid long-term
complications.
</P>
<P>
   However, heartburn can usually be controlled with a little
effort, says last month's ``Mayo Clinic Health Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn is caused when stomach acid flows up into your
esophagus, the tube that runs from the stomach to the mouth.
Stomach acid is normally kept in the stomach by a muscular valve
called the esophageal sphincter. If the valve is weakened or we
overeat, acid can overflow up into the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Tips to avoid heartburn:
</P>
<P>
   Don't overeat. An overstretched stomach causes the esophageal
sphincter to open, allowing stomach acid to flow up.
</P>
<P>
   Control your weight. Obesity is a major risk factor for
heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid heartburn triggers. They include fried or fatty foods,
alcohol, chocolate, peppermint, citrus fruit, orange juice and
tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Loosen your belt. Tight belts or clothing can push acid up.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid lying down for two hours after eating. Gravity helps keep
stomach acid in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Don't smoke: Nicotine relaxes the sphincter and increases
stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   Chew gum after meals. That can stimulate saliva production,
which helps neutralize stomach acid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jobs involving the use of common solvents put people at risk of
developing more severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease earlier in
life, according to a new study published in ``Neurology,'' the
scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 990 Parkinson's patients found that those exposed
to hydrocarbon solvents found in common petroleum-based products
such as paints and glues were an average of three years younger at
the first sign of disease symptoms. The severity of the symptoms
was directly related to the amount of hydrocarbon exposure
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers identified occupations that accounted for more than
91 percent of the hydrocarbon solvent exposure, including
petroleum, plastic and rubber workers, painters, engine mechanics
and lithographers.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative
disease caused by the death of a small group of brain cells that
control body movement. Symptoms include tremors in arms and legs,
rigid muscles, slowness of movement and impaired balance.
Parkinson's affects more than 500,000 Americans, including actor
Michael J. Fox.

 &HT;    CD mini reviews

   Rounder. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   It's been 11 years since Keith Whitley died tragically of
alcohol poisoning, and this CD underscores what a loss it was to
country music. Like Merle Haggard or George Jones, the skinny
Kentucky singer had a singular voice, which could turn the rawest
of emotions into tunes so intense they could have been recorded in
a therapy session (or more likely, the corner table at a dive bar).
On these 15 tunes, recorded in 1982, Whitley stays in the
heartbreak zone with a sound that is eerily rich and beautiful,
illuminating how far today's Nashville has strayed from the New
Traditionalist movement he helped launch. _Miriam Longino

</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since the woman with one of R&AMP;B's most
amazingly acrobatic voices released a new album. So it's especially
disappointing that this one isn't a solid ``10.'' If Rachelle
Ferrell isn't contorting her remarkable ``instrument'' around the
dated, incohesive lyrics of the title track or ``Sista,'' she's
stumbling upon a fine enough hook (``I Gotta Go,'' ``Why You Wanna
Mess It All Up''), and wonderful musical accompaniment from
keyboardist/producer George Duke and Atlanta drummer Lil' John
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little substance in the verses. The certain smooth
jazz favorite ``I Forgive You'' and the beautifully fleshed-out
apology that closes this album, ``Can I Explain,'' are really the
only offerings on this intimate-club sounding CD that get points
for more than technical ability.

   ``It's Like This''
</P>
<P>
   Rickie Lee Jones. Artemis Records. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean when Rickie Lee Jones steps away from the
embittered Bohemian pose we've grown to love and assumes the role
of a veteran vocalist covering hits by others? ``It's Like This''
is a bittersweet dispatch to Jones' fans: She's never sounded
better as a singer, but she teeters on the knife's edge of lounge
act parody. But, oh, what a lounge act it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Jones and British soul man Joe Jackson teaming up (as
they do here, on Steely Dan's ``Show Biz Kids'') in some smoked-out
bar. Or being in some swampland saloon as an audibly content Jones
croons ``Up A Lazy River.'' The way she hisses her way through
Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man,'' you'd think she'd juiced up on
Viagra for the recording session.
</P>
<P>
   She wrings an extra fluid ounce of sadness out of The Beatles'
``For No One,'' she sighs oh-so-sweetly through Gershwin's
``Someone to Watch Over Me,'' and her version of Traffic's ``Low
Spark of High-heeled Boys'' is fittingly gritty. This isn't the
first time Jones has covered other writer's songs. But as
pleasurable as ``It's Like This'' is, it still leaves you longing
for her distinctive compositions.

   ``Mi Reflejo''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Aguilera. RCA Records.11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately Christina Aguilera can sing.
</P>
<P>
   Her first album in Spanish has four translated songs from her
Grammy-winning debut album, including the hits ``Genie in a Bottle
(Genio Atrapado)'' and ``What a Girl Wants (Una Mujer).'' The CD is
filled with soft, romantic ballads, and the music is more of a
backdrop for her voice. ``Falsas Esperanzas'' has tinges of salsa,
and there are moments when it seems like the musicians are going to
take off. They don't.
</P>
<P>
   As with the R&AMP;B tracks in the recording, the music has a
manufactured, computer-generated feel to it. Still, if soft pop is
what you want to hear, then this album will do nicely. Aguilera,
whose father is Ecuadorian, does a fine job with the classic ballad
``Contigo en la Distancia.'' But the truth is after hearing
Aguilera's version, I reached in my collection for Jose ``Cheo''
Feliciano's rendition. The best song is ``Si No Te Hubiera
Conocido,'' a duet with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi. It has a
good hook and will stay in your head for a while.

 &HT;    With fine fall days, best garden ever's within reach
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the time of The Plan. Now's the time that thoughts of
the next fine gardens race through gardeners' heads like baseball
players rounding first after slamming one deep to center; we have,
at last, reached the fall renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves tell the story. As the sourwoods redden and the maples
yellow, we, energized by the prospect of the cool and maybe even
the wet, can plant what we could not during the hellish days of
summer, appreciate what survived _ and perhaps most important of
all, anticipate next year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year. It'll be the greatest, because of the plans we lay
out now. We'll walk our spaces, and some will make notes on paper.
Others, including me, will try to make a mental picture of how that
most excellent space will shape up. Ahhh, the sweet perfection of
the mind-garden.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that the best-laid plans sometimes go forever.
There's nothing like the slow passage of time, the long wait for
something to grow into place, to teach patience. And perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much I plan, I always leave room for serendipity.
And, this year, I'm especially glad I did. At the cabin in
McCaysville, Ga., pansies that I neither planned nor planted began
showing up last month. I had planted several colors in containers
last fall, and some decided they wanted to return, in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us do not garden by serendipity alone, of course. We
like too much the idea of having our say. Though planned passion
seems an oxymoron, in the garden plans are part of the passion; we
love to dream. And when one of those long-running plans finally
flowers, it's all the sweeter for the time it took to make it real.
</P>
<P>
   In my garden, we need look no farther than the creeping fig. How
aptly named, given the time it took to fit my vision for it.
</P>
<P>
   Our Atlanta relationship began 10 years ago, when I planted
several clumps next to the brick wall out back. I had caught
fig-envy after many visits to Savannah and Charleston, where the
lovely clinging evergreen, also known as fig vine, covered walls
lushly, evoking verdant ease.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I knew my plan wouldn't work quickly, as this plant prefers
a bit more winter warmth than Atlanta customarily provides. I was
heartened, however, by the sight of a tall wallful of the vine
enhancing the courtyard of the First Presbyterian Church of
Atlanta, whose Memory Garden was designed by the renowned Edith
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   So, one autumn day, I began my quest to cover my walls,
snuggling the vine close to the bricks. Hedging my bets, I also
planted Boston ivy. Naturally, the ivy took only a minute to crawl
all over the wall, covering a 30-foot horizontal space before
bounding over the top of the 7-foot wall and making its way along
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Boston ivy wasn't pretty enough to be so bold (I might
have felt differently had the wall color not been so close to the
ivy's autumn red). Ivy had to go. I dug it out, making it clear
that if that wall wore a cover, it had to be fig, whose finer
texture better fits my small space. (To be sure, ivy, whether
Boston or English, never goes easy; I still see shoots sneaking
toward the wall.)
</P>
<P>
   Years went by rhythmically: The fig would creep up the wall
during high growing season, then get knocked to the ground in
winter, leaving skeletons of stems and leaves to mark the heights
it had reached. Two feet, three, four. By year eight the skeletons
were almost as high as my head, 6 feet from the ground. And last
summer I thought the little leaves could reach the summit. But they
got stopped inches short.
</P>
<P>
   When 2000 rolled around, I had high hopes. They were fulfilled.
One hardy stem went over the top. No, creeping fig does not yet
cover the wall. But someday ...
</P>
<P>
   Someday. The plan is in place.

 &HT;    Video pick: `High Fidelity' smartly done date flick
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? Directed by Stephen Frears and
finessed by a terrific cast, ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it is
enjoyable. Still one of the best films of the year, it's a great
date-movie about dating.
</P>
<P>
   `High Fidelity'
</P>
<P>
   Rated R / Our critic's grade: A -
</P>

   OTHER NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Jesus' Son'' (R) _ Like the book of Denis Johnson's vivid
short stories that it's based on, the movie mirrors its
protagonist's sense of dislocation as it woozily tours a few years
in the life of a boozing, pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup).
The film is like ``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played
out on the suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``28 Days'' (PG-13) _ Cinema's chipper girl-next-door (Sandra
Bullock) goes clean and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that,
thankfully, isn't an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch
Adams.'' It's a professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying
to be all things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as
well as devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Me Myself I'' (R) _ An engaging ``what-if?'' fantasy about
the life not lived. Rachel Griffiths (an Oscar nominee for ``Hilary
and Jackie'') makes an art of benumbed comic reaction as she finds
herself in a nightmare of domesticity, trapped in one of two
parallel lives. ``Me'' could be called a chick flick. But it gives
its heroine intelligence, self-analysis and a healthy sex drive
that leads to some of the movie's funnier scenes. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Map of the World'' (R) _ Sigourney Weaver gives a riveting
performance as a farm wife whose life turns upside down following
an accident while baby-sitting neighbor Julianne Moore's toddler.
An insightful, unsettling drama about families in crisis, the movie
didn't receive a theatrical release in Atlanta. It deserved one.
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Passion of Mind'' (PG-13) _ Demi Moore plays a woman who
lives two lives simultaneously. In one, she's a widowed mother in
Provence. In the other, she's an unattached high-powered agent in
Manhattan. The psychological overtones are intriguing, and the
denouement has a genuine emotional kick. Director Alain Berliner
(``Ma Vie en Rose'') knows how to handle dicey material, but
``Passion's'' problem is that it isn't dicey enough. Grade: C

 &HT;    Olympics serve as background for films
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't seem like four years have passed, but it's time to go
for the gold again. The Olympics may have moved Down Under, but you
don't have to move from your living room to savor these
Olympic-themed movies. Oh, and I excluded ``Chariots of Fire''
because I figured you already know that one. Or at least you know
the music.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Walk Don't Run'' (1966): Cary Grant's final film, it's
essentially a remake of George Stevens' 1943 comedy, ``The More the
Merrier,'' with the original's wartime housing shortage in
Washington replaced by a similar shortage in Tokyo during the 1964
Olympics. Industrialist Grant, landlady Samantha Eggar and U.S.
Olympic walking team member Jim Hutton _ father of Timothy _
discreetly share an apartment in the overcrowded city. Though Grant
is not the love interest _ he's the suavely benign Cupid for his
co-stars _ his breezy charm dominates the film. Grant hired the
picture's composer _ a then-fairly unknown Quincy Jones. Jones
later recalled that when Grant phoned him, the star said, ``I`d
like you to do the music for my last film.' Everybody was retiring.
Frank Sinatra, for whom I was also conducting, was in his second
retirement. So I didn't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Personal Best'' (1982): After writing scripts for such
classics as ``Chinatown'' and ``Shampoo,'' Robert Towne started
directing his own scripts with this movie about about two
pentathlon athletes (Mariel Hemingway and real-life Olympian
Patrice Donnelly) training for the 1980 Olympics. It may have been
his directorial debut, but in terms of the culture, Towne was ahead
of the curve. He shows his two leads as friends, competitors and,
yes, as lovers (this is way before Anne was even a twinkle in
Ellen's eye _ or vice-versa). However, their relationship is one of
several in the film, less important, in fact than both athletes'
relationship with their coach (Scott Glenn). Towne may lavish a bit
too much time on the slo-mo stuff _ we get to see every trembling
muscle and sinew _ but the overall effect is a film that sings the
body athletic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Without Limits'' (1998): Towne, again, this time as the
writer/director of an underappreciated film based on the true story
of '70s track superstar Steve Prefontaine. ``Pre,'' as he was
called, broke about every record there was to break on his way to
the ill-fated 1972 Olympics in Munich. Problem was, he broke as
many rules as he did records, insisting on doing things his way. In
the movie, as in life, that becomes a source of tension between Pre
and his equally stubborn coach (Donald Sutherland), who insists on
doing things his way. Sutherland is excellent as the coach whose
inventive approach to running shoes was co-opted by Nike. But it's
hard to take your eyes off Billy Crudup as Pre. As he does in the
just-released ``Almost Famous,'' Crudup exudes a sexy star quality
that's natural and crafted. Like Russell Crowe, he's a hunk with
talent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Olympia'' (1938): Forget ``Chariots of Fire.'' This is the
Olympics film by which all other Olympics films are measured. Leni
Riefenstahl's two-part masterpiece chronicles the 1936 Olympics in
Berlin and, as in her equally remarkable ``Triumph of the Will,''
the documentary's sheer cinematic power overwhelms the politics
(Riefenstahl was turned on by the notion of an Aryan ideal). Der
Fuhrer can be glimpsed in the stands (his presence, Susan Sontag
once noted, ``consecrates this effort''), but the filmmaker later
insisted that she gave Hitler the same treatment she would've
given, say, Stalin had the Games taken place in Moscow. Whether
``Olympia'' qualifies as Nazi propaganda is a question best decided
by historians, but on purely artistic terms, it's an amazing
achievement.

 &HT;    What's comfort food? Reply's as subjective as memory
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the bee stings, the dog bites and the check is not in the
mail, it may be time for a little comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you have a yearning for a pot roast, it's time
to slow down,'' said Judith Fertig, author of ``Prairie Home
Cooking'' (Harvard Common Press, 1999), at a recent meeting of the
Association of Food Journalists in Kansas City, Mo. Traditional
comfort foods like pot roast and chicken potpie have found a way
back to our dinner plates. It seems in this high-speed, high-tech
world, a little slow food now and then helps soothe our souls.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``comfort food'' immediately evokes images of
piping hot homemade rolls, a platter of fried chicken or a roast,
truth is everyone has their own preferences for foods that console.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation really has never had home-prepared
meatloaf and macaroni and cheese,'' said Jerry Vincent, director of
the culinary program at Johnson County Community College in Kansas
City. ``So those really aren't comfort foods to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, some may find a slice of their favorite pizza
comforting; others, a bowl of ice cream or a carton of kung pao
chicken. It can ``be anything that makes you feel good,'' Fertig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some foods make us feel better because of our chemical reaction
to them _ carbohydrates can trigger serotonin, which can contribute
to a feeling of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's aromatherapy. ``I so remember walking into my
grandmother's house and instantly smelling the aroma of pot roast,
yeast rolls and a great dessert.'' ( Fertig worries the new
generation may only remember ``the smell of McDonald's french fries
in the car.'' )
</P>
<P>
   For some, a particular food is soulful because it's associative
_ it brings up memories of a trip to Italy or family holiday
feasts. I have several comfort foods, ranging from the traditional
(vanilla ice cream with Hershey's syrup) to the not-so-traditional
(my mother's peanut dip.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd love for you to tell me what your favorite comfort foods are
and why _ no matter how wacky. This dip is not at all what one
might think of for a gal who split her childhood between the South
and the Midwest. My mother actually learned to make it from the
Vietnamese women who moved into her Italian neighborhood in Kansas
City in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   She almost always had some in the fridge, left over from her
latest catering gig or party. Try it once and I bet it will become
a party standard of yours, too. And the leftovers will provide a
little bit of solace on the day after.
</P>
<P>
   mom's peanut dip
</P>
<P>
   Start with Vietnamese or Thai sweet chili sauce. You can find
this in Asian markets, or try the Thai Kitchen sweet red chili
sauce or spicy chili sauce (for a little bit of heat) found in most
major grocery chains. You'll need about 7 ounces. Pour the chili
sauce into the bowl of a food processor and turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly begin adding peanuts. They can be lightly salted cocktail
(my preference) or dry roasted. You should have at least 12 ounces
on hand, though you may not use that much. Pour at least 6 ounces
of peanuts into the processor. Then add 1 tablespoon sesame oil.
Now add more peanuts or warm water to get desired consistency. The
dip will loosely resemble peanut butter; there'll be nearly 2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   The dip is better stiff when serving with sturdy crackers like
bagel chips and raw vegetables (my favorites are blanched green
beans and wide slices of red pepper). A thinner sauce is good
drizzled over meats or as a dressing for noodles. Store in
refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving.

&HT;     PLAN TO PUT A MEMORIAL TO REAGAN ON THE NATIONAL MALL IS
TROUBLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A move by some Republican lawmakers to build a
memorial to Ronald Reagan on the National Mall is troubling. They
are seeking to subvert congressionally approved procedures
controlling new monuments on that hallowed strip of land.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan may sound like a trivial matter to
Americans concerned with jobs, income, taxes, and education of
their children. But it is not trivial. And it may appear to be
partisan vindictiveness to individuals who worship the former
president. But it is not.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, opposition to the proposal, approved by the House
Resources Committee Sept. 13, is a matter of protecting the mall,
which is visited by hundreds of thousands of Americans each year
who wish to experience the grandeur of their national heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, an individual is not
to be honored with construction of a memorial until he or she has
been dead 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, who is 89, remains very much alive although Alzheimer's
disease has robbed him of the ability to understand what is going
on around him. But if he did, he probably would reject the idea of
building a memorial to a president who is still alive or who only
recently died.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in the White House, Reagan was so dedicated to
preserving the prestige of the presidency that he would not appear
in the Oval Office unless he wore a coat and tie.
</P>
<P>
   After the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, many
communities named schools, public buildings, parks and highways
after them. But that was not the same as honoring them with
memorials commissioned by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A half century after Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the nation
finally built a memorial to him on land adjacent to the mall
because he is grouped with George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and
Thomas Jefferson as one of the republic's greatest presidents.
</P>
<P>
   King, who was assassinated 32 years ago, will soon be remembered
with a memorial across the Tidal Basin from the one honoring
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the nation's capital has no memorial to Harry Truman,
who made some of history's greatest decisions as president. It has
only a bridge and an island in the Potomac River named for Theodore
Roosevelt and another bridge bearing the name of Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's name already graces the city's national airport and a
huge new federal trade center. That would appear to be enough until
future American leaders determine whether he should be honored with
a memorial on or near the mall akin to those commemorating
Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan memorial effort recalls an earlier rush by
Republicans to honor one of their own. When Sen. Robert A. Taft,
known nationally as Mr. Republican, died in 1953, the
GOP-controlled Congress immediately memorialized him with a bell
tower on the grounds of the Capitol. Taft had been the living
symbol of American conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Three times _ in 1940, 1948 and 1952 _ he had sought to follow
in the footsteps of his father, William Howard Taft, and become
president. Three times, Republicans refused to make him their
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional leaders exercised poor judgment in pushing
for the Taft carillon. No other member of Congress, past or
present, has ever been honored with a monument on the Capitol
grounds. Not even such great statesmen as Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, John C. Calhoun, Robert LaFollette, George Norris, Hubert
Humphrey, Arthur Vandenburg, Paul Douglas or Mike Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1959, the Senate selected five outstanding past members
whose portraits would hang in the Senate's public reception room,
Taft was one of the five, along with Webster, Clay, Calhoun and
LaFollete. That was a well-deserved honor for the late Ohio
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few tourists now visiting the carillon know much, if
anything, about Taft. Since the carillon is the only monument to a
member of Congress on the Capitol grounds, however, some visitors
automatically assume that Taft was the greatest Capitol Hill
lawmaker in history. In truth, no single individual is worthy of
that designation.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was a popular president who has some far-reaching
achievements. He restored prestige to the presidency in the wake of
Watergate, Vietnam and the Iranian hostage crisis, which had
diminished the office in the eyes of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His national defense policies and his cordial relationship with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev undoubtedly hastened an end to the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But on his watch the national debt quadrupled, and the
Iran-contra controversy raised serious questions about what Reagan
knew about deals in which the U.S. government traded arms to Iran
in return for hostages and secretly transferred profits from the
arms sales to the anti-Communist contra rebels in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations should determine Reagan's place in history.
Then, and only then, should Congress decide whether he deserves on
monument on the National Mall.

   WHITEWATER-REPORT (Washington) _ In a decisive end to the
six-year-long Whitewater investigation, Robert Ray, the independent

insufficient evidence to show that either President or Mrs. Clinton
had committed any crimes in connection with the Arkansas real
estate venture that vexed his presidency through two terms. In
clearing both the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton of any
criminal wrongdoing, Ray was notable in the the spareness of his
language. He said only that on each of the allegations his office
had investigated, ``there was insufficient evidence to prove to a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt,'' that a crime had been committed.
Nonetheless, his statement was a definitive legal conclusion on the
issue and thus a significant victory for the White House and
especially for Mrs. Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New
York. By Neil A. Lewis.

being a father took up every spare inch of his thoughts. Suddenly,
there was no room for distractions. As he walked into the Super
Dome Wednesday night, the Russian with the biceps of an action hero
didn't see the other competitors in the men's Olympic all-around
final. As he calmly walked away from each captivating routine, the
24-year-old with a mapmaker's attention to detail didn't notice the
cameras documenting his every idle moment. Instead, Nemov was
fixated on his son. One day, he would tell him a story about this
night; and he wanted it to be a fairy tale. ``An important thing
was my son; that was my major motivation,'' Nemov said through an
interpreter. ``I wanted to do my best for Russia, for my family and
loved ones.'' No one was let down. Nemov won the coveted title as
world's best gymnast. By Selena Roberts.

 &HT;    GATEWAY TO OFFER NETWORKED TWIST ON INTERNET APPLIANCE
 &HT;    With GATEWAY-PLAN. For release Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Gateway Inc., the computer maker with the boxes
designed to look like dairy cows, is about to become a maverick in
the stampede of companies selling Internet-ready machines.
</P>
<P>
   When Gateway introduces the first of its so-called Internet
appliances in coming months, it will market them not as
alternatives to traditional PCs, but as add-ons to users' existing
home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's Internet appliances _ relatively cheap, simple
computers created specifically for checking e-mail or browsing Web
sites _ are sold as stand-alone machines for the kitchen or the
living room. They're designed for people who want Internet access
but don't want the complexities, and the prices, that come with a
traditional PC.
</P>
<P>
   But Gateway's machines, while still designed with simplicity and
space in mind, will emphasize networking and be positioned mainly
as a ``second buy'' for current PC owners.
</P>
<P>
   From a kitchen, for example, users of Gateway's Internet
appliance machines could access phone numbers in their home
computer upstairs, print recipes on a printer in the home office,
or instantly connect to mom or dad's cell phone or personal digital
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons (Internet appliances) haven't worked before
is because they've been positioned as replacements for PCs,''
Gateway Chief Executive Jeffrey Weitzen said at a recent gathering
of business journalists in Irvine, Calif. ``And basically, an
Internet appliance as a stand-alone device is not a great
replacement for the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   By selling to current PC owners, Gateway may have an advantage
over companies that market to computing newbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start with non-PC households, you have sort of a
double sales job,'' said Bryan Ma, an analyst with research group
International Data Corp. (IDC). ``First, you have to convince them
why they want Internet access in first place, and second, you have
to convince them why they should buy your machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway plans to introduce the first of its appliances, a small
unit with a wireless keyboard and a 10-inch flat panel screen, in
time for the Christmas buying season. It plans to release two other
machines, including one that's completely wireless, in the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't disclosed prices for the machines yet. But they're
expected to cost $500 or more _ not much cheaper than the company's
least-expensive PCs. Signing up for long-term Internet access from
Gateway partner America Online will bring prices down
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to disclose more details, Weitzen said that
along with compact designs, the Linux-based machines will feature
quick access to custom Internet content and software that isn't
available on traditional desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't expecting to hit a home run right away,'' Weitzen
said. ``We will do quite a bit of learning around these devices at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   With traditional PC sales lackluster, and research showing that
about half of all U.S. homes are still not connected to the
Internet, computer makers like Gateway have been exploring ways to
score in the market for easy-to-use, Internet-ready machines for
the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the results have been mediocre at best.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. quietly discontinued its Internet-centric
WebPC in June because of poor sales. Undeterred, Compaq Computer
Corp., in a partnership with Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, introduced its
iPAQ Internet appliance in August to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas-based Netpliance Inc. was one of the first
companies to create a stand-alone Internet appliance _ it calls it
the i-opener _ but critics say with constant price changes and
sales of only 50,000 units so far, i-opener been less than
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these companies saw that research shows people dislike
complication and the price associated with traditional PCs, so they
figured they'd just bring out simpler, cheaper appliances and
people would jump on it,'' said Milosz Skrzypczak, an analyst with
the Yankee Group research company. ``Well, they're not jumping on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they will, some forecasters predict.
</P>
<P>
   IDC predicts that within four years, the market for home
Internet appliances will grow from virtually nothing to about 6.5
million units. That doesn't include Internet-ready devices like
cell phones or personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely people who are intimidated by PCs but
they do want to get on the Internet,'' said Ma, the IDC analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing people who don't like computers to buy computers
isn't easy, however. Past attempts by some companies, including
Dell, to convince consumers they were getting something other than
a tweaked desktop when they bought what was billed as an Internet
machine hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many companies came out with is not an Internet
appliance, it's just a browser in a box,'' said Netpliance
President Kent Savage. ``They're not doing anything to enrich the
consumers' experience, and that's where we certainly have an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, anyway, Savage claims he isn't too concerned by the
entry of Gateway and other newcomers into the Internet appliance
market his company essentially created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic to see it,'' he said. ``Now you've got Microsoft
and Compaq and Gateway and AOL all coming in and (doing) what we've
been doing all along. They're validating the marketplace.''

   GATEWAY'S GAME PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Here's a peek at the new Internet-ready computers that San
Diego-based Gateway Inc. plans to introduce.
</P>
<P>
   _ The machines will be marketed not as PC substitutes, but as
add-ons that
</P>
<P>
   can be networked with exisiting home computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Machines will be the first Internet appliances to run on
Linux-based
</P>
<P>
   operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first of three planned machines will feature a wireless
keyboard and 10-inch
</P>
<P>
   flat-panel display. The second will be a completely
self-contained computer.
</P>
<P>
   The third is expected to be wireless.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prices have not been disclosed, but are expected to be $500 or
more _
</P>
<P>
   not much lower than Gateway's cheapest PCs. Long-term agreements
for
</P>
<P>
   Internet service from America Online will bring upfront costs
down.

 &HT;    AMERICAN VOTERS WEIGHTED WITH APATHY AND IGNORANCE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With VOTERS-POLLS. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jodi Kirkhuff of Tulsa, Okla., may cast her vote
for president in November. Should America be pleased, or worried?
</P>
<P>
   She is, after all, famous for being ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Canadian bacon come from? Kirkhuff now knows the
answer. But she didn't when the 19-year-old university student was
quizzed by ``Tonight'' show host Jay Leno in his ``Jaywalking''
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Leno offers a weekly glimpse into the civically disengaged and
utterly empty-headed, asking pedestrians in Los Angeles such
seemingly self-evident questions as: Who is running for president?
On what bay is San Francisco situated? Leno's cameras capture
people stammering and stuttering as America laughs along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a voter. I don't really get politics. I guess
I'm just too busy with other things,'' Kirkhuff said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. Millions of Americans are bystanders to
democracy, disconnected to an election process that is intended to
make America strong and give ordinary citizens a hand in shaping
the country's policy and direction.
</P>
<P>
   They are unable to name their senators or representative,
uninformed on major public issues, and unfamiliar with the basic
power structure in Washington and city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election, only about 66 percent of
American adults were registered to vote, and only 49 percent of
those old enough to vote did so.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math. America's leaders are being chosen by a small
minority of its citizens. In 1996, there were 265 million
Americans, of whom 196 million were old enough to vote. About 96
million of them voted for president, and 47 million of those votes
went to President Clinton. He was elected by about 18 percent of
the people he governs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are warning that turnout could fall even lower this
year, despite a tight race and clear policy differences between
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the numbers, you realize how many people are
not in this. Most people are not paying attention to the issues,''
said Stephen Hess, a scholar of politics and the media at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Issues? Many Americans are not even aware of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, when Al Gore and George W. Bush locked up their
parties' nominations for president, only 45 percent of those people
polled just before the Super Tuesday primary (March 7) in their
states knew that the vote would take place within the week. More
than half either guessed incorrectly or said they did not know.
</P>
<P>
   When the same pollsters for Harvard University's Vanishing Voter
project conducted a survey in late July, three of four Americans
did not know when the GOP convention would be held. The answer: the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted in June by National Public Radio, Harvard
University and the Kaiser Family Foundation, fewer than half of
Americans could name their congressman or state senator. One in
four could not name the governor of the state in which they lived.
</P>
<P>
   In a July poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, fewer than
one in three Americans could identify Dennis Hastert as the U.S.
House speaker, despite his frequent appearances on news and public
affairs TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such results aren't new.
</P>
<P>
   While voter turnout has been in steady decline since the
mid-20th century, public surveys indicate that political ignorance
has remained virtually unchanged since social scientists began
measuring it in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   However, what is surprising and disturbing to scholars is that
the level of public interest in politics is stagnant even though
the country is better educated, older and less mobile than in
recent decades _ three factors that experts had believed would
encourage voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   One ready explanation in the current election year could be
contentment: a stable economy, no war, optimistic social trends.
According to polls, nearly half of all Americans believe things
will stay pretty much the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   So, is the lack of voting an expression of lost confidence in
the political process or one of passive sanction that things are
good and do not require an effort to go to the polls?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the question is sometimes posed, is it due to a decline
in civic and history education in schools, or the media's focus on
the horse race rather than the issues?
</P>
<P>
   It is a universally acknowledged problem that no one seems to
know how to fix. And some libertarian scholars suggest it needs no
repairing _ why would society want to prod unmotivated voters to
make uninformed decisions at the polls?
</P>
<P>
   The National Voter Registration Act, passed by Congress in 1993,
was intended to make it easier for voting-age Americans to register
and, it was hoped, increase participation in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Informally known as the motor-voter bill, it allowed voters to
register while renewing drivers' licenses and performing other
other community functions. In the first four years of the program,
from 1995 through 1998, more people registered to vote than at any
time in history. But voter turnout did not rise in the 1996 and
1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incandescently clear that the problem we face now in
turnout has nothing to do with procedure. We have made it
progressively easier to register to vote, and voter turnout has
gone down,'' said Curtis Gans, executive director of the nonprofit
Center for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   What does spur voters to the polls? History indicates it is a
tight race with much at stake _ war, the economy, social causes.
The Vietnam war, the Cold War and the civil rights movement kept
turnout relatively high during the 1960s (yet still no higher than
60 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the nomination of Harold Washington, an African
American, to become Chicago's next mayor raised black voter turnout
in the city election by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his recently published book ``Bowling Alone,'' Harvard
University professor Robert Putnam suggests that the decline in
participation in civic organizations, churches and neighborhood
associations has diminished an important element of schooling in
democracy and civic virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Politics without face-to-face discourse and organization has led
to an inferior brand of democracy via the electronic town hall of
talk shows, Internet chat and quick polls, he asserts. The result
is ``a muddle of disembodied voices, neither engaged with one
another nor offering much guidance to decision-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another component of the problem is the cynicism that has
infected politics at every level. Politicians run ``against
Washington,'' feeding a public perception that government is the
enemy and not a useful tool of society, said Michael Schudson, a
sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego and
author of the 1998 book ``The Good Citizen: A History of American
Civic Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message out there from our leaders is that you cannot
trust politicians. Why should that make someone want to vote?''
Schudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of America's history, political interest was
spurred by patriotism and political parties. Parades and brass
bands in the town square may have done their part to drum up
popular support for a candidate. So too, in the era before campaign
reforms, did easy patronage jobs, wads of cash, and simple
strong-arm party rule telling partisans where to mark the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the last half of the 20th century, television
supplanted the force of the parties as campaigns relied on mass
marketing and sound bites to convey their messages. Yet the
coverage of government and politics by television _ still America's
top source of news _ has declined steadily over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the Internet, cable television and speciality
magazines, there is more information available about candidates,
their records, the issues and the campaigns than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a July survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press found that only 15 percent of the public actually go
looking for campaign news. Most people, 83 percent, come across
such information by happenstance. The sources of information are so
varied that as many people get their political news from late-night
talk-show shows like Leno and David Letterman as they do from
C-SPAN, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   If unabashedly ignorant of the issues, Kirkhuff, Leno's dupe,
has at least made a buck or two off her benightedness.
</P>
<P>
   After their appearance on Leno's dunce-on-the-street feature,
she and a college friend were hired by the ``Tonight'' show to
``cover'' the Republican National Convention in August. (In answer
to Leno's question about the GOP platform, they answered _
referring to the stage behind them _ that it was nicely carpeted.)
</P>
<P>
   Kirkhuff believes she will cast her vote for Bush, if she
decides to vote. ``A lot of it just seems over my head. I know my
vote is supposed to count. But what about the electoral college?
What is that?'' said Kirkhuff. ``I think there are a lot of people
like me who don't get a lot about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but social scientists say it is not laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting is a ritual, symbolic act,'' said UC-San Diego's
Schudson. But through such central acts, he says, ``that's how
civilizations sustain their societies.''

 &HT;    AMERICAN VOTERS WEIGHTED WITH APATHY AND IGNORANCE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With VOTERS-POLLS. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jodi Kirkhuff of Tulsa, Okla., may cast her vote
for president in November. Should America be pleased, or worried?
</P>
<P>
   She is, after all, famous for being ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Canadian bacon come from? Kirkhuff now knows the
answer. But she didn't when the 19-year-old university student was
quizzed by ``Tonight'' show host Jay Leno in his ``Jaywalking''
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Leno offers a weekly glimpse into the civically disengaged and
utterly empty-headed, asking pedestrians in Los Angeles such
seemingly self-evident questions as: Who is running for president?
On what bay is San Francisco situated? Leno's cameras capture
people stammering and stuttering as America laughs along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a voter. I don't really get politics. I guess
I'm just too busy with other things,'' Kirkhuff said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. Millions of Americans are bystanders to
democracy, disconnected to an election process that is intended to
make America strong and give ordinary citizens a hand in shaping
the country's policy and direction.
</P>
<P>
   They are unable to name their senators or representative,
uninformed on major public issues, and unfamiliar with the basic
power structure in Washington and city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election, only about 66 percent of
American adults were registered to vote, and only 49 percent of
those old enough to vote did so.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math. America's leaders are being chosen by a small
minority of its citizens. In 1996, there were 265 million
Americans, of whom 196 million were old enough to vote. About 96
million of them voted for president, and 47 million of those votes
went to President Clinton. He was elected by about 18 percent of
the people he governs.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are warning that turnout could fall even lower this
year, despite a tight race and clear policy differences between
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the numbers, you realize how many people are
not in this. Most people are not paying attention to the issues,''
said Stephen Hess, a scholar of politics and the media at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Issues? Many Americans are not even aware of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, when Al Gore and George W. Bush locked up their
parties' nominations for president, only 45 percent of those people
polled just before the Super Tuesday primary (March 7) in their
states knew that the vote would take place within the week. More
than half either guessed incorrectly or said they did not know.
</P>
<P>
   When the same pollsters for Harvard University's Vanishing Voter
project conducted a survey in late July, three of four Americans
did not know when the GOP convention would be held. The answer: the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted in June by National Public Radio, Harvard
University and the Kaiser Family Foundation, fewer than half of
Americans could name their congressman or state senator. One in
four could not name the governor of the state in which they lived.
</P>
<P>
   In a July poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, fewer than
one in three Americans could identify Dennis Hastert as the U.S.
House speaker, despite his frequent appearances on news and public
affairs TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such results aren't new.
</P>
<P>
   While voter turnout has been in steady decline since the
mid-20th century, public surveys indicate that political ignorance
has remained virtually unchanged since social scientists began
measuring it in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   However, what is surprising and disturbing to scholars is that
the level of public interest in politics is stagnant even though
the country is better educated, older and less mobile than in
recent decades _ three factors that experts had believed would
encourage voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   One ready explanation in the current election year could be
contentment: a stable economy, no war, optimistic social trends.
According to polls, nearly half of all Americans believe things
will stay pretty much the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   So, is the lack of voting an expression of lost confidence in
the political process or one of passive sanction that things are
good and do not require an effort to go to the polls?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the question is sometimes posed, is it due to a decline
in civic and history education in schools, or the media's focus on
the horse race rather than the issues?
</P>
<P>
   It is a universally acknowledged problem that no one seems to
know how to fix. And some libertarian scholars suggest it needs no
repairing _ why would society want to prod unmotivated voters to
make uninformed decisions at the polls?
</P>
<P>
   The National Voter Registration Act, passed by Congress in 1993,
was intended to make it easier for voting-age Americans to register
and, it was hoped, increase participation in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Informally known as the motor-voter bill, it allowed voters to
register while renewing drivers' licenses and performing other
other community functions. In the first four years of the program,
from 1995 through 1998, more people registered to vote than at any
time in history. But voter turnout did not rise in the 1996 and
1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incandescently clear that the problem we face now in
turnout has nothing to do with procedure. We have made it
progressively easier to register to vote, and voter turnout has
gone down,'' said Curtis Gans, executive director of the nonprofit
Center for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   What does spur voters to the polls? History indicates it is a
tight race with much at stake _ war, the economy, social causes.
The Vietnam war, the Cold War and the civil rights movement kept
turnout relatively high during the 1960s (yet still no higher than
60 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the nomination of Harold Washington, an African
American, to become Chicago's next mayor raised black voter turnout
in the city election by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his recently published book ``Bowling Alone,'' Harvard
University professor Robert Putnam suggests that the decline in
participation in civic organizations, churches and neighborhood
associations has diminished an important element of schooling in
democracy and civic virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Politics without face-to-face discourse and organization has led
to an inferior brand of democracy via the electronic town hall of
talk shows, Internet chat and quick polls, he asserts. The result
is ``a muddle of disembodied voices, neither engaged with one
another nor offering much guidance to decision-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another component of the problem is the cynicism that has
infected politics at every level. Politicians run ``against
Washington,'' feeding a public perception that government is the
enemy and not a useful tool of society, said Michael Schudson, a
sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego and
author of the 1998 book ``The Good Citizen: A History of American
Civic Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message out there from our leaders is that you cannot
trust politicians. Why should that make someone want to vote?''
Schudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of America's history, political interest was
spurred by patriotism and political parties. Parades and brass
bands in the town square may have done their part to drum up
popular support for a candidate. So too, in the era before campaign
reforms, did easy patronage jobs, wads of cash, and simple
strong-arm party rule telling partisans where to mark the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the last half of the 20th century, television
supplanted the force of the parties as campaigns relied on mass
marketing and sound bites to convey their messages. Yet the
coverage of government and politics by television _ still America's
top source of news _ has declined steadily over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the Internet, cable television and speciality
magazines, there is more information available about candidates,
their records, the issues and the campaigns than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a July survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press found that only 15 percent of the public actually go
looking for campaign news. Most people, 83 percent, come across
such information by happenstance. The sources of information are so
varied that as many people get their political news from late-night
talk-show shows like Leno and David Letterman as they do from
C-SPAN, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   If unabashedly ignorant of the issues, Kirkhuff, Leno's dupe,
has at least made a buck or two off her benightedness.
</P>
<P>
   After their appearance on Leno's dunce-on-the-street feature,
she and a college friend were hired by the ``Tonight'' show to
``cover'' the Republican National Convention in August. (In answer
to Leno's question about the GOP platform, they answered _
referring to the stage behind them _ that it was nicely carpeted.)
</P>
<P>
   Kirkhuff believes she will cast her vote for Bush, if she
decides to vote. ``A lot of it just seems over my head. I know my
vote is supposed to count. But what about the electoral college?
What is that?'' said Kirkhuff. ``I think there are a lot of people
like me who don't get a lot about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but social scientists say it is not laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting is a ritual, symbolic act,'' said UC-San Diego's
Schudson. But through such central acts, he says, ``that's how
civilizations sustain their societies.''

SATELLITE WEB LINKS LET INDIAN TRIBES TAKE A TECHNOLOGICAL JUMP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., N.Mex., Utah)  (Circuits)  
 By MINDY SINK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reach of the Internet has now made it to the floor of the
Grand Canyon and several other remote places on American Indian
reservations in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month 120 locations on Navajo, Hopi and Havasupai
reservations throughout Arizona, New Mexico and Utah were supplied
with new satellite dishes and computer equipment for two-way,
high-speed Internet service. In one case that meant the
state-of-the-art satellite dishes had to be carried down eight
miles of trails to the bottom of the Grand Canyon by a caravan of
pack mules to reach the Havasupai tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are jumping generations of technology in a couple of
hours and into the 21st century,'' said Ed Groenhout, vice
president for strategic initiatives at Northern Arizona University
in Flagstaff. ``They have gone from dial-up service that didn't
work very well to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Starband Communications (formerly Gilat-to-Home Inc.) of McLean,
Va., worked with Northern Arizona University and the Southwest
Navajo Nation Virtual Alliance to create the connections. The
three-year pilot project is the first commercial venture for
Starband, which plans to begin selling two-way satellite Internet
service to the general public later this year. The company made
significant donations of hardware and subsidized the installations,
and the tribes obtained additional money in the form of federal and
other grants.
</P>
<P>
   The service offers download speeds of up to 500 kilobits per
second, or about 10 times faster than a 56K modem, although
Starband officials said that 300 to 400 kbps might be more
realistic. Uploading would be at about 150 kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Each tribe and reservation had different needs and priorities
for the Internet, depending on its geographical location. The
police department at the First Mesa Consolidated Villages, on the
Hopi reservation northeast of Phoenix, wanted to have access to the
FBI's National Crime Information Center. Students at the Selba
Delkai Boarding School near Winslow, Ariz., needed greater access;
they had to rotate Internet use because there was only a single
copper wire line for data.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of the computers and satellite dishes were distributed to
chapter houses _ meeting halls and community centers _ throughout
the far-flung reservations, where simple telephone service is often
still a luxury. The Havasupai Indians hope some of their tribal
members can obtain college degrees through online education courses
and remain on the reservation to teach the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point for our community,'' said Sally
Tilousi, director of the Havasupais' Head Start School. ``It's hard
for people on the outside to understand how isolated we are from so
much technology.'' Tilousi said phone service deep inside the
canyon can be intermittent and all calls are long-distance, making
landline connections unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Starband officials note that availability of Internet services
has been spotty. ``Satellite is ubiquitous, and they could not get
DSL or cable modems,'' said Sandy Colony, vice president for
corporate communications at Starband Communications. ``In some of
these cases, this was their first Internet connectivity. It allows
more people access to all of the benefits of the Internet with
high-speed delivery, long-distance learning, and it's always on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Havasupai court clerk can correspond regularly with the
circuit judge who typically visits only once a month. Tourism is
the primary source of income for the Havasupai, and they depend on
the 20,000 or so tourists that hike, ride horseback or sightsee by
helicopter. The lodge now has a computer and dish so that current
weather conditions can be made available and frequently asked
questions can be intercepted through e-mail on the tribe's site.
</P>
<P>
   For Tisouli, benefits for the 600-member tribe's children are
the most important reason for the upgrades. ``What has happened is
we're sending children ill-prepared into the outside world,'' she
said. The tribe's children are sent to boarding school after eighth
grade. ``They're not socially exposed. We're hoping this might
better prepare them academically and we'll be able to communicate
with them when they do leave.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea of the modern world encroaching on a seemingly
simpler culture, Tisouli said the new technology could only be
beneficial. ``It will only strengthen our community, helping us
grow and learn with our children and our families,'' she said.

 &HT;    In the era of e-mail, fountain pen lovers express themselves
with flair
 &HT;    By Michelle Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pen is mightier than the Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Or so say those who would rather pick up a Montblanc than send
an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And they speak reverently of the fountain pen, the way
winemakers describe a rare vintage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ink flows like gold off the tip of the pen,'' says Atlanta
Pen Show coordinator Gerald Zwiren of his favorite pen _ a Swan
from England with a handmade nib.
</P>
<P>
   As coordinator of the Atlanta Pen Show, Zwiren puts in a good
amount of time at his computer. But he still relishes his fine pens
for that special touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use them to write notes and things,'' Zwiren says. ``It
makes it more personal when you use a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwiren is not alone. Even in this era of point-and-click
communication, the simple stroke of a fountain pen still
captivates. According to the Writing Instrument Manufacturers
Association in Moorestown, N.J., in 1998 fountain pen sales
accounted for $50 million of an overall $2.3 billion writing
instrument market. Although sales of fountain pens declined from 15
million in 1996 to 12 million two years later, a local salesman
says interest is high in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are back as an art form,'' says Andrew Sutter, sales
associate at Mori Luggage and Gifts at Lenox Square, which sells
several brands of finer pens.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados say the fountain pen is the Cadillac of writing
instruments. Sutter, who picked up his first fountain pen 12 years
ago, found his hand cramped significantly less while using a
fountain pen to take lecture notes during college. For Zwiren, a
retired pediatric surgeon, a desire to write distinctive,
recognizable notes in patient charts prompted him to take pen to
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make drawings of the operations that I would do. I
started collecting pens to get a good pen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're an inkwell aficionado or a nib neophyte, there's
a fountain pen out there for you. Choices range from a $4 basic
Sheaffer to $12 for a Pelicano to $3,700 for a limited-edition
Michel Perchin Fleur de Lis. Artlite, the largest Montblanc
retailer in the Southeast, sells a solid platinum Montblanc
Meisterstuck for $12,600 _ about the cost of a Ford Escort.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your taste and budget, a few simple tips will
help you find the write stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Personal penscription
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as the perfect pen,'' says Steve Light,
co-owner of Artlite. The amount of pressure, ink flow and writing
angle determine how well a pen will work for you. So it is
essential to try a pen before you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   John Chartier, manager of the Colorado Pen Co. at Lenox Square,
recommends consumers focus on what feels good in the hand. ``It
doesn't matter if it is $10 or $10,000 _ if you like it is what
matters,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The point is . . .
</P>
<P>
   What separates fountain pens from their rollerball and ballpoint
counterparts is the tip, called the nib. Nibs come in a variety of
materials, sizes and shapes. Gold is popular because of its
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a gold nib, it will conform to your style of
writing, so you shouldn't let someone else use it,'' says Light.
</P>
<P>
   Materials determine the cost, says Charles Dukes, a retired
English professor and pen connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that you can purchase a beautiful writing
instrument for under $300, because over and above that _ and it is
worth it if you are really passionate about pens _ you are paying
for precious metals and workmanship; things that make pen
aficionados' hearts go a-twitter,'' says Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   All's well that inks well
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is the ink that leaves a lasting impression. It
was ink flow that prompted L.E. Waterman to make the first
commercially popular fountain pen in 1884. According to pen lore,
Waterman, an insurance salesman, lost a sale when his quill pen
dripped ink on a contract. Soon, thousands of fountain pens were
sold by companies still doing business today: Waterman, Sheaffer
and Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain pen inks are water-based, allowing paper to fully
absorb the ink. Although there are variations in shades, most will
still show up darker than a ballpoint or rollerball pen.
</P>
<P>
   Says Chartier of the indelible impression of the fountain pen,
``In this day and age of e-mail, if you write a note by hand, it
won't go unnoticed; if you use a fountain pen, it won't be
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN PEN TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things to keep in mind when pen shopping and once
you've brought your pen home:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Try before you buy: Try out the pen before making an
investment. Pay particular attention to the weight, the way it
writes, the grip and how it feels in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Examine different nib sizes and styles: There are a wide range
of sizes and nib shapes; keep trying until you find the one that
writes the way you like.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fly on empty or full: ``If you travel with a fountain pen, you
have two airplane options: fill it completely so there are no
bubbles, or travel with it empty,'' says John Chartier, manager of
Colorado Pen Co. in Lenox Square. Otherwise, he says, the ink will
spill over into the cap during pressurization.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use daily, or clean and store: ``Best way to store is head
up,'' says Steve Light, co-owner of Artlite on Piedmont Road.
Because a fountain pen needs to be used daily _ the feeder section
needs a steady flow of ink _ Light suggests cleaning and storing
pens if you are not going to use them for a while.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paper path: ``Some of the better papers are not terribly
compatible with fountain pens,'' says Andrew Sutter, sales
associate at Mori Luggage and Gifts at Lenox Square. ``Some paper
is very thirsty; when you write, you will find that the pen
drags.''

   Q: I am trying to find Burleson's Pure Honey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Malone, Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Have a bee in your bonnet about this honey? Unfortunately,
Montgomery is the closest city to Atlanta that stocks Burleson's,
says Jim Phillips, the company's sales and marketing director in
Waxahachie, Texas. However, you can order it by calling
817-284-0014 or online at www.burlesons-honey.com. A 12-ounce
bottle is $2.49, a 24-ounce bottle $3.99. Burleson's has been
producing honey since 1907. Its product is all natural (no
additives or preservatives) and certified kosher.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have enjoyed a product called 5 Day Antiperspirant &AMP;
Deodorant in the regular scent. The small jar contains pads soaked
in a clear solution. It works great for me. I would love for you to
find it for me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marie R. Perrotta, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Feel refreshed all day with 5 Day deodorant pads, available
at King's Drugs, 2345 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-233-2101). A jar
with 75 moistened pads is $7.17. This product will keep you dry and
odor-free all day, says distributor Numark Laboratories. Use daily
for five days and if not totally satisfied, you can send the
company your receipt for a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the name, 5 Day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a women's shaver called Flicker Classic by
Persona. It's a plastic disposable razor with five blades. I
haven't been able to find it in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandy Dettenmayer, Newnan, Ga.,
</P>
<P>
   A: You will glide into fall with your newfound Flicker Classic.
We found this women's shaver ($2.99) at CVS Pharmacy, 1544 Piedmont
Ave. N.E. (404-892-7188). Flicker is designed to shave legs and
underarms and to protect your skin from nicks and cuts. The rounded
shape is easy to grip, even when your hands are wet. For best
results, use with shaving cream or soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you find pasteurized eggs? I read a few months ago they
were coming on the market. I would love to make a variety of items
using raw eggs but am scared about salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Storm,
</P>
<P>
   Roswell
</P>
<P>
   A: Go ahead and make mayo or eggnog at home. We found Davidson's
pasteurized eggs at Harris Teeter, 3954 Peachtree St. N.E.
(404-814-5990). A dozen eggs is $1.57. To destroy the salmonella
bacteria, said company president L. John Davidson, ``The eggs are
pasteurized in their shells, using gentle heat and clean water.
They look, cook and taste the same as nonpasteurized eggs. Notice
the slight opacity in the white. That is your assurance the egg is
pasteurized.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I desperately need help locating my best-fitting jeans,
Levi's 521 tapered fit/tapered leg for women. I have located Levi's
512 for juniors but not 521 for women. Please don't tell me they
have discontinued them! Thanks for your help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kim Johnson, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Relax. Your slim-fit, original tapered-leg jeans are still
being made, just under another number. To avoid confusion, Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. has consolidated its junior (512) and misses (521)
styles under one number: 512. The junior sizes are 3, 5, 7, 9, etc;
the women's sizes are 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. We found your 512 jeans
($30 a pair) at Dillard's in the Mall of Georgia (678-482-5241).
Happy jeans wearing!

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Virginia-Highland
 &HT;    Hip intown hub gives senses a workout
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The busy spot where North Highland and Virginia
avenues intersect could easily be designated as one of Atlanta's
trendiest.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at Virginia-Highland, you'll find a pedestrian-friendly
residential and commercial neighborhood that cries out for
exploration. The little hub offers visitors restaurants that rely
on good food, not gimmicks, to draw crowds and shops filled with
items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Pop into Dakota J's if your taste in women's clothing runs to
lushly textured fabrics in rich jewel tones and eclectic styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to specialize in romantic and whimsical items. Our
clothes are pretty, soft and flowing,'' said owner Terri Hill. This
is also the place to pick up small beaded purses in striking colors
and tiny silk bags with slinky shoulder straps.
</P>
<P>
   Dakota J's offers a selection of jewelry, hair and beauty
products and gift items that include silk boxes adorned with beads.
</P>
<P>
   The Highland Tobacco Co. may be Lilliputian in size, but it's
loaded with cigars, cigarettes, magazines and a wealth of
accessories. This is the place to purchase popular Arturo Fuente
cigars from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a ``modern mercantile,'' Metropolitan Deluxe is a
feast for the eyes. It should give your olfactory senses a workout,
too. The scent of freshly cut flowers vies with stacks of perfumed
candles and various bath and body products.
</P>
<P>
   At Metropolitan Deluxe, not only can you pick up a fresh
bouquet, but you also can snag a pair of coveted pink lawn
flamingos, miniature collectible shoes and blown glass Christmas
ornaments. Take a look downstairs in the shop's furniture and home
accessories department, and you'll find assorted throw pillows,
overstuffed chairs and funky drawer pulls in the shape of spoons,
rolling pins and even toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen guru will feel right at home a few doors down at the
Plump Peasants. The scent of coffee and the sight of Godiva
chocolates might serve as the initial lure, but once you take a
look around, you'll want to stay a while. Take in the variety of
hot sauces and imported teas, and don't miss the olive oils _ some
perfumed with Meyer lemons _ and a slew of flavored vinegars,
including a striking version made with blood oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the usual assortment of kitchen gadgets, you'll find
elegant tapestry picnic totes, French fondue pots and a collection
of unusual greeting cards. Those interested in woodworking
shouldn't miss a visit across the street to Highland Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zack Etheridge, who teaches some of the store's
popular woodworking classes, this shop and Murphy's restaurant were
among the first businesses that revived the area in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we set about rehabbing this shabby building, we made a
conscious decision to design it in a style that fit our vision of
the neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomething hardware store is decked out with oak
flooring, brick walls and skylights, lending it a deceptively older
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it looks as if it's been here for so long, we get
people who say they've been shopping here for over 30 years,''
Etheridge said.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From I-75/I-85 south, take 10th Street exit and
turn left. From I-75/I-85 north, take 10th Street exit and turn
right. When 10th Street dead-ends, turn right onto Monroe Drive,
then left onto Virginia Avenue. When you reach the second traffic
light, you will be at the intersection of Virginia and North
Highland avenues.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Vary by store.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Metered parking in front of the stores and free
parking in nearby residential area. But be prepared to make a few
spins around the neighborhood on nights and weekends, when
competition is fierce for close-in spots.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are wheelchair accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: No public
</P>
<P>
   restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fontaine's Oyster House. This eatery proves you can be hours
from the ocean and still feast on fresh oysters, mussels and
shrimp. Sample the classic and sinfully rich oysters Rockerfeller
or Black &AMP; Blue oysters, which include a spread of black olives and
blue cheese. Those who crave something other than seafood can
sample one of the restaurant's mighty muffuletta sandwiches. Prices
range from $2.95 to $18.95. 11:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Mondays-Sundays.
(Open until 3 a.m. Saturdays.) Major cards accepted. 1026 1/2 North
Highland Ave. 404-872-0869
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Murphy's. When it's time to take a break from shopping, you
won't go wrong if you pass through the doors of Murphy's
restaurant. For a real treat, consider the frozen mocha latte.
Smooth, icy cold and crowned with whipped cream, this drink or
dessert or snack _ however you choose to refer to it _ makes a
visit to Murphy's worth the trip. Housemade desserts ranging from
black forest squares to white chocolate banana cream tartlets
almost make you want to head straight for the final course. But
don't ignore local beet cured Atlantic salmon or a side order of
garlic mashed potatoes. The restaurant also serves Sunday brunch.
Prices range from $4.50 to $18.95. 10 a.m.-10 p.m.
Mondays-Thursdays; 10 a.m.-midnight Fridays; 8 a.m.-midnight
Saturdays; 8 a.m.-10 p.m. Sundays. Major cards accepted. 997
Virginia Ave. 404-872-0904.

A WELCOME BREEZE OF HOPE WAFTS IN FROM SYDNEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CECIL JOHNSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the four dread horsemen are rampaging across many
places on the planet and the signs are ripe that they have designs
on riding through others, the world needs the kind of hope-filled
distraction that is occurring in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Games are supposed to symbolize the possibility that
the nations of the world can compete and prosper in peace and with
mutual respect, not just in sports but in all spheres of
international activity.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of this century, however, the Games have been
used for purposes far beneath that exalted ideal.
</P>
<P>
   That was true when Adolf Hitler attempted to use the Games to
project the myth of Aryan racial superiority, as the world moved to
the brink of global war. The Fuhrer's German superiority balloon,
of course, was punctured by American athletes, most notably Jesse
Owens, an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   It was true during the Cold War, when the Communist Bloc nations
and the Western democracies exploited the Games to suggest the
superiority of their political and economic systems. The
performances of the athletes supposedly made significant statements
about the social, economic and political realities of the societies
that produced them.
</P>
<P>
   The Games also have been targeted by terrorists seeking to
dramatize their causes and by individual bombardiers bent simply on
making mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet
Union, the Games came closer to becoming the kind of friendly
competition among individual nations that they are supposed to be.
Some of the old East-West rivalry, however, remained during the
last two Olympiads. And new ones have sprung up between some of the
former Soviet satellite nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But something special appears to be happening at the Summer
(make that Autumn) Games of the 27th Olympiad. Perhaps it has much
to do with the apparent determination of the Australians to make it
possible at the end of the competition for Juan Antonio Samaranch
to declare truthfully that the Sydney games were the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular and uplifting opening ceremonies set the stage
for a competition in which the athletes can represent their
countries well and exceed that objective by exemplifying the
Olympic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that the parade of athletes presented a
moving mosaic of contradictions with its array of countries that
are at war with others or whose bilateral relations are far from
harmonious. Among that juxtaposition of unfriendly neighbors were
India and Pakistan, Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel and
the Palestinian entity, and Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, at least, representatives of those countries and
others in Asia, Africa and Europe can operate in a state of willing
suspension of hostilities and send the world a message that it can
be done in other arenas of international life.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful sign of that at the Sydney Games was the joint
appearance of the athletes from North and South Korea. Their
marching together showed how far the two Koreas have come in recent
months toward the dream of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
   That has enormous implications for regional stability and for
U.S. strategic military planning. It could eliminate the need to
develop an anti-missile system to intercept North Korean warheads,
as well as make it unnecessary for the United States to continue to
deploy thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is wishful thinking. Still, there is something
about the Sydney Games that suggests they are a harbinger of a more
peaceful and stable world to come, a world in which the Olympic
ideals could be fully realized. &QL;

   ``Henry's Song'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Kathryn Cave &QL;
</P>
<P>
   and ``If Nathan Were Here'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Bahr &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Eerdmans, $16) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You might not know it to hear my speaking voice, but I can carry
a tune in a bucket _ at least if the bucket is big enough.
Apparently, the title character in ``Henry's Song,'' a charming
children's picture book by London writer Kathryn Cave, has a
similar problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that noise?'' his animal neighbors howl when the tubby
little creature makes some joyful sounds early one morning. ``Put a
sock in it, Henry!''
</P>
<P>
   The Maker of All Things, however, likes Henry's singing just
fine, although the animals have to be prodded a bit to get the
point. Sue Hendra's colorful and cartoonish illustrations work well
with Cave's text; ``Henry's Song'' should please preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nathan Were Here,'' on the other hand, is aimed at the
elementary-school set, and its style is quite dissimilar to that of
the effervescent ``Henry's Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nathan were here,'' the youthful narrator thinks, ``we
would meet in our tree fort to choose which team hats to wear from
our Baseball Hat Wall of Fame. ... But Nathan isn't here. And
nobody's laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bahr's poignant story follows the boy as a teacher, a
neighbor and a father help him work through his best friend's
death. Karen A. Jerome's soft-edged watercolors provide an
atmosphere altogether different from Hendra's vivid drawings in
``Henry's Song.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no overtly religious element in ``If Nathan Were Here''
_ no mention, for instance, of God or prayer. But the book works
well on its own terms and can fill a niche that, unfortunately,
occasionally needs filling. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This album, recorded live at Metro Christian Fellowship in
Kansas City, Mo., is a fascinating glimpse into a ``Harp &AMP; Bowl''
intercessory worship service.
</P>
<P>
   Harp &AMP; Bowl refers to Revelation 5:8, a verse about music and
prayers being offered to Jesus. The services combine worship music
and spontaneous songs _ the ``harp'' of the passage _ and prayers _
the ``golden bowls of incense, which are the prayers of the
saints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Kingdom Come'' contains all three elements.
</P>
<P>
   The album uses the Lord's Prayer as the framework for a service
led by Smith. The planned songs, all written by Smith, are divided
into six sections based on six verses from the Christian faith's
most important prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes a couple of spontaneous songs, including one by
a woman from the congregation, and a trio of prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The worship music is first-rate. Add the other elements, and
this becomes an outstanding album. &QL;

 &HT;    Nervous booksellers to gather here; public invited
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since the invention of the printing press has there been so
much buzz in the book business. As the Publishers Association of
the South and the Southeast Booksellers Association gather at the
Atlanta Merchandise Mart this weekend for their annual convention,
discussion topics will range from the threat of chain stores to the
future of books themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom Payton,
president of Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the lovingly
composed, designed and printed paper artifact to that of bits and
bytes downloaded onto handheld readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he says, there is the question of who buys books today,
where they buy them and how they'll buy them in the future. Will
e-book ventures such as Stephen King's ``Riding the Bullet'' and
``The Plant'' make traditional book publishing obsolete? And what
will this mean for the average reader?
</P>
<P>
   To address these questions, Payton and other members of the
Publishers Association of the South have arranged a quarterly
series of public round-table discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The first session, scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday at the Margaret
Mitchell House and Museum, will feature a panel that includes
Payton; Karen Orchard, director of the University of Georgia Press;
Nancy Pate, book editor of the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel; Shannon
Ravenel, editorial director of Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill,
N.C.; and Carolyn Sakowski, president of John F. Blair Publishers
and president of the publishers association.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will debate a variety of issues: Would Truman Capote
launch his own dot-com to promote himself? Would the Agrarians
gather for a chat room discussion on the Internet? Would Margaret
Mitchell answer fan letters by e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   ``More so,'' Payton says, ``we will discuss what is the real
face of the South today and tomorrow, and how will it be
represented in our book culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Some publishers, such as Sakowski, see the new technology and
the consolidation of New York publishing houses as beneficial for
both readers and writers. ``It's a great opportunity for midsize
publishers, because talented writers are frustrated with the
current conglomerate mentality,'' she says. ``We are seeing a lot
of defections from writers who have decided they'd rather go to a
midsize house and be treated with respect and dignity than to
simply have the name of a big publisher behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sakowski says, the Internet allows smaller
publishers to market their books more effectively and gives readers
more choices. ``It's a situation where both publishers and readers
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   On tap for future public discussions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Emerging Trends in Southern Publishing,'' Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Media Coverage of Books in the South,'' Jan. 18.

   Whenever I mention a cell-phone slowdown, the reaction is like:
``Hey, dummy, don't you know that cell-phone demand is through the
roof? Just look at this year's handset numbers compared with last
year's.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument there (about cell-phone demand being through the
roof, or me being a dummy). But the issue with cell phones doesn't
have as much to do with cell-phone handset makers anymore (they've
already had their hits) as it does with the folks who supply them.

<P>
   Supply has finally caught up with demand, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the more 'commodity' type components/packages are
quietly coming off allocation, or to use the latest terminology,
'Controlled order entry,''' Fechtor Detwiler analyst Jim Coleman
wrote Friday in a report to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a slowdown, among suppliers, are abundant. Just Friday
Anadigics (ANAD on the Nasdaq) warned of a fourth-quarter slowdown.
It cited a fire at ``a supplier's factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that the supplier in question was Ericsson
(ERICY on the Nasdaq), which reported the fire weeks ago; blaming
the fire now just makes you wonder whether it's a scapegoat for
reality: Business is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Coleman: ``We have been told that Ericsson has
reduced component requirements for calendar year 01 by 25 percent,
and most suppliers believe that this is still an inflated level.
The OEM [original equipment manufacturers'] mindset appears to be
that it is better to overbook and cancel orders than to underbook
and be left short or forced to pay premium prices through the
broker channel if the market is strong.'' Put another way, the fire
was bad but it's not the worst of Ericsson's worries.
</P>
<P>
   Other data points:
</P>
<P>
   -- Last week one Banc of America analyst said that cellular
handset results ``are catching forecasts of 400 million to 425
million units (up from 270 million units last year) but that he
does ``not expect material upside to these numbers.'' He added that
the cell-phone makers themselves could face a challenge as demand
shifts to low-end, low-margin products. (Personal note: Like many
parents, last weekend I bought a cell phone for my daughter and
replaced one for my wife. Both were low-cost digital units.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Last week another Banc of America analyst said Motorola had
mentioned ``short-term moderation in wireless components'' and that
``wireless bookings are down slightly in Q3 from a large Q1 and Q2
... lead times have come in a bit to eight to 13 weeks.'' This from
a company that just a few months ago was telling analysts how it
was building inventories. Now inventories are not a problem. (In
other words, the pipeline is more than stuffed; manufacturers who
double-ordered and triple-ordered to avoid supply shortages aren't
likely to be stepping up their orders anytime soon. That goes for
PCs, too.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Inventories at Solectron (SLR on the New York exchange),
which assembles cell phones, are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   -- In a recent meeting, RF Micro Devices (RFMD on the Nasdaq)
reportedly told analysts that its visibility going forward isn't
that great, meaning the company can't give clear guidance. (That's
from a company that hadn't been hampered by tight supplies. Yet its
stock, while sharply off its highs, still trades at 89 times this
year's expected earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   Which companies, besides those mentioned above, are vulnerable?
``Open up a cell phone and start reading the names on the chips''
and other components, says money manager Jeff Matthews of Ram
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember: It wasn't so long ago that Cirrus Logic (CRUS on
the Nasdaq), Analog Devices (ADI on the New York exchange) and
other of today's highfliers were trading in the single digits;
nobody wanted to own them. Now (thanks largely to cellular) they're
well into the double digits, and demand for their stocks remains
robust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happens every time,'' Matthews says. ``It's a
supply-demand thing, and when it happens, people say it will never
happen again, yet it does.'' And when things turn, he adds, ``they
turn!''

   Whenever I mention a cell-phone slowdown, the reaction is like:
``Hey, dummy, don't you know that cell-phone demand is through the
roof? Just look at this year's handset numbers compared with last
year's.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument there (about cell-phone demand being through the
roof, or me being a dummy). But the issue with cell phones doesn't
have as much to do with cell-phone handset makers anymore (they've
already had their hits) as it does with the folks who supply them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America embraces many of Australia's most accessible exports
(Russell Crowe, Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, koalas), but one of the
most compelling aspects of the culture _ Aboriginal art _ remains
largely unknown in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aborigine'' is the name given to Australia's many and various
indigenous tribes. And their art, characterized by the use of
painted or carved lines, dots and simple figures, is as beautiful
and fascinating as the celebrated wildlife and landscapes of
Australia. The lines and dots mysteriously evoke the mythical
history and collective psyche of the Aborigines, weaving images of
Australia's odd-looking animals, lithe dancing figures,
spear-wielding hunters and primitive symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The art form represents thousands of years of sacred
storytelling and inspiration that have, in more recent generations,
survived the attempts of English colonists to annihilate them.
Aboriginal paintings and carvings, along with their oral
traditions, capture the myths and histories that define their
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the paintings recount the mythic time before
civilization, when their legends were formed, known as ``The
Dreamtime.'' That is when the spirits placed the shark in the sea
and the evening star in the sky, when fire was born and when evil
first intruded on gentle people.
</P>
<P>
   With the English colonization of Australia, beginning in the
late 18th century, and the subsequent decimation of the Aborigines,
their culture was at risk of disappearing. But in the second half
of the 20th century, the Australian government began to re-examine
its brutal and inhumane treatment of the Aborigines. And in the
past 20 years, Aboriginal art has enjoyed growing popularity and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Olympics' focus on the land Down Under whets your
appetite for things Australian, include Aboriginal culture in your
exploration. Check out www.dreamcreations.com.au, an online source
for Aboriginal art that features the work of female artists;
www.dacou.com.au, which represents the work of an all-Aboriginal
owned and operated gallery; or www.aboriginalart.com.au, an
award-winning site that includes information about the history,
music and legends of the Aborigines along with the artwork. &QL;

<P>
   William Hill was delighted when he first heard about the digital
video- editing abilities of the new Apple iMac DV. Hill, a
40-something actor in New York, was having trouble finding film
roles, thanks in part to the Screen Actors Guild strike. He needed
to edit his reel, the film equivalent of a resume, but he figured
that renting a digital-editing suite and editor would cost him at
least $150 an hour. In comparison, a new iMac DV would cost $999 to
$1,499, about $100 more than a comparable iMac without video
editing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the stupid mistake of spending $1,900 on a Gateway
without digital-editing capabilities recently,'' said Hill, whose
burly build and rosy face befit the good-natured cop roles he
typically plays. ``Now I'm thinking of buying the iMac, too,'' he
said, sitting in front of a bank of iMac DVs at a Manhattan
electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac DV, which made its debut at the end of July, is not the
only computer on the market right now for those with a need, or
just a desire, to make movies. In the last few months, there has
been a flood of personal computers with bundled software, including
products from Sony and Dell, aimed at the consumer who aspires to
be an auteur.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hill is a film professional, these products are
designed to appeal to a more general audience. The companies are
hoping to attract buyers who might have little interest in
purchasing new home computers but have hours of home videos of
babies or vacations that they want to edit. The companies are also
flattering consumers with the pitch that despite their proclivity
for inert activities like surfing the Net and watching television,
they, too, have an energetic artist within.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say computer makers are embracing digital video-editing
technology because they hope that it will liven up the home
computer market, enticing more people to buy new machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal computer business has lost luster recently _ PCs
are more of a commodity, like a refrigerator that you only need a
new one when it breaks down,'' said Ron Glaz, a senior research
analyst for digital imaging at International Data Corp.
``Meanwhile, digital imaging is the hottest consumer market right
now and the personal computer makers are trying to jump on the
digital-imaging bandwagon with all of these new digital film
products.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether the average consumer will rise
from the couch to claim the director's chair, hooking up a digital
camcorder to a computer with editing abilities. Critics wonder
whether the digital film revolution for home computers merely gilds
the lily of passive entertainment. Buyers of the new cinephilic
computers may imagine that one day _ next year? _ they will use
their computers to edit their films. Instead, they may well wind up
watching DVDs on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making movies is a lot of work,'' said Landon Finnerty, 43, a
theater lighting technician who is considering buying a new
Macintosh computer, but not for its film abilities. ``A movie is a
nice concept, but given how long it takes just to download a film,
will anyone bother to make films? People are just buying it because
they just want the latest and the greatest thing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies that are trying to sway consumers to buy one more
computer include Sony, which bundles free MovieShaker software with
new Vaio computers that cost $2,300 to $2,600. MovieShaker adds a
technobeat to family footage at the click of a mouse _ by pressing
a ``shake'' button, the program instantly creates a 30-second clip
out of a user's montage. Sony is planning a large campaign to
promote the product in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is offering video-editing software, Movie Studio, that
costs $99 when consumers purchase Dimension desktops or Inspiron
notebooks. Dell is also urging consumers to purchase the Dazzle USB
Digital Video Creator to convert their analog videos into digital
videos.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case a person finds these systems too complex,
there's the new Lego Studios Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set, with
a PC camera (a computer with a Pentium II 400-megahertz chip is
recommended), editing software and Lego props included. The set is
aimed at children whose parents are willing to spend $179.99 on
their little directors. Lego Studios is clearly an attempt to give
educational software some show business razzle-dazzle, and it will
reach stores in November. Lego emphasizes Spielberg's involvement
and the fact that the software has been created in collaboration
with Pinnacle Systems, which makes grown-up digital editing
software for Hollywood. The site says Spielberg's proceeds from the
project will go to the Shoah Foundation and the Starbright
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers for the companies that are offering new computers with
digital film applications acknowledge that they are trying to spice
up the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got stuck in a rut with the personal computer,'' said
Richard Black, director of marketing for the desktop PC group at
Sony. ``Customers were just buying what was cheapest. They were
pushing back, asking: `Why should I get a PC? What's the reason to
upgrade?' Now there's the added benefit of software that goes with
their camcorders. It makes it simple for the customer to edit down
their tape of their family vacation near the Barrier Reef.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Schiller, vice president for worldwide marketing at Apple,
said, ``We think of adding digital filmmaking to the iMac as
another way to add excitement to personal computing, which was
getting stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   These marketers also want to lure customers with the concept of
taking the helm to create something, rather than just passively
viewing images or text. ``With MovieShaker, users can put their
personal touch on their home movies,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making an iMovie is more than just making a video _ it's like
the difference between a book and words on a page,'' Schiller said.
``You get to tell your own story. Making a movie can be a very
emotional experience. It's so much better than surfing a Web
page.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's Web site and advertising show home iMovies of
celebrities and children to emphasize the creative aspects of
digital movie making on the iMac. Apple has also urged amateur
digital-film directors to post their own short films on the site,
and at this year's Macworld, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief
executive, hawked iMovie software by screening slick home videos
crafted by Apple employees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For some consumers, the lure of being able to tell personal
stories by just cutting and pasting on their computers has proved
irresistible. ``Lots of student filmmakers and some family types
are buying it for its film capabilities,'' said Joseph Troskie,
head of sales at Tekserve, a Macintosh store in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry experts wonder how many people will actually
make movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am skeptical of the marketing of these personal computers _
they seem to be saying that you'll be an artist if you buy a PC
with digital film capabilities,'' said Kimberly Reed, an editor of
DV magazine. ``Sony and Apple appear to be saying, `Buy this word
processor _ you'll write a novel and be Dostoevski.' Film
professionals know that shooting and editing takes talent and time.
Digital filmmaking is not something that's immediately
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaz, the analyst, predicted: ``The average user won't be able
to do it. Even if they do understand, they will be discouraged when
they discover they are not Spielberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Film editing on a personal computer has its limitations. ``Film
professionals play with the Vaio and iMac,'' said Joe Bentivegna,
vice president of Avid Media, which makes professional equipment
for digital film editing. ``They don't work with them. The editing
application on the Vaio lacks storage and performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Avid's editing software, experts say, the iMac and Sony
software can fall below the level of professional quality in things
like color saturation. And there is an even more basic drawback for
the consumer _ all images shot on VHS or Beta camcorders need to be
converted into a digital format before one can edit them on the
iMac DV or the Vaio.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a price comparison tends to render such quality
comparisons moot, especially for potential buyers who just want to
edit their home videos cheaply. The entry-level Avid setup costs
around $7,000, considerably more than either the Vaio or the iMac,
even with a $1,300 digital video camera thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   For a user with no secret aspirations to be Spike Lee or Quentin
Tarantino _ someone who would be happy to have edited one
five-minute short of a family vacation, or to have merely
considered making such a film _ the Vaio and iMac DV may provide
most welcome new diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some would-be iMac auteurs just cannot afford to
spend an additional $1,000 on an iMac DV when they already have a
perfectly good, if uncinematic, computer at home. Hill, the actor,
is one of those putting off an iMac DV purchase for another time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't been the greatest of years for actors,'' he said.
``Our union is telling us an even bigger strike is coming that
could shut the whole industry down. For now, I've got to hoard my
money.''

 &HT;    'Iron Joe' Clark's kids make 800 meters a family affair
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ He made his name _ baseball bat in hand _ taking other
people's kids to task.
</P>
<P>
   You remember 'Iron Joe' Clark.
</P>
<P>
   That was him _ a trademark Louisville Slugger over his shoulder
_ glaring from the cover of Time magazine in 1989. That was him _
played in an Oscar-nominated performance by Morgan Freeman _ in the
movie ``Lean on Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was the confrontational, no-nonsense principal who took on
drug dealers and gangs to clean up Eastside High School in
Paterson, N.J., in the 1980s. On one day alone, he recently
admitted with pride, he suspended 300 students _ ``to the utter
dismay of liberals all over the land.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was riding herd on all the other kids, you might wonder
what was going on at his own home. Were his kids toeing the line?
Or, where they running all over the place?
</P>
<P>
   Both.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it sounded as you listened to the tale
his daughter, Joetta Clark Diggs, was telling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a set of rules we had to follow without question,'' she
said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for one of the better ones, she offered the mandate that
got her _ as well as her sister Hazel, sister-in-law, Jearl Miles
Clark, and brother J.J. _ to these Olympic Games, where they are
the most dominant track and field family in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's rule was pretty ironclad,'' said Joetta, who with
Hazel and Jearl are the three U.S. runners in the women's 800
meters that begins Friday. ``Basically, it was 'sprinters are a
dime a dozen. You are going to build character and discipline. You
will only run distance races.'''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions like that seem, at the least, open to debate. Many
people would consider them narrow-minded ,even blasphemous. Others
_ especially when they note that most sprinters are black _ might
even call the viewpoint racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the opposite,'' said Joetta, the 37-year-old team captain
of the U.S. Track and Field team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think back to when I came up. In 1968, black people were in
the street. There was a lot of unrest. My father wanted to make
sure we had opportunities. He exposed my brother and I to a lot of
things _ not just sports. When it came to track, he wanted to prove
stereotypes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said blacks can't run distance. He made us run the
800. He said it would build character, instill discipline. Growing
up, I was always the only black person in the race. But he said we
had an opportunity to open eyes and make a name for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Father knew best.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta _ for 21 consecutive years ranked among the top 10 U.S.
women in the 800 _ will be competing in her fourth Olympic Games.
Her 22-year-old sister Hazel _ who was the 1998 NCAA champion at
800 meters at the University of Florida _ is competing in her first
Olympics after winning the event at the U.S. Olympic Track and
Field Trials. Then, there's Jearl. The wife of J.J., it's Jearl's
fourth Olympics. She already has a gold medal from the 1,600-meter
relay at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   At the Track and Field Trials in Sacramento, Calif., Iron Joe
said J.J. was the only one who balked at the 800 edict.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the 800 would come around, he'd go hide,'' Joe said. ``He
really wanted to be a sprinter. It took several heated discussions
and a couple times I had to hunt him down like a bloodhound _ all
before he really came around.''
</P>
<P>
   J.J. ended up an All-American distance runner at Villanova
University. His dad's message was so instilled in him that he
convinced his wife _ a former quarter-miler _ to double her
distance and take on the 800. Today, J.J. coaches all three, which
has meant Joetta _ who lives in New Jersey _ flies down to spend
two weeks a month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That the three women would finish 1-2-3 at the Trials and come
en masse to Sydney took something of a late-race miracle. While
Hazel and Jearl battled each other for the lead, Joetta had faded
to the back of the pack in the final. Even with a stretch surge, it
looked as if Joetta wouldn't have enough steam to catch Meredith
Rainey Valmos.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final strides, Joetta closed hard and then leaned _
almost lunged _ into the finish. She won her berth in Sydney by
1/100th of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all about who would dig down the deepest,'' she said.
``That's where character comes in. Here, if I have to lean or dive
to make it to the next round, I will. ``
</P>
<P>
   She admitted this is her swan song. She'll retire after the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on, the lane will be empty,'' Joetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Clark kids, Joetta's most like her dad, who now is
the director of a juvenile detention center in New Jersey. He's
again proven to be controversial with his criticisms of young men
who parent children and offer no support and his belief that
youthful offenders with two convictions should remain incarcerated
until they are 21.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta once worked as a drug enforcement officer for the Newark
N.J. Pharmacy Board and next year she plans to run as a Republican
for freeholder (City Councilmember) in Somerset County, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   Hazel, on the other hand tried to embrace several other
activities before she found her niche. She tried horseback riding,
drama class, playing the piano and finally figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she felt the pull of the track...and the 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is with our Dad,'' Hazel said. ``He usually
gets his way. But instead of it being so overbearing, there's a
real sense of love from him. He's really helped me in everything in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the boys would come by, they'd be nervous enough just
from Dad's image,'' she recalled with a laugh. ``And then they'd
see those bats in the corner. Probably one or two left a little
quicker than when he came in.''
</P>
<P>
   ...Proof that Iron Joe Clark produced sprinters, as well.

 &HT;    U.S. women's soccer team reaches Olympic semifinals with win
over Nigeria
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia - The gantlet has been run, and with only a
few nicks along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's soccer team defeated Nigeria 3-1 Wednesday to
earn a date in the Olympic semifinals, withstanding a brutal
schedule that bunched the three best teams in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of survival in Group F, the Americans went 2-0-1,
gaining seven points and winning the top spot. The surprising loser
was China, ousted 2-1 by Norway after playing well Sunday in a draw
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that a team like China's out of the
tournament,'' U.S. captain Julie Foudy said. ``We would have loved
to have another shot at them.''
</P>
<P>
   So there will not be a U.S.-China rematch for the gold medal,
depriving the sport of its biggest rivalry. Instead, the Americans
will play in Canberra against Brazil, a team they have beaten twice
this year, for the right to defend their Olympic championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal in Sydney, also Sunday, Germany will meet
Norway, which lost to the U.S. in its opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as happy as we could be,'' U.S. coach April Heinrichs
said. ``Nigeria is one of the top six teams in the world. The way
they play is unsettling to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   After first-half goals by Brandi Chastain and Kristine Lilly
gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead, Nigeria began exerting pressure with its
speed. The Super Falcons pulled one back three minutes into the
second period when Mercy Akide knifed between four defenders and
put a shot past Siri Mullinix. Her exuberant Nigerian teammate,
Ifeanyichukwu Chiejine, was so happy she completed four back flips.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was short-lived, due to Nigeria's defensive
shortcomings. Goalkeeper Anna Chiejine was given a yellow card in
the 54th minute after a hard collision with U.S. striker Tiffeny
Milbrett at the edge of the penalty box. Shannon MacMillan hammered
the free kick over the wall of defenders and through the arms of
Chiejene, who reacted too late and eventually was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so hard to play against because they're so
unpredictable,'' U.S. defender Kate Sobrero said. ``Even they don't
know what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets about my team,'' Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo
said. ``Today, it was 3-1. Maybe the team that comes to play
tomorrow or next year will win.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking, but Nigeria did leave behind a few
souvenirs for the Americans. Lilly was removed at halftime after
injuring her arm in the physical match. Milbrett had a lacerated
left wrist. Both are expected to play against Brazil.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel who has been investigating
the tangled affair known as Whitewater said on Wednesday that there
was insufficient evidence to charge President Clinton and the first
lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that was somewhat anticlimactic and devoid of
ringing proclamations of innocence, the counsel, Robert W. Ray,
stated again and again that there was ``insufficient evidence to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the Clintons had done
something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lukewarm language or not, Ray's report was a victory for the
Clintons, at least in the legal arena. It comes as Mrs. Clinton is
locked in a bitter campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
Had Ray's report been less conclusive, its findings surely would
have been used against her in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had anxiously awaited Wednesday's report and
greeted its release with tempered relief. ``Robert Ray is now the
latest investigator to complete an examination of the transactions
related to Whitewater Development Company and conclude that there
are no grounds for legal action,'' said the president's press
secretary, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, speaking in Albany, N.Y., at a meeting of New York
state Associated Press members, said she believed that most people
decided long ago that there was little to the Whitewater charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that this is finally over,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
``Now everybody can just move on and be focused on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's statement was issued to coincide with a detailed document
transmitted under seal to the panel of federal judges to whom he
reports. With the developments Wednesday, the long episode that
began as an inquiry into Arkansas real estate dealings and wandered
far afield (at a cost estimated at more than $50 million) is near
an end.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began with events in Arkansas years before
most Americans knew who the Clintons were, and long before Bill
Clinton ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   How the episode that began with obscure real estate deals
eventually led to the second impeachment of a president in U.S.
history, involving Clinton's relationship with a White House aide,
is a story that only the most ardent Whitewater buffs can follow
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's predecessor and the Clintons' nemesis, Kenneth Starr,
expanded the original Whitewater investigation into other matters
with the permission of the judicial panel overseeing the
prosecution. The Clintons and their allies have accused him of
wandering far afield out of vindictiveness, but at least some of
his forays came about because accusations of Clinton's misbehavior
not related to real estate found their way to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The original inquiry grew out of a relationship between James B.
McDougal and his former wife, Susan, who were partners with the
Clintons in an Arkansas real estate venture. The McDougals also
owned an Arkansas savings-and-loan association, which was deeply
involved in the Whitewater real estate development and which
failed, at a cost estimated to be as high as $73 million in
taxpayers' money. The McDougals were convicted in 1996 of fraud
surrounding the collapse of their savings and loan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Whitewater land deal began in 1978, when the Clintons and
the McDougals became partners in a 230-acre land venture at the
conjuncture of Crooked Creek and White River in northern Arkansas.
During the 1992 presidential election, James McDougal publicly
complained that he had absorbed the Clintons' losses. That
eventually lead to the investigation by the office of the
independent counsel of whether James McDougal had improperly
diverted money from his savings-and-loan, Madison Guaranty, to
benefit the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said in his report that he and his staff had concluded that
there was insufficient evidence ``to prove to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt'' that the Clintons knowingly took part in any
criminal activity related to the Whitewater development or the
failed savings and loan.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, too, that there was insufficient evidence to
prove that the president knew of or gave false testimony regarding
a loan made to the savings and loan.
</P>
<P>
   It said, further, that there was insufficient evidence to prove
that the Clintons were involved in any effort to provide a quid pro
quo for Webster Hubbell, the former Number 2 Justice Department
official who resigned and eventually went to prison when the
mushrooming Whitewater investigation revealed that he had bilked
his partners at the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark., where he
and Hillary Clinton were once partners.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions of a quid pro quo involving Hubbell arose after he
obtained various consulting fees through political connections at
the height of the Whitewater scandal. There were questions as to
whether the fees really amounted to hush money.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ray concluded that two other rivulets of the inquiry,
involving dismissals from the White House travel office and the
mishandling of FBI files involving former Republican government
appointees, did not involve criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those involved in the original Whitewater episode are
dead, while others are trying to rebuild their lives. The
independent counsel law under which Ray and Starr operated is also
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Still alive, and potentially incendiary, are two other facets of
the investigation. One is a proceeding in Arkansas to determine
whether Clinton should be disbarred for giving false testimony in
the sexual-misconduct suit filed against him by Paula Jones. The
other is a decision on whether criminal charges stemming from
Clinton's untruthful testimony involving the White House intern
should be lodged against him once he leaves office.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phenomenal growth of the U.S. economy springs
from the combined genius of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the way
Democrats tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, say Republicans, who award the Clinton-Gore team
zero credit for the nation's robust economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies in between.
</P>
<P>
   That should matter to voters trying to decide if Democrat Gore,
Clinton's vice president, should be the next president, or whether
it is time for new leaders and new policies, meaning Republican
George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, pollster Peter Hart found that 47 percent of
Americans surveyed would vote for ``continuity'' and exactly the
same percentage were ready to vote for ``change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the good times rolling'' is the gut message of the Gore
campaign. Bush says he can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who is in charge? The answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts believe that bad decisions by elected
leaders certainly can wreck an economy. But they also argue that no
administration can really be said to control or manage all the
complex and interrelated forces that build or destroy wealth,
create or erase jobs, and raise or lower living standards for
American families.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces include competition, interest rates, oil prices,
fiscal policy, work-force education and training, technological
innovation, capital formation, entrepreneurial enterprise, consumer
confidence, taxes and trends in global trade. And these are just
some of the factors that drive or impede the U.S. economy in
differing degrees, at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential authority over most of these factors is limited, at
best. Clinton may be entitled to substantial credit for things he
didn't do as well as things he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's dictum, `first, do no harm,' may be applied to
much of Clinton's economic policy,'' said Bruce A. Wallin, a
political science professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
``It has moderately contributed to economic expansion, and has not
done much to get in its way. A Republican president might have done
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   How? By prematurely cutting taxes, which probably would have led
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates, according to
Thomas A. Ferguson,a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really Alan Greenspan's economy, in Ferguson's view. ``It's
Greenspan who gets the credit,'' he said, referring to the Federal
Reserve Board chairman's manipulation of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wallin and Ferguson, like many other experts, say presidents get
more blame and more credit for performance of the economy than they
deserve. Wallin put it bluntly: ``Our current economic growth
likely would have happened no matter who was in office. Timing is
everything, and it may be better sometimes to be lucky than good.''
</P>
<P>
   When historians distribute credit for the current economy,
Wallin believes,a big share should go to a late leader of the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not Bill Clinton or Al Gore who gets credit, but more
appropriately Nikita Khrushchev who caused it by launching Sputnik,
and subsequently America, into a technological revolution,'' Wallin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an axiom of politics that success has a hundred fathers
and failure is an orphan. Other candidates for paternity of the
economic boom include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President George Bush, whose 1990 budget imposed limits
on spending and began a pay-as-you-go policy for entitlement and
revenue changes, as well as a tax increase that may have cost him
his job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ross Perot, for elevating deficit reduction as a key issue in
the 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican
Congress, whose ``Contract With America'' prodded Clinton to cut
deficits further.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President Ronald Reagan, whose anti-regulation,
anti-tax, pro-business administration coincided with the start of
an 18-year growth period interrupted only briefly by six months of
recession under Bush, and continuing through the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration gets a lot of credit for the 1993
budget, but it is inevitable that political leaders would like to
claim credit for things that come from the private economy,'' says
economist Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for
Economic Development, a nonpartisan group of business and education
leaders who study policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 budget, passed without the support of a single
Republican in Congress, was pivotal because with it, Clinton
postponed his election-year promise of a middle-class tax cut and
substituted a package of spending cuts and tax increases on
upper-income Americans to achieve deficit reductions. It was a
political risk, and many Democratic members of Congress paid the
price in elections the following year, when the Republicans seized
control of both House and Senate. But the economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration can certainly claim they had very
successful stewardship of the economy in the last eight years,''
Ooms said. ``On the other hand, one has to recognize that
stewardship happens on the edges of an economy that is basically
driven by the private sector. They had the capacity to screw things
up, and didn't, and should get credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats with White House experience acknowledge that
Clinton-Gore claims of responsibility for the economic good times
may be a bit inflated.

<P>
   ``Presidents don't literally manage the economy,'' said Jack
Watson, who served as White House chief of staff for Democrat Jimmy
Carter. ``They can calibrate the budget, and fiscal policy is
important to the success of the economy, but not determinative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economy doesn't run by itself, on automatic pilot.
``You've got to give the guy (Clinton) some credit for it,'' says
Bryan Jones, director of the Center for American Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jones points to Clinton's support for trade globalization and
deficit reduction as key.

   Economics is hardly an exact science in which right and wrong
answers can be tested and determined in advance, and the
consequences of policy changes known with accuracy. What worked
yesterday may not work today.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Clinton's chief economic adviser,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are eternal truths in economic policy, but
that economic policies have to be adapted to circumstances,''
Summers recently told a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Summers thinks a lot more than luck was involved
in the economic growth spurt on Clinton's watch. He recalls the
bitter struggle with Republicans over Clinton's 1993
deficit-cutting budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, during the 1993 budget debate there were
people, like the president, who said this was crucial to turning
the economy around, and there were people like Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich who said it risked recession,'' Summers said. ``But there
was nobody who said it was inconsequential and it really wouldn't
be very important to the future of the outcome. So everybody
thought at the time that it was consequential, and things turned
out much better. That suggests that it was consequential.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't all Clinton-Gore brilliance at work,
Summers concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I like to think about it is that moving to the right
kinds of policy unlocked the energy that was there in the economy,
without which the deficits would have stifled that energy. That's
not to say that if you didn't have entrepreneurs, if you didn't
have information technology, there would have been success. Those
things were absolutely necessary for success. But for them to
succeed, you needed a change in the national policies that were in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supplied the change, Summers said, and it is impossible
to calibrate with precision how much of the resulting success was
due to the president, how much to Greenspan, how much to other
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to walk comfortably, I need both my right shoe and my
left shoe and it's sort of fruitless to try to define what fraction
of my comfort is due to my right shoe and what fraction of my
comfort is due to my left shoe, because both are necessary,''
Summers said. ``And that's the right way to think about the success
of the American economy.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phenomenal growth of the U.S. economy springs
from the combined genius of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the way
Democrats tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, say Republicans, who award the Clinton-Gore team
zero credit for the nation's robust economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies in between.
</P>
<P>
   That should matter to voters trying to decide if Democrat Gore,
Clinton's vice president, should be the next president, or whether
it is time for new leaders and new policies, meaning Republican
George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, pollster Peter Hart found that 47 percent of
Americans surveyed would vote for ``continuity'' and exactly the
same percentage were ready to vote for ``change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the good times rolling'' is the gut message of the Gore
campaign. Bush says he can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who is in charge? The answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts believe that bad decisions by elected
leaders certainly can wreck an economy. But they also argue that no
administration can really be said to control or manage all the
complex and interrelated forces that build or destroy wealth,
create or erase jobs, and raise or lower living standards for
American families.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces include competition, interest rates, oil prices,
fiscal policy, work-force education and training, technological
innovation, capital formation, entrepreneurial enterprise, consumer
confidence, taxes and trends in global trade. And these are just
some of the factors that drive or impede the U.S. economy in
differing degrees, at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential authority over most of these factors is limited, at
best. Clinton may be entitled to substantial credit for things he
didn't do as well as things he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's dictum, `first, do no harm,' may be applied to
much of Clinton's economic policy,'' said Bruce A. Wallin, a
political science professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
``It has moderately contributed to economic expansion, and has not
done much to get in its way. A Republican president might have done
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   How? By prematurely cutting taxes, which probably would have led
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates, according to
Thomas A. Ferguson,a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really Alan Greenspan's economy, in Ferguson's view. ``It's
Greenspan who gets the credit,'' he said, referring to the Federal
Reserve Board chairman's manipulation of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wallin and Ferguson, like many other experts, say presidents get
more blame and more credit for performance of the economy than they
deserve. Wallin put it bluntly: ``Our current economic growth
likely would have happened no matter who was in office. Timing is
everything, and it may be better sometimes to be lucky than good.''
</P>
<P>
   When historians distribute credit for the current economy,
Wallin believes,a big share should go to a late leader of the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not Bill Clinton or Al Gore who gets credit, but more
appropriately Nikita Khrushchev who caused it by launching Sputnik,
and subsequently America, into a technological revolution,'' Wallin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an axiom of politics that success has a hundred fathers
and failure is an orphan. Other candidates for paternity of the
economic boom include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President George Bush, whose 1990 budget imposed limits
on spending and began a pay-as-you-go policy for entitlement and
revenue changes, as well as a tax increase that may have cost him
his job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ross Perot, for elevating deficit reduction as a key issue in
the 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican
Congress, whose ``Contract With America'' prodded Clinton to cut
deficits further.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President Ronald Reagan, whose anti-regulation,
anti-tax, pro-business administration coincided with the start of
an 18-year growth period interrupted only briefly by six months of
recession under Bush, and continuing through the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration gets a lot of credit for the 1993
budget, but it is inevitable that political leaders would like to
claim credit for things that come from the private economy,'' says
economist Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for
Economic Development, a nonpartisan group of business and education
leaders who study policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 budget, passed without the support of a single
Republican in Congress, was pivotal because with it, Clinton
postponed his election-year promise of a middle-class tax cut and
substituted a package of spending cuts and tax increases on
upper-income Americans to achieve deficit reductions. It was a
political risk, and many Democratic members of Congress paid the
price in elections the following year, when the Republicans seized
control of both House and Senate. But the economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration can certainly claim they had very
successful stewardship of the economy in the last eight years,''
Ooms said. ``On the other hand, one has to recognize that
stewardship happens on the edges of an economy that is basically
driven by the private sector. They had the capacity to screw things
up, and didn't, and should get credit for that.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phenomenal growth of the U.S. economy springs
from the combined genius of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the way
Democrats tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, say Republicans, who award the Clinton-Gore team
zero credit for the nation's robust economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies in between.
</P>
<P>
   That should matter to voters trying to decide if Democrat Gore,
Clinton's vice president, should be the next president, or whether
it is time for new leaders and new policies, meaning Republican
George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, pollster Peter Hart found that 47 percent of
Americans surveyed would vote for ``continuity'' and exactly the
same percentage were ready to vote for ``change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the good times rolling'' is the gut message of the Gore
campaign. Bush says he can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who is in charge? The answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts believe that bad decisions by elected
leaders certainly can wreck an economy. But they also argue that no
administration can really be said to control or manage all the
complex and interrelated forces that build or destroy wealth,
create or erase jobs, and raise or lower living standards for
American families.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces include competition, interest rates, oil prices,
fiscal policy, work-force education and training, technological
innovation, capital formation, entrepreneurial enterprise, consumer
confidence, taxes and trends in global trade. And these are just
some of the factors that drive or impede the U.S. economy in
differing degrees, at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential authority over most of these factors is limited, at
best. Clinton may be entitled to substantial credit for things he
didn't do as well as things he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's dictum, `first, do no harm,' may be applied to
much of Clinton's economic policy,'' said Bruce A. Wallin, a
political science professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
``It has moderately contributed to economic expansion, and has not
done much to get in its way. A Republican president might have done
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   How? By prematurely cutting taxes, which probably would have led
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates, according to
Thomas A. Ferguson,a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's really Alan Greenspan's economy, in Ferguson's view. ``It's
Greenspan who gets the credit,'' he said, referring to the Federal
Reserve Board chairman's manipulation of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wallin and Ferguson, like many other experts, say presidents get
more blame and more credit for performance of the economy than they
deserve. Wallin put it bluntly: ``Our current economic growth
likely would have happened no matter who was in office. Timing is
everything, and it may be better sometimes to be lucky than good.''
</P>
<P>
   When historians distribute credit for the current economy,
Wallin believes,a big share should go to a late leader of the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not Bill Clinton or Al Gore who gets credit, but more
appropriately Nikita Khrushchev who caused it by launching Sputnik,
and subsequently America, into a technological revolution,'' Wallin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an axiom of politics that success has a hundred fathers
and failure is an orphan. Other candidates for paternity of the
economic boom include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President George Bush, whose 1990 budget imposed limits
on spending and began a pay-as-you-go policy for entitlement and
revenue changes, as well as a tax increase that may have cost him
his job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ross Perot, for elevating deficit reduction as a key issue in
the 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican
Congress, whose ``Contract With America'' prodded Clinton to cut
deficits further.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former President Ronald Reagan, whose anti-regulation,
anti-tax, pro-business administration coincided with the start of
an 18-year growth period interrupted only briefly by six months of
recession under Bush, and continuing through the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration gets a lot of credit for the 1993
budget, but it is inevitable that political leaders would like to
claim credit for things that come from the private economy,'' says
economist Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for
Economic Development, a nonpartisan group of business and education
leaders who study policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 budget, passed without the support of a single
Republican in Congress, was pivotal because with it, Clinton
postponed his election-year promise of a middle-class tax cut and
substituted a package of spending cuts and tax increases on
upper-income Americans to achieve deficit reductions. It was a
political risk, and many Democratic members of Congress paid the
price in elections the following year, when the Republicans seized
control of both House and Senate. But the economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration can certainly claim they had very
successful stewardship of the economy in the last eight years,''
Ooms said. ``On the other hand, one has to recognize that
stewardship happens on the edges of an economy that is basically
driven by the private sector. They had the capacity to screw things
up, and didn't, and should get credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats with White House experience acknowledge that
Clinton-Gore claims of responsibility for the economic good times
may be a bit inflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents don't literally manage the economy,'' said Jack
Watson, who served as White House chief of staff for Democrat Jimmy
Carter. ``They can calibrate the budget, and fiscal policy is
important to the success of the economy, but not determinative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economy doesn't run by itself, on automatic pilot.
``You've got to give the guy (Clinton) some credit for it,'' says
Bryan Jones, director of the Center for American Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jones points to Clinton's support for trade globalization and
deficit reduction as key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is good but Clinton was just as good,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Economics is hardly an exact science in which right and wrong
answers can be tested and determined in advance, and the
consequences of policy changes known with accuracy. What worked
yesterday may not work today.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Clinton's chief economic adviser,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are eternal truths in economic policy, but
that economic policies have to be adapted to circumstances,''
Summers recently told a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Summers thinks a lot more than luck was involved
in the economic growth spurt on Clinton's watch. He recalls the
bitter struggle with Republicans over Clinton's 1993
deficit-cutting budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, during the 1993 budget debate there were
people, like the president, who said this was crucial to turning
the economy around, and there were people like Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich who said it risked recession,'' Summers said. ``But there
was nobody who said it was inconsequential and it really wouldn't
be very important to the future of the outcome. So everybody
thought at the time that it was consequential, and things turned
out much better. That suggests that it was consequential.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't all Clinton-Gore brilliance at work,
Summers concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I like to think about it is that moving to the right
kinds of policy unlocked the energy that was there in the economy,
without which the deficits would have stifled that energy. That's
not to say that if you didn't have entrepreneurs, if you didn't
have information technology, there would have been success. Those
things were absolutely necessary for success. But for them to
succeed, you needed a change in the national policies that were in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supplied the change, Summers said, and it is impossible
to calibrate with precision how much of the resulting success was
due to the president, how much to Greenspan, how much to other
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to walk comfortably, I need both my right shoe and my
left shoe and it's sort of fruitless to try to define what fraction
of my comfort is due to my right shoe and what fraction of my
comfort is due to my left shoe, because both are necessary,''
Summers said. ``And that's the right way to think about the success
of the American economy.''

JOURNALISTS DESCRIBE HARROWING FOUR DAYS WITH CAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines _ After a dramatic escape from Muslim
rebels, two French journalists said Wednesday they had spent an
exhausting four days and nights on the run with their captors after
the Philippine military launched a surprise assault to wipe out the
rebels and liberate 19 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Jacques Le Garrec, 46, and Roland Madura, 49, are the only
hostages to gain their freedom since Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered an attack on the Abu Sayyaf guerrilla bases on the
southern island of Jolo last Saturday. Fed up with a cycle of
negotiation, under-the-table ransom payments, and new kidnappings,
Estrada canceled talks and declared war on the rebels, pledging
that the military would eliminate them and free the captives in a
matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly-shaven after two months of captivity in the jungle, and
flanking a beaming Estrada at the presidential palace in Manila,
the two former hostages appeared in good health as they smiled and
thanked the government for launching the attack that gave them the
opportunity to flee to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's been a very hard decision to make a military
operation, and it gave us the opportunity to escape,'' Le Garrac
said. The men said 12 evangelists also being held hostage were
alive, though their leader was weak from a 40-day hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before they left for Paris, however, Le Garrec
and Madura privately questioned the wisdom of the assault, saying
the main victims have been the civilians of Jolo. An estimated
5,000 have fled their homes to non-combat areas. A force of 4,000
troops has blockaded Jolo, 600 miles south of Manila, and barred
journalists from going there.
</P>
<P>
   Le Garrec also said he felt ``abandoned'' by the government when
the assault began, adding that it could risk the lives of the
hostages, who could be used as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of France, Malaysia, and Germany have criticized
Estrada for not securing the captives' release before beginning the
campaign to destroy the Abu Sayyaf, a self-proclaimed band of
extremist Muslims who have profitted to the tune of more than $15
million by ransoming more than 100 people since March. The rebels
have used the money to buy high-powered weapons and fast boats to
carry out their separatist campaign for Muslim self-rule in the
majority-Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Le Garrec said negotiators told him and Madura they would be
released last Saturday, but they awoke early that morning to the
sound of mortar fire and were told to get ready to flee the
government onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were forced to walk all day and into the following
night to evade government troops. At one point they heard a radio
report in which Estrada said that the captives _ the journalists,
the evangelists, and an American Muslim _ had all walked into the
rebels' lair of their own choice. When they heard that, Le Garrec
said, ``We thought we had been abandoned,'' and that the government
might have decided they were expendable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt if we didn't save ourselves, nobody would,'' Le Garrec
told a Newsweek reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages spent Tuesday holed up in a house in the jungle,
then were herded out in pitch blackness and ordered to cross a
road. The two Frenchmen took advantage of the moment to flee into
the jungle, running for 200 yards before crouching down and hiding
in the brush. They sensed people looking for them with flashlights
but were not found.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. Tuesday, noisy rain began to fall. Knowing their
footsteps could not be heard, they fled through the dense
vegetation to a road. At dawn, they flagged a passing military
truck, and were taken to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The two Frenchmen and a female reporter were seized on July 9
when they went to interview Abu Sayyaf leaders who were holding 21
hostages they had seized at a Malaysian diving resort on April 23.
Their colleague was released a few weeks ago after the reported
payment of $1 million ransom by Libya, which bankrolled the release
of Western hostages in the guise of ``development aid'' for Muslims
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Le Garrec told his employer, France-2 television, that they were
well treated and that the captors became so attached to them that
``we were afraid that in the end they would keep us out of
affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada Wednesday predicted that the American hostage,
24-year-old Jeffrey Shilling of Oakland, Calif., would soon be
rescued. Schilling, a convert to Islam, visited the Abu Sayyaf camp
with his Filipina wife, a relative of a rebel leader, and was taken
hostage on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a bomb exploded on a ferry that had just arrived
in Zamboanga from a city in coastal Mindanao, killing the man
carrying the bomb and injuring seven others. Officials have not
established any link between the Abu Sayyaf and the bomb, but they
feared it may be a sign that the rebels are spreading their
campaign of havoc to cities.

MR. SPELLING IS MISSING THE `POINTE' _ IT'S SATIRE OF SOAPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The point of ``Grosse Pointe'' is satire, which rarely plays
well on American TV. Example: Last season, a spoof of the movie biz
called ``Action'' was adored by critics and ignored by viewers.
(Bonus example: if ``The Larry Sanders Show'' had aired on network
TV rather than on cable, its small following would have doomed it
long before Garry Shandling could suffer his first paranoia
attack.)
</P>
<P>
   Months ahead of its own debut Friday night, ``Grosse Pointe''
incurred the disapproval of Aaron Spelling, who thought Darren
Star's parody was skating too close to the edge of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling and Star go way back. Star was the creative force
behind the long-running prime-time soaps ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Melrose Place,'' both produced by Spelling's company.
``Grosse Pointe'' is a fresh, funny skewering of such programs,
centering on a cast of young actors playing young actors. The fact
that one of Star's characters looked a lot like Spelling's
daughter, Tori, is what got the elder Spelling's knickers in a
knot. Star capitulated, changing the hair color of actress Lindsay
Sloane and altering some scenes in the pilot that Spelling deemed
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if Spelling gave Star one of those
if-you-want-to-work-in-this-town-again ultimatums. But his thin
skin and big ego forced a creator and a network _ The WB in this
case _ to cave. Even more remarkable is that ``Grosse Pointe''
still has some sharp barbs on its hook, which may prove that it's
possible to do satire in Hollywood and still have a job.
</P>
<P>
   The show within a show can be a nightmare since it requires a
person to create two characters: the ``real'' one and the
``fictitious'' one. The ``Grosse Pointe'' cast is good at it,
artfully switching from the twentysomethings they are in real life
to the teens they play on the high school melodrama ``Grosse
Pointe.''
</P>
<P>
   As much a spoof of The WB's own teen-targeted shows as it is a
sendup of ``90210,'' ``Grosse Pointe'' offers the most compelling
argument yet that the TV business is just like high school. You've
got the stuck-up diva, Hunter Fallow (Irene Molloy doing a lovely
homage to Shannen Doherty), the eager newcomer, Courtney Scott
(Bonnie Somerville), the insecure do-gooder, Marcy Sternfeld
(Sloane), the clueless surfer dude, Johnny Bishop (Al Santos), the
mature stud with follicle issues, Quentin King (Kohl Sudduth), and
the frustrated stand-in, Dave May (Kyle Howard), all shepherded by
a producer (William Ragsdale) who has no idea what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this exchange, between Courtney, dressed like Elly May
Clampett in short shorts and skimpy top, and a cynical wardrobe
assistant encapsulates what we all know and loathe about TV, and
will come to love about ``Grosse Pointe'':
</P>
<P>
   COURTNEY: I don't understand. Would I really be dressing this
way in the middle of a Michigan winter?
</P>
<P>
   WARDROBE PERSON: We don't pay attention to the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   C.: But how am I supposed to create any kind of reality? I mean,
I just moved to Grosse Pointe from West Virginia and it's my first
day of school. What am I saying with this outfit?
</P>
<P>
   W.P.: You're saying, ``I may be a hick but, dammit, I'm hot.''
</P>
<P>
   C.: Maybe because I'm a poor girl I have low self-esteem and I'm
trying to compensate for that by dressing in an exhibitionistic
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   W.P.: Right. They must have accidentally left that out of the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it might have been a Spelling error. Let's hope he
doesn't notice. ``Grosse Pointe'' is too promising to be trashed by
a peeved mogul.

QUEBEC REOPENS SHADOW EMBASSY IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Quebec, the Canadian province whose French language
and culture often makes it seem a nation apart, is Thursday
formally reopening its shadow embassy in Boston, an office known as
the Quebec Delegation to New England.
</P>
<P>
   More than a trade or tourist office, the aim of the delegation
is at least partly to promote Quebec as an entity distinct from the
rest of Canada. The secessionist movement in Quebec is in the
doldrums, with little hope of rebounding to the glory days that
almost led to a political break from Canada in 1995, but most
Quebecers remain passionate in the belief that theirs is a society
and culture profoundly different from the other nine provinces and
three territories, which are dominated by English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These delegations have a mission to promote economic ties, but
beyond that they are symbols of Quebec's enduring spirit of
autonomy,'' said Louis Balthazar, a Quebec political scientist
teaching at Bridgewater State College this fall as a Fulbright
scholar. ``Quebec is intent on promoting its own culture with its
own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec maintains roughly a dozen delegations around the world.
Boston joins Paris, New York, and other world capitals in hosting a
full-fledged Quebec delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston office was closed in 1995, partly for reasons of
austerity and partly because of bitter internal disputes within the
Quebec government as to whether the office's main role should be to
promote stronger economic and cultural interaction with New England
_ whose business and political leaders almost uniformly believe
Quebec secession would be a disaster _ or serve as an American
podium for the separatist views of the Quebec governing party, the
Parti Quebecois.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Lucien Bouchard, an ardent sovereignist, remains in
power in Quebec City, but the pragmatists have plainly won the the
day in Boston. Although the delegation will seek to offer a Quebec
perspective on Canadian events, Delegate Francois Lebrun _ in
effect, Quebec's ambassador to New England _ is known to keep a low
political profile and favors close cooperative relations with the
Canadian Consulate-General in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec officials in Boston may seek to defend Quebec on such
touchy issues as the stringent provincial language laws, which seek
to enforce the primacy of the French language. But the real focus
will be on forging stronger economic and cultural bonds between New
England and Canada's biggest province.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the reopening the Quebec Delegation is proof of the
high-flying Quebec-New England economy, as well as Quebec's
continuing determination to forge a foreign policy distinct from
Ottawa's.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England is a priority for the Quebec government,'' said
Martin Roy, spokesman for Quebec's minister for foreign affairs,
Louise Beaudoin, who will be in Boston for the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The admiration is mutual _ Thursday is ``Quebec Day'' in
Massachusetts, by proclamation of the state government. A ceremony
will be held at the French Library and Cultural Center in the Back
Bay, and more than 300 US and Canadian business, professional, and
political leaders are expected at the Quebec Delegation offices on
Milk Street.
</P>
<P>
   More than $9 billion in annual trade flows between Quebec and
the six New England states, with high-technology taking the
dominant share, a shift from the days when days when Quebec was
mostly a seller of lumber and pulp paper. That is nearly half of
New England's overall $20.5 billion trade with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonds between Quebec and New England are extraordinarily
deep,'' Balthazar said. ``That no one notices them is perhaps the
best proof that our relations are excellent.''

&HT;     ESTATE TAX CUT TOUTED BY BUSH RARELY TOUCHES MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush rarely makes a campaign stop without calling for the
elimination of the nation's inheritance tax, which he says will
benefit middle-class families and save small farms and businesses
across America.
</P>
<P>
   But because of new tax loopholes, crafty estate planning and an
exemption on the first $675,000 inherited, only 2 percent of
American estates actually pay an inheritance tax. Most Americans
inherit their money tax free, and most small businesses and farms
escape huge tax bills as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the vast majority of middle-class Americans say the
so-called death tax is a critical issue. A recent poll by Zogby
International found 86 percent of those surveyed think the
inheritance tax is unfair and should be eliminated, even when told
that by 2006 up to $1 million of an estate will be exempt from
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of concern on the part of the American people about
the death tax goes far beyond those who are immediately effected,''
Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney said at a stop
in Sacramento on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and pay 39 or 40 percent on what you earn as a
taxpayer, and then when you die Uncle Sam comes along and takes 50
percent of what's left so you can't give it to your kids, there is
a fundamental question of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush never talks about eliminating the estate tax to benefit the
wealthy. It's always in terms of the small family farm or business.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in a discussion with reporters, was asked why he talks
about the inheritance tax when mostly the very wealthy pay it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly because our opponents always want to treat it as `Well
these are rich people and we don't have to worry about that,'''
Cheney said, ``when in fact the consequences of it are significant
for real families, real Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the inheritance tax, however, ``would provide a
massive windfall for some of the country's wealthiest families,''
according to a recent study by the Washington D.C.-based Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The center found that only 43,000 American estates paid taxes in
1997. That is 1.9 percent of the 2.3 million people who died that
year. More than half of all inheritance taxes were in fact paid by
the wealthiest estates _ the 5 percent with assets over $5 million,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, a recent Treasury Department study shows that almost
no estate tax is paid by middle-income people,'' the center
reported. ``Most of the estate taxes are paid on the estates of
people who, in addition to having very substantial wealth, still
had high incomes around the time they died.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of estate taxes are paid by those with
incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And because of tax law changes made in 1997, family farms and
small businesses were given greater exemptions than other Americans
in inheritance taxes. Only six out of every 10,000 estates include
farms or businesses as a large part of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Family-owned businesses and farms already have a special
exemption under the law allowing up to $1.3 million in assets _
$2.6 million for a couple _ to be exempted from taxes. In addition,
surviving family members can spread out their tax payments, if any,
over 14 years, unlike other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that most estates never pay the highest
rate, 55 percent. Because of estate planning, exemptions,
deductions and tax credits, the average estate tax rate is closer
to 17 percent.

SO, YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(With CIRCUIT-HOME-MOVIES) 
(Eds: This story did not appear on the Circuits budget filed
earlier.) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it as easy as computer and videocamera makers would have you
think to edit a home movie on a computer?
</P>
<P>
   After spending a weekend making a short video of a youth soccer
match, I can say that the definitive answer to that question is:
yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, because video-editing software _ I used the iMovie program
that comes on Apple's iMac DV _ is simple, intuitive and even fun
to use. No, because to assemble anything other than the most basic
jumble of scenes requires an amount of skill, and free time, that I
(and many other people, I suspect) don't possess.
</P>
<P>
   With iMovie, raw video, fed into the computer from the camera
via a high-speed FireWire cable, is broken down into individual
scenes, what the software calls clips. These can be dragged and
dropped into a ``clip viewer'' in the order desired for the final
movie. Dissolves or other transitions are easily created, as are
titles and other effects. Sounds can be added or subtracted, volume
faded in or out.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, in theory. And iMovie's tutorial, which results in a
cute little movie about two children giving a dog a bath, makes it
seem simple in practice. The movie has six videoclips and shows how
to put them together, performing some tricks along the way, like
digitally splicing part of one clip into another, adding a music
soundtrack and creating scrolling credits.
</P>
<P>
   But even that 52-second movie takes about an hour to complete
(the tutorial itself suggests that it may take up to an hour and a
half). And that's with everything _ clips and sound files _ readily
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   My soccer movie, which ended up being 3 minutes, 42 seconds
long, took a lot longer to make. And while it's more than a basic
jumble of scenes, it's not as polished as the tutorial movie.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems cropped up at the beginning of the
process, as I was feeding the recorded video from the digital
camcorder into the computer (video from older analog camcorders
must be converted first). IMovie creates clips automatically,
making a new one every time the camera was stopped during
recording.
</P>
<P>
   While this is convenient, it also quickly revealed the haphazard
nature of my camera work. Where the tutorial had six clips, I ended
up with 49, varying in length from two seconds to about a minute
and a half. A little planning before and during the shooting would
make the whole process easier.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the software makes it simple to delete unwanted
clips (employing all the usual cut, copy and paste commands), so in
a first go-round I trashed about 30 of them. But that still left me
with about 20, and among these, most had unwanted or unusable
moments. (For one thing, an uninterrupted 90-second clip of a youth
soccer game feels like an eternity when viewed on screen.) So
before I could assemble my movie, I first had to edit the clips.
</P>
<P>
   Again, iMovie makes this easy. Each clip can be displayed and
run through at will, and can be quickly cut in two, or desired
snippets can be cut and pasted into new clips. The problem, of
course, is that the number of clips quickly start to multiply like
bacteria. Clip management can become a nightmare. IMovie gives each
clip a number, but I found it more convenient to rename them,
giving a short description of the action in each.
</P>
<P>
   Once the clips are edited, though, it's easy to arrange them in
the clip viewer in rough form. The clips can also be rearranged at
will _ trying different combinations of scenes until the movie
feels right.
</P>
<P>
   Each rough cut can be run through from start to finish on the
program's main display windows. This quickly revealed further flaws
in the clips _ many were too long and needed to be cut (even an
uninterrupted 15-second clip of a youth soccer game can feel like
an eternity). This, in turn, created still more clips.
</P>
<P>
   My final movie contained 29 clips, and even after a fair amount
of snipping and juggling, I wasn't completely satisfied. Some of
the clips were still too long, and while I did the best I could
arranging them, they seemed for the most part to be thrown together
haphazardly. But I couldn't go on rearranging forever.
</P>
<P>
   I used transitions _ one scene dissolving into the next, or one
appearing to push the other off the screen _ six times. These were
easy to create, and gave the finished product a more polished look,
helping to disguise some odd cuts. Adding a title superimposed on
one of the opening scenes was also easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   That left the soundtrack, which in some ways was even harder to
create than the video. IMovie allows the sound to be extracted from
a videoclip, so if you like the sound somewhere in the raw
material, but don't like the video, you can take the sound and
splice it in somewhere else. It's also easy to add canned sounds or
those you record yourself, even right at the computer using the
iMac's built-in microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as with the video, is that soon there is a
profusion of audio clips. These are added to the movie quite
simply, by placing them under the videoclips. But unlike the video,
the audio can't be seen, so it's easy to lose track of which clips
are where in the soundtrack. I found that it took a lot of
painstaking effort to get the audio clips right where I wanted
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about four hours after I sat down at the computer, I had
my finished movie _ one that my immediate family, at least, would
find watchable. No doubt the next time things would go much faster,
and the finished product would improve. But I doubt that there will
be a next time. Movie making is a nice thing to do in theory, but
in practice, I have other things to do with my time.  &QL;

 &HT;    FUNDING LACK PUTS WOMEN AT RISK, U.N. REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and other developed nations must
increase their funding for international family planning programs
or women will continue to die from a lack of access to reproductive
health care, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and United Nations officials spoke at a news conference
to release the U.N. Population Fund's (UNFPA) annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said about 500,000 maternal deaths occur each year in
developing countries, where just half of all births are
professionally attended. Of the estimated 50 million abortions
performed annually, it said, 20 million are unsafe and result in
the deaths of 78,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   One-third, or 80 million, of all pregnancies each year are
believed to be unwanted or mistimed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The UNFPA said that of the $5.7 billion a year that countries
have agreed is needed for family planning programs, less than half
of that amount has been made available from international sources.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, among other nations, has not met its
financial and moral obligation, said Margaret Pollack, director of
the Office of Population for the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the most prosperous nation on Earth, and
yet it ranks eighth in international population assistance to the
ratio of (gross national product),'' she said. ``Because we are a
nation that believes in individual freedom and responsibility, we
have every interest in supporting others around the world in
achieving those same rights and responsibilities we ourselves
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Pollock said, U.S. funding for international
population programs has been cut by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In human terms, these funding shortfalls mean that women will
continue to endure unintended pregnancies or resort to abortion,
and they will continue to die as a result of their pregnancies,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to restore funding for
these programs to their previous level in 1995 with an increase of
$170 million, Pollock said.
</P>
<P>
   The UNFPA has come under fire from anti-abortion groups such as
the American Life League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their money isn't going towards saving these women's lives,
but killing their babies,'' said Cathy Brown, a league
representative who protested the report's findings outside the U.N.
Foundation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Lives Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women
in a Time of Change,'' also documented gender disparities. It said
that 2 million more African women than men suffer from HIV/AIDS,
that 5,000 women and girls are murdered each year in ``honor''
killings, and that more than 100 million women and girls are
affected by female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   UNFPA officials said at the news conference that because of a
lack of resources, organizations like theirs are unable to provide
women with what they need and want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main obstacle is the fact that we often have to cut
programs because of financial constraints,'' said Thoraya Obaid,
director of the UNFPA's division for Arab states and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even though UNFPA's progress has been
quantitatively documented, Obaid said. For example, more than a
dozen countries, including Senegal and Ghana, have passed laws
banning female genital mutilation _ a victory due in part to
UNFPA's efforts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this (report) will help stimulate an increased
financial commitment from Washington and other developed countries
to help end gender inequality all around the world.''

GORE ATTRACTS A CROSS-SECTION AT RALY

<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ The line started forming before 7 a.m.
Wednesday, and on it went for hours: the elderly, the infirm, the
Internet wealthy, and the working class, all waiting in the rising
heat for a glimpse of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They came for reasons both political and personal. Many, of
course, wanted to show their support for Gore's White house bid.
When he arrived shortly after 10 a.m., they stomped and cheered and
whistled their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said the candidate mattered less to them than
the chance to witness a bit of history on their home turf. Local
schools brought students; class projects were in the making. Still,
caught up in the moment, many of them roared their approval _
regardless of whether they held a coveted red ticket that got them
close to Gore or a white ticket that kept them toward the back of
the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew I'd have to stand, I wouldn't be here,'' said Evelyn
Markland, 77, a retired secretary who walks with the aid of a cane
and lives near the park where Gore spoke. ``But I'm glad I came. I
like him and it was right around the corner to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 1,000 people who live in the Silicon Valley turned out
to hear the vice president speak at Lakewood Park, where veterans
in VFW caps leaned against trees, schoolchildren on risers
serenaded the gathering and men in union T-shirts served as a
photogenic backdrop. ``Are you with me?'' Gore asked after
outlining his positions on Social Security and prescription drug
plans once again. The clapping crowd made clear they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been afraid to, or hesitant to, stand up to the
big drug companies,'' said Gore, addressing an issue Markland
called especially important to her. ``Let me tell you in this day
and time it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Markland, many of the voters who were missing work or
classes or had driven 50 minutes or more in rush-hour traffic had
trouble articulating why they want Gore as the nation's 43rd
president. Instead, they tended to use the same sort of platitudes
and generalities often heard in the stump speeches of presidential
candidates. Mostly ignoring particulars, they talked of Gore's
goodwill, of his experience and integrity, of his willingness to
speak for all Americans regardless of their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Lam, a 20-year-old public policy major at Stanford
University in Palo Alto and a former Gore intern, said ``he works
to find solutions to meet the needs of all Americans, especially
the bottom rung.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bradshaw, a 24-year-old from Oakland who is working on
the campaign opposing school vouchers in California, added, ``I
love Al Gore. I love that he's a good coalition builder and that
he's bringing forth the traditions of the Democrat Party by
bringing people together.''
</P>
<P>
   In praising Gore, many also blasted Bush, implying their votes
would be against the Republican candidate as much as for the
Democrat who stopped briefly in their neighborhood Wednesday. Carol
Chicelli, 57, who owns a small computer software company in Los
Altos, a Republican stronghold, said she likes both Gore's populist
approach and ``the fact that he speaks in complete paragraphs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's a hard worker and that he got here from hard
work and not from entitlement,'' said Robin Kearns, 42, who drove
in from San Jose to see her eighth-grade daughter play the clarinet
in the band that was providing music for the rally. ``Mostly I
think George Bush doesn't have the experience to lead the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the crowd, Kearns said she couldn't imagine herself
voting for a Republican under any circumstances. Marcos Rodelos,
23, an electrical engineering major at the University of California
at Berkeley, said he supported the Democrats because his father is
a union official and joined the rally because the International
Union of Painters and Allied Trades was out in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a college student, so politics are the last thing on my
mind right now,'' Rodelos said. ``But I thought this would be a
good opportunity to see how politics works.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of Silicon Valley, populated with new money, tend
to be conservative. But some Internet types turned out for Gore,
who added at least $3.5 million to Democratic coffers when he
attended a Tuesday night fundraiser at a computer tycoon's Atherton
mansion, an event also attended by actors Sharon Stone and Robin
Willians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm one of these Silicon Valley paper
millionaires, I want a president who will do right by all
Americans,'' said Brian Drygas, 45, a software trainer from San
Jose. ``That's what being an American is all about.''

   OLY-SWIM-ARCH _ SYDNEY _ While swimmer Eric Moussambani from
Equatorial Guinea was awkward and slow as he competed in the
100-meter freestyle prelims, the 17,500 fans in the crowd stood and
cheered his every stroke. For one minute 52.72 seconds _ which is
nearly 2 1/2 times slower than it took Aussie Michael Klim to swim
the same distance in world record time during Saturday's 400-meter
relay _ Moussambani thrashed and flailed and tried desperately to
make it the pool wall. The Sydney Olympics had a hero reminiscent
of Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, the myopic ski jumper at the 1988
Calgary Olympics or, better yet, John Akhwari, the Tanzanian
marathon runner who came limping into the stadium more than hour
behind the rest of the field at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico
City. Moussambani _ a 22-year-old student from the inland town of
Molabu in his West African country _ just learned how to swim in
January. He trained in a hotel pool that was just 20-meters long
and _ because tourists there had first dibs _ he rarely got access
to the facility. Moussambani had never before swum 50 meters, much
less 100 _ the event in which he was entered. (Archdeacon, Dayton

a trademark Louisville Slugger over his shoulder _ glaring out at
you from the cover of Time magazine back in 1989. As he was riding
herd on all the other kids, you might wonder what was going on at
his own home. Were his kids toeing the line? Or, where they running
all over the place? Both. At least that's the way it sounded as you
listened to the tale his daughter, Joetta Clark Diggs, was telling
Wednesday in Sydney. (Archdeacon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

United States' Hyman upset Australia's Madame Butterfly, Susie
O'Neill, in front of her home crowd on Wednesday. Hyman's win in
the 200-meter butterfly also managed to upstage the night's premier

   PRESIDENTIAL-POLL _ DAYTON, Ohio _ As presidential principals
continue to flock to Ohio, the latest polls, including the most
recent Ohio Poll, show the race tightening here, but Bush still
holding to a lead. Ohio Poll of 600 likely voters has Bush up by
four points in Ohio, but Gore closing in. Bush' numbers have been
stable over last five months, while Gore has climbed steadily, if
slowly. He has yet to turn the corner, however, even among women _
where he's doing quite well nationally, but running even w/ Bush in
Ohio. Results mirror polls of four battleground states taken this

Ohio, but Gore polling significantly ahead in Michigan, Illinois
and Pennsylvania. These polls were taken before the flap over dog

   COXNET FOOD 0919: BUILDING A BETTER BANANA _ In the modern world
of the nation's fruit processing facilities, an increased number of
store chains have built banana ripening rooms designed to turn out
fruit just the right colors at the right time. In these
climate-controlled places, computers and temperature probes, forced
air and pressurized doors combine to bring bananas to a buff
condition 365 days a year. It's a far cry from the days of storing
bananas in a humid warehouse. (Crider, Austin American Statesman)

   KITCHEN-CONVERSATION _ Comfort food, says Judith Fertig, author

bites, the bee stings and the check is not in the mail. Ask people
what comfort food is and they'll offer a ready reply _ mac'n
cheese, meat loaf, homemade rolls. But then ask folks what THEIR
comfort food is and you may get some surprising answers. Mine is a
spicy Thai peanut dip that my Mom almost always had in the fridge

   HOMES-ELECTRICITY _ Let's face it; even if a person does all his
own lawn work , minor plumbing, carpentry, landscaping and other
jobs around the house, he may fear electrical work. Even if you
don't expect to fool with anything electrical yourself, it pays to
have a general understanding about how your home's electrical
system works. And it also helps to know how professional electrical
contractors go about the jobs they commonly do in people's houses.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Call
it the time of The Plan. Now's the time that thoughts of the next
fine gardens race through gardeners' heads like baseball players
rounding first after slamming one deep to center; we have, at last,
reached the fall renewal. Leaves tell the story. As the sourwoods
redden and the maples yellow, we, energized by the prospect of the
cool and maybe even the wet, can plant what we could not during the
hellish days of summer, appreciate what survived _ and perhaps most
important of all, anticipate next year. Next year. It'll be the
greatest, because of the plans we lay out now. (May, Atlanta

   KITCHEN-GARDEN _ The yard man said my backyard would never be
Shangri-la and I took his word for it, content to merely let him
spray and blow and bag and go. But then I tasted a potato for the
first time. Until you've tasted one that has just been dug up, you
haven't tasted a potato. And I knew that sunny hillside in my
backyard would someday be my Eden. Despite drought, work began this
summer, starting with a consultation with a garden designer. The
herb garden is in place; fall vegetables soon to go in the ground.

   SEASONS-BEST _ First, they suffered heat stroke. Then they got

they simply bade a sad farewell. If those tender plants you so
gingerly set out in beds last spring are now tumbleweed slammed
against the Herbie Curbie, chin up. Sure, days are still plenty
warm, water is still rationed, and those six packs of begonias look
more like six packs of Bud. But you and your yard are about to be
granted a second lease on gardening. Friday marks the official
opening of fall _ the best gardening season of all _ so get
organized. Here's a 10-point list of gardening projects for each of
the next three months to help you plan for fall, winter and spring.

upstate New York, a father of four, and a best-selling author.
Green is in town to promote his latest thriller, ``The Letter of
the Law.'' In other news, David Hackworth, the most decorated

   BOOKS-PUBLISHERS _ Not since the invention of the printing press
has there been so much buzz in the book business. As the Publishers
Association of the South and the Southeast Booksellers Association
members gather at Atlanta's Merchandise Mart this weekend for their
annual convention, discussion topics will range from the threat of
chain stores to the future of books themselves. ``The very
definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom Payton, president of
Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the lovingly composed, designed
and printed paper artifact to that of bits and bytes downloaded
onto handheld readers.'' To deal with some of these uncertainties,
Payton and other members of the Publishers Association of the South
have arranged a quarterly series of roundtable discussions open to
the public. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.

IN LATEST POLITICAL SCANDAL, ANOTHER HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL
RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In the latest scandal involving
high-ranking members of the South Korean government, a close aide
to President Kim Dae-jung, who was a key player in the government's
reconciliation efforts with North Korea, resigned Wednesday after
being accused of using his position to help businessmen obtain
sizable bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   While the latest scandal was not expected to affect talks
between the two Koreas, the accusations against the minister of
culture and tourism, Park Jie-won, and his resignation, were a
reminder of the collusive ties between businessmen and politicians
that plagued South Korea during its pre-reform days. The scandal
also meant lost credibility for the administration of Kim Dae-jung
in its efforts to get South Korean businesses to adopt management
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is that many people are linking Minister Park
with a scandal that is hindering political affairs, which in turn
is slowing down economic reforms,'' said Kim Il-young, a political
science professor at Sungkyunkwan University.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the president has surged since his summit
meeting in June with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. But at the
same time, the president has had to replace a premier and five
ministers because of scandals involving money since his
inauguration in February 1998. Less than a month ago, South Korea's
education minister was forced to resign when he was accused of
buying shares of Samsung Electronics at discounted prices while
serving as an outside auditor for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Park's close relationship with the president, which dates back
to the 1980s, was demonstrated by his appointment as Seoul's top
envoy to help prepare for the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Park has faced mounting pressure during the past several
weeks to resign after several news reports accused him of forcing
Hanvit Bank, the recipient of government funding, to extend loans
to a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing his resignation, Park denied the
accusation and said he will face an investigation by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for the concerns I have caused for the president
and the people,'' Park said. ``There must be no more incidents to
make the public lose confidence in the government.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ While enormous in scale, the Olympic Games
really are a mosaic of individual memories. They make up what is
called the Olympic Experience. Everyone involved in the Games has
them, and the experiences are all different.
</P>
<P>
   For me, 1984 in Los Angeles was cheeky British decathlon
champion Daley Thompson wearing a T-shirt that read, ``Is the
world's second-greatest athlete gay?'' in a not-so-veiled reference
to Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the use of the word gay, Thompson said
disingenuously, ``In my country, gay means happy.'' Right.
</P>
<P>
   In Barcelona in 1992 it was getting a minute with Nelson
Mandela. He was at the boxing venue to see one of his fellow South
Africans compete.
</P>
<P>
   After the South African had lost, Mandela remarked, ``He should
have used his jab more.'' As a boxer in his youth, Mandela knew
whereof he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   For wintry Lillehammer in 1994 it was watching two guys
ice-fishing on a frozen lake. Each fish they caught they simply
placed on the ice. At 10 degrees below zero, the fish weren't about
to spoil.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta four years ago, I shared my Olympic moment with the
world when Michael Johnson ran his astounding 19.32-second time in
the 200 meters, truly a race for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   As the time was posted, I found myself jumping up and down
uncontrollably, using all of my 6-inch vertical leaping ability.
Next to me, Bob Burns of the Sacramento Bee sank to his knees. Each
of us was overcome in our own way.
</P>
<P>
   So far in Sydney, my Olympic moment has to be having cocktails
with the writer Gay Talese, whose works of nonfiction include
``Unto the Sons,'' ``Honor Thy Father,'' and ``Kingdom and the
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in Melbourne, the night of the U.S.-China women's
soccer game. I was sitting in the hotel bar when an older gent in
an olive green suit asked if he could share the table. We
introduced ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Talese, it turns out, is writing a book about sports in China,
with a particular emphasis on the country's women's soccer team. I
had to chuckle at the juxtaposition _ a member of the New York
literati and a beer-guzzling barbarian sharing a table.
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling that won't be my defining Olympic moment. At
least I hope it's not.

 &HT;    Bush strikes a populist tone in Pennsylvania visit
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRYSVILLE, Pa. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, striking a
populist tone Wednesday, railed against the ``thinkers and planners
and plotters in the nation's capital,'' and attacked his Democratic
rival for attending a Hollywood fund-raiser one week after
criticizing its work.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate also outlined his plans to
eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty, as well as other
proposals, for a crowd of a few hundred mostly loyal supporters in
this Allegheny County town. This was Bush's third visit to the
county since the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia
ended in early August. It was also part of Bush's continuing ``Real
Plans for Real People'' tour. The tour is an all-out pitch to
middle-class and female voters in the face of polls showing Vice
President Al Gore scoring better on a number of issues and gaining
much-needed ground among women since the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``...This is a campaign which trusts people, people with your
own money, people with your health-care choices, trusts parents for
educating children as opposed to a campaign that trusts
bureaucracies, planners, thinkers, people in Washington, D.C. who
want to plan our lives for us,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked Gore for attending a $4.2 million Hollywood
fund-raising dinner Monday, a week after Gore and his running mate,
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman criticized the entertainment
industry as too violent, too sexual and no good for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like he must be auditioning for a Broadway play 'cause
he keeps changing his tune,'' Bush said. ``In the beginning of the
week he sounded awfully tough on Hollywood, talked about six months
and sanctions and tough language. After a couple of fund-raisers,
he changes his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman used a Federal Communications Commission
study as a springboard for calling for more regulation of the
makers of movies, videos and music if they don't better police
themselves. Monday, the running mates softened their tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have a tremendous regard for this industry,''
Lieberman said at the event where couples donated $10,000 to the
Democratic National Committee. ``We're both fans of the products
out of the entertainment industry _ not all of them, but a lot of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, denied any Gore
flip-flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore, unlike George Bush, is not afraid to disagree with
his friends,'' she said. ``Al Gore has repeatedly said that we need
to stop the marketing of violence to our children. George Bush has
yet to say what his approach would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attempt to reach ordinary citizens hit a momentary glitch
when a woman asked if he would support reauthorization, now
pending, of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The act created
federal penalties for stalking and domestic abuse across state
lines, toughened punishment for repeat sexual offenses, and
provided more funding for battered women's shelters, among other
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it up for reauthorization now? Give me the facts,'' Bush
told the woman, later saying, ``I need to know more about that.
Give me your name and address and I'll write you a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore backer Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she was
``surprised and concerned that Bush apparently had never heard of
one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting women in
a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., also rapped Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that the day after Bush sought women's votes
by performing on 'Oprah,' he revealed his stunning ignorance on a
topic that is so important to women voters,'' Maloney said. ``This
isn't a pop quiz. For some women, it's a matter of life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said later that Bush does support
reauthorization of Violence Against Women's Act and will convey
that message to Congressional GOP leaders.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: GORE POUNDS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a campaign rally and a blizzard of TV ads, Al Gore battled
George W. Bush over giving seniors a Medicare benefit for
prescription medicine. Vowing to stand up to the pharmaceutical
industry, Gore staged a rally today in Sunnyvale, Calif., the heart
of Silicon Valley, to promise he would ensure that all of the
nearly 40 million Americans on Medicare have access to affordable
prescription drugs, whether they are enrolled in traditional
Medicare or managed care. Gore said the drug companies were
``spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television and on
magazine advertising to persuade people to buy newer and more
expensive medications when less-expensive versions would usually
work just as well. I think that's just wrong. . . . We need to make
some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH RAPS GORE ON HOLLYWOOD SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Big contributions seem to have helped soften Al Gore's criticism
of entertainment violence aimed at kids, George W. Bush asserted
this afternoon in the Philadelphia suburbs. ``It seems like he must
be auditioning for a Broadway play, because he keeps changing his
tune,'' Bush said. A day after his appearance on Oprah Winfrey's TV
talk show, Bush also tried some auditioning of his own _ on a
looser, more informal campaign style that included his wife, Laura.
At a morning town-hall meeting in a Pittsburgh suburb, both Bushes,
microphones in hand, took questions.
</P>
<P>
   SIR ELTON DOES A FIRST-TIME CAMPAIGN GIG
</P>
<P>
   With Elton John at the piano belting out ``Benny and the Jets''
at his first political fund-raiser, Al Gore rocked on the dance
floor with his wife Tipper at a dinner party with wealthy Silicon
Valley supporters. The British-born pop star said he was
campaigning for Gore because, ``I do not want this country to have
to live under George W. Bush.'' About 300 people paid $10,000 to
$25,000 each to join the Gores and Sir Elton at the home of Eric
Schmidt, CEO of software maker Novell. ``I've never done a
political fund-raiser before,'' the knighted singer said.

   TEXAN TAPPED FOR DEBATE PREP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore tapped Paul Begala, a Texas native and former aide to
President Clinton, to stand in for George W. Bush as Gore prepares
for next month's debates. Begala replaces former Rep. Tom Downey,
who withdrew last week from the debate prep process after receiving
an anonymous package of Bush's confidential debate materials. Gore
campaign officials decided that they wanted a Texan to play Bush in
rehearsals to give Gore a feel for Bush's style and demeanor.
``Apparently they wanted a Texan with a (wise-guy) attitude and
occasionally a foul mouth, and why they settled on me is a
mystery,'' Begala joked in an interview with the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS MIXED IN THREE STATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has narrowed the presidential race in new state polls.
In Ohio (Ohio Poll, 4 percentage point error margin) Gore now
trails 47-43, and the two candidates are now virtually tied among
independent voters. Gore was behind by 8 points in the Ohio Poll
this spring. But George W. Bush is holding onto his edge in North
Carolina , leading 47-42 percent (Mason-Dixon poll, 4 percentage
point error margin). And Gore had a 52-33 lead among likely voters
in Connecticut (Quinnipiac poll, 3 percentage point error margin).
</P>
<P>
   GORE CAMP FAULTS MARRIAGE PENALTY PROPOSAL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign said today that while George W. Bush has
claimed he would ``dramatically reduce the marriage penalty,'' a
Treasury Department study of the marriage penalty plan endorsed by
Bush would leave out 23 million couples. The largest group left out
of Bush's marriage penalty plan, the Gore campain said, would be
12.4 million couples with stay-at-home mothers or fathers.
``Despite Bush's misleading claims, his marriage penalty relief
relieves the wealthiest the most _ and leaves 23 million couples
out in the cold,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   TWO TERM-LIMITS RENEGERS WIN
</P>
<P>
   Despite reneging on the term-limit pledge that helped usher him
into Congress, Rep. George Nethercutt (R-Wash.) survived his first
ballot box test since breaking his promise. Nethercutt's pledge to
retire after three terms helped him oust Tom Foley, who was speaker
of the House. This time, Nethercutt turned back a challenge from
Richard Clear, a former radio talk show host. In Massachusetts,
another term-limits pledge breaker, Rep. Marty Meehan, defeated two
Democratic primary challengers. In Oklahoma, where Republican Tom
Coburn kept his pledge to step down after three terms, Brad Carson
won the Democratic nomination to face GOP car dealer Andy Ewing.

<P>
   CANTWELL BEATS SENN, FACES GORTON NEXT
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Senate race promises to break state records, as
Maria Cantwell, an Internet executive and former one-term
congresswoman worth an estimated $40 million, tries to defeat Sen.
Slade Gorton, a three-term incumbent targeted as one of the
Senate's few vulnerable Republicans. Cantwell trounced her main
Democratic competitor, state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn,
who had won endorsements from union and party stalwarts and Green
Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader. Cantwell spent $5 million
of her own money on TV ads and built name recognition far beyond
the Seattle suburbs she once represented.
</P>
<P>
   TWO GM CRITICS TEAM UP ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader and filmmaker Michael Moore, first famous for their
criticism of General Motors, are back in the industrial Midwest for
a ``nonvoter tour'' targeting young and disillusioned Americans.
Moore, who wrote newsletters for Nader causes in the early 1980s,
says he's happy to help if he can. Nader's high-profile career as a
consumer advocate got its start with his 1965 book ``Unsafe at Any
Speed,'' a harshly critical look at U.S. auto manufacturing that
focused on GM's Corvair. Moore's 1989 documentary ``Roger &AMP; Me''
assailed the company's actions in closing its plant in Moore's
hometown, Flint, Mich. Their tour began today at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Then it was on to Madison and cities in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   NADER CRITICIZES SOCIAL SECURITY `PANIC'
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader said Social Security has an ``extremely solid''
economic base and urged George W. Bush and Al Gore to stop trying
to convince the public that the retirement program is headed for
bankruptcy. ``The idea that Social Security is going to run out of
money is simply nonsense,'' the Green Party candidate said. The
program has an ``extremely solid'' economic base that will provide
benefits until 2037, even under the ``pessimistic'' assumptions by
Social Security trustees who use a 1.7 percent average annual
growth rate to estimate their projections, Nader said. ``Panic
fueled by opportunistic politicians and investment firms poses the
only serious threat to the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SIT-IN AT DEBATE COMMISSION OFFICES
</P>
<P>
   Six protesters seeking to open up next month's presidential
debates to third-party candidates staged a brief sit-in today at
the offices of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Police
escorted the group away after about 40 minutes. No one was
arrested. The protest was staged by the fledgling Open Debate
Society, a small group composed mainly of supporters of Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader. The nonpartisan debate commission requires
candidates to register at least 15 percent of support in media
polls to be included; neither Nader nor the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan meets the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY STEPS UP CRITICISM OF GORE
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, a self-professed ``man of few words,'' is finding
his voice on a campaign swing though must-win California, lobbing
attacks at Al Gore on everything from Hollywood to taxes. In one of
his harshest attacks to date, Cheney said that Gore ``simply makes
some things up out of whole cloth and repeats them over and over
and over again until he's called on it.'' In Fresno, Cheney
referred to a story Gore told recently about his family's
prescription drug costs, saying, ``Once again he's playing fast and
loose with the facts to win an argument.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP AMASSES MONEY FOR CAMPAIGN STRETCH
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for the final stretch of the presidential campaign, the
Republican National Committee raised nearly $30 million in August,
party chairman Jim Nicholson said today. The party raised $29.3
million in August, with $21.5 million under federal limits and the
remaining $7.8 million in unregulated ``soft money'' donations. The
GOP raised $38 million in July. That brought its total fund-raising
since Jan. 1, 1999, to more than $200 million. Republicans have
long said they would have an advantage over Democrats in spending
for the fall campaign. The GOP reports its fund-raising totals
monthly; the Democratic National Committee reports quarterly. From
the start of 1999 through last June 30, the DNC reported raising
$108 million.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING MATES BRINGING IN MONEY
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney shake
political tin cups as well as hands, and their fundraising has
enriched their political parties by millions in the last month.
Their respective campaigns said Lieberman has raised $5.5 million
since hitting the fund-raising trail alone last week, while Cheney
took in $5.4 million in less than a month. Each major party ticket
has received $67.6 million in public funds and is prohibited from
raising any additional money for its campaign except for legal and
accounting costs. But the political parties continue to grab it
hungrily to finance issue ads designed to help elect their
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   MINE WORKERS FALL INTO LINE WITH GORE
</P>
<P>
   The United Mine Workers, the last holdout among labor unions in
the AFL-CIO, announced its endorsement of Al Gore today. The labor
federation as a whole endorsed Gore more than a year ago. The
miners followed the larger Teamsters union, which withheld its nod
until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   FEDS PROBING TORRICELLI DONOR
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating whether allies of Sen.
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) tried to keep a jailed political
fund-raiser from cooperating with authorities, the New York Times
reported today. The donor, David Chang, admitted in June that he
broke election laws by funneling $53,700 into Torricelli's
successful 1996 Senate campaign. He pleaded guilty to five
misdemeanor election-law violations and a felony obstruction charge
_ telling a potential grand jury witness to lie. As part of a plea
bargain, he agreed to assist investigators. The Times reported that
Chang told authorities that after his arrest he was visited in jail
by several strangers, and that one of the men told him not to
cooperate with authorities, while another simply put a finger to
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   SANCHEZ CANCELS ANOTHER EVENT
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic congresswoman who created a stir when she arranged
a party fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion during the Democratic
convention has canceled another event rather than change the format
because President Clinton's schedule changed. Rep. Loretta Sanchez
was scheduled to be hostess Sunday for a dinner with Clinton. But
she called it off rather than turn the event into a reception to
accommodate changes that limited the time the president would have
available. ``Loretta is Loretta,'' said Marty Schrank, California
Democratic secretary. ``She's shown lately that she's going to be
her own person.''
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO PUTS CHALLENGE ON CLINTON
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio issued a campaign finance challenge to Hillary
Clinton today, saying more than a dozen groups have agreed to stop
advertising against her if she agrees to ban so-called soft money
from their Senate race. Clinton had said the agreements were
required before she would call for a ban of unregulated donations
from the race. She already has collected millions of dollars in
such funds. The issue took center stage as the candidates held
their first debate last week in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE CRITICS ARE SEXIST, LAZIO SAYS
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio issued his strongest rebuke yet to critics of his
debate tactics, saying it was ``sexist'' to suggest he should not
have walked over to Hillary Clinton's lectern in a challenging
manner. During last week's debate, Lazio strode over to Clinton's
side of the stage brandishing what he said was a contract to ban
soft money from the campaign. She declined. ``The idea that somehow
that there's a double standard because you're a man or a woman, and
you can't make a point forcefully if you're a man, and the person
you're making the point with is a woman, I just think that's
sexist,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL CANCELS CANDIDATE'S VISIT
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey school district canceled Democratic Senate
candidate Jon Corzine's planned visit after residents raised
concerns of political partisanship. Corzine was to tour
Sayreville's middle school today to highlight school overcrowding.
Corzine, a rookie candidate who was chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co., is facing four-term Republican Rep. Bob Franks in November.
The school board did not want to seem to support either candidate,
``despite the good intentions of the appearance,'' said
Superintendent Dennis Fyffe.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING FOR ECONOMIST
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman said that George W. Bush showed a flawed
understanding of the national economy when he said earlier this
week that he would not retreat from a tax cut in the middle of a
recession but would cut even more, even at the risk of creating a
``short-term deficit.'' That approach very well might worsen a
recession, Lieberman said. ``We can't afford that. Deficits lead to
higher interest rates, and what does that mean? Higher mortgage
payments. Higher car payments. Higher student loan payments.''
Lieberman noted that even Republican leaders in Congress had not
advocated a tax cut as large as Bush $1.3 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   HE'D RATHER BE FISHING
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is an avid, even fanatical, fly fisherman. His
Secret Service code name is Angler. On the stump he often talks
wistfully about forgoing the fall fishing season in order to
campaign for the vice presidency. So he looked more than pleased
when he took a break from policy speeches and led his entourage and
motorcade to Kaufmann's Fly Fishing, just outside Portland, Ore.
After looking over the fly boxes, $600 rods and all-weather gear,
he picked up a rod and reel and headed out to the parking lot to
show off a few graceful casts, nearly landing a television camera
crew. Then he headed back to dry reality, a Chamber of Commerce
speech.
</P>
<P>
   DUAL ENDORSEMENT IN VERMONT
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign found itself in a quandary last week
when Vermont's state auditor, Edward Flanagan, a Democrat, became
the first openly gay candidate nominated for the Senate by a major
party. The group wanted to acknowledge Flanagan's accomplishment,
but didn't want to offend incumbent Sen. James Jeffords, a
Republican who has piled up what the group believes is a stellar
record on gay rights issues. So this week the group endorsed them
both.

 &HT;    FUNDING LACK PUTS WOMEN AT RISK, U.N. REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    Corrects spelling of Pollack in grafs 9 and 11.
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and other developed nations must
increase their funding for international family planning programs
or women will continue to die from a lack of access to reproductive
health care, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and United Nations officials spoke at a news conference
to release the U.N. Population Fund's (UNFPA) annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said about 500,000 maternal deaths occur each year in
developing countries, where just half of all births are
professionally attended. Of the estimated 50 million abortions
performed annually, it said, 20 million are unsafe and result in
the deaths of 78,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   One-third, or 80 million, of all pregnancies each year are
believed to be unwanted or mistimed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The UNFPA said that of the $5.7 billion a year that countries
have agreed is needed for family planning programs, less than half
of that amount has been made available from international sources.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, among other nations, has not met its
financial and moral obligation, said Margaret Pollack, director of
the Office of Population for the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the most prosperous nation on Earth, and
yet it ranks eighth in international population assistance to the
ratio of (gross national product),'' she said. ``Because we are a
nation that believes in individual freedom and responsibility, we
have every interest in supporting others around the world in
achieving those same rights and responsibilities we ourselves
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Pollack said, U.S. funding for international
population programs has been cut by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In human terms, these funding shortfalls mean that women will
continue to endure unintended pregnancies or resort to abortion,
and they will continue to die as a result of their pregnancies,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to restore funding for
these programs to their previous level in 1995 with an increase of
$170 million, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   The UNFPA has come under fire from anti-abortion groups such as
the American Life League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their money isn't going towards saving these women's lives,
but killing their babies,'' said Cathy Brown, a league
representative who protested the report's findings outside the U.N.
Foundation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Lives Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women
in a Time of Change,'' also documented gender disparities. It said
that 2 million more African women than men suffer from HIV/AIDS,
that 5,000 women and girls are murdered each year in ``honor''
killings, and that more than 100 million women and girls are
affected by female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   UNFPA officials said at the news conference that because of a
lack of resources, organizations like theirs are unable to provide
women with what they need and want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main obstacle is the fact that we often have to cut
programs because of financial constraints,'' said Thoraya Obaid,
director of the UNFPA's division for Arab states and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even though UNFPA's progress has been
quantitatively documented, Obaid said. For example, more than a
dozen countries, including Senegal and Ghana, have passed laws
banning female genital mutilation _ a victory due in part to
UNFPA's efforts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this (report) will help stimulate an increased
financial commitment from Washington and other developed countries
to help end gender inequality all around the world.''

<P>
   It started optimistically enough: Find Olympics Web sites that
appeal to children and are as exciting as watching Marion Jones run
the 100 meters. But Olympic endeavors can have many a slip. Like
the Russian gymnast who went whirling off his pommel horse on
Saturday during a preliminary competition, the online sites are
often disjointed and perform below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A dream Olympic site should probably include a map of Australia,
the history of the Olympics, profiles of athletes, event schedules,
explanations of the sports and motivational bits about what it
takes to be the best in the world. Sites should also offer more
than an encyclopedia or book on the Olympics can _ they should be
interactive in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most obvious stop was the children's section of
the official site of the Sydney 2000 games,
www.olympics.com/eng/kids. The site is studded with advertisements
and animations that make the content seem almost like an
afterthought. It is organized into four groups: Sportzone,
worldzone, greenzone and technozone, which offer virtual games and
information with educational themes about sports, world culture,
ecology and the technology behind the games.
</P>
<P>
   Millie the echidna, Olly the kookaburra and Syd the platypus,
the Olympic mascots (what would the games be without mascots?) are
prominently featured.
</P>
<P>
   Especially intriguing are greenzone, which has a section on the
Olympic-size mound of garbage generated by the games, and
technozone, which asks older children to research and design their
own venues for a sport of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   The sportzone includes the Kids' Guide to Sports, which is both
appealing and useful. The swimming link, for example, features an
animated platypus swimming freestyle and a simple, easy-to-read
explanation of the sport itself. There are also links to more
information, like the official rules and the venues. The simplicity
of the Web presentation makes sportzone appealing to younger
children. But sportzone is also cluttered with advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Sportzone, and the rest of the official site, is also packed
with virtual games. The game at the swimming link requires players
to beat the clock to dress a cyclist, an equestrian and a hockey
goalie in the proper gear. There is also a trivia quiz.
</P>
<P>
   While the official site is amusing, animated and informative, to
get to the basics, such as a history of the Olympics and maps, it's
easier to go somewhere where they are clearly marked on the home
page.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you will find at the Copernicus Educational Gateway
to the summer games (www.edgate.com/summergames/inactive). There
are sections on Olympic history and facts about Australia, and
inspirational interviews with athletes. This site presents Sydney
time all the time; on the official site, Sydney time is a click
away from each page.
</P>
<P>
   Copernicus is offered by the Learning Network, an educational
company. The Copernicus site, while well researched and free of
direct advertising (though sponsorship is prominent), is not as
exciting as that animated swimming platypus. There is not much here
to play with.
</P>
<P>
   A less cluttered Olympic site is provided by the educational
publisher Scholastic (www.scholastic.com/olympicgames). The site
includes an interactive world map with pop-up boxes studded with
Olympic facts about each country. While the map is entertaining,
country names are not indicated unless you actually click on the
country, and the facts about each country often seem relentlessly
negative or trivial. Children can discover which country boycotted
which games and why, or learn that the Irish Republican Army once
caused a bicycle race pile-up.
</P>
<P>
   The Scholastic site also offers a Pen Pals Down Under feature.
American children can correspond with Australian schoolchildren and
hear the Australians' welcoming audio greetings, which are fresh
and sometimes funny. One admonished Americans ``not to win too many
medals.''
</P>
<P>
   No Olympic tour on the Internet would be complete without a stop
at the television sites. The CBS Kids' Zone
(olympics.sportsline.com/u/kids/olympics/2000/index.html) has
scanty offerings. It has an interactive game called Grab the Gold,
interviews and sports facts. The information is presented in a
simple manner, best suited to the youngest Olympic fans.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the network that spent $704 million to broadcast the summer
games, uses its space on the Web, naturally, to promote itself at
www.nbcolympics.com/kids/index.html. It also promotes the
``Scholastic at the Olympic Games'' television show; going to that
page will also lead you to other features of the Scholastic site.
Most of the educational content for children on the NBC site is
provided by Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of interactive games for children, and
just like the real thing, they come courtesy of sponsors. Children
(or adults) can play the IBM Basketball One on One game, the Visa
Long Jump game, the Ameritrade Gold Medal Challenge and the
Budweiser Boxing Battle.

IT'S A WORD WORLD _ OR IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you compete in a business where the next-largest company
holds a market share hovering just under 100 percent? That's the
quandary WordPerfect faces.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled last spring that Microsoft held a
competition-stifling monopoly in personal computer operating
systems with a market share of roughly 85 percent. But Microsoft's
worldwide dominance in word processors is even more complete,
hovering between 93 and 95 percent, by most estimates. So when Dave
Ludwick, a senior manager at the Corel Corp., the Canadian company
that owns WordPerfect, said, ``We are pursuing a strong niche
strategy,'' he may seem overly optimistic at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago WordPerfect was the world's leading word
processor, with more than 50 percent of the market. The program
lost its place largely as a result of blunders by the program's
former owner, Novell, and astute marketing by Microsoft, which
figured out before anyone else that programs packaged in office
suites were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Today many people are surprised to learn that WordPerfect still
exists, so complete is Microsoft Word's dominance. But WordPerfect,
the oldest word processing program still in wide production for
PCs, is thrumming along.
</P>
<P>
   Version 1.0, called P-Edit, came out in 1979. It was renamed
WordPerfect in 1980. Version 9.0 is now in use, and it is utterly
competitive with Word.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect partisans, and there are still millions of them,
primarily in government and the legal profession, argue that it's
better.
</P>
<P>
   But Corel understands one thing perfectly well: To survive,
WordPerfect must be fully compatible with Word. If a WordPerfect
user cannot open a Word attachment that arrives by e-mail, the
program will not survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``WordPerfect can't place its users on a technological island,''
Ludwick acknowledged. Or, as Don Sylvester, a former Corel
official, put it in an interview while he was still with the
company in 1998: ``It's clear to us that Microsoft isn't the
competition anymore. They are our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, word processors have engendered stronger customer
loyalty than many other sorts of programs, largely because learning
to use one takes a lot of time. That's less true today, with the
great similarities among Windows programs. But that phenomenon has
left WordPerfect with a large base of 22 million users in the
United States and Canada, according to one marketing survey. I am
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I've used WordPerfect off and on since Version 2.24 in 1983,
when the program was produced by the Satellite Software
International of Provo, Utah. My first serial number was 5,250. In
recent years I've also used Word. In many ways now, the programs
are largely interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote this article to this point in WordPerfect. But now,
after saving it in WordPerfect format, I've opened the file in Word
without a hiccup. After writing another sentence, I saved the file
in Word format and moved back to WordPerfect. I picked up where I
left off without a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Over time I've encountered Word users who cannot open my
WordPerfect file attachments, for reasons that are not easily
explained. And I occasionally receive a Windows file of one form or
another that Word will open but WordPerfect will not. Here again,
the reasons remain obscure. So even the dedicated WordPerfect user
can find that it's best to have a copy of Word, too, to be
completely safe when exchanging files via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While WordPerfect looks and feels a lot like Word, WordPerfect's
face is cleaner than Word's. Icons don't pop up unbidden. Almost
any significant feature you might find on Word you'll also find on
WordPerfect, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But Corel officials point to a couple of unique conveniences,
including one that has stayed with the program since the earliest
versions: The Reveal Codes option.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, in a complex document, you will become bollixed up
in conflicting commands. A font change or an indent command will
find its way into your document even though you swear you didn't
put it there.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the Reveal Codes button, and a gray shaded panel pops up at
the bottom of the screen displaying several lines of text around
the cursor. In that box, every hidden embedded command is shown.
You can edit or delete them, then exit to find your document
repaired. That one feature is a tremendous convenience and has no
direct counterpart in Word (the comparable feature in Word is more
limited).
</P>
<P>
   The drop-down menus for typeface and font size _ in the
upper-left margin of the lower tool bar, just as in Word _ display
true-to-life examples of the various typefaces or font sizes your
cursor passes as you scroll through the options. Another nice
feature.
</P>
<P>
   And the program is infinitely customizable. Every toolbar can be
changed to show whatever commands you want. Even the bar at the
bottom of the screen can be edited to show more than file name and
cursor position. But in truth, a Word partisan could stroll through
that program and point out an equal number of much-appreciated
features that are available in Word but not in WordPerfect.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that even with Word's dominance, there is an
attractive alternative. And WordPerfect wins hands down by one
measure: Price. The WordPerfect Office Suite, which includes
WordPerfect, spreadsheet, presentations and a couple of other
programs, typically sells in stores for about $90.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Office sells for about five times that price.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy WordPerfect only as a part of the office suite,
though you can choose to install only the word processor. Microsoft
offers a stand-alone version of Word, which sells for about $275.
</P>
<P>
   Corel released WordPerfect Version 9.0 in May 1999 and plans to
issue Version 10.0 in the first half of next year. Right now, Corel
officials say, WordPerfect is in use in most law firms in the
United States and Canada, and in many government offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, where the federal antitrust suit against
Microsoft was written, uses WordPerfect. The New York attorney
general's office, where the companion state antitrust suit was
written, uses Word.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Web site of the District of Columbia U.S. District
Court, the court where Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found
Microsoft in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws and
ordered the company broken in two, his rulings are published in
three formats: Adobe Acrobat, HTML ... and WordPerfect.

SOON, A WAY TO TELL WHEN YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN THOSE SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the most occasional stroller to the most fanatical
marathoner, walkers want to know: How far have I gone?
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInnis, a former NASA engineer, has paid a lot of
attention to people's obsession with measuring their athletic
efforts, particularly when it comes to running and walking. For the
last six years he has worked for Reebok International, the maker of
sports and fitness gear based in Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, Reebok is expected to unveil a new kind of sneaker
that McInnis, who is the company's director of technology, says
will accurately tell its wearers not only how far they have run or
walked, but also what pace they set and how many calories they
vanquished along the way. Called Smart Train, the high-tech shoes
are expected to appear in July. Two versions will be available,
priced at $110 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   Most devices currently on the market that measure a runner's
distance are step counters. And even if they are properly
calibrated to a runner's stride, as that stride changes _ often a
consequence of fatigue or changing terrain _ translating steps into
real distance becomes less and less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are going over four to five miles, a 10 percent swing
in accuracy either way really starts to add up,'' McInnis noted.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference in the Smart Train shoes, which at first
glance look like rather ordinary high-performance running sneakers,
is a solid-state sensor called an accelerometer that measures the
force exerted on the foot with each step. It is the same kind of
device that in a car senses significantly sudden deceleration to
trigger the release of air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Using a special algorithm, a microprocessor in a unit in the
shoe's tongue then converts the stream of foot force data into how
far and fast a runner is actually going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an idea that's been a long time coming,'' said
McInnis, who also directs product marketing and advanced research
and development for Reebok. ``It's just that the science and the
circuitry has finally caught up to the point where you can make it
small enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smart Train's components are small enough, in fact, to fit
easily into the tongue of one of its shoes. A prototype of the
device is no larger than the face of a quarter, only thicker, and
is expected to run for months on standard watch batteries.
</P>
<P>
   In the $110 version of the shoe, the wearer's information would
be seen on a small LCD screen embedded in the shoe's tongue. In the
higher-end model, called the Smart Train IQ, the unit is designed
to communicate wirelessly, using radio frequency, to a specially
equipped wristwatch display.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the time, day and date, the watch face can also display,
in real time, distance, current pace, average pace and calories
burned.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless feature, something that has been incorporated for
years into speedometers and odometers for bicycles, was a major
advance in making the device appeal to runners and walkers, McInnis
said. Without it, he said, ``you would have to have a wire
basically going up your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The watch interface also makes expansion of features easier,
McInnis said. ``The beauty of the watch and RF communication is
that the watch is just a receiver. You can plug in as many
different items of data as you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok is also considering adding to the shoes the ability to
measure heart rate, McInnis said. Current heart rate measuring
devices require people to wear a monitoring strap around their
chest. Most people, McInnis said, don't like wearing the strap.
</P>
<P>
   Though developers are working on measuring heart rates through a
wristband, McInnis said it was not likely that heart rate
information would be a feature of the first Smart Train line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right out of the box,'' McInnis said, the sneakers will be 94
percent to 95 percent accurate, no matter who is using them. To
ensure accuracy rates near 98 percent, the shoes have a calibration
step-up. Basically, the shoe can be trained to the wearer's running
and walking strides and styles. McInnis said the wearer would need
to run or walk only a quarter of a mile, the length of a common
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The device, because of the force involved and its measuring of
that, knows whether you are walking or running,'' he said. ``You
could be a runner and a walker, too. Go out and do a workout and it
will tally the whole thing up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart Train's underlying technology was developed over the last
two years by FitSense, a technology company in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Joffe, president of the company, said FitSense and Reebok
had been working together for the last year to create Smart Train.
But the Reebok products will not be the first on the market to use
what he calls the FitSense instant feedback technology.
</P>
<P>
   In November, FitSense plans to release its own $200 version of
the basic technology, without sneakers, Joffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Called the FitSense FS-1, the system will include a 22-ounce,
snap-on foot sensor, a wrist display and a wireless link to a
personal computer. The PC link, Joffe explained, permits users to
download their workout information into their computers, where it
can be displayed, stored and charted.
</P>
<P>
   Joffe said his company's technology had already been heavily
tested _ the FS-1 sensors have even been strapped onto the sneakers
of one of the fastest humans in history, the track star Michael
Johnson. Johnson wore them in the Olympic trials in July, Joffe
said, adding that he expects to have runners using the technology
in the New York Marathon this fall.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said he did not expect this kind of measured feedback
technology to be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go and watch the New York Marathon,'' he said, ``the
guys who are winning it _ the Kenyans and all of those guys _ they
don't even need shoes. They are so efficient, they are just
clicking along. In their head they know, `Hey, I'm running a
five-minute pace.' For the rest of us, we need a more supportive
shoe.''

WAYS T  O KEEP OUT BROADBAND HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
Q. I have heard that a speedy connection like a cable modem or a
digital subscriber line leaves your computer very vulnerable to
invasion by hackers. Is this true, and how can it be prevented?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A. Security and privacy issues are causing more and more concern
among users as high-speed connections like cable and digital
subscriber lines become more available to the home market. An
individual cable or DSL connection is part of a network and the
connection is always on and therefore visible on the network to
anyone poking around in the right places. So they are thought to
have more vulnerability than a telephone modem connection, which is
turned ``on'' only when it dials up the Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL providers will try to configure a customer's
computer to make it more secure. The technician who visits the
user's home to set up the service will often make adjustments to
certain computer settings, or the company will provide the customer
with the information to do it. Many providers of high-speed
connections will also encrypt data going to and from the user's
computer and will provide measures to help ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   There are some basic steps you can take to help safeguard
against intruders. Most providers will advise the user to turn off
the file- and print-sharing option within Windows. To do that, go
to the Start menu to Settings and then Control Panel. Double-click
on the Network icon, and in the dialog box, click on the File and
Print Sharing button. There are two options there that refer to
giving other users access to the computer's files, as well as
allowing other users to print files to the printer connected to it.
Make sure neither of the boxes next to those options has a check
mark in it before you click on OK. Mac users should make sure the
file sharing option is turned off in the Apple menu's File Sharing
control panel.
</P>
<P>
   You should have a current version of a virus-protection program
on your computer as well. You can usually find a selection of the
programs for either Windows or Macintosh systems at your favorite
software retailer, and registered users can usually download
updates to the software from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a firewall to your home system can also help block out
unwanted visitors. Firewalls can consist of separate hardware (like
one made by Linksys (www.linksys.com), special software or both.
You should ask your provider about methods or programs you should
use. Many companies are starting to make easy-to-use firewall
software for home users. Windows users might try Norton Internet
Security from Symantec (www.symantec.com), Internet Guard Dog from
McAfee (software.mcafee.com) or BlackIce Defender by Network Ice
(www.networkice.com). Mac users might try NetBarrier by Intego
(www.intego.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you use a Windows PC and are curious about how vulnerable
your machine is on the Internet, try the free Shields Up! test by
following the link on the Gibson Research Corp. page at grc.com.
Zone Labs also makes a firewall program called Zone Alarm that home
PC users can download free at www.zonelabs.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q. How can one telephone line be used simultaneously for phone
calls and DSL service?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A. Plain old voice telephone calls use only a very small portion of
the potential capacity of the copper-wire telephone line in your
house. (According to some industry estimates, about 4 percent of
the wire's capacity is used on a voice call.)
</P>
<P>
   The DSL modem technology takes advantage of the full potential
of your phone line. The part of the line that is used for voice
calls is different from the part that is used for the high-speed
data transmission, and these two parts can coexist, allowing you
the ability to surf the Web while talking on the phone over the
same line. &QL;

   OLY-SWIM-ARCH _ SYDNEY _ While swimmer Eric Moussambani from
Equatorial Guinea was awkward and slow as he competed in the
100-meter freestyle prelims, the 17,500 fans in the crowd stood and
cheered his every stroke. For one minute 52.72 seconds _ which is
nearly 2 1/2 times slower than it took Aussie Michael Klim to swim
the same distance in world record time during Saturday's 400-meter
relay _ Moussambani thrashed and flailed and tried desperately to
make it the pool wall. The Sydney Olympics had a hero reminiscent
of Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, the myopic ski jumper at the 1988
Calgary Olympics or, better yet, John Akhwari, the Tanzanian
marathon runner who came limping into the stadium more than hour
behind the rest of the field at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico
City. Moussambani _ a 22-year-old student from the inland town of
Molabu in his West African country _ just learned how to swim in
January. He trained in a hotel pool that was just 20-meters long
and _ because tourists there had first dibs _ he rarely got access
to the facility. Moussambani had never before swum 50 meters, much
less 100 _ the event in which he was entered. (Archdeacon, Dayton

herd on all the other kids, you might wonder what was going on at
his own home. Were his kids toeing the line? Or, where they running
all over the place? Both. At least that's the way it sounded as you
listened to the tale his daughter, Joetta Clark Diggs, was telling
Wednesday in Sydney. (Archdeacon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

&HT;     CLINTON WON'T BE CHARGED IN WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton received good news Wednesday
_ right in the middle of her race for the U.S. Senate _ when
Independent Counsel Robert Ray announced that neither she nor
President Clinton will face charges related to the failed
Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said his decision to end the six-year, $52 million
Whitewater investigation was based on his conclusion ``that the
evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated
in any criminal conduct ... or knew of such conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said the Clintons were investigated for
allegations ranging from obstruction of justice to false testimony
concerning their Arkansas business dealings, including the failed
Whitewater real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton welcomed Ray's announcement and said the special
prosecutor's decision proved that she had never done anything
improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that this is finally over and I can get back to
the problems of New York,'' Clinton said after a meeting with New
York editors in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he would soon send his final report on the land deal to
a federal three-judge panel that oversees his work. The report is
expected to be kept secret until after the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a brief response: ``Robert Ray is now the
latest investigator to complete an examination into the
transactions related to the Whitewater Development Co., and
conclude that there are no grounds for legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater investigation led to 14 convictions, including
those of the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, James and
Susan McDougal, presidential friend Webster Hubbell and then-Gov.
Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Susan McDougal chastised Ray for refusing to fully
exonerate the Clintons by using terms like ``insufficient
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really please me if they would just be men and say
there is nothing there,'' said Mrs. McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   With the Whitewater investigation finished, Ray now must decide
whether to indict Clinton after he leaves office for his conduct in
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Last month, Ray impaneled a grand jury
to look into the case.
</P>
<P>
   When the Whitewater real estate investment project was launched
in late 1978, then-state Attorney General Bill Clinton, Mrs.
Clinton, and the McDougals planned to develop a vacation community
dominated by timeshare homes.
</P>
<P>
   Financing for the project fell apart when the local bank,
Madison Guaranty Saving and Loan _ owned by McDougal _ failed and
the project collapsed. The bank failure cost taxpayers more than
$73 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the Whitewater development were poor, and in 1992, the
Clintons sold their remaining interest in it to Jim McDougal for
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Whitewater investigation began in 1994 amid
questions about whether the Clintons benefited from some of
Madison's illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a special counsel, Robert
Fiske, to investigate the partnership. Kenneth Starr later took
over the case after Fiske resigned.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the probe involved allegations that in 1986
then-Gov. Clinton pressured David Hale _ a former local judge who
ran a federally backed investment company_ to make a $300,000 loan
to Susan McDougal, which would have broken a number of federal
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also investigated whether the president gave false testimony
in the trials of Mrs. McDougal and Tucker when he denied being
aware of a fraudulent loan to the McDougals that was never repaid.
Ray concluded he could not prove Clinton ``knew of the loan or that
his testimony regarding the loan was knowingly false.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the first lady, the independent counsel examined her
legal work on a fraudulent land development in Little Rock, Ark.,
known as Castle Grande. The development was owned by James McDougal
and Little Rock businessman Seth Ward, the father-in-law of Webster
Hubbell, Mrs. Clinton's then-partner at the Rose Law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was indicted for allegedly concealing his legal work on
Castle Grande when asked about by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned in 1994 about her work in the project, Mrs.
Clinton told Justice Department investigators that she could not
recall any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Mrs. Clinton's law work for the project was
confirmed when her law firm billing records mysteriously turned up
in the White House family residence under circumstances that have
never been explained. The records proved that the first lady had
done legal work on the Castle Grande development.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater prosecutors had subpoenaed them two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hubbell pleaded guilty to a felony charge that he
misled federal regulators about legal work he performed. Hubbell
did not have to serve any jail time under a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell also maintained that Mrs. Clinton engaged in no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the evidence concerning the billing records was
``inconclusive'' as to whether Mrs. Clinton ``knowingly or
willfully possessed the billing records with the intent to obstruct
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Whitewater, Ray also has finished two other aspects
of his wide-ranging investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ray found ``substantial evidence'' that Mrs. Clinton
played a role in the firing of seven employees of the White House
press travel office but that he could not ``prove beyond a
reasonable doubt'' that she was guilty of perjury. She swore to
congressional investigators in 1996 that she had no role in the
decision to fire the employees.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ray concluded there was no credible evidence of
criminal activity in the White House's improper gathering of
hundreds of FBI background files of former Republican appointees.

 &HT;    New colors and forms crowd the baggage carousel
 &HT;    By Leigh-Ann Jackson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Red-eye flights just became more bearable. No
more dragging your limp body from the gate to the baggage claim,
only to find that every carousel is packed with luggage that,
through your bleary-eyed vision, looks like one big charcoal gray
mess. ThoughWhile the average suitcase tends to be so aesthetically
bland that you have to tie a bright ribbon around the handles to
distinguish yours from everyone else's, a wave of color and
innovative form has just touched down.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most hyped hand-held accessory since last year's
baguette bag is Prada's bowling bag, which does double duty as a
carry-on bag for short trips. The Italian-bred brand also has a new
line of genuine carry-on totes with sharp designs contrasting
colors, piping and perforated leather. One can never get too far
into a conversation about carry-all fashion without mentioning Kate
Spade; she, too, has put together a travel line that consists of
larger versions of the multi-hued, striped bags she debuted last
season. New York-based boutique, Hogan, switches things up with
vinylized leather, velvet, and 70's-inspired earth tones, as well
as saturated reds and oranges. Even conservative shoe line J.P.
Tod's is getting in on the act with a line of rich mahogany leather
totes.
</P>
<P>
   Another Manhattan designer, Malle, specializes in travel bags.
With non-crushable hidden compartments for shoes, a wealth of side
pockets and sneak spaces, and colors reminiscent of confections,
their weekend and overnight bags are well suited for young women
whose lifestyles are freckled with numerous brief jaunts. Austin's
wee diva depot, Wild Child, has also proven to be a valuable source
for baggage. Though they specialize largely in clothing for tots
and teens, the boutique has recently been carrying Roxy brand
medium-sized rollercases in hyper-color Hawaiian prints. They're
ideal for the post-''Ooff to Grandma's'' suitcase set and can even
be used by adventurous adults who don't shy from vivid colors. On a
recent visit, the shop had completely sold out their stock, but the
constant demand has them ordering more, in a wider variety of
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonite, not wanting to lose their firm grip on the baggage
market, has opted to splinter off into more adventurous design
territory. Instead of the dreary black models for which they're
typically known, the company has gone retro, with red, turquoise
and silver hard-bound snap-closure cases that might have crowded
airports circa 1950 They've even crafted handy little patent
leather light travel bags. The most impressive of their new
offerings is the functional, fashionable Oyster II line, which
features two rounded hardbound bags that fit into one another,
nesting-doll style.
</P>
<P>
   While the top and middle shelf designers are attaching triple
(and sometimes quadruple) figure price tags to their retro luggage,
savvy shoppers know to go to the root. Instead of getting
vintage-style luggage, they'll save hundreds on bags that are
straight-up vintage. Local used-goods shops like Amelia's
Retro-Vogue and Relics and Room Service stock authentic bags from
the days when flying was a grand event, not just a work-a-day
necessity. They come in a wide range of colors, materials and sizes
and offer the distinctive details that modern bags tend to overlook
_ mirrors, combination locks, grooved handles, silken linings with
minute sidepockets for holding jewelry and other small baubles.
</P>
<P>
   After dishing out a sum that could easily amount to the price of
a roundtrip ticket, you might be hesitant to check the pricier bags
at the curb. Fortunately, many of these items are just small enough
to pass for carry-on luggage _ which, as any shrewd traveler knows,
is the way to go in these days of travel turmoil when personal
effects tend to arrive as far away as geographically possible from
their owners.

`BOXING 2000': BURNED OUT BUT NOT DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The characters of the young director-playwright
Richard Maxwell are not what you would call an excitable lot. Their
voices are as uninflected as a refrigerator's drone, their postures
those of exceptionally passive people who have been parked
somewhere and told to wait. In Maxwell's breakthrough work two
years ago, ``House,'' a couple of them were murdered, and it was
hard to distinguish the dead from the living.
</P>
<P>
   Now Maxwell _ who has previously considered such American
phenomena as cowboys and Indians and mall rats _ has moved into the
world of amateur prizefighting in a play called ``Boxing 2000.'' It
is probably safe to say that no sporting event, even in the current
Olympics, has generated less adrenaline than the match shown here.
</P>
<P>
   Well, among the fighters, anyway. Audience members for ``Boxing
2000,'' which runs through Sept. 30 at the Present Company
Theatorium in Manhattan, are likely to feel a wide-awake energy in
the presence of these somnambulists. They may also experience the
quickened, hopeful heartbeat that comes from watching that rare
phenomenon, a genuinely original new talent at work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensation that's felt all too rarely these days. Watching
Maxwell's work at this nonprofit theater makes you think of what it
must have been like to stumble upon the baffling but seductive
creations of the young Sam Shepard in the early 1960s in the East
Village. A Richard Maxwell play is unlikely ever to show up on
Broadway or even on the institutional stages of the Public Theater
or the Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   This author's style is anti-polish, even to the point of
deliberately seeming amateurish. Read cold, the texts of his
scripts are unlikely to have much resonance. It's the whole
mise-en-scene, under the control of one artistic imagination, that
makes ``Boxing 2000'' so effective. To take it out of its
calculatedly crude, experimental realm and spruce it up would be
fatal. In the meantime, in its own context, this dramatist's voice
_ seemingly as flat and thin as pasteboard _ is sending off depth
charges that keep vibrating.
</P>
<P>
   Like many artists of his generation, Maxwell is a connoisseur of
cliches. None of the nine characters in ``Boxing 2000'' have
anything remotely fresh to say. Their conversations, if you
overheard them on the street or in a supermarket, would inspire
glum thoughts that people as a whole are not an interesting
species. These are folks that seem bored even with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Maxwell, who achieves his distinctive tone as much through
his direction as his writing, is listening hard to his characters
and demands that we do, too. By slowing down rhythms of speech and
inflating pauses, he parses the banalities of everyday talk and
finds the whispering fear and confusion beneath. It makes you
grateful that there is nothing like a slow-motion instant-replay
device monitoring your own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing 2000'' begins with three men planted motionless in a
naked space in front of a corrugated metal wall. There is Jo-Jo
(Gary Wilmes, a Maxwell veteran), who wears an industrial uniform
and many keys on his belt; his younger brother, Freddie (Robert
Torres), who has the deadest stare this side of a morgue, and a
fellow identified as the Promoter (Christopher Sullivan), who is
silent for so long that he might be mistaken for a George Segal
statue.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue emerges slowly and in spurts, like a car being
started with an undercharged battery. It is repetitive and
circular. There is talk of what Jo-Jo should buy his father for a
birthday present; of some arcane mishap at work involving the
confusion of room numbers. Suddenly Jo-Jo announces, with no change
of tone, that he is ``looking for that one moment of goodwill'' in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration is thrown away; it registers as just another
instance of someone's repeating something he has heard and vaguely
feeling it might be appropriate to the occasion. Yet Maxwell isn't
sneering at his creations any more than Flaubert was sneering at
that most famous receptacle of received ideas, Emma Bovary.
Platitudinous these people may be, but there is a genuine yearning
that emerges, despite itself, from their numbness.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes even clearer as the play's focus shifts to Freddie,
who has agreed to participate in the boxing match organized by the
Promoter and who has a girlfriend, Marissa (Gladys Perez), who
talks in the language of spiritual self-help books. Freddie is
Maxwell's 21st-century answer to Clifford Odets' ``Golden Boy,'' a
smaller-time, even more manipulable boxer who doesn't even know
what to do when he finally gets into the ring or whether he has won
or lost at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' Freddie manages to come across as both stolid and highly
impressionable. It may not look like it, but he's paying attention
when the Promoter talks about investing in IRAs instead of Lotto or
when Marissa tells him to find his inner voice. ``I'm thinking a
lot of what was just said now by him,'' Freddie in a typical
declaration. Unlike his older brother, whom Wilmes portrays with as
much heartiness as a monotone allows, Freddie still has a shred of
an attention span left. In Maxwell's world, this is not necessarily
a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   More than most of Maxwell's plays, this one conspicuously
features physical movement. There is a dance sequence in which
Freddie and Marissa slowly move in circles, wanly shifting their
weight. The spirit of stunted passion here seems of a piece with
Freddie's idea of foreplay, which is to brush at Marissa's breasts
and then quickly withdraw his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the boxing match itself, for which an authentic
ring has been provided. (Stephanie Nelson is the set and costume
designer.) Maxwell, needless to say, milks every ounce of
anticlimax from this climactic event, as Freddie listlessly takes
on the older, marginally more animated Jerry (Jim Fletcher).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the ring or out of it seems to know how things should
proceed, including the Referee (Lakpa Bhutia). The usual ringside
patter that is the staple of boxing films is here delivered with
the conviction of old porn stars simulating sex. ``I like it when
you hurt each other,'' urges the Promoter blandly. Freddie's father
(Benjamin Tejeda) materializes to express, in Spanish, his
disappointment with his son's performance. Marissa appears briefly
to beg Freddie to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of material that has been parodied for years in
spoofs like the 1978 film ``Movie Movie.'' Maxwell, however, isn't
sending up an established genre. His characters are in a realm
where even the energy of satire is beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of the actors, many of whom are nonprofessionals,
flattens speech to the point that distinctions between irony and
sincerity, between questions and exclamations are erased. Maxwell's
burned-out, overprogrammed Americans are one step shy of becoming
automatons. The playwright's great accomplishment is to make us
care about them nonetheless; it's that last flickering spark of
humanity that makes them so funny and so sad.
</P>

 &HT;    UPS tests e-commerce customers return sustem
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service is trying to solve one of the
thorniest questions in e-commerce: what to do with items that
customers buy online but wish to return.
</P>
<P>
   UPS' answer is designed to speed and simplify the return process
for customers, tell retailers which items are coming back, and why
_ and boost the flow of packages through the Sandy Springs, Ga.,
company's transportation network. The prototype isin place at
Buy.com, which sells a broad variety of retail goods online, and
UPS officials say the technology has reduced customer phone calls
to the company's return center by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a business environment that's still in its
infancy,'' said Ross McCullough, UPS vice president for e-commerce.
``This (method for handling product returns) is the most advanced
product developed by anyone in our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., estimates 23
million online buyers will purchase $64 billion in goods next year.
But industry experts estimate 10 percent or more of those goods
will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling returns is one of the last big sticking points in
e-commerce,'' said Chris Newton, an analyst at AMR Inc. ``People
have heard horror stories, and they're reluctant to place orders
online if they think items are going to be difficult to return.
That concern is constraining the growth of the entire market.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS currently delivers about half the items bought and sold on
the Web. In addition to increasing its own package traffic, UPS
expects to charge transaction fees for handling returns. The
company says it will negotiate fees and shipping rates separately
with each seller. UPS' online return process works like this:
</P>
<P>
   Customers who want to return goods log onto the seller's Web
site and obtain a return shipment authorization. That authorization
contains a shipping label with a bar code that customers can print
on regular paper. The customer attaches the bar code to his or her
package and puts it in any UPS drop box or shipping center or gives
it to any UPS driver.
</P>
<P>
   The process lets online retailers know when and where each
returned item will arrive. It also allows them to route packages to
different destinations. Items that need repairs, for example, can
go straight to technicians while those that are ready to go onto
store shelves can be sent directly to locations where consumer
demand is high. Buyers and sellers can each track individual
packages as they move through the UPS system, and shipping charges
automatically take place when the packages are delivered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In years past it was a cliche that starry-eyed college graduates
dreamed of moving to New York to seek fame and fortune. Many still
do, but today their dreams are apt to be more specific. They want
to move to New York neighborhoods such as trendy Long Island City
or Williamsburgh _ not to overpriced Manhattan. And many don't want
to move to New York at all.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 20-somethings are looking for places that offer calm and
community as well as career opportunities. Youth Intelligence
recently surveyed 500 19- to 30-year-olds to see where they might
like to live.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   For some 20-somethings who see New York as a steel prison but
want an urban environment, Chicago feels like their kind of town.
Chicago offers great restaurants, sophisticated shopping,
world-class culture, sports bars and great live music.
</P>
<P>
   House music originated in Chicago, and Chicago offers a host of
venues for traditional house, soul, hip-hop, garage and acid jazz.
It's a clubber's delight, with some of the most cutting-edge DJs
and most respected clubs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   LONG ISLAND CITY
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, Long Island City has become one of the newest
hot spots in New York's five boroughs. Only two subway stops from
midtown, it has everything that young people need: accessibility,
access to work, a bohemian flair and cheap rent.
</P>
<P>
   PS-1, one of the largest contemporary-art centers in the city,
has been attracting an enthusiastic, trendsetting crowd. During the
summer, hipsters _ and families! _ danced in an outdoor
installation that looked like an urban beach. You could bring your
kids, buy a beer and get down to some serious dance music.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, the Museum of Modern Art says it will move its entire
operation to an old factory in Long Island City while it remodels
its Manhattan building. Currently the Silvercup Studio, where ``Sex
and the City'' is filmed, is expanding its space _ and New York
designers and tech firms are pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   With almost every inch of Manhattan a prime commodity in the
real estate market, Long Island City should attract not only young
bohemians, but also smart young investors.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
   The bars close at 2 a.m. and most people are so health-conscious
that you get dirty looks if you smoke cigarettes, but the way our
respondents see it, there is quite a bit more to be said for L.A.
than against it. There's the weather, the opportunity to be
outside, the laid-back lifestyle, the Pacific Coast Highway, fine
cuisine, drinks poolside and stargazing _ celebrities, not astral.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hottest up-and-coming young designers such as
William B and Luxe are coming out of L.A. And, as one 24-year-old
who moved from New York explained, ``People said I would miss the
culture of the East Coast, but there is lots of culture in
California and who cares when you are having so much fun, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   BOULDER
</P>
<P>
   Young people love places where they can live a really healthy
lifestyle by day and break all the rules at night. Boulder, Colo.
makes the grade. The nearby Rocky Mountains offer hiking and
skiing, while Boulder _ home to the University of Colorado _ is
laid-back and fun. Twenty-somethings who move there don't miss out
on culture, either. During the summer, Boulder hosts the Colorado
Music Festival and the seven-week-long Colorado Shakespeare
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 20-somethings we interviewed said that San Francisco
was the only city where they could conceivably leave work at a
reasonable hour and go for a late run down a mountain or a sunset
walk on the beach. As one 23-year-old explained, ``You don't even
need a car to go somewhere beautiful. You are somewhere
beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as one 26-year-old stated, ``It seems that everyone
here is young and rich, and you certainly need to be to pay the
high real-estate prices.'' But San Francisco also seems to have
tons of jobs in technology, banking, and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   The way some 20-somethings see it, what could be wrong with a
place that offers good weather, a great beach, wild nightlife and
an exotic Latin influence? These days the trendiest part of South
Beach is below 5th Street, away from the big hotels and well-known
restaurants. The design district, which was once simply that, has
now become an up-and-coming place to live, though it could be a
year or two before the cafes and boutiques roll in.

 &HT;    ATLANTA PENSION OFFICE DESCRIBED AS SLOPPY, CARELESS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Atlanta office of the Pension Benefits Guaranty
Corp. is so sloppy that letters have been routinely sent out with
incorrect pension amounts, wrong names and erroneous Social
Security numbers, a former employee said in testimony to be
delivered to a Senate hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonne(cq) Ann McHenry, who worked until last March for
Integrated Management Resources Group, Inc., a Maryland-based
private contractor that ran the Atlanta office, said in her
statement that supervisors showed ``no concern'' that former
employees of Pan American World Airways had to wait years to find
out how much they would receive in pensions.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry is scheduled to appear before the Senate hearing as part
of an investigation into the performance of the Pension Benefits
Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), a self-financing government entity that
provides pensions for defunct companies, such as Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry said that ``there was no justification for delays'' in
sending pension designations. She said that frequent mistakes
included overpaying some pensioners and telling others that they
were entitled to 34 percent less than they stated by the Pan Am
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, McHenry said current pensioners received notices
that ``due to unresolved issues we cannot determine the amount of
your benefit,'' and in other cases, she said, Pan Am pension
designations were mailed to people who had never worked for Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   Also slated to speak Thursday are Thomas A. Parks, a pensioner
from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who waited eight years to receive a
determination of his pension amount, and John W. Wilde of Daly
City, Calif., whose mother received a check in error for $473,129.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency is an unbelievable mess,'' said Sen. Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging,
who called Thursday's joint hearing along with the Senate Small
Business Committee chairman, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contractors do most of the work, yet nobody looks over their
shoulder,'' Grassley said. ``Their product suffers. Retirees pay
the price. This is not the way for the government to treat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the continuing probe of pension oversight problems,
the General Accounting Office has completed a report that also
found the ``appearance of improper influence'' in granting $40
million in contracts to Integrated Management Resources Group.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said it found
evidence that PBGC field operations head Bennie Hagans had shown
favoritism toward the company's owner-president, Myrna Cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks declined to comment on the criticism of her company. Her
attorney, David Kuhnsman, said that allegations of favoritism had
been ``refuted by the agency,'' and he denied that there were
performance problems with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a minority, female-owned and -operated small business
with an excellent performance record and has been harassed
repeatedly by baseless rumors and allegations,'' Kuhnsman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans did not return a reporter's call.

   WHITEWATER-REPORT (Washington) _ In a decisive end to the
six-year-long Whitewater investigation, Robert Ray, the independent
prosecutor, said Wednesday he has concluded that there was
insufficient evidence to show that either President or Mrs. Clinton
had committed any crimes in connection with the Arkansas real
estate venture that vexed his presidency through two terms. In
clearing both the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton of any
criminal wrongdoing, Ray was notable in the the spareness of his
language. He said only that on each of the allegations his office
had investigated, ``there was insufficient evidence to prove to a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt,'' that a crime had been committed.

THE BLACKBERRY MEANS CONSTANT CONTACT AND BAD MANNERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   You know they've gotten a BlackBerry when they stop calling.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the tiny keyboard on the BlackBerry, a wireless
e-mail device, requires a kind of thumb-typing nobody learned in
high school. Or that reading messages on its pager-size screen
while driving is a hazard. For a fast-growing group of BlackBerry
fans, getting and sending text messages while away from home and
office beats verbal contact any day, all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It teaches you that most of the time on the phone is small
talk,'' said Tom Scott, chairman of the Nantucket Nectars juice
company, who like many recent BlackBerry converts said his phone
bills had gone down. ``I don't like dealing with the cell phone. It
always goes in and out. I'm always worrying that I'm getting
cancer. And honestly sometimes I would just rather talk to less
people than more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the BlackBerry cult won't ask how you are in their
electronic communiques. Nor are they very likely to give you their
full attention when you are in their physical presence, since the
messages flashing on their pager-size screens demand a quick
glance, and perhaps a response. But they will return your e-mail
almost immediately, no matter where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more important?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may not matter. The BlackBerry is the forerunner of a
set of tools that offer constant contact without the need to
actually talk to anyone. About a million Americans currently use a
wireless e-mail service, with BlackBerry leading the pack,
according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based telecommunications
consulting firm. That number is expected to swell to 100 million in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the BlackBerry has become much coveted by
America's business professionals, who are increasingly judged by
how accessible they are to colleagues and clients. A key draw:
unlike cellular phone calls, which require a clear distraction of
attention, BlackBerries allow users to do two things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives rave about watching messages roll in while
they conduct other business. Along with higher salaries and
concierge service, BlackBerries headed a list of demands submitted
by junior analysts at Salomon Smith Barney to their superiors last
spring. Even lawyers, notoriously slow to embrace e-mail in the
office, have become enthralled by the BlackBerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard colleagues say that when they've had the poor taste
to return e-mails from their bedrooms, it hasn't been a welcome
gesture,'' said David Grais, a partner in the law firm Gibson, Dunn
&AMP; Crutcher in New York. ``It definitely makes you more of an e-mail
junkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Grais uses his Blackberry to receive messages when he's out of
the office and when he's not. ``If I'm two floors away and I get a
call, my secretary knows I can always be reached,'' he said. ``It's
completely indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to see why ordinary consumers would crave such
continuous connection, or be willing to pay for it. Research in
Motion, or RIM, the Canadian company that manufactures the original
BlackBerry models ($349 and $399) and a slightly larger version
($499), has so far marketed its $40-per-month e-mail service to
corporations, and about 5,000 companies now pay for employees to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   RIM said the device would soon be available in retail stores
like Staples. America Online has announced plans to make its e-mail
and instant messaging service available through BlackBerry-like
gadgets. Earthlink, the nation's second-largest Internet service
provider, is conducting a pilot test with BlackBerries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what motivates people to want e-mail on their
hip when they leave home,'' said Roland Wilcox, a senior product
manager at Earthlink. ``But they do, and we want to provide it to
them.`
</P>
<P>
   The BlackBerry will soon face more competition, most notably
from cellular phones, which allow users to talk and type messages
with one device and are the mobile e-mail method of choice among
Europeans and Japanese teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cellular network in the United States is a patchwork
of often incompatible standards, the BlackBerry _ which uses a
wireless data network built for two-way messaging _ has so far been
able to provide better coverage and lower prices here than most
phone services. But even as this country's wireless providers find
ways to weave their networks together, it is unclear whether
Americans will take to typing with the cell phone's number pad,
which requires two presses of the 2 key to enter the letter B, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The BlackBerry's QWERTY keyboard and its calendar and address
book features have also pitted it against the wireless models of
the Palm and the Handspring Visor personal digital assistants. The
Palm and the Visor require users to log on to collect e-mail, while
the BlackBerry receives e-mail automatically whenever it is on.
Since the smaller version uses a AA battery that lasts about two
weeks with continuous use, users tend to keep it turned on.
</P>
<P>
   BlackBerry's biggest competition comes from Motorola, whose new
T-900 is a sort of stripped-down BlackBerry that is considerably
less expensive. Last week, Motorola introduced the P-935, a model
aimed directly at BlackBerry's core corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the BlackBerry is at the forefront of a shift in
communications reminiscent of the introduction of the cellular
phone in the early 1980s, except that it is happening much faster,
and with an added dimension. Wireless e-mail changes the nature of
e-mail itself, making for a shorter, jerkier exchange not unlike a
typical cell phone call. It also alters communication as a whole,
because people can now choose to send e-mail all the time rather
than call.
</P>
<P>
   More than perhaps any other electronic device, the BlackBerry
also gives its users the sense of being in many places at once.
Users say the ability to send e-mail while waiting in line for
lunch, or eating it, is one of the BlackBerry's chief appeals. For
those not toting around a palm-size conduit to the rest of the
world, it may seem like a drawback.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is a BlackBerry backlash. The devices are banned
at the staff meetings of Loudcloud, an Internet company based in
Sunnyvale, Calif., whose chairman, Marc Andreesen, was recently
reprimanded for using his during jury duty. ``Staff meetings are
not worth holding if everybody is there thumb-typing,'' said Ben
Horowitz, Loudcloud's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A vice president of a major investment bank, who declined to be
identified, complained that colleagues at another bank were
distracted by the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to meetings and it's hard to get those guys to focus
because they're all pecking away,'' he said. ``In a small enough
meeting it becomes obtrusive if you're playing with it. If it's six
or seven people, you can get away with it.''

   James Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University,
recently saw a student scrolling through his BlackBerry messages in
the back of a class he was teaching on telecommunications policy.
It seemed apropos for Katz to send him a message with his own
BlackBerry. The professor said the incident reinforced a lesson
borne out in his own research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be spending more time in a mental space
different than their body space,'' Katz said. ``You're able now to
more subtly engage in these antisocial behaviors than you could
before. And if you're not entertaining, people will tune you out
for this other world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time when what Katz and his colleagues call
``perpetual contact'' is becoming a standard expectation, some
BlackBerry aficionados say the device offers a more humane way to
make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the juice company executive, recently needed to reach an
employee who was taking a day off to attend a religious ceremony.
``I could've called his cell phone, but I didn't want to bother
him,'' Scott said. ``With this thing you don't have to interrupt
someone. They can wait five minutes or whatever it is and answer on
their own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoai Ta, the senior director of information technology at
Broadvision, a Silicon Valley company that offers BlackBerries to
all employees, said he took his with him even on weekend fishing
trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often I pull it out, to see, do I have a message from
my boss?'' Ta said. ``Being in touch, staying on top of things is
better for me. Otherwise I have to deal with the problem later on
anyway, and there's the perception that you're not acting fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody considers that a good trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Smith, 32, said her fiance, Jonathan Guerster, an avid
BlackBerry user, sometimes ``almost crashes when we're driving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a lack-of-focus issue,'' she added. For
instance, during conversations about getting married and buying a
house, Guerster ``may from time to time decide to start doing
e-mails,'' Smith said. ``It's annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Nantucket, Mass., where the couple recently bought
a house, Guerster sends e-mail from the nine-seater plane until the
BlackBerry stops working. On the way back, he holds it in his lap
waiting for his connection to click in, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerster, a venture capitalist, conceded a certain BlackBerry
addiction, but he said the ability to send e-mail as thoughts
popped into his head had made him more productive and more focused
because he no longer had to keep lists in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he was glad the BlackBerry doesn't work on
Nantucket. ``I like to be able to get out of range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How long that will last, however, is unclear. Smith had heard
that Scott, among others, had begun to petition RIM to extend its
coverage area to the island. ``I hope it doesn't work,'' she said.

   Many of the craft books published each year are for the Martha
sisterhood: people who were born with an apron, a paintbrush and a
burning desire to decoupage their world. Rarely does a book come
along that addresses the skills of the neophyte, the person who
comes to crafts late in life, someone who did not work out that
teen-age angst on the bedroom walls. ``The Weekend Decorator'' by
Amy Dawson and Gina Moore is for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weekend Decorator'' (DK Publishing, $24.95 hardback) is a
primer for all sorts of simple crafts and home projects. Each
project is explained clearly, with step-by-step photographs
accompanying the directions. Each project has an estimated
completion time; most are under four hours, but a few are more
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a Craft 101 course, this could be the textbook. It
is a very practical book for someone who is moving into a first
house or apartment with more ambition than money.
</P>
<P>
   Painting and sewing projects are the mainstay here, with
chapters devoted to each that list materials needed and describe
the most common techniques. The book illustrates the difference
between measuring a window for a shade or for a curtain. Tassels,
zippers and buttonholes are addressed; so are glazes, washes and
varnishes.
</P>
<P>
   Templates, stencils and a list of suppliers are included with
the index pages.

   NEWS WATCH: Digital Information for the Tragically Hip
</P>
<P>
   A debate may rage over whether leather pants will really be this
fall's fashion fetish, but there is one accessory that urban
hipsters should not be seen without: MODO. At least that is what
MODO's developers will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   MODO is a walnut-shaped handheld device that displays bite-size
chunks of information about a city's dining and entertainment
options, updated daily and delivered wirelessly without a
subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   The device went on sale in New York City last week at Virgin
Megastores, DKNY and other stores that try attract the demographic
group that MODO's developers are aiming for: People 18 to 34 years
old, active, urban and in decent financial straits. The gadget,
which can also be bought online at www.Modo.Net, sells for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a stylus or keypad, MODO has no aspirations to become a
replacement for the Palm organizer or other personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographic is different from the button-down professional
set,'' said Geoff Pitfield, chief executive of Scout Electromedia,
the San Francisco-based company that created the device.
</P>
<P>
   And it does not try to replicate the services of Vindigo,
Zagat's or other downloadable software services that enable people
to search for nearby restaurants or movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is not to be like the Yellow Pages,'' Pitfield
said. ``The idea is to be like your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, at least four writers employed by MODO in each city
send out blurbs and reviews about whatever they think is
buzzworthy: Eclectic dance bands or the three best restaurants in a
specific neighborhood or the latest movie that everyone is talking
about. You can scroll through these reviews or select a feature
called Gambles, which picks an event or restaurant at random.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are saying, `What are we going to do tonight?'''
Pitfield said, ``we'll help.''
</P>
<P>
   If the random entertainment selections don't move the crowd,
MODO also features what it calls ``characters'': Real people living
somewhere in the city who publish their musings on MODO each week.
``It's got a little bit of a soap opera, `Real World,' voyeuristic
feel to it,'' he said. ``That's what we're going for.''

   Study Finds Monitors May Pose Health Risks
</P>
<P>
   For people who sit in front of computer monitors all day, the
old joke about being allergic to work may have some scientific
validity.
</P>
<P>
   A study by three members of the department of analytical
chemistry at the University of Stockholm has found that a gas
emitted by plastics used in cathode-ray tube monitors may be giving
users headaches, allergic skin reactions and nasal congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, according to the study, which appears in the
current issue of Environmental Science and Technology, stems from
the chemical known as triphenyl phosphate. It is commonly added to
plastics used in monitors as a flame retardant.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers built two offices of varying sizes and equipped
them with various pieces of office furniture, computers and
telephones. But seated at the desks was vapor-monitoring equipment
rather than humans.
</P>
<P>
   When the equipment was not operating, the researchers found no
significant changes in the office air. But once the monitors were
switched on, their internal temperatures rose to between 122 and
131 degrees Fahrenheit, and significant levels of triphenyl
phosphate were released. In the 18 monitors tested, the effect was
most pronounced in new units. But even older monitors that were
left running continuously for 183 days produced concentrations of
the gas that were 10 times higher than office background levels.
</P>
<P>
   The computers were also monitored for the gas by the
researchers. But because they don't generate as much heat as
monitors, the group found that the plastic boxes that house the CPU
don't spew unpleasant gases.
</P>
<P>
   Triphenyl phosphate, according to the study, has been shown to
cause skin problems in humans. They can include inflaming nasal
passages, leading to congestion. Based on their findings, the
study's authors wrote that its use in the plastic boxes that
surround monitors ``may be considered a risk to human health.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the effect, the authors suggest that new CRT monitors
be turned on but kept from workers for 10 days to allow some of the
gas to bake off. While that would reduce the initial level of gas
exposure by two-thirds, it still doesn't solve the problem of
long-term release. For that, the study offered no suggestions.

   Module Turns Visor Into Pocket MP3 Player
</P>
<P>
   The promise of Handspring's Visor is its ability to easily morph
into something other than the standard Palm device. To utilize the
Springboard slot on the back of the unit, a developer could create
a module that could turn the Visor into anything from a cell phone
to a game player.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first of these Springboard modules is an MP3 player
from Innogear called the Minijam, which was released last week.
What is supposed to make Springboard modules so useful is that
little needs to be done other than plugging them into the
Springboard slot. While that is true of the Minijam _ it has some
preloaded music covering most popular genres _ to take full
advantage of it, MP3 files need to be downloaded to a computer and
then copied to the Minijam. It is not a painful process, but you
need to know the terminology and inner workings of the MP3 world.
If you don't know about skins and rippers, some time spent reading
MP3 FAQ's would be helpful to get the fullest enjoyment from the
Minijam.
</P>
<P>
   The Minijam comes in two colors, graphite and ice, and two
memory sizes, 32 and 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy memory cards to increase storage, up to 128
megabytes, which translates to about two hours of stored music.
Since the cards are about the size of postage stamps and can be
purchased separately, you can carry an entire music library around
and not take up a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main function of the Minijam is to play MP3 files,
it also has an e-book reader from Peanut Press and a picture viewer
from Album-to-Go. Books and photos can be stored on the Minijam and
viewed through the Visor. There are also two megabytes of extra
memory for moving any application or files off the Visor. For
example, one popular entertainment guide takes up to 500 kilobytes
of memory for each of the five cities currently available. Moving
it to the Minijam leaves room for applications that are used more
often.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-megabyte Minijam sells for $199; the 64-megabyte model is
$259.

PLACES TO CLOSE IN ON RAGWEED, BUT FROM A DISTANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Patton's first rule of war _ get the other poor blankety-blank
before he gets you _ doesn't work with ragweed. It's too prolific,
and a single plant's lightweight, allergenic spores, as many as 1
million a day, blow too far in the wind to let you solve your
watering, itching and sneezing problems in your own backyard.
Samples of ragweed pollen have been collected 400 miles at sea and
2 miles high, the National Institutes of Health says.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean giving up. One of Patton's other rules
does apply: Know your enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To help with identification, the Plants Database of the federal
Department of Agriculture (plants.usda.gov) gives profiles of more
than 20 ragweed varieties, along with many other plants. Under
common ragweed, the site has links to several picture displays,
notably those from the Weed Science Society of America, showing
ragweed as a seedling, a young plant and a mature plant.
</P>
<P>
   A good text and picture site is from the Oklahoma State
University Cooperative Extension Service. You may not need
herbicide advice for alfalfa, but there are close-ups of ragweed
stages 
(www.agr.plantsoil.okstate.edu/alfalfa/webnews/common(Percent)20ragw
eed.htm).
</P>
<P>
   A page on ragweed from the University of Tulsa
(bio44.utulsa.edu/homepages/levetin/ragweed.htm) gives a scientific
description of the common ragweed plant (Ambrosia artemisiifolia),
which it calls the most important cause of allergenic rhinitis and
pollen asthma in North America. Two species of ragweed, it notes,
account for more hay fever than all other plants together. Pollen
release normally occurs in midmorning, it says.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough account of ragweed, complete with literary
references, was compiled by Larry W. Mitich
(ext.agn.uiuc.edu/wssa/subpages/weed/10-1.htm). Why ragweed
acquired a beautiful generic name like Ambrosia, which means food
for the gods, is not known, he writes. He quotes an earlier
speculation that whoever first used the word ``may have had the
equine god in mind, for horses are very fond of this species.''
</P>
<P>
   Hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, affects more than 15 percent of
the population, according to the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology. Its page of advice
(www.allergy.mcg.edu/patients/index.html) explains the various
forms of rhinitis, which can be seasonal or permanent and can be
caused by many substances besides pollen, including mold spores,
dust mites, animal dander and certain foods. Treatment options
include avoidance, medication and allergy shots.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to avoid ragweed entirely, but the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has a short page on
prevention strategies
(www.niehs.nih.gov/airborne/prevent/ragweed.html). Another
important government site on allergies, titled Something in the
Air, from the National Institutes of Health, is at
www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/allergens/full.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma can be a killer and can be aggravated by many of the same
things that cause hay fever. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of
America (www.aafa.org) is a comprehensive online resource for
adults and children. For harder science, a collection of abstracts
of original papers, editorials and correspondence about asthma from
The New England Journal of Medicine is at
www.nejm.org/content/collections/asthma.asp.

 &HT;    COST OF EVERGLADES CLEANUP COULD RISE SHARPLY, GAO SAYS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cost of the projected $7.8 billion Everglades
restoration project could grow _ possibly substantially _ in order
to assure adequate water quality throughout the South Florida
ecosystem, according to a congressional report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office concluded that there
were too many uncertainties about how the restoration project would
work over the next few decades to set a specific price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades project is estimated to cost $7.8 billion, shared
equally by the federal government and the state of Florida, and be
largely completed in about 20 years. Full completion is not
expected until 2036.
</P>
<P>
   The report came as senators met privately late Wednesday trying
to work out objections to the proposed $2.7 billion water resources
development act, the umbrella legislation authorizing federal water
projects. Approval of the Everglades restoration plan drafted by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including about $1.4 billion in
immediate Everglades projects, is part of the water bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, who requested the GAO study and
has been critical of the Corps' Everglades restoration plan, said
he was not trying to derail the project, but felt more study was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My detailed review of this largely conceptual plan has ...
convinced me that it was rushed to this Congress for
consideration,'' Voinovich said. ``A cursory review of this
document shows that it lacks the specificity of a traditional
feasibility report.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, chairman of the Energy and Public Works
Committee, which approved the bill in June, argued that although
the Everglades restoration had risks, it would be disastrous to
stop the project now.
</P>
<P>
   Smith argued that the cost of the project would be roughly $110
million a year for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't try, we will not save the Everglades and the
Everglades will be gone. For 260 million Americans, that doesn't
cost very much, and it's worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., agreed that it was possible the
Everglades project might cost more than currently projected, but he
said any additions to the scope of the project would have to be
approved by future Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects the GAO said might be needed was a $1 billion
effort to dredge Lake Okeechobee to remove contaminated sediments
which flow southward through the Everglades ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   But David B. Struhs, secretary of Florida's Department of
Environmental Protection, told an Environment and Public Works
Committee panel that the state did not intend to dredge the lake.
</P>
<P>
   GAO Associate Director Barry Hill said the dredging of Lake
Okeechobee was included as a potential related cost of the
Everglades restoration because the lake is ``the heart'' of the
South Florida ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is going to have to be dealt with,'' Hill
said. ``How it is dealt with, and how much it will cost, remains to
be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report listed three other areas of uncertainty in the
restoration plan that could increase the project's cost:
</P>
<P>
   _ The effectiveness of 19 storm water treatment areas which may
not be able to remove enough phosphorus to meet the goal of 10
parts per billion. that is believed to be the level that can be in
water without adversely affecting the sensitive Everglades
environment. If the state set that standard, the plan would have to
be modified to include additional treatment at higher cost, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Additional water could be needed. Responding to concerns from
the Interior Department, the Corps indicated that 245,000 acre-feet
of water could be made available to park areas from eastern
portions of the project. That could require construction of
additional water treatment plants to clean the water flowing into
environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Corps plans to filter and chlorinate surface water being
pumped into more than 250 aquifer storage and recovery wells. Such
treatment could cause an adverse chemical reaction between the
chlorinated surface water and the aquifer's groundwater. That could
require additional filtration costs. The GAO also noted that the
project could save about $500 million if it was determined that
chlorination was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report's only recommendation was that progress reports
submitted by the Corps to Congress be issued every two years,
rather than at least every five years as required in the bill.

   KEY WEST, Fla. _ They apparently set off in hopes of finding new
lives of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine Cubans who survived when their small airplane
crash-landed in the ocean Tuesday still didn't know their fate a
day later.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were just beginning their investigation of the
incident, which left one man dead and a cloud of mystery after
Cuban authorities initially reported that the airplane was
hijacked. The plane went down about 60 miles west of Cuba, with the
survivors picked up by a passing Panamanian freighter, the Chios
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some of those on board the Soviet-built crop duster
said there was no hijacking because the pilot of the plane planned
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no hijack, it was a way of looking for freedom,''
Isidro Puig(cq), father of two men on the plane, told Reuters news
service. Puig, who lives in Hialeah, Fla., said the pilot, Lenin
Iglesias Hernandez(cq), planned the escape attempt for his family
and a few select friends.
</P>
<P>
   News service reports from Cuba supported the story.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters there were told that Iglesias set off Tuesday morning
for a routine day of crop-dusting, but left behind his partner,
flight engineer Juan Jose Galiano Cabrera(cq), saying he had to
take care of an administrative matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Iglesias flew to another small airstrip, picked up his
family and friends and headed for freedom, Galiano told reporters.
Iglesias radioed Cuban air controllers that he was hijacked, but
that was a cover story, Galiano said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why the airplane headed west toward Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula instead of north toward the Florida Keys and
Miami. While there were some reports the plane may have run out of
fuel, Miami television station WSVN reported Wednesday that the
pilot might have ditched the plane on purpose near the Panamanian
freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were hoping to learn the details in the coming
days. They had a brief interview Wednesday with Rodolfo Fuentes,
36, who suffered serious injuries in the crash-landing and was
brought by Coast Guard helicopter to Key West late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes was in stable condition in the intensive care unit with
a concussion, a lacerated scalp and a sore neck, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight other survivors _ two men, three women and three
children _ remained aboard the Chios Dream most of Wednesday
because rough seas prevented transferring them to the Coast Guard
cutter Courageous, which rendezvoused with the Chios Dream late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials hoped to complete the transfer late
Wednesday. It was unclear whether they would then be transferred to
Key West or kept aboard the ship pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials and FBI agents were aboard the Courageous,
and planned to interview the survivors once they were on board,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is involved because of the reported hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it doesn't appear to be a hijacking, but until
we interview them we won't know for sure,'' FBI spokeswoman Judy
Orihuela(cq). ``It appears the plane was stolen in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in Miami said all the survivors hoped to apply for
asylum and to remain in the United States. Activists in Miami's
Cuban exile community began working on their cases, with U.S. Rep.
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican, sending a letter to
President Clinton urging that the asylum requests be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, Cubans intercepted at sea are normally
interviewed there and returned to Cuba unless they appear to have
legitimate asylum claims, which are usually based on a fear of
persecution should they return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who reach U.S. soil are normally allowed to apply for
asylum, although those found to have violated laws in their attempt
to reach the U.S. can be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether stealing the airplane _ which was
property of the Cuban government _ would create problems for the
Cuban survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, who was being cared for at the Lower Keys Medical
Center, didn't talk to reporters Wednesday, but met with his
relatives and Miami lawyer Manny Diaz, who played a prominent role
in trying to keep Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. David Bannan, said Fuentes was in good shape
considering the trauma he had suffered, but was clearly worried
about what the coming days might bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing quite well and his spirits are good, although he's
obviously concerned about his situation,'' Bannan said.

RAW RAP AND FILM MAY STIR A FUSS, BUT HIST'RY SHOWS 'TWAS EVER
THUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first English novels, by Henry Fielding and
Samuel Richardson in the 18th century, were filled with debauchery,
and the London establishment was convinced that this new form of
literature was debasing the country's youth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century cartoons and vivid drawings were in fashion
in the popular press. Illustrations of Jack the Ripper's crimes
were said by the high-minded in England to be contributing to
crime. ``Imagine,'' intoned Punch magazine in 1888, ``the effect of
gigantic pictures of violence and assassination by knife and pistol
on the morbid imagination of an unbalanced mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States at the turn of the 20th century the first
motion pictures were offered in peep shows at penny arcades. The
arbiter of moral values and culture at the time was Anthony
Comstock, organizer of the New York Society for the Suppression of
Vice. Working with the postal authorities, he sent agents into
arcades to arrest teen-age boys looking at pictures of women in
bloomers, pictures less risque than those on billboards and in
newspaper ads today. By the time he died in 1915, Comstock was
responsible for the destruction of 160 tons of literature and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of adult dismay over youth culture is being
repeated today in the debate here over violence in the movies,
television, music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every generation believes that the one coming up behind it is
being corrupted by popular culture,'' said Francis Couvares, a
social historian who is dean of freshmen at Amherst College.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Gitlin, a professor of culture, journalism and sociology at
New York University and an authority on the 1960s, said that the
phenomenon of adults' anxiety over their children's culture was
deeply rooted in the human psyche, in the adults' denial that the
culture of their own generation could become passe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every culture passes sooner or later, but we don't want to
believe that what we like is just provisional,'' Gitlin said.
``This is in the human condition. I can't help but think it has
always been so.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly true throughout the 20th century. Ragtime,
vaudeville, jazz and burlesque. Movies about gangsters and fallen
women. Dime novels and comic books. Elvis Presley and James Dean.
Playboy and Penthouse. Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   All of them caught on with young people and were deplored by
their parents. And the politicians of the day often tried to
restrain them in the name of preventing youth from going to hell in
a handbasket.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, in a report last week, carefully
avoided the content of culture and limited itself to examining the
marketing of entertainment rated for adults. The commission found
that a vast majority of films, recordings and electronic games,
including movies whose R rating specifies that children under 17
must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian, were advertised
to appeal to children. One studio even convened focus groups of 10-
and 12-year-olds to test an R-rated film, the commission reported.
</P>
<P>
   At a Senate hearing on the topic the politicians denounced the
content of the entertainment as well as the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee,
declared that the shootings last year at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., indicated that ``the violence our children are
being bombarded with by the media had become part of a toxic mix
turning some of them into killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney, whose husband, Dick, is the Republican candidate
for vice president, said of the lyrics to one rap song: ``It is
despicable. It is horrible. This is dreadful. This is shameful.
This is awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., noted that this was the 21st
hearing the Senate Commerce Committee had held since 1960 on
violence and the media. Before 1960 other committees considered the
matter. In today's light the topics of some of those examinations
seem so tame as to be laughable.
</P>
<P>
   At a memorable moment in a 1954 hearing on whether comic books
contributed to juvenile delinquency, Sen. Estes Kefauver held up
the cover of one comic book and said to its publisher, who was the
witness: ``This seems to be a man with a bloody ax holding a
woman's head up, which has been severed from her body. Do you think
that is in good taste?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the publisher replied, explaining that it would be ``in bad
taste if, for example, the severed head was held higher, and blood
was shown dripping from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest television commercial for American International
Group, the giant financial conglomerate, makes light of the notion
in the 1950s that Elvis Presley was a corrupting influence on young
people, and underscores just how much the limits of culture have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the commercial a heavy man with a Southern
accent says, ``This town will not put up with the vulgar body
movements of Elvis Presley.'' Then a woman in 1950s garb with two
small children at her side yells out in disgust: ``I saw him gyrate
his body and wiggle his hips! He should not be on television!''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ends with a shot of Presley onstage before a huge
audience, and the voice-over proclaims the conglomerate's slogan:
``The greatest risk is not taking one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In modern America, political intervention at the national level
never reached the point of censorship, but in some cases it had a
considerable effect on the culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s politicians put so much pressure on movie studios
that they adopted industry codes that led to the demise of movies
glorifying gangsters, like those with James Cagney and Edward G.
Robinson, and movies like those starring Jean Harlow in which the
heroine was a so-called wanton woman.
</P>
<P>
   By current standards the moral outrage arising from photos of
women in bloomers and comic books and gangster movies is hard to
understand. In an interview, Cheney, a former chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities, said that looking back at
Elvis, ``it all seems so innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   But she argued that matters were much worse today. She mentioned
``Kill You,'' a rap song by Eminem. Although he spends long
stretches on his album ``Marshall Mathers LP'' telling listeners
not to like him, not to act like him and not to expect him to act
like the person in his songs, ``Kill You'' contains images of the
rapper raping and killing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine how it could be much worse,'' Cheney
said. ``We've reached some sort of outer limit here that I don't
think other cultures have had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians and sociologists _ all of whom of course are adults _
tend to agree with Cheney that the depiction of violence in today's
popular culture is worse than what has come before, though they
disagree on whether it leads to violence or the extent to which it
might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this stuff,'' said Gitlin of NYU. ``It's disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Erich Goode, a sociologist who teaches criminology at the
University of Maryland and who has written widely on what he calls
``moral panics'' of earlier years, said: ``There is a qualitative
difference in the kinds of threats children face today, and I think
culture is a big part of it. To parents today, the threat from the
media seems to be something they can't stop. It's not like telling
their kids not to take candy from a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   David Nasaw, who teaches cultural history at the graduate center
of the City University of New York, said, ``The more freedom to
consume children and adolescents have, the more difficult it is for
parents to regulate what they see and what they hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that needs to be asked, said James Gilbert, a
social historian at the University of Maryland, is the extent to
which each generation's culture exceeds the prevailing standards of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things you see today are unbelievably vulgar,'' he said.
``But are they more of a shock compared with the standards of the
day than, say, rock 'n' roll in the '50s was compared with the
standards of that day? I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People accept the idea that times now are worse,'' he added.
``I think you have to be awfully cautious of that.''

MAUI'S VILLAGE OF HANA IS A BREATHTAKING STOP

<P>
   HANA, Hawaii -- Around 5 p.m. Or maybe 6. That's when you begin
to notice a subtle shift in the town's personality.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the last rental cars pull out of Hana, the
unpretentious little village on the southeastern edge of the
Hawaiian island of Maui. You see the drivers glance impatiently at
their watches, then pick up speed a little as they head for the
first of 56 bridges, the first of 617 curves on the infamous Hana
Highway that will be their route out.
</P>
<P>
   It's then that Hana ceases to be a midday tourist refueling stop
and regains its truer identity.
</P>
<P>
   A softball game begins on an emerald-green field across from the
school, the very young or very old hopping onto the hoods of parked
cars to watch the action and heckle the participants. A grill leaps
to flaming life down on the beach of Hana Bay, as the day's catch
is readied for dinner. Siblings squeal with excitement as they ride
their bikes toward Hasegawa General Store in hopes of getting there
before it closes at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   As the night descends, there will be no streetlights to defile
it. And at some point, all sound is destined to be muffled by a
sudden cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Hana -- this is the Hawaii -- that few visitors
experience. Reams have been written about a drive on the Hana
Highway, that 51-mile scenic wonder that perches precariously along
the lush, nearly vertical eastern slope of Maui's Haleakala
volcano. But almost all of it is presented in the context of a day
trip, and that's how it is treated by the majority of visitors
staying in the resort enclaves of Kaanapali or Wailea.
</P>
<P>
   They hop into their rental cars at mid-morning and begin bending
around the 10-mph curves and over the quaint, one-lane bridges,
marveling at each waterfall, each neon-orange burst of African
tulip blossom, each sweeping vista of the cobalt-blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make the briefest of stops in Hana (perhaps wondering
what all the fuss is about) before venturing a bit farther on to
the so-called Seven Sacred Pools (which are not considered sacred
by Hawaiians and number about two dozen). As late afternoon closes
in, they beat a hurried retreat, perhaps sensing that a drive that
had been a charming delight in the morning will be three hours of
white-knuckle torture on the return.
</P>
<P>
   Those who linger in Hana thus have it to themselves. In those
evening hours, and again in the early morning before the leading
edge of the day's tourist caravan rolls in, they're treated to a
profound sense of Hawaii of old. And it is heavenly. Clearly, an
overnight stay is the optimal way to experience its charms.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation fosters the little town's simplicity. You can't get
here readily, so there is no popping in for dinner. The Hana
Highway is one route in. The other is even more daunting: the
Piilani Highway, an unimproved, all-but-deserted road around the
island's southern edge. Rental-car companies use red ink in their
drive-guide brochures to inform customers that their contracts will
be void if they venture onto this track.
</P>
<P>
   Hana has a long history of being removed from the rest of island
life, and it shows. Until the 1920s, access to it was only by boat,
mule or foot. In 1927, convict laborers, using only picks and
shovels, began hacking away at a narrow path that had been the only
route through the rainforest since ancient times. The road wasn't
even paved until the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   So Hana was allowed to exist on its own terms. It was a sugar
cane plantation until the late 1940s, when soaring costs -- not the
least of which was transporting the harvested cane off the island
-- made the operation unfeasible. Then tourism took a toehold, as
San Francisco entrepreneur Paul Fagan opened the six-room Kauiki
Inn, the forerunner to what is now the 66-acre, 66-room Hotel
Hana-Maui.
</P>
<P>
   This enterprise and others (notably cattle ranching) enabled a
high proportion of the indigenous population to remain in the area
after the cane business fizzled out. Maybe that's why the sense of
family, of stability seems to be so strong here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the island, you're with tourists like
yourself,'' said Dave Brazda, manager of the Hotel Hana-Maui.
``You're going to luaus that are more in the Tahitian tradition,
while our (entertainment) is Hawaiian. We have second and third
generations working here, people whose parents and grandparents
worked here. We have one employee getting ready to retire who's
been here 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for the show, don't expect any fire-twirling act,
the frenetic pounding of drums (that's Tahitian, too), or
cheesecake dancers. On a Sunday evening in February, a small choir
of older Hawaiians ascended a stage in the hotel's dining room and
sang songs in their native language, accompanied only by guitars
and ukuleles. This wasn't a polished act -- many, in fact, seemed
to be wrestling mightily with pitch -- but it was absolutely
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hana itself. Over the past 30 years of Hawaii's development
boom, a trend has emerged. A hotel-builder will find a suitable
oceanfront site, then come in and scrape it clean. What follows is
what you might describe as an art director's concept of paradise:
lagoon, waterfalls, tropical trees, sandy beach. Little of it is
authentic (even the sand is trucked in at some of the Big Island's
newer resorts).
</P>
<P>
   Hana has the real deal. You want a rock-lined cove? Hana Bay is
the answer. A picturesque beach? It's hard to beat Hamoa Beach,
where the sand has a salt-and-pepper look and consistency, the
byproduct of lava decomposition. Lagoon? Oheo Gulch is nearby.
Tropical vegetation? Geez, just look around. Haleakala's rainfall
works out to an average of about an inch a day, and most of it
falls here on the eastern slope -- which is why the Hana Highway
winds through a carpet of so many hues of green.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Hana-Maui is pleasantly low-rise. Its most popular
accommodations are the Sea Ranch Cottages, built in the 1980s in
the understated design of plantation workers' quarters. Step out
onto your porch here and your view toward the sea is likely to be
punctuated by a grazing horse.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel underwent an ownership change last year and is still
working to bring in an operational partner willing to sink some
money into the place. It's needed. It hasn't undergone any capital
improvements in more than 10 years, and ``when you're in Hawaii,
sitting by the ocean, maintenance has to be done,'' Brazda said.
``The saltwater will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hotel Hana-Maui is in need of a sprucing up, you wouldn't
know it from its room rates. Brochure rates for the Sea Ranch
Cottages range between $500 and $695, while garden suites start at
$475.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened off by these steep tariffs, we opted instead for the
Hana Kai-Maui Resort, which offers 18 beach-motel-like units on
Hana Bay. The rooms, priced between $125 and $195 nightly, are
divided between two buildings, one of which faces the bay ... the
other of which faces the back of the first building. So you might
want to specify bay-front when you make your reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the rear building, the accommodations were found to be
pleasant -- primarily because they were in Hana. The room had a
broad wooden balcony with comfortable lounge furniture, a heavy
wood sliding door and screen, a ceiling fan, louvered windows on
the inland side of the unit (allowing the onshore breezes to
ventilate the place vigorously), and a full kitchen. It did not
include such amenities as beach towels, a hair dryer or an iron.
</P>
<P>
   The real appeal of the place was revealed at night. Sleeping
conditions were ideal -- so dark and so quiet, the only sounds
being the breakers rolling into Hana Bay and the tradewinds
ruffling the palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hana attribute is its friendliness -- a refreshing break
from a longstanding Hawaiian norm. In many areas where tourists
congregate, the aloha spirit is something of a fraud, as mainland
visitors are met with surliness or, worse, are ignored altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hana has yet to be infected with this. We
encountered locals who waved from passing cars, cheerfully offered
assistance at Hasegawa's General Store and, with the exception of
those serving breakfast at the Hana Ranch Restaurant, were
unfailingly congenial. We even felt welcome at the softball game.
</P>
<P>
   After three days here it was difficult to leave, but an
adventure beckoned. The great majority of visitors to Hana return
the way they came, tackling anew the corkscrews of the Hana
Highway. The idea of heading west on the Piilani Highway -- perhaps
because the rental-car company so strenuously discouraged it --
seemed infinitely more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive is strongly recommended for its 26 miles of
dirt road, primarily because the frequency of Haleakala's stormy
fury can create some suddenly sloppy passages. But many travelers
tackle the risks of this route in compact rentals. While never
having to shift into four-wheel, we encountered three women in a
Chevy Cavalier and one fellow in a Mustang with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Hana, a popular stop with travelers is Oheo Gulch,
where a mountain stream cascades over elaborate rock formations,
forming a series of swimming holes large and small -- commonly but
inaccurately referred to as the aforementioned Seven Sacred Pools.
It is the destination and turn-around point for many of the Hana
Highway day-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of Haleakala National Park, and you can't miss
the crowded parking lot. Most people follow trails to the big pools
below the road, and by afternoon these swimming and rock-leaping
spots look like tourist ant hills. The pools above the road are
usually deserted, perhaps because there are no signs marking the
path to them.
</P>
<P>
   To reach them, follow a trail that parallels the road just west
of the gulch bridge (on the ocean side of the road). When you
encounter a road sign that reads ``Parking, 0.2 miles,'' cross the
road and pick up a trail that descends to the upper pools. The
mountain runoff can be bracing, but afterward you can regain warmth
by lying across one of the sun-washed boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Driving west from Oheo Gulch, you'll probably be on your own
soon after passing the idyllic bluff that is home to the Palapala
Hoomau Congregational Church, where famed aviator Charles Lindbergh
chose to be buried after living out his final years in Hana.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the road works its way along windswept coastal bluffs,
the ride can be equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. On some
tight turns, the salt spray was blowing through the driver-side
window. Grassy hillsides swept down to gray-pebble beaches that
were utterly deserted. The ocean was absurdly blue, perhaps because
the channel between here and the Big Island is more than a mile
deep in places.
</P>
<P>
   It was reassuring to see no tourist development, no signs of
life, not even any power poles at one point -- and to enjoy these
wide-open vistas for miles and miles. There are a few scattered
signs of habitation: the weathered Kaupo Store and farther on, a
barn-like missionary church built in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   We encountered a woman driving alone from the other direction
with a map spread on the passenger seat. ``How much farther to
civilization?'' she asked in a querulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   As desolate as this land might appear, it was once home to a
thriving civilization, attested to by hundreds of archaeological
sites. These southern reaches of Maui were covered with sandalwood
forest, but the trees were felled in the 1800s because newly
arrived traders placed an extreme value on the wood, and the land
soon became arid, suitable only for cattle grazing.
</P>
<P>
   As the road began to climb toward the western end of the island,
the views became ever more spectacular, with black-lava peninsulas
jutting out into a white-capped ocean. A stop at one turn in the
road provided, with only a slight turn of the head, a view of four
other protrusions in the Hawaiian archipelago: the Big Island (the
summit of Mauna Kea poking through a cloud bank), Kahoolawe, Lanai,
and the tiny sliver that is Molokini.
</P>
<P>
   Someday this road may be fully paved, closing the loop with the
Hana Highway, which is scheduled for extensive upgrades. Until
then, this corner of Hawaii will remain blissfully untouched.
</P>
<P>
   And Hana will remain Hana.
</P>
<P>
   ------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Hana is 51 miles from Kahului (where Maui's
airport is located) along highways 36 and 360. Southern California
freeway drivers see the mileage distance and assume they can get
there in an hour. But over the highway's final 34 miles, it becomes
a narrow road that clings to the edge of a verdant cliff and picks
its way across 56 one-lane bridges. It is a spectacularly beautiful
drive that should not be rushed. Stop frequently to enjoy the many
waterfalls and vistas. If you allow three hours, you'll appreciate
the drive infinitely more. Allow at least that much time to drive
from Hana to the Ulupalakua Ranch around the southern end of the
island on the Piilani Highway (Route 31). The distance is 36 miles
along a track that, for much of the way, is either dirt or battered
asphalt. Most rental-car companies consider your contract void on
this road. Before embarking, check with the rangers at the
Haleakala National Park/Oheo Gulch visitors center for an update on
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Brochure rates for rooms at the Hotel Hana-Maui start
at $475 for garden suites, $500 for a Sea Ranch Cottage. Packages
are offered. Information and reservations: (800) 321-4262 or (808)
248-8211; www.hotelhanamaui.com. If that's too steep for your
budget, you'll probably find the Hana Kai Maui Resort (an awfully
fancy name for a motel) to be perfectly adequate. Doubles from
$125. Information and reservations: (800) 346-2772 or (808)
248-8426; www.hanakaimaui.com. Hana also has a number of
bed-and-breakfast options, which can be found through an
exploration of guidebooks or Web searches. One excellent resource
is ``Hidden Maui,'' (Ulysses Press; $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The fine-dining options are fairly limited in Hana. As
in one. The restaurant at the Hotel Hana-Maui, imaginatively
referred to as the Main Dining Room, blends Pacific Islander, Asian
and American cuisine in a delightfully laid-back setting. If the
local fishermen have pulled in some papio, you might luck into an
entree of this delicate white fish, served grilled with garlic
butter sauce, stir-fried vegetables and mashed potatoes that have
been spread out on a griddle and flash-grilled. However, the best
thing about the restaurant is an hour of Hawaiian music presented
by local families, at 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   PICNIC FARE: If you're just making a day trip to Hana (as most
Maui visitors do), pause briefly in the town of Paia before
tackling the highway. Later, you'll be glad you did, because the
lunch fare in Hana is sorely lacking. At the Hana Ranch
Restaurant's snack window, they prepare deli sandwiches early in
the morning -- using bread no more interesting than hamburger buns
(the only choice). You don't want to think about what tuna salad on
a hamburger bun looks like five hours after assembly. For this,
they'll gladly charge you $6. Hasegawa General Store sells only
fixings, no pre-made sandwiches. Instead, stop in Paia (four miles
from the airport) at a place called Picnics -- just off the highway
at 30 Baldwin Ave. It prepares exceptional sandwiches and box
lunches targeted specifically for Hana Highway travelers.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: For information on Hana, the Hana Highway or the
Piilani Highway, contact the Maui Visitors Bureau at (800)
525-6284. Web: www.visitmaui.com.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``It is the very model of a modern music festival,''
the conductor Andrew Davis pattered during the 72nd and last
concert of the BBC Proms festival at the Royal Albert Hall here
this month, offering no apologies to Gilbert and Sullivan and
filling out the famous song with more doggerel celebrating the
Proms. It was a parting tribute, for Davis was relinquishing the
post he had held for 11 years, as chief conductor of the BBC
Symphony Orchestra, the mainstay of the festival, to become music
director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. (Leonard Slatkin succeeds
him at the BBC.)
</P>
<P>
   The Proms, which began in 1895 and are still going strong, to
judge from the last four concerts this year, are surely the model
of a summer music festival for London. It is a model that some have
eyed longingly from afar, finding it attractive for, say, New York.
Kurt Masur, even as he enters his penultimate season as music
director of the New York Philharmonic, continues to broach the
possibility of a Proms-like event in the 7th Regiment Armory across
Central Park from Lincoln Center. But how well might the Proms
translate to New York? If not the Proms, then what is the model of
a modern music festival for New York?
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts, to use the formal title, were
founded by Wood, a conductor, organist and pianist, in the old
Queen's Hall, with a capacity of 2,500. They take their character
from the Promenaders, or Prommers: the devoted listeners who buy
standing room on the arena floor directly in front of the stage
and, since the festival moved to the vast Royal Albert Hall in
1941, high aloft in the gallery. This hall, a study in faded
elegance on the grand scale, holds almost 6,000 people, including
900 Prommers in the arena and 500 more in the gallery. Lines of
Prommers form outside on the day of a concert, often extending for
blocks. Some wait to buy tickets, for 3 pounds, less than $5;
others hold season tickets at a sizable discount.
</P>
<P>
   What I remember best from an earlier visit to the Proms, 12
years ago, was the byplay among Prommers, with chants, posters and
props commenting drolly or nonsensically on the music or on
politics. But here there was little of that. Oh, the arena
challenged the gallery to a phantom tennis match at one point, and
the grunts of serves from on high were answered by shouts of
`Fault!'' below. But for the most part, the Prommers spent the time
before concerts collecting money for charities and engaging in
polite conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Once performances began, an American could only be stunned by
the intense silence among so many listeners, with scarcely a cough
heard through at least two entire evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any hall, those paying the least amount of money are among
the most avid listeners, but they're usually far from the action,''
said Nicholas Kenyon, who has been director of the Proms since
1996. ``But here the atmosphere of the hall is based on the people
paying the least. The concentration is incredible, and it radiates
outward.''
</P>
<P>
   Outward from those standing in the arena, that is. ``The gallery
is a law unto itself,'' Kenyon added. ``We hear strange stories
about what goes on. We even believe that babies have been born up
there, or if not born, at least conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, there were flurries of coughs, American style, at the
best of those four late concerts, with Valery Gergiev conducting
the World Orchestra for Peace in a blazing performance of
Shostakovich's ``Leningrad'' Symphony on the next to last night.
The Last Night of the Proms, as the capstone is called, is
something else again.
</P>
<P>
   There, national sentiment and general lunacy prevail, and the
audience becomes part of the show, waving flags and banners and
singing along to Elgar (``Land of Hope and Glory''), Arne (``Rule,
Britannia'') and Parry (``Jerusalem''), producing sound effects in
Wood's ``Fantasia on British Sea Songs'' and, on this occasion,
serenading the departing maestro. The soberest critics stay away
and dismiss the affair as a nationalistic display co-opted by
right-wing elements. Others in the cultural world more given to
ambivalence tend to sound some variation on the words of a radio
producer who called the event ``utterly offensive but quite
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that judgment was too harsh for Kenyon, himself a former
music critic at The New Yorker and at several London newspapers.
``It's utterly eccentric and very difficult to explain but totally
inoffensive,'' Kenyon said, pointing out that audience members wave
flags of many countries. ``It's really not a political event of any
kind. If we saw any danger of its being taken over that way, we
would do something about it. It's a totally innocent outpouring of
British spirit, with people singing tunes that everyone likes to
sing.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, half of the concert is ``serious.'' On that recent
Saturday, Davis led the BBC Symphony in Elgar's orchestration of
Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in C minor (BWV 537); the young American
violinist Hilary Hahn played Mozart's Violin Concerto in D (K. 218)
brilliantly; and the English soprano Jane Eaglen gave a powerful
account of the final scene from Strauss' ``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Proms season can be more than serious. The
Wednesday before, Bernard Haitink led the BBC Symphony Orchestra
and Chorus in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with unusually substantial
company: Stravinsky's ``Symphony of Psalms.'' The Stravinsky
completed a seasonlong survey of psalm settings, no less, and
unfortunately it (or Haitink) set a tone of coolness and
abstraction that more or less carried through the Beethoven. The
Shostakovich symphony, that Friday, was also set off substantially,
by ``La Mer'' of Debussy, sounding in Gergiev's hands like the
Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   On the Thursday, H.K. Gruber conducted the BBC Philharmonic and
the BBC Singers in a concert version of Weill's ``Aufstieg und Fall
der Stadt Mahagonny'' (``Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny''),
completing another seasonlong concentration, on the music of Kurt
Weill in his centenary. (Other featured composers were Bach,
Copland, Shostakovich and Sullivan.) With the singers heavily
amplified and ``staging'' applied in dribs and drabs, the
performance made an uneven effect. (Or worse: Rodney Milnes wrote
in The Times of London, ``It's been a good season, and if it was
time for an absolute turkey, here it was.'')
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, this was the only concert that did not
come close to filling the house, and there was room on the arena
floor for some to sit. But most evidently take it as a point of
honor to stand, and what terrors could the three hours (with
intermission) hold here after the six hours (with intermissions) of
Simon Rattle's concert performance of Wagner's ``Parsifal'' four
days before?
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the seriousness of much of the enterprise, including
goodly doses of contemporary music, the atmosphere remains festive.
Wood, who died in 1944, still presides in the form of a bust
imported from the Royal Academy of Music and placed on a pedestal
at the rear of the stage. On the last night, he is crowned with a
wreath. He was also brought into action in ``Mahagonny,''
spotlighted as if he were delivering the English commentary on
Bertolt Brecht's deeply cynical text; in fact, the commentary was
piped in, recorded by Jeremy Paxman, an acerbic and hard-hitting
television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   All of this largess is shared with the city and the nation
through the good offices of the BBC, which took over the Proms in
1927, rescuing them from insolvency. (The annual budget now
approaches $8 million, with more than half covered by ticket sales
and the BBC supplying the rest.) Every concert is broadcast on
radio, and many, including the last night, are televised. The
second, ``pops'' half of the final concert is shown in nearby Hyde
Park, as part of a larger program attended by tens of thousands;
this year, it was also shown in parks in Liverpool and Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   So much a part of the public consciousness are the Proms, it
seemed only natural that Davis last concert should be the occasion
for a television profile of him on ``This Is Your Life,'' the
British equivalent of an old American show, in which the subject is
taken by surprise. Davis was ambushed on camera at the end of the
rehearsal on Saturday and whisked off to a studio to record the
rest of the show for future broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   How does all of this apply to New York?
</P>
<P>
   Not whole cloth, for sure; not even with all the Britishisms
translated into American. As with so many traditions, institutions
and circumstances that have evolved over the years, the Proms have
taken on a life of their own, a product of seeming defects as well
as obvious virtues, of inadvertency as well as careful design.
</P>
<P>
   (In Carnegie, read: hole in the stage ceiling, curtain to hide
the hole and the like.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken 106 years of continuous tradition to build
this,'' Kenyon said. ``You can't create something like that
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   You have to start somewhere. The multidisciplinary Lincoln
Center Festival represents a notable beginning over its first five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, who finds the great value of the Proms in its ability to
attract new listeners from outside the field, remains skeptical.
``There is a genuine need for a new venue in New York,'' he said.
``I wouldn't have thought of Lincoln Center, which feels stuffy and
conventional. I would have thought that the crowds for Central Park
concerts should be the basis of a constituency. How do you get
those people indoors?''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival since
1998 and of the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, S.C., begs to
differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten an audience that is anything but stuffy,'' he
said of the New York festival. ``Audiences come to where the
programs are exciting, and it happened this summer with our
presentations of Caribbean music and electronic music.''
</P>
<P>
   Those events, it should be noted, moved to sites outside Lincoln
Center, as have others not well served by its buildings, like the
Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion.'' On the other hand, the
concerts of the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall have
been hard put to separate themselves from the humdrum of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring at Spoleto, Redden showed what might be missing so
far in New York: the way a festival can capture the imagination of
a city, as the Proms regularly do in London.
</P>
<P>
   The festival concert at Spoleto was a performance of ``Surrogate
Cities,'' a big, brash bear of a piece by Heiner Goebbels, a
German. It could not in itself have held much interest for
nonmusical Charlestonians, but Redden presented it in the Memminger
Auditorium, a building nearly destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989
and reopened for the occasion. All of Charleston wanted to get in,
and musical and municipal concerns tumbled together to create an
event far larger than the sum of its parts. It was a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston, of course, is not New York in its diversity and its
distractions. Nor, even, is London. The Lincoln Center Festival,
multidisciplinary as it is, cannot be all things to the music
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think aspects of the festival have caught the imagination of
the city in certain ways,'' Redden said. ``It hasn't happened to
the entire city, and it can't.'' Redden plans to offer music of
Goebbels at Lincoln Center next summer, though nothing that would
require the huge forces of ``Surrogate Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic has announced that it will not take part in the
festival next year. Might there at some point be room alongside the
Lincoln Center Festival for a separate summer venture by the
Philharmonic?
</P>
<P>
   It may be more edifying to contemplate the possibilities for
different kinds of collaboration between the Lincoln Center
Festival and the orchestra. And that seems to be a direction in
which Zarin Mehta, the orchestra's new executive director, is
inclined to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unclear to me, after talking to the architects,
how the armory would work,'' Mehta said. ``Some people say the
capacity could be 4,000 to 5,000, and the architects say 2,700 to
2,800. Well, if it's 2,800, indoors, why are we moving from Avery
Fisher Hall?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mehta sees exciting possibilities for various kinds of
activities there, not just in the summer but year-round; not just
for the Philharmonic but in collaboration with other constituents
of Lincoln Center or even Carnegie Hall, which is also under new
leadership, in Franz Xaver Ohnesorg.
</P>
<P>
   What might come of all these new personalities and ideas in
combination and conflict? How will the Mostly Mozart Festival,
which is run by Lincoln Center in the Philharmonic's hall and has
recently regained some of its original Promsian spirit, fit in?
What is needed is some amalgam to engage the hearts and minds of
New Yorkers beyond the music ghetto and beyond the culture crowd.
It won't be the Proms, nor should it be. For them, there will
always be an England.

SUPERHERO SPIDER-MAN MAKES A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Spider-Man, from Activision; developed by Neversoft for Sony
PlayStation, $39.99; and developed by Edge of Reality for Nintendo
64, available during the holidays for $49.99; for all ages. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The superhero sits brooding and unshaven in a musty armchair,
his costume in tatters, his great muscles sagging, his spirit lost
to despair. Many a time he has been recruited for computer and
videogames. And on many of those occasions, the game in which he
was to appear vanished before the curtain rose. It is his history.
It is his curse.
</P>
<P>
   This character and his brethren should be perfect material for
electronic games, but the superhero genre has a troubled legacy.
The computer games that died on the vine include Superhero, from
Psygnosis; Champions, from Hero Software; Guardians: Agents of
Justice, from MicroProse; and The Indestructibles, from Bullfrog.
And when superheroes do surface, typically on video game consoles
and using comic-book characters, they appear in fighting games that
rarely do justice to the earthly complexities of being a demigod.
</P>
<P>
   Game makers seem undeterred by the high failure rate. Infogrames
recently announced plans for a Superman game, and Irrational Games
is working on Freedom Force for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge with an exuberant yell is Activision's
Spider-Man for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. This novel action
game from Neversoft (the developer of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater)
offers challenge, charm, humor and an unusually open vision of how
a character moves through a game world.
</P>
<P>
   In most games, movement is proscribed: You can go only where the
game designers specifically allow you to go. That is necessary to
sustain a game's challenge and pace. If a particular room calls for
you to perform several side missions to create a path to a distant
door, it wouldn't do to have the player just jump up to the door
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But these kinds of limits can leave the player feeling that a
location doesn't derive from the real world but has been tailored
specifically to serve as an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely had that feeling in Spider-Man. It is the least
fettered of games. The world is your oyster. No rooftop is so high,
no ledge so distant, no section of pipe so out of the way that you
cannot reach it. Spider-Man jumps and swings across vast abysses,
crawls on walls and ceilings in 34 levels set indoors and
out-of-doors _ the latter a misty sea of Manhattan rooftops and
cranes that recalls the classic game Killing Cloud. In my game,
Spidey was even able to take refuge in a building under
construction by nestling, upside-down, at the junction of two
girders as bullets from a marauding helicopter rained on the other
side. It was strangely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The only limits are his health, his supply of webbing and,
occasionally, a meter at the top of the screen that measures the
progress of the villain he is tracking. (More than once, I also
wound up getting tangled in rooftop TV antennas, which made me feel
more like one of the superhero wannabes from the movie ``Mystery
Men'' than the real thing.) To be sure, the levels are populated
with enemies who can be caught in Spidey's web or punched and
kicked into submission, but in many levels that's necessary only if
you make a pit stop to collect supplies.
</P>
<P>
   You usually won't have much time to enjoy the scenery. The game
hits its stride early on with a run of kinetic levels: An
invigorating climb up the outside of a condemned skyscraper, a
brisk pursuit of a taunting supervillain and a series of rooftop
dashes to escape the police. (While Superman and Batman typically
enjoy alliances with law enforcement, Spider-Man is often on the
outs. Here, he's been framed for a theft.)
</P>
<P>
   Delightfully, this openness of structure survives into the early
confrontations with ``bosses,'' the supervillains that Spider-Man
faces at the end of each of the game's six chapters. In most games,
each boss has an Achilles heel that the player must first identify
and then batter at every opportunity. But in Spider-Man, the
villains have inflexible styles of attack that can be turned
against them. For instance, Rhino has a devastating charge, but
only a limited ability to redirect it once he's moving, and a
battleground laden with electrical transformers and explosive
barrels calls for finesse.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spider-Man is endearingly faithful to the
comic books and cartoons that helped inspire the game. It swears
its allegiance in the watercolorlike backdrops, the character
voices (many provided by graduates of Spider-Man cartoons), the
picture-perfect comic-book covers that grace each of the six
chapters, and the spider symbol that heralds new scenes. (The game
also raises the same question in my mind as the cartoons: Given
that Spider-Man is traveling across the top of New York City, where
he is finding an anchor for those sustaining threads he launches
skyward as he swings from building to building?)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also authentic, and delightful, is the game's simple but robust
sense of humor. Everyone's a comedian, and the sense throughout is
that Manhattan is just a lavish playground for the entertainment of
superhero and supervillain alike. Especially fun are the sequences
involving a toothy enemy named Venom, who calls the hero
Spider-Wuss. One of his attacks is a bear hug. (Spider-Man suggests
a breath mint.) And while I'm not a fan of non-interactive
animations _on the principle that games shouldn't take control away
from the player _ one such animation midway through their first
meeting is a classic of its type. Venom escapes by breaking through
the glass wall of an apartment building. The player can't see much
of what follows within but can hear the combatants' crashing
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooo, toe, toe, toe, ow!'' Spidey says, moaning.
</P>
<P>
   A door crashes open, and a woman shrieks. ``Sorry, lady,'' Venom
rumbles. ``Didn't see a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then with another crash, they burst out of the other side of the
building and back into the fray. I was laughing so hard I dropped
the controller.
</P>
<P>
   The controls may initially seem elaborate, with combinations of
buttons allowing Spider-Man to perform special maneuvers, like
creating ``Web spikes'' that add power to his punches or singling
out specific locations for his sticky threads. But they are
introduced gradually, and by the time you have to use them, you
have probably learned how.
</P>
<P>
   If I have a complaint, it is the game's inconsistency. At one
point, the game goes underground and exchanges some of its novelty
for action-game conventions. There is a fighting level: Spidey has
to hold off a horde of reptilian attackers atop a speeding subway
train. (Admittedly, it's beautifully done. The stations that zip by
in the background are meticulously rendered.) There are at least a
couple of Tomb Raider-like levels, with much running and throwing
of switches. There is also a puzzle and a maze with a villain's
lair at the end. These are not bad designs, and the action-oriented
puzzle in the lair is especially grueling, but they don't fully
capitalize on Spider-Man's special abilities. Lara Croft could
perform many of these tasks as easily as Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   But this game is such an advance from its predecessors that this
shortcoming seems little more than a hiccup. Spider-Man is the
first good superhero game I've played in a decade. It may even be
the first great one, entertaining even players who have long since
put away their comic books. It might even educate developers in
what a superhero game can and should be.
</P>
<P>
   And it should banish any notion of a curse. Our down-and-out
superhero is back in action _ hitting the weights, bending over a
sewing machine to mend his costume and airing out that musty
armchair.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, a gleam of hope.

THE VINTAGE DRESS: 92,400 PLACES TO START
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Va.)  (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a big defender of the dress. Suffering from three children,
a dog, two cats and a suicidal streak that prompted me to agree
last week to become a class mother, I am grateful to any single
article of clothing that takes less than 30 seconds to put on but
is efficient enough to function as an entire outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Make that an entire identity. With a mere dress, you can
transform yourself into a businesswoman, a carpooling mom, an
Audrey Hepburn wannabe or a princess.
</P>
<P>
   Although I personally favor the royalty option (I like to wear
bottle-green velvet and carry a scepter to Waldbaum's) I have found
that owning just the right casual dress is more directly applicable
to my lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But which dress is the right dress? I sought advice from Jane
Hegland, an assistant professor of clothing, textiles and fashion
merchandising at New Mexico State University.
</P>
<P>
   I figured that since her doctoral dissertation had explored the
ritualistic aspects of dressing for the prom, she should have no
trouble advising someone who just wanted an incentive to get out of
pajamas on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the conversation, I established a baseline. ``I don't
want the same one everyone else is wearing,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Hegland said. ``But getting dressed is a
constant tension between conformity and individuality. You don't
want to go too far to the edge and somehow communicate that you
don't understand the rules, but you want to add your own individual
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   We agreed that maybe what I wanted was a vintage dress, a
well-sewn vestige of an earlier era that would clearly label me as
an individual of superior taste. I wouldn't know a Bonnie Cashin
coat from a turn-of-the century opera cloak. But thanks to a recent
surge in the popularity of vintage clothing, I should have no
trouble getting an education online, where a simple search for
``vintage clothing'' turned up 92,400 matches on the Google search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that both Hollywood starlets and the woman sitting
next to me at last week's PTA meeting are snagging vintage Pucci on
eBay, why shouldn't I get lucky, too?
</P>
<P>
   But when I found myself squinting dubiously at thumbnail photos
of dresses like the ``late 1940s swing dress with ruffled collar
and cuffs'' for sale for $22 at Vintagevixen.com, all I could think
was, I'd look like Ma Walton in that.
</P>
<P>
   Then another source gave me a lead. ``Do you remember a dress,
back in the 1970s _ it was universally flattering, it tied at the
shoulder, with a band that went over the top of the bosom and then
smocked under it?'' asked Christina Lindholm, a fashion historian
who heads the department of fashion design and merchandising at
Virginia Commonwealth University. ``I had one in navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although my notes indicate that Lindholm continued to describe
this once-popular style in great detail, the last words I heard
clearly were ``universally flattering.'' It was vaguely familiar.
Didn't my childhood neighbor, Mrs. Nilles, wear that dress to a
block party when I was in junior high?
</P>
<P>
   It was a tantalizing enough lead to send me to a couple of dozen
more online shops, with merchandise that ranged from vintage
couture to frowzy flowered housedresses that even Ma Walton would
have torn up to make cleaning rags.
</P>
<P>
   I was intrigued by items like the men's polyblend white disco
shirt, $19.50 at Rustyzipper.com, the 1920s kidskin flapper shoes,
$125 at Hemlockvintage.com, and the Dolce and Gabbana satin purse
for $85 at Buffaloexchange.com. But no 1970s sundress that always
came in a solid color, with three contrasting bands of color across
the bottom and an applique of a lotus flower.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone recalls that particular dress. As Anne Hollander, a
dress historian and author of ``Feeding the Eye: Essays'' (Farrar
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1999), told me: ``Universally flattering comes and
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me wonder whether the dress would look hopelessly
dated even if I did find it. The problem, Hollander said, was that
I wouldn't be able to examine it closely online, much less try it
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think buying vintage items online could really be a
mistake,'' she said, ``because it's very hard to figure out the
general flavor, how it well it wore,'' she said. ``If you are going
to buy it online but can't touch it, then really look at the way
the seams have worn and how the back looks.''
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I tried Fashiondig.com, which operates an
online mall that has about a dozen vintage clothing shops. ``If you
have a fashion dilemma to solve, just Ask Janet _ she may have the
answer you are looking for,'' the site invited. So I clicked on Ask
Janet and sent an e-mail message to the site's co-founder, Janet
Pytowski.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a day, Pytowski responded: ``The dress you're
describing was a comfortable, popular dress worn during the hippie
era. The Young Edwardian label (they made reproduction Victorian
clothes) made a version of this sundress. Sally Struthers wore it
on `All In the Family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pytowski, a video producer who has collected a library of
fashion videos dating to 1984, suggested that I post a classified
advertisement on the site's My Closet area. Placing an
advertisement is currently free but will cost $4.95 a month
beginning next month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Did I want to look like Sally Struthers? Well, at least the
actress wore it when she was playing Gloria Bunker Stivic, not when
she was doing those television commercials for a list of mail-order
technical schools that included both high-school equivalency
studies and firearms repair.
</P>
<P>
   To place an advertisement, I had to specify an amount I would be
willing to pay. ``With a one-of-a-kind piece of clothing, how do I
know what it's worth?'' I asked Pytowski, stalling for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to decide what it's worth to you,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``price,'' I typed, ``Negotiable.''

 &HT;    ATLANTA PENSION OFFICE DESCRIBED AS SLOPPY, CARELESS
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts agency reaction grafs 9-10.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Atlanta office of the Pension Benefits Guaranty
Corp. is so sloppy that letters have been routinely sent out with
incorrect pension amounts, wrong names and erroneous Social
Security numbers, a former employee said in testimony to be
delivered to a Senate hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonne(cq) Ann McHenry, who worked until last March for
Integrated Management Resources Group, Inc., a Maryland-based
private contractor that ran the Atlanta office, said in her
statement that supervisors showed ``no concern'' that former
employees of Pan American World Airways had to wait years to find
out how much they would receive in pensions.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry is scheduled to appear before the Senate hearing as part
of an investigation into the performance of the Pension Benefits
Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), a self-financing government entity that
provides pensions for defunct companies, such as Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry said that ``there was no justification for delays'' in
sending pension designations. She said that frequent mistakes
included overpaying some pensioners and telling others that they
were entitled to 34 percent less than they stated by the Pan Am
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, McHenry said current pensioners received notices
that ``due to unresolved issues we cannot determine the amount of
your benefit,'' and in other cases, she said, Pan Am pension
designations were mailed to people who had never worked for Pan Am.
</P>
<P>
   Also slated to speak Thursday are Thomas A. Parks, a pensioner
from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who waited eight years to receive a
determination of his pension amount, and John W. Wilde of Daly
City, Calif., whose mother received a check in error for $473,129.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency is an unbelievable mess,'' said Sen. Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging,
who called Thursday's joint hearing along with the Senate Small
Business Committee chairman, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contractors do most of the work, yet nobody looks over their
shoulder,'' Grassley said. ``Their product suffers. Retirees pay
the price. This is not the way for the government to treat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pension agency reports that it has made progress in reducing
its work backlog in recent years and disputed descriptions of the
Atlanta office as incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, this office had difficulties with case
processing,'' the agency's spokeswoman said. The PGBC then hired
Integrated Management Resources Group, she said, ``And since then,
the operation has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the continuing probe of pension oversight problems,
the General Accounting Office has completed a report that also
found the ``appearance of improper influence'' in granting $40
million in contracts to Integrated Management Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said it found
evidence that PBGC field operations head Bennie Hagans had shown
favoritism toward the company's owner-president, Myrna Cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks declined to comment on the criticism of her company. Her
attorney, David Kuhnsman, said that allegations of favoritism had
been ``refuted by the agency,'' and he denied that there were
performance problems with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a minority, female-owned and -operated small business
with an excellent performance record and has been harassed
repeatedly by baseless rumors and allegations,'' Kuhnsman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans did not return a reporter's call.

IN AN MTV WORLD, AN ANCIENT CHINESE ART COURTS FOLLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A familiar cacophony echoes in the school's peeling
cement halls, just regular youngsters letting off steam during a
break between classes. The boys are in track suits and Nikes, the
giggly preteen girls in Hello Kitty T-shirts and platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in the background is the high-pitched sawing of a
jinghu, an ancient Chinese string instrument. And no one seems to
take much notice when a creature with a bleached white face
splotched with brilliant colors carrying a sword rounds a bend in
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   These are ordinary children studying a most rarefied pursuit:
They come from across China to a specialized middle school here in
the hope of becoming future Beijing opera stars. And in many ways
these giggly pupils and their teachers form a fragile lifeline for
a dying art that is the centerpiece of traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days everyone knew Beijing opera, and learning how
to sing it was popular, but then there were no movies or home
karaoke sets or VCDs,'' or video compact disks, said Li Xiaofeng,
vice dean of the Accessory Intermediate School of the China
Theatrical College, herself a former performer. ``As China has
opened up, our cultural life has become so much richer _ plays,
Western opera, art _ but that means that Beijing opera doesn't
monopolize the stage as it once did.''
</P>
<P>
   With its complex stories sung in high whiny voices, crashing
cymbals and highly stylized movements, Beijing opera is not an easy
art form for the uninitiated to love. Even in its heyday many of
the plot lines were known only to well-educated Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, every city in China was obliged to have an
opera troupe if only as a symbol of local pride, the cultural
equivalent of small countries boasting an airline.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are fewer than 60 troupes nationwide, and some
provinces don't have any. Though Beijing opera performances are
still presented around the capital, most fans are well-educated
retirees. China's younger generation is far more attuned to the NBA
and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   And that presents a big problem for Beijing opera, since
government support for the art form has dropped steeply as China's
planned economy has given way to market forces. Troupes must now,
for the first time, attract a paying audience to survive and often
train their own performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our reforms brought to bear on Beijing opera troupes,
many get little financing from the government,'' said Li Hong, a
division chief at the Ministry of Culture. ``They have to feed
themselves by doing performances or finding sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Intermediate School of the Theatrical College, China's
new market economy has meant large changes. Tuition-free until the
mid-1990s, the school is now forced to charge about $600 a year in
school fees, far more than the average Chinese public school fees
and many times the average Chinese monthly income.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chinese teen-agers are today far more apt to seek a career
with IBM or a punk-rock band, big opera troupes must recruit so
that new performers will keep coming into the pipeline. Beijing
opera is one of the world's most demanding art forms, with singing,
dance, acrobatics, martial arts, drama. Successful stars combine
the skills of a Luciano Pavarotti and a Nadia Comenici, and
training almost always starts young.
</P>
<P>
   The troupes have become far more aggressive in hunting down
students, holding contests in major cities, for example. They have
also gotten into fund-raising, soliciting private businesses to set
up scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Shimeng, a lanky 12-year-old in a sky blue track suit and
Donald Duck baseball cap, said that two years ago he had signed up
for a tryout in his hometown, Haerbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are opera lovers,'' he said during a break from
acrobatics class, as 30 boys flipped wildly onto foam mats in the
background. He hopes someday to be a star, although for now he
likes to play soccer and watch cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The school has worked hard to introduce young Chinese to Beijing
opera by developing ``greatest hit'' shows. Every two weeks Shimeng
and his classmates perform in a local theater, and Li is trying to
take shows to Beijing's colleges and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been enough promotion, so we go out to lecture
and to popularize Beijing opera so people will understand what it's
about,'' she said. Li acknowledged that for now, at least, the
opera troupes could not continue their performance schedule without
the government financing that remains, about $500,000 a year. With
their fantastic sets and elaborate costume, Beijing operas are
expensive to develop and stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government decided to totally let us live or die on our
own, it would be very difficult for us,'' Li said. ``I don't think
it would die out, but its influence would certainly shrink even
further.''
</P>
<P>
   To help its students navigate an uncertain future, the opera
school insists that all take academic courses and has added
university and master-level opera programs. Its students seem at
home in both the old-world China and the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing opera is a national treasure, and I think most of my
friends envy me, that I'm here,'' said Song Yang, a 12-year-old
from Beijing in a fashionable white jacket, sunglasses and platform
shoes. But when she and her classmates were asked to pick their
favorite music, they giggled and confessed allegiance to a Hong
Kong singer. ``I love pop music, especially Wang Fei,'' she said.

&HT;     GAS PRICES BUCK TREND, REMAIN AT SUMMER LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So much for the traditional post-Labor Day drop
in prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the American Automobile Association, a
gallon of regular unleaded costs an average $2.07 in San Francisco.
That is 11 cents more than a month ago and 49 cents more than a
national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to nickel-and-dime it,'' said Frank Hannah, 29, of
Oakland, who paid $2.20 per gallon at a San Francisco Shell station
on Tuesday. ``I can't fill 'er up.''
</P>
<P>
   He put $5 worth into the tank of his Nissan Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA survey of more than 60,000 stations nationwide showed
San Francisco's gas prices above $2 on average for the first time
and the prices in the San Francisco Bay area rising to an all-time
high of $1.98, up 12 cents in a month.
</P>
<P>
   In Yreka, Calif., near the Oregon border, gasoline cost $2.18
per gallon. AAA representatives said that appeared to be the
highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, gas prices rose 8 cents in the past month to $1.58
per gallon. The price is just shy of the record reached June 23 of
$1.66 per gallon, compared to $1.28 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bronwyn Hogan, a spokeswoman for AAA in San Francisco, said the
skyrocketing prices had shocked the association. Historically,
prices decline along with demand after the summer, but this year
they are remaining elevated because of crude-oil costs that are
rising and nearing $40 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Refinery problems have contributed to the surge in prices on the
West Coast. And in San Francisco, where there are few stations and
residents are relatively well-off, ``retailers will charge what the
market bears,'' Hogan said.

ARTISTS SAY MUSEUM'S WORKS ARE REALLY THEIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the early 1980s, when the art dealer Sidney Janis
was promoting the work of young graffiti artists, Michael Tracy, an
underground painter from the South Bronx, gave the Janis Gallery
several pieces to sell on his behalf, Tracy recalled. He said he
considered one of the pieces, a six-foot metal subway door taken
off a train and spray painted with his graffiti tag, ``Tracy 168,''
one of his best works.
</P>
<P>
   But after he left the piece with the gallery, he said, it
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not see it again until last month, when he
discovered a photograph of it on the Brooklyn Museum of Art's Web
site, www.brooklynart.org, advertising ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots,
Rhymes and Rage,'' an exhibition that opens tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ``Subway Door,'' is one of 47 works by graffiti
artists donated to the museum in June 1999 when heirs of Janis, who
died in 1989, closed the gallery on West 57th Street in Manhattan
and cleared out bins of work that had been warehoused there for
years. Five of those works, including ``Subway Door'' and a
painting on canvas by Tracy, will be included in the museum show,
which explores 25 years of hip-hop culture.
</P>
<P>
   But two graffiti artists whose works were given to the museum,
Tracy and Anthony Clark, as well as a dealer who has handled
graffiti work since the 1970s, Hugo Martinez, say that at least a
dozen of the pieces were never the property of the Janis estate,
and that it had no right to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These paintings were given to the Janises on consignment,''
Martinez said. ``They were never sold and never returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he first saw the donated collection in early July,
when Jeffrey Deitch, a gallery owner who was conducting an
appraisal of the work on behalf of the Janis estate, asked him to
evaluate the works. But Martinez said he became suspicious about
the provenance of the work, because he knew that several artists
had said they lost work they had left with the Janis Gallery over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew S. Dontzin, a lawyer for the Janis estate, said that the
donated work had been stored at the gallery for at least 15 years,
and that for at least a decade no one had made any attempt to
retrieve any of the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   When the estate began sorting through the materials last year,
he added, its representatives made several attempts to contact
artists. Of those they were able to locate, only two responded, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery believed that the rest of the work had been
abandoned, Dontzin said. ``Had the artists contacted them about the
consigned work, the gallery would have gladly returned it to
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Martinez or the other artists contacted the
estate about the work, it would consider their claims. But Tracy
said he had tried to retrieve his work from the Janises, and had
called the gallery at least a dozen times over the last 15 years
without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying they didn't have them,'' he said. ``They
said, `We've looked high and low, but they're not here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who goes by the tag ``A One,'' said he was affiliated
with the Janis Gallery between 1983 and 1986. At the time, he said,
he sold three of his paintings, which he describes as ``aerosol
expressionism,'' to Janis, and gave the gallery a number of other
works to sell on commission. He said that he was in regular contact
with the Janises until 1995, but that he was never informed of what
had happened to any of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every few months each artist used to leave a small body of
work with them to sell, but the ones that didn't sell we were
supposed to get back,'' said Clark, who now lives in Paris. ``But
we never got some of them back. Obviously they've been hoarding
painting from me for like 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Museum, referred
questions about the history of the art to the Janis estate and said
that the museum had no reason to contact any of the artists about
the work because it had been received from a reputable source.
</P>
<P>
   Deitch said he could not comment on the provenance of the work,
and added that the issue of compensation notwithstanding, ``the
really important thing is that a great group of these works will be
in the Brooklyn Museum.'' He continued, ``It's a superb collection,
and I think these are among the great artists of their time, and
they haven't received their due yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he declined to disclose the appraised value of the
collection as a whole, he said a typical piece ``in this category''
would sell for about $5,000.  &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was just 22 when he jumped into a rail yard in 1980 and
took the door off an A train _ he would not say how _ and then
hauled it home to paint his tag on one side and the ``Lovester''
(the opposite of ``monster,'' he explained) on the other. To him it
was a quintessential act of artistic appropriation of public
property, in keeping with the graffiti philosophy and aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   He said that taking the door could not be viewed as theft
because ``the subways belong to the people,'' and because the train
car was about to be retired. ``This door was on its way to the
scrap yard,'' said Tracy, who is now 42 and lives in the Riverdale
section of the Bronx. ``I utilized the piece before it would have
been dumped in the garbage, and now it's actually being
appreciated, instead of sitting in a landfill somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, declined to
comment on whether the door was public property or whether the
authority might have an interest in reclaiming it.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said that because he had turned the door into a new object
_ an artwork _ he saw it as his personal property, which he was
eager to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it is priceless,'' he said. ``I wanted it back for so
many years, when I finally saw it on the Internet, I lit up like a
Christmas tree. It's kind of like a kidnapping, and I've finally
got my kid back.''

U.S. WOMEN GET SCARE BUT GO ON TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Adding score of Australia-Slovakia game) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ruthie Bolton-Holifield had just rushed two
shots, long 3-point heaves that bounced off the rim. Then she
turned to witness something even more unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Pchikova, the Russian forward, beat most of Team USA
downcourt, hit a little runner from the left side and clutched her
fist at the enormous possibility in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans trailed by 7 points, their dominance threatened by
essentially the same opposition, then playing as the Unified Team,
that dealt them their last Olympic loss eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would use the word `scared,' '' said Nikki
McCray, the starting shooting guard for the Americans, ``but we had
to show our character at some point. Or we were headed for real
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States managed to recover for an 88-77 victory after
trailing by 47-44 at halftime, the first Olympic halftime deficit
the American women had known since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback began with a McCray steal and 3-pointer with 17
minutes left. Then, with less than 12 minutes remaining,
Bolton-Holifield caught fire from the perimeter, knocking down two
3-pointers and another jumper within two minutes, baskets that
helped turn a 1-point lead into a 10-point bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Their menacing defense wore the Russians down in a performance
that was more grit than skill before 8,383 at the Dome in Olympic
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she saw the game as either a crack in the U.S. facade
or a show of perseverance after her team moved to 3-0 in
preliminary play, Coach Nell Fortner replied: ``We were resilient.
We came together when we had to against some very tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie overcame early foul trouble to score 14 of her
game-high 18 points in the second half. Yolanda Griffith and Sheryl
Swoopes each added 16 points, and Bolton-Holifield had 12 clutch
points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was never out of the game, but the closest it came after
the spurt was 68-63 with less than eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for much of the first 20 minutes, the Russians sliced apart
the Americans' vaunted defense with precision. Point guard Anna
Arkhipova (a team-high 15 points) and forward Svetlana Abrosimova,
who plays for the University of Connecticut, ran the pick-and-roll
as well as any tandem from the Utah Jazz, popping out for jumpers
or penetrating for short bank shots.
</P>
<P>
   The center tandem of Yelen Chakirova and Mariya Stepanova were
responsible for putting Leslie and Griffith in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia took it to the Americans like no other team in the
tournament, matching them in every facet until the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The United States women have not lost in Olympic competition
since the 1992 semifinals in Barcelona, Spain, where several of the
players now on the Russian team were part of the upset. The last
time the United States lost in international competition was
against Brazil in an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro this past March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aggressive right now defensively,'' Griffith said.
``This is the third game we started slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia (2-1) seems headed for a semifinal showdown with
Australia (3-0), which beat Slovakia by 70-47 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As well as they played, the Russians were undermanned. Their
starting point guard, Irina Soumnikova, was sidelined for the
tournament when she caught an elbow in the face from a Cuban player
in the opening game. Falling to the floor, she fractured her right
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian coach, Yevgeny Gomelskiy, was still upset with the
Cubans, calling the act malicious. ``She forced one of our girls to
end up in a hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban player, Maria Leon, has denied that she purposely hit
Soumnikova.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, center Yelena Baranova, one of Russia's best
players and a star in the Women's National Basketball Association,
missed the Olympics because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   That left Arkhipova's arching 3-pointers _ she made all four she
took _ and her teammates' creative passing to fill the void. Those
Russian players taller than 6 feet often dribbled upcourt and
picked up their defensive assignments in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Russia, and their post players can do so much,''
McCray said. ``Can you imagine Lisa Leslie picking up someone 64
feet from the basket? They're really talented in a lot of different
areas of the game, whereas we specialize a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gomelskiy congratulated the Americans for their
comeback and superiority on defense. He talked about their
outstanding individual skills, as if suggesting that his players
had played better as a unit. He lamented a few mistakes, ``but as
far as the team effort, there are no tragedies today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, his team gave the United States a few anxious
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really wasn't a scare,'' McCray said again. ``It was a
great challenge. Look, we're not going to beat the really good
teams by 20 points anymore. People just have to get used to that.''

TROUBLE IN PARADISE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS: THIS STORY WAS SENT PREMATURELY. PLEASE DO NOT USE UNTIL
AFTER SUN., SEPT. 24, 2000.) 
By ERIC NOLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii -- Hawaii is a place of unsurpassed beauty,
simplicity and peace, such that tourists caught up in its tropical
caress can easily be lulled into a false sense of security. The
islands are not, however, exempt from the same human evil that
infects urban areas on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple from Studio City learned this in excruciating
fashion this past spring. Total cost of the lesson: $8,000, and a
vacation that was utterly ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Fox and Walter Lang, making their first trip to Hawaii,
opted for a one-week stay in Maui. On their first full day on the
island, they arose well before dawn to undertake a popular tourist
activity -- biking down the Haleakala volcano. They parked their
convertible rental car in a shopping center lot at the bike tour
company's office in the Paia-Haiku area, on the northeastern side
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But before boarding the vans for the ride to the top of the
mountain, they made a fateful mistake: They locked valuables in the
trunk of their car, notably a wallet and a condo key.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to their car in the late morning, they discovered
it had been broken into and vandalized. But the nightmare was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves, who apparently hit the car right after the vans
left, drove to the couple's condominium in Kihei and ransacked it,
taking everything _ laptop computer, Palm Pilots, camera, gifts,
clothes, shoes, toiletries, makeup, luggage. From the condo itself,
the VCR, microwave oven and even the phone were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throughout the morning, while Fox and Lang were blissfully
pedaling down the mountain -- and before they could notify banks
and credit-card companies of the break-in -- the thieves went on a
shopping spree, writing checks, using credit cards. They even
bought a full set of tires for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lang were devastated. They had to have money wired and
an emergency Visa account set up (having to wait two days for the
new card to reach them). They had to buy clothes and toothpaste and
combs. ``It was so emotionally violating,'' said Fox, who noted
that even as they went about other tourist activities, she found
herself looking to see if people they encountered were wearing her
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We went there because we were overworked and needed
a break and needed a little romance and a break from all the
stress. It wasn't that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jon Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui Police Dept.,
acknowledged that vehicle break-ins are a common crime against
tourists on the island, but he declined to provide figures on the
matter -- other than to say incidences have declined in recent
years with the deployment of citizens' patrols of problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Morioka noted that prevention is one of the most important steps
an island visitor can take -- ``not locking valuables in the
vehicle, making sure you take only what you need for your
excursion; not taking your whole household with you, locking the
rest in the hotel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Hawaii-bound travelers might not be able to prevent the
kind of calamity that Fox and Lang encountered, but steps can be
taken to substantially reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   In Maui's remote beach areas, signs are posted about not leaving
valuables in your car. As Morioka noted, heed them. ``You see those
signs,'' said Fox, ``but on your first time in Hawaii, something
inside you gets caught up in the magnificence of it all. We were in
a dream-like state.''
</P>
<P>
   The implicit challenge is in protecting your valuables without
denying yourself many of the natural pleasures of the islands.
Hiking in the rain forest and snorkeling in the warm, pristine
waters tend to be unforgettable experiences, but both often require
you to park at a deserted turnout.
</P>
<P>
   And tourist vehicles are easily identified in the islands.
They're late-model, sparkling-clean (with no signs of rust or mud),
and generally white or red.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   -- First of all, scale down your store of valuables before you
leave the mainland. If possible, take just one credit card apiece,
an ATM card, and maybe one gasoline card, if possible, and leave
the rest at home. Don't bring along a lot of expensive jewelry
(restaurants in Hawaii are unfailingly casual). You shouldn't need
your checkbook (maybe just a spare check or two). Leave the
expensive electronic devices at home, if you can live without them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bring along a vast reserve of cash. Even if you don't
want to bother with travelers' checks, you can reload on cash
frequently at numerous ATM machines around the islands.
</P>
<P>
   -- Invest in a couple of nylon fanny packs and some
freezer-strength zip plastic bags. Consider one fanny pack your
``dry'' pack and the other your ``wet'' pack. Then, on any day
trip, take along only essential items. (If you're staying in a
hotel with a room safe -- many have them -- lock all remaining
valuables in it.)
</P>
<P>
   If you embark on a day trip that will involve hiking to
waterfalls and also snorkeling at a beach -- the drive to Hana, for
example -- leave your lodgings with only select valuables: driver's
license, room key, car key, a couple of credit cards, some cash.
</P>
<P>
   For a hike or a bike trip, place these items in the dry fanny
pack and leave nothing in the car more valuable than a beach towel,
your picnic lunch and an ice chest. Later, for a swim, transfer
your valuables -- including your eyeglasses or sunglasses, if
applicable -- to the plastic zip bags. Place them in the wet pack,
strap it around your waist (be sure to zip it closed securely) and
head into the water, leaving nothing important in the car, on the
beach or in a snorkel-tour boat.
</P>
<P>
   You may get funny looks from other swimmers and the fish, but
your mind will be at rest. Afterward, the nylon wet pack should dry
quickly if laid out in the sun or in the trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: You might want to put wedding rings or other
valuable rings in a zip plastic bag when you swim. Greg Thomas of
the Paragon snorkel outfitter said rings can slip off when fingers
get cool and shrink up in the water, and once a ring settles into
the exotica of the coral bed, you'll be hard-pressed to find it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Obviously, this system won't work for a large, bulky,
expensive camera. The solution: Leave it behind in your lodgings if
you know you're going to be swimming or snorkeling. You can always
save the good camera for an evening luau or a simple sightseeing
drive, where you can make sure it's always with you.
</P>
<P>
   For the beach trips, consider picking up a disposable camera _
or, better yet, an underwater disposable camera (they work for
shots on land, too).
</P>
<P>
   -- Another idea is to bring a spare key chain from home and
transfer your condo key to it. That way, if it's misplaced or
stolen, the person in possession of it won't have the name of your
condo complex and your unit number.
</P>
<P>
   None of these precautions will guarantee a safe trip. Rooms can
still be broken into. Tourists can still be robbed at gunpoint _ it
has happened on the hiking trail to Sacred Falls, on Oahu's
windward shore. But they can substantially reduce the severity of
losses in a car burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would certainly have prevented Fox and Lang from
having such a disastrous vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their travails, however, the two were encouraged
after encountering some Good Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the Old Lahaina Luau heard of their ordeal _ and
learned that they had no immediate means of paying for the feast
they had reserved. Fox: ``They said, `Why don't you just come and
be our guests.''' Meanwhile, the proprietor at Maui Jim's broke
into tears at their story, Fox said, and began giving them
sunglasses, shirts, T-shirts and a dinner certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while experiencing the dark side of paradise, Fox and Lang
also encountered its aloha. &QL;

SCHOOLS REFUSE TO BLOCK NAPSTER ON COMPUTER NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as MIT-Napster; a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against
Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford
University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter
the music-swapping site from their computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week
that they, too, will not block access to Napster.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre
asked several elite colleges this month to ban Napster, which
allows visitors to its Web site to obtain copyrighted music for
free. Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E. King, would make a
college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for
free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are
more important than the threat of copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT has a long history of providing its faculty, staff, and
students with uncensored access to the Internet,'' said James D.
Bruce, MIT's vice president for information systems, in a letter to
King.
</P>
<P>
   Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith
colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall
because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet
systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next
month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment
industry. The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of
recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Napster had hoped to recruit more high-profile
schools to lead a nationwide boycott against the site. But Debra
Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel, said the university resisted
because Napster in some instances can be used legally and for
academic purposes, such as in a class focused on copyright issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slippery slope _ once you start banning access to Web
sites because people can potentially violate copyright laws, where
do you stop?'' Zumwalt said.

   Cruz control &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spain's hottest export since paella works hard to be the woman
on top &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Whipp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't know Penelope Cruz. That is, unless you make
movies, in which case you're probably willing to do just about
anything to put her in one of your films.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Crowe (``Almost Famous'') flew halfway across the world
to convince her to co-star opposite Tom Cruise in his next comedy,
``Vanilla Sky.'' Billy Bob Thornton held up his adaptation of
Cormac McCarthy's ``All the Pretty Horses'' until studio executives
gave in and let him cast Cruz for a role as a Mexican heiress.
(``They wanted someone famous; I wanted someone Hispanic,''
Thornton says. ``It's not like 'F-Troop' where old Jewish guys are
playing Indians.'')
</P>
<P>
   And the high-profile parts don't stop there. The Spanish-born
actress just returned from a small island off Greece (that's where
Crowe flew to have dinner with her) where she was working with
director John Madden (``Shakespeare in Love'') and Nicolas Cage in
the sweeping, World War II love story ``Captain Corelli's
Mandolin.'' She's also wrapped ``Blow,'' a harrowing drug story
that co-stars Johnny Depp.
</P>
<P>
   With this resume, Cruz clearly transcends being labeled a
flavor-of-the- month. Sure, she's beautiful. Magazines (GQ and
Vanity Fair among them) have been putting her on the cover for the
past year, usually in connection with ``All the Pretty Horses,''
which has seen its release date move more times than football's
Raiders franchise. Cruz's pretty face obviously doesn't hurt sales,
but it's her acting skill that has filmmakers drooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful, she's fearless, and she challenges herself to
be different every time out,'' Crowe says. ``And the camera loves
her. I feel fortunate to have her in my movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 26, has been acting since the age of 15 and has nearly 25
films to her credit. At the moment, though, audiences here have
only had the opportunity to see her in three English-language
films. There was the little-seen western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' and
the even-less-seen romantic charmer ``Twice Upon a Yesterday.''
Both were fine movies; neither found audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's latest is ``Woman on Top,'' which probably isn't going to
be the movie that plants her in the consciousness of moviegoers
(``All the Pretty Horses,'' coming this Christmas, will likely
accomplish that) but makes for a pleasant enough diversion
nonetheless. Its magic realism will undoubtedly recall for some
Laura Esquivel's ``Like Water for Chocolate,'' and Cruz's
charismatic presence carries you through some of the film's weaker
stretches.
</P>
<P>
   If Cruz is antsy about her impending stardom, she's not showing
it. She's probably been too busy working (see the aforementioned
list) to have time to contemplate such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the process I went through in my country is
repeating now here,'' Cruz says. ``When I started, every little
part I was given was making me very, very happy. My goal is not to
lose that. I feel so lucky that I'm not being typecast. I look for
that, and I'm having the trust of people to give roles that I
haven't done before. If they have trust in me, why should I say
no?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why she hasn't said no and why she's been working
nonstop since making ``All the Pretty Horses'' two years ago.
Which, in turn, is why during a recent 15-day break between movies,
Cruz's well-earned vacation consisted of ``walking from the bed to
the sofa and from the sofa to the swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think she likes working like that,'' says ``Woman on
Top'' director Fina Torres. ``I've known her for many years, and I
knew ever since seeing her in 'Belle Epoque' that she was going to
be big. She has a mixture of innocence and sensuality that's rare.
Usually you get one or the other. Penelope can be convincing in
both respects.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixture that has always been there, from her adolescent
appearances in Spanish movies like ``Jamon Jamon'' (a video store
favorite with lonely men) and the Oscar-winning ``Belle Epoque.''
And now that she's honed her acting abilities, Cruz can even get
away with playing a pregnant nun (another Oscar winner, Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'') and make the character
completely recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Penelope could have played that part,'' Almodovar
enthuses.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to the opening thought: If all these
directors keep calling, thinking that ``only Penelope can play that
part,'' what then? She'll be the ``woman on top,'' but will she
have time for any kind of life outside of movie sets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make the movie with Cameron, then I go back to Spain
for a film, and then I will live,'' Cruz says, noting that next
year's looming Screen Actors Guild strike could neatly dovetail
with her desire to work less. ``In that event, at least I won't be
tempted,'' she says. ``I won't be on holiday thinking, 'Oh maybe I
should be doing this or that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What will she be doing? Looking for an apartment in New York and
a house in Madrid. Spending time with her beloved mother and father
and younger brother and sister. Going from the bed to the sofa and
from the sofa to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time for everything,'' she says. ``I've never felt
like I've had to sacrifice anything to have this job. It's a crazy
life, but I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing. I'm not
thinking, 'Oh, I wish I was home with a baby.' I'm not ready for
that now. Some day, I hope, but there will be a time for that.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola shares decline on concerns over profit
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola fell as much as 6.5 percent Wednesday over
fears that weak volume growth and the strong dollar could hurt
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares fell to as low as $49.44 before closing at
$50.25, down $2.63. More than 7.3 million shares changed hands, or
1.5 times average daily volume over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   The company is scheduled to provide Wall Street with a global
volume update next week. Earlier this month, Coca-Cola sought to
reassure investors by issuing a statement that it is comfortable
with analysts' third-quarter earnings estimates. The company added
that its own outlook for full-year 2000 and 2001 profit is
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola further said it ``remains comfortable'' with the
previously established goal of growing worldwide case volume 5 to 6
percent this year and 6 to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find out next week whether the outlook has
remained the same or changed,'' said analyst Andrew Conway of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who has a ``neutral'' rating on the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is beginning to discount that the consensus range
of earnings per share for fiscal 2001 is too high,'' Conway said of
the stock's decline. He noted that Wall Street generally expects
Coca-Cola to earn $1.75 or $1.76 a share next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness of the stock implies that fiscal year 2001
estimates are too high,'' said Conway, whose own estimate is $1.76
a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to reassess that when we get the volume
updates from Coca-Cola next Tuesday or Wednesday,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares had been on an upswing since tumbling to a
52-week low of $42.88 on March 14. They closed as high as $63.06 on
Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been downhill since.
</P>
<P>
   The decline started after analysts began lowering expectations
of North American volume growth for the third and fourth quarters,
Conway said. It was exacerbated by a strong dollar in relation to
other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the euro Wednesday fell to an all-time low against
the greenback. Earnings downgrades from Gillette,
Colgate-Palmolive, McDonald's, Estee Lauder and DuPont were all
partly blamed on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises slipped 75 cents to $16. Pepsico fell $2
to $41.62.

<P>
   LACMA's new kid-friendly exhibits encourage visitors to look and
touch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Valerie Kuklenski/Staff Writer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking young children to an art museum? That has to be almost as
much fun as taking them to the dentist, or forcing them to sit
quietly through a religious service, or maybe spending an entire
weekend with them at their great-aunt's house the one who has no
toys or videos and lots of breakable stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The powers that be at Los Angeles County Museum of Art believe
that kids will enjoy museums much more as they mature if their
first experiences are fun. Really, really fun.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking behind the development of its new show
titled ``Made in California: NOW,'' the first exhibition developed
by LACMALab, the museum's new research and development unit that
tests innovative ways for visitors to take in art.
</P>
<P>
   The family-oriented exhibit is considered a prequel and sequel
to the LACMA exhibit titled ``Made in California: Art, Image and
Identity, 1900-2000,'' running Oct. 22-Feb. 25. That show looks at
how the arts have shaped California's image over the past century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 California artists who created projects for the exhibit
including Jennifer Steinkamp, John Outterbridge, Erika Rothenberg,
Jim Isermann, Allan Kaprow and Martin Kersels do not usually cater
to young audiences, but they rose to the occasion (or maybe got
down on their hands and knees) to come up with some very playful,
inviting works that defy the stuffy, repressive image of the
typical art museum field trip.
</P>
<P>
   While the ladies who lunch walk through the museum's main
galleries, talking just above a whisper about the Monets, Sargents
and Picassos, kids can enjoy a near playground atmosphere over at
LACMA West (the old May Co. building), where everything is meant to
be touched, if not climbed on. And noise is definitely allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The installations begin at the entrance to the Boone Children's
Gallery with Steinkamp's psychedelic video canopy. Another
Steinkamp work stands just inside the entry: a large video screen
with colorful patterns and composer Jimmy Johnson's swooshing
sounds set in motion by visitors using the swingset in front of it.
Behind the translucent screen is a bright beam, inviting playmates
to cast funny shadows for the amusement of themselves or the
swingers.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg's stage has a podium with working microphones given
by local media, and a video camera projecting the speaker's image
on a screen behind him. Whatever a kid says or sings is amplified
in the gallery and also piped to a speaker-equipped ``microphone
tree'' outside. The wall behind the stage is available for posting
children's drawings, created in the gallery's well-stocked studio
or brought in from home. Title of the installation: ``Hey Kid,
Wanna Be Famous?''
</P>
<P>
   Outterbridge has built a colorful, Watts Towers-inspired,
three-masted ship, complete with a treasure chest that welcomes
visitors' own creations. Two 6-year-old guests donated treasure
maps made from large sheets of paper, cut-out magazine headlines
and yarn ties.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Hashimoto's ``Water-Table'' floor sculpture has an
undulating turf-green surface suggesting a scaled-down version of
St. Andrews, perhaps covered with small round trapdoors. Crawl
across it and lift the lids to look into an artificial ecosystem of
plastic flowers, bubbling fountains, breezy electric fans and other
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fun stopping points is Kaprow's ``No Rules
Except ...,'' as free-for-all as any museum exhibit ever has been.
His space, designed with his 11-year-old son, Bram Crane-Kaprow, is
a bunker covered floor to ceiling in white bed pillows. Most are
attached but several are loose on the floor, game for tossing,
mounding and pillow-fighting. Kids can leap from one ladder in the
middle of the room or another against the wall. Pushing a large
punching bag triggers a soundtrack of snippets of children's
voices, sounds reminiscent of whispers that continue long after the
lights-out order at a bunking party.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sain, director of LACMALab, said the notion of a museum
commissioning art for a children's audience ``is a new animal, not
only at LACMA, but at museums all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exhibition by dare,'' he said of the concept, which
was limited only by budget and square footage.
</P>
<P>
   Sain said traditional exhibits are complete in their own right
even when no one is looking at them, but ``Made in California:
NOW'' ``requires the viewer, the audience to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting at a lot of questions: the role of artists in
the life of museums, the role of museums, the future
stakeholders,'' he said. ``Not just growing the audience, but
inspiring kids who someday will be the museum's benefactors, its
staff, even artists themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   LACMALab is actively seeking feedback from visitors, and so far
the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Maybe it's easier to
rave about an art exhibit when it's clear the curators care what
you think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have institutional permission to not like it,''
Sain said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 people visited the Boone Gallery with free
admission made possible by the Boone family's endowment
</P>
<P>
   in the show's first week. Many families have come several times,
almost like a visit to the neighborhood park. And the average stay
has been about two hours, compared with about two minutes' time
spent viewing a painting in a conventional show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first child screaming in tears, and I thought, 'Oh my
God, what's happened?' '' Sain said. ``The parent simply told him
it's time to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a really great exhibition for kids,'' video
artist Steinkamp said. ``If I'd seen something like that at a
museum when I was a kid well, I'd still be an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   As one young observer said, as she gooshed the moist, waxy sand
of Victor Estrada's sculpture playscape through her fingers, ``This
is the first time I've been to an art museum that's fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ---``MADE IN CALIFORNIA: NOW'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What: A family-friendly, interactive exhibit that lets kids be
part of the art. Where: Los Angeles County Museum of Art's LACMA
West building, northeast corner of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire
Boulevard. When: Noon to 8 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays;
noon to 9 p.m. Fridays; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

NURSES SAY THEY'LL SET UP MORE MILITANT GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The squabble over who speaks for the nation's nurses deepened
Wednesday as nurses from Massachusetts, California, and other
states announced their intent to form a new national organization
to compete with the American Nurses Association, which they called
too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The new group would represent only staff nurses, not managers or
educators, and would fight for ``social justice in health care,''
according to the California Nurses Association, which organized the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The California group took aim at the American Nurses
Association, saying it is dominated by nurse managers who have
become ``agents for profiteering at the expense of patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 members of the Massachusetts Nurses Association
attended the meeting, along with representatives from the Maine
Nurses Association. The two New England groups are contemplating
seceding from the American Nurses Association, following in the
footsteps of the California group, which left the national parent
group in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Oakland, Calif., came just days after the
Massachusetts Nurses Association took another step in that
direction. The MNA's board of directors voted Friday to support the
split, increasing the likelihood that the full membership _ whose
18,000 nurses make up one-tenth of the ANA's members _ will choose
to break off ties in a vote scheduled for Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   After that, MNA leaders who attended the California meeting say
they will push for the MNA, which is both a labor union and a
professional association, to be a founding member of a new national
group.
</P>
<P>
   All this maneuvering has high stakes because nurses, the
nation's largest health care profession, are trying to stake out a
more visible role in the debate over health care cost, access and
quality. Nurses have been energized by events such as the St.
Vincent's Hospital strike in Worcester, Mass. earlier this year,
where strong public support helped the union win limits on
mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the agenda should be a ban on mandatory overtime
for nurses, protections for nurse whistleblowers and other
safeguards against commercialization of health care, said Patricia
Healey, an intensive care nurse at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and a member of the MNA board who attended this weeks'
meeting. And, she said, the ANA has been slow on that agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in our state locals have felt the absence of a
strong national presence pushing these issues,'' said Patricia
Eakin, an emergency room nurse at Temple University Hospital in
Philadelphia and treasurer of Pennsylvania Association of Staff
Nurses and Allied Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the American Nurses Association also supports all of those
positions. The ANA, like the California, Massachusetts and other
state groups, supports a bill introduced last week in the House
that would ban mandatory overtime beyond eight hours in one day or
80 hours in 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   The national group says it struggles to keep the peace between
member states with activist union memberships, such as
Massachusetts, and those who prefer a more moderate approach, such
as the southeastern states. But creating a new national group would
duplicate the ANA's efforts, spokeswoman Hope Hall said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the president of the ANA's newly formed union,
United American Nurses, had attended the California meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the debate is whether an organization can represent
nurse managers and nurse educators as well as staff nurses, and
still advocate effectively for patients' and nurses' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a conflict of interest,'' Eakin said. ``Many of
the same people who are telling us, `You've worked 12 hours and
you're exhausted, but you have to work another four hours,' could
be a member'' of the ANA, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Nurses Association allows only staff nurses on
its board of directors, said executive director RoseAnn DeMoro. But
many nurse managers and educators pay dues to the organization, she
said, because they share its goals.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of collaboration is one reason why some within the MNA
want to remain within the ANA. Until Friday, the board of directors
had remained neutral on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   MNA president Karen Daley said Friday's vote was close: seven in
favor of the split, five against, with one person absent. Daley
herself opposes the split, but does not have a vote on the board of
directors unless there is a tie.

A MEASURE OF IRRELEVANCY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By KATIE HAFNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it would interest you to know that during the first
quarter of this year, 50.4 percent of Internet users were women.
You might be intrigued by the recent news that the number of people
who visited George W. Bush's official Web site,
www.georgewbush.com, soared 522 percent after a new version opened
last month. Or maybe you will find it fascinating to learn that the
money spent on business-to-business online advertising is expected
to reach $3 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you may not care in the least.
</P>
<P>
   The many figures, projections and demographic revelations that
those in the Internet business have decided are relevant to the
public may demonstrate just one incontrovertible fact: the
compulsion to measure has run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Market research is nothing new, of course. But as recently as 10
years ago, research results were, for the most part, shared quietly
with the companies that used them to chart business strategies.
Today, they are the stuff of headlines. Internet research now
commands the same kind of attention as political polls and baseball
statistics. But sports fans, baseball addicts in particular, demand
their numbers. It's all part of the pleasure of the pastime. And
political polls are just another type of scorekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of the Internet industry is different. The number
of online advertisers may be useful to companies plotting their
courses in the online world, but the statistic is so much white
noise to the public at large. Few people are likely to grow cranky
if not given a daily dose of Web site rankings or told how many
Web-enabled cell phones will be on the market by year's end. In the
rush to inform the public on all matters related to the Internet,
no one has asked the most obvious question: Who really cares?
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the pat explanation, which invokes the famous
dictum, much embraced by statisticians, by the physicist Lord
Kelvin: ``When you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is
of a meager and unsatisfactory kind.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a sentiment echoed enthusiastically among the growing
ranks of market research and measurement firms that focus on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a society thirsty for information, and data tells us
something about how we're doing,'' said Doug McFarland, a senior
vice president at Media Metrix, a New York firm with offices
worldwide that churn out regular reports on things like Web site
popularity. ``We're also a very scientific society, and we like to
have that precision of data.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the less lofty, more cynical perspective. ``It's
really about money,'' said Maryann Jones Thompson, who is editorial
director of the Metrics section of for the Industry Standard, a
weekly magazine about the Internet economy that devotes six pages
of each issue to various statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a clamor for attention in the press,'' she said,
``that companies have learned that a great way to get publicity is
to produce a study about your market and issue it as a study and
have reporters pick it up.'' And reporters, this one included, have
been known to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Market research reports are used as tools to sell products.
Corporate clients pay as much as $45,000 a year to receive sales
projections for e-commerce, commerce conducted over mobile devices,
cell phones and personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the companies usually get what they pay for. A
study sponsored by a Spanish-language site reveals that Hispanics
are rushing to get online. A study paid for by a Web site geared
toward women concludes that women are more likely to buy things
online than men are. Yet another _ commissioned by, of all things,
a cell phone retailer _ finds that Americans are optimistic about
the ways cell phones will be used in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fienberg, the Maurice Falk professor of statistics and
social science at Carnegie Mellon University, said people should be
wary of the profusion of market studies masquerading as social
science. ``One needs to make a distinction,'' he said, ``between
the carefully crafted surveys that get done by government agencies
like the Census Bureau, and just using the tools to make a buck,
where the methodology isn't taken all that seriously, even though
there's a gloss and spin on what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the press has called the accuracy of the market
research firms' predictions into question, criticizing them as
inflated and intended to promote a particular market sector. But
Thompson said that after comparing older forecasts with what had
actually transpired in a market, her staff found that analysts'
predictions often turned out to be conservative. For example,
Thompson's group found that four market research firms had
underestimated the amount consumers would spend on online holiday
shopping last year.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Bernoff, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a large,
high-profile market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said, ``We
have a 70-plus percent renewal rate among our clients, so people
are getting valuable things out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, a recent report from the Cahners In-Stat
Group predicting that the use of wireless data technology would
``skyrocket'' from about 170 million subscribers worldwide in 2000
to more than 1.3 billion in 2004. That would put a wireless data
device in the palm of one in every five people on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Cahners more about the report, however, and you will find
that the number of subscribers does not mean the number of
individuals. If one person subscribes to three different services,
Cahners counts that as three subscribers, not one. Also, to reach
its projection of 1.3 billion, Cahners queried not consumers
themselves, but carriers, like Verizon and AT&AMP;T Wireless, whose
projections are bound to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen, principal of Nielsen Norman Group, a product and
Web design consulting firm, saw another flaw in the report. ``Let
us for a minute accept the estimate that there may be 1.5 billion
handsets and other devices with wireless capability sold between
now and 2004,'' Nielsen said. That may be reasonable, he said, if
one makes a projection based on the number of cell phones sold per
year these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it does not follow from `X devices sold' that there
will be `X users of wireless data,' '' he said. If people find the
devices too difficult to use, he said, many will use them simply as
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was no shortage of media coverage on the
report. ``I can't even tell you about the press calls I got,'' said
Rebecca Diercks, director of wireless research for Cahners In-Stat.
Diercks then rattled off a list of news outlets that had called
her: Wireless Week, CNET, the Oregonian and Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasts are sometimes questionable, the relevance of
Internet statistics to consumers is even more difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are Web site rankings generated by Media
Metrix and a handful of competitors. The rankings hold as much
surprise as a McDonald's menu. The top 50 sites are a collection of
usual suspects: Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com. Yet Media Metrix also
gets about 200 calls a day from journalists who are looking for
rankings data sliced dozens of different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Bernoff, of Forrester, is a staunch defender
of publicizing statistics, particularly those that represent
milestones. ``Big numbers are exciting,'' he said. ``People are
fascinated with big magnitudes and transitions. It's the same as
when you were a kid and the odometer turned over from 39,999 to
40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is more skeptical. ``I don't know necessarily that
readers are internalizing all this,'' she said, ``or whether they
actually feel like they need it, but it is definitely being covered
by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   And people do seem to read it. Thompson said the Metrics section
of the Industry Standard was one of the magazine's more popular
sections. And that's not just an educated guess. ``Of course, we
have the numbers on that,'' she said.

SCHOOLS REFUSE TO BLOCK NAPSTER ON COMPUTER NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as MIT-Napster; a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against
Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford
University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter
the music-swapping site from their computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week
that they, too, will not block access to Napster.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre
asked several elite colleges this month to ban Napster, which
allows visitors to its Web site to obtain copyrighted music for
free. Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E. King, would make a
college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for
free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are
more important than the threat of copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT has a long history of providing its faculty, staff, and
students with uncensored access to the Internet,'' said James D.
Bruce, MIT's vice president for information systems, in a letter to
King.
</P>
<P>
   Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith
colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall
because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet
systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next
month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment
industry. The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of
recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Napster had hoped to recruit more high-profile
schools to lead a nationwide boycott against the site. But Debra
Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel, said the university resisted
because Napster in some instances can be used legally and for
academic purposes, such as in a class focused on copyright issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slippery slope _ once you start banning access to Web
sites because people can potentially violate copyright laws, where
do you stop?'' Zumwalt said.

BLEDSOE EXPECTED TO RE-SIGN WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ All indications are the Patriots believe
Drew Bledsoe will be signed by season's end. Bledsoe hasn't been
sweating his contract situation because he knows he will be
spending the rest of his career here, despite reports that he may
be dealt to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Robert Kraft has kept clear of the rumors
regarding Bledsoe's future, but a local report seemed to draw his
ire. He broke his silence Wednesday to respond to a powerful story
in Wednesday's MetroWest Daily News that quoted anonymous sources
close to the team saying Kraft may have ``long-standing doubts''
about Bledsoe being the team's quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was made aware of an article with supposed anonymous
sources,'' said Kraft. ``It's so contrasting to what my personal
feelings are about Drew. As far as I'm concerned, I'm priviliged to
have Drew here. He's a young man I'm proud of _ 286 yards away from
being the all-time Patriots passer. I hope and believe he'll be a
Patriot for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   One source told the newspaper, ``I can't tell you how many times
(Robert Kraft) said, `Is Drew the quarterback of the future for
this team?' Then he'd come up with 50 reasons why he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The source went on to say, ``They're taking so long to re-sign
him because they have doubts about him. That's the real reason they
haven't gotten him signed. Teams don't take this long with a
quarterback if they're planning on keeping him. He should be making
$5 million this year and they should have used (money saved against
the salary cap) to go out and get other players but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The source also said Kraft questioned Bledsoe's work ethic and
commitment to being the best: ``They wonder, `Does he really work
that hard? Is he really into it like Peyton Manning?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said Bledsoe was ``one of the most diligent'' in his
offseason workouts and that he's ``a great young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed all of the workouts this offseason and last.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots invite speculation about Bledsoe because he's at a
point in his contract when most teams have already torn up the old
and brought in the new. Bledsoe's salary-cap figure is $8.66
million this year and $9.83 million next season. Bledsoe, who is
$36 million into his current contract and has earned more than $45
million with the Patriots since 1993, will earn a base salary of
$6.444 million this year and $7.6 million next year. A new contract
would pay him about $15 million up front.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe continually says he's content to earn $7.6 million in
salary next year. When you've already earned $45 million, that
comment is more believable.
</P>
<P>
   There is another aspect to consider: Because Bledsoe signed his
deal before 1995, he has a grandfather clause that prevents the
team from cutting his base salary more than 20 percent. But there
are ways around this, which experienced agents (like Leigh
Steinberg) and experienced negotiators (like Andy Wasynczuk and
Jack Mula) can circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he won't negotiate in the newspapers, but did say,
``Andy (Wasynczuk) has been in regular contact with his
representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he would be ``shocked'' to hear Kraft had doubts
about keeping Bledsoe. Kraft and Steinberg have always had a
friendly relationship and Steinberg sayd he doesn't get the feeling
from the Patriots or Kraft that the team has bailed out on his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is floating this stuff out there,'' said Kraft. ``If
they're trying to represent my feelings, they're way off-base.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick said, ``I think the commitment Mr. Kraft
has made to Drew speaks for itself. He's certainly one of the best
players on the team and he's going to be productive for us. There's
no question he's the quarterback as long as he has a contract and
hopefully beyond. He's handled situations well. He's protected the
ball, hasn't turned it over much, and he's been a good leader for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patriots notes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kraft gave his first public defense of the coaching staff. ``I
have full confidence in this coaching staff. There's a system in
place and they have my total support,'' Kraft said . . . The
Patriots filled the vacant spot on the roster by signing linebacker
Olrick Johnson off of the practice squad. They also re-signed tight
end Chris Fontenot to the practice squad after releasing him last
week. The Patriots are now carrying two tight ends on the practice
squad including Harvard's Chris Eitzmann . . . Belichick said of
Derrick Fletcher, the big offensive lineman he released Tuesday,
``Derrick has a lot of talent. We just had eight offensive linemen
who we think are playing well. That's what we're going with. You
can't keep everybody. These are the best we have. I don't have any
negative feeling toward Derrick right now.'' . . . Both guard Max
Lane and safety Larry Whigham are listed as questionable for
Sunday's game against Miami . . . Bledsoe was upfront about his
first three games: ``Bottom line is I have to play better. It
doesn't end with me, but it starts with me.''

RARE RECORDINGS: HISTORIC, LIVE AND LEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers
can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or
888-346-9867.) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be hard for opera fans to find recordings of historic
live performances on commercial labels. No longer. As record
companies continue to flood the market, live opera recordings from
the past turn up in all the larger record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some hold historical interest for more than musical reasons: a
recently issued recording of Wilhelm Furtwaengler conducting
Wagner's ``Meistersinger von Nuernberg'' at the Bayreuth Festival
in 1943 on the Arkadia label, for example, a fascinating relic of
Nazi Germany. Others are nothing special, just routine nights at
important opera houses that record companies stumble on and
release, hoping that susceptible buffs will buy them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the copyrights to these recordings have been
properly obtained and paid for. More often these releases are
``pirated,'' obtained illegally, though the injured individuals are
usually long gone, and the ripped-off opera companies have more
pressing claims on their budgets than fighting legal battles in
copyright court.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera is an exception. The company's legal
department has vigorously enforced the copyright laws protecting
recordings of performances at the house, at least in the United
States, where laws are stricter than in Europe. So you seldom come
across a pirated recording of a Met performance in an American
store.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Met's own series of historic recordings has been
so valuable. Since 1974 the company has released 23 recordings of
historic radio broadcasts in deluxe boxed sets with extensive
program notes, essays, biographies of the singers and pictorial
histories of all productions of the opera at the Met. The latest
release is a lovely performance of Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier'' from
Feb. 24, 1951, conducted by Fritz Reiner, with a splendid cast
headed by Eleanor Steber as the Marschallin: apparently the only
complete recording of this beloved American artist in that
touchstone role.
</P>
<P>
   These albums are limited-edition collector's items, available
only by special order from the Met (212-362-6000). Just 2,500
copies of each set are produced. Technically, they are not for
sale, but are sent as gifts to anyone contributing $150 or more to
the Metropolitan Opera Fund.
</P>
<P>
   All those with a potential stake in the project have waived
their fees: the artists, their families and heirs, the Met
orchestra and chorus, the local musicians' union and the television
and radio union. So the recordings are scrupulously legal. This
performance of ``Der Rosenkavalier'' is an important addition to
the discography.
</P>
<P>
   There are several classic studio recordings of Strauss' most
popular opera, and this live account is not likely to displace
them. But it is a distinguished performance. In October 1949, the
Met opened its season for the first time with ``Der
Rosenkavalier,'' and Steber moved from the role of Sophie to that
of the Marschallin. The reviews were admiring but qualified. Olin
Downes in The New York Times praised the tenderness and charm of
Steber's singing but said it lacked ``the color, the sensuousness,
the outbursts of passion and of vain regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Steber's conception of the role grew quickly. The 1951
performance captured here is still not as impassioned and overtly
emotional as some portrayals. Yet the restraint and dignity are
refreshing and deeply moving. Steber's singing is typically
sumptuous, with lovely pianissimo passages, effortlessly sustained
high notes and rich, full sound in long lyrical phrases. Though she
performed the role only 24 times with the Met, 14 times at the
house and 10 on tour, many Steber connoisseurs consider this role
among her most important.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of this broadcast the acclaimed American
mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens was scheduled to sing Octavian, one of
her favorite roles. Forced by illness to withdraw, she was replaced
by Jarmila Novotna, the great Czech soprano. The character is an
adolescent, lovesick count, who is 100 percent hormones. Novotna
was 47 at the time, and she sounds it. Her voice is husky and
mature. Still, this is an admirable and sensitive portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie, the other impetuous adolescent in the story, is sung by
another veteran, the German lyric soprano Erna Berger, then 50. Yet
her singing is wonderfully youthful and fresh. Fritz Krenn, the
Austrian bass who plays Baron Ochs, was first encouraged to sing
the role by Strauss himself. It became one of his great
achievements. By the time of this Met performance Krenn was 63, and
his voice sounds patchy and worn. Still, he brings great character
and stylistic authority to his portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Steber's Marschallin aside, admirers of ``Der Rosenkavalier''
will want this recording for the conducting of Reiner. The
performance offers a revealing glimpse of the Met orchestra in its
workaday mode during that period, just one year into Rudolf Bing's
tenure as manager. The playing is careless here and there. It makes
clearer the achievement of James Levine, who over the last
quarter-century has turned the orchestra into a wonder of technical
skill and glorious sound.
</P>
<P>
   But Reiner conducts a fleet, supple and thoroughly engaging
performance, bringing shape and sweep to the phrasing, without a
trace of self-conscious effort. It is all natural, buoyant and
beautiful. He allows the bittersweet moments to linger just enough.
The interpretation is never indulgent or sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all 2,500 copies of some exciting releases in the Met's
historic broadcast series have been scooped up: a classic
performance of Wagner's ``Walkuere'' from 1944, for example, with
Lauritz Melchior as Siegmund, Rose Bampton as Sieglinde, Helen
Traubel as Bruennhilde and Herbert Janssen as Wotan, with George
Szell conducting. So unless the Met reissues them, this recording
and others are gone. Several remarkable albums from the series,
like a performance of Puccini's ``Manon Lescaut'' from 1949, are
still available.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Manon Lescaut'' performance was just one of those times
when everything went right and everyone was at his or her best. The
legendary tenor Jussi Bjoerling, as Des Grieux, is in stupendous
voice. His singing is ardent, vibrant, clarion and, where called
for, meltingly expressive. The surprise, for some, will be the
performance of the soprano Dorothy Kirsten in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Kirsten was taken for granted at the Met, as were other
American singers during the 1940s and '50s. Hers was not a glamour
voice. She had a lovely, warm and quite full sound, solid
technique, affecting artistry and keen dramatic instincts. She was
also a strikingly handsome woman. Today she would have a major Met
career.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is strong, especially Giuseppe Valdengo as
Le-scaut. Giuseppe Antonicelli conducts an idiomatic performance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an electrifying recording of Puccini's
``Turandot'' from 1961, with Birgit Nilsson in the title role and
Franco Corelli as Calaf, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. This was
one of Nilsson's signature roles, and her 1959 studio recording for
RCA Victor, with Bjoerling as Calaf, is justly prized. She sings
here with an extra degree of spontaneity and intensity that was
very likely provoked by her tenor.
</P>
<P>
   During his day, Corelli was criticized for his often hammy
singing. He was a famously lusty tenor, and no score marking, let
alone a mere conductor, was going to limit how long he held his
ringing high notes. Today, when we lack tenors with his kind of
vocal charisma, it is exciting to hear someone with such an
enormous, vibrant voice unleash it so confidently. He and Nilsson,
who appeared together often in this opera, had a love-hate
partnership. In their final scene they engage in some pretty
competitive singing.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Moffo portrays Liu. This gifted American soprano's prime
did not last long, but the Met performance captures her in the
midst of it. The bass Bonaldo Giaiotti is a fine Timur. No doubt
the other reason Nilsson and the cast sing with such vigor is
Stokowski, who conducts with bold dramatic pacing and a keen ear
for orchestral color.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other albums still obtainable are an exceptional
recording of a 1963 broadcast of Bellini's ``Sonnambula'' with Joan
Sutherland and Nicolai Gedda, conducted by Silvio Varviso, and a
1946 recording of Ponchielli's ``Gioconda'' with a glittery cast,
including Zinka Milanov, Stevens, Richard Tucker and Leonard
Warren.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When these Met releases sell out, the performances may still be
available for determined collectors undeterred by legal
technicalities. Though the Met does a fairly thorough job of
keeping pirated Met recordings off the American market, it is less
diligent in Europe, as its legal department readily admits. In
Europe you can easily find pirated recordings of Met performances.
E-commerce has made it much easier for buyers to find them and,
consequently, much harder for companies to crack down on illegal
sales.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Web sites offer lengthy lists of recordings of Met
broadcasts that have even been released on CD, both complete operas
and excerpts, with sound quality ranging from good to wretched. One
Web site has nearly 200 items.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of these pirated recordings are not currently
available, quite a few are.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one matter that will have to be straightened out as
lawyers in the field of intellectual property rights undertake the
enormous task of totally revamping copyright laws, which are so
outdated that they barely take into account the photocopy machine,
let alone the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the $150 cost to obtain the newly issued
``Rosenkavalier'' and other historic Met performances may seem a
lot. Contributors can at least rest assured that they are acquiring
the only legal recordings of live Met broadcasts.

<P>
   WASHINGTON Sept. 20 - Representative William Delahunt, Democrat
of Quincy, yesterday urged a continuation of the moratorium against
quotas for fishermen working in federal waters in a letter to
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``By privatizing our fisheries, quota shares fall to the highest
corporate bidder - leaving the family fisherman out in the cold,''
Delahunt wrote in a letter urging lawmakers to pressure the House
Appropriations Committee to add a one-year extension to the ban
before it expires Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress extends the moratorium they set in 1996,
regional fishery management councils will be able to impose
individual fishing quotas on fishermen. These quotas are based on a
fisherman's previous catch, helping those with larger operations
dominate the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt maintains that a one-year extension of the ban would
give Congress time to set standards for future quotas. That
extension can come as part of the Department of Commerce's fiscal
year 2001 appropriation. Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat,
wants language in the bill that would require hearings as part of
the one year extension.
</P>
<P>
   Quotas are considered by some to be the ``silver bullet'' to end
the problems associated with too many people searching for not
enough fish. Fishery management companies along the Gulf of Mexico
see it as a possible solution to solving their red snapper
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of fishermen from Cape Cod and other shore points,
who came to Washington yesterday to lobby for a continued
moratorium, said they are worried the quotas would destroy their
livelihood, a scenario they said has happened in other areas that
have tried the same program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a severe hardship on the fishing community and it
hasn't done a great service to the resources either,'' said Azure
Westwood, who fishes out of Chatham and is the outreach coordinator
for the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   When Alaska distributed quotas for halibut, the top 40 fishing
boats received quotas worth $2.5 million annually, while the rest
were given an average of $10,000, according to the National
Environmental Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And when quotas were placed on catching the surf clam in New
Jersey, the number of fishing boats dropped by almost two thirds.
Now the groups that hold the access to most of the fish are a bank
and an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, however, locals feel quotas are needed to
protect their businesses. On the West Coast, fishing of the sable
fish has been limited to nine days a year, because experts have
found that any additional fishing would wipe out the population.
Installing quotas would allow fishermen to spread out their work
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast was planning to move to a quota system when the
moratorium started four years ago. Now, some lawmakers are asking
for an exception for the West Coast if an extension is granted.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, 43 percent of managed fish species are
over-fished and the government has declared fisheries disasters in
Alaska, New England and the West Coast, according to the Marine
Fish Conservation Network.
</P>
<P>
   A number of organizations are working to promote the fishermen's
concerns about quotas, including Greenpeace. At the environmental
group's Washington office, Morgan Eldredge prepared to lobby
lawmakers. Her father is a fisherman in Chatham and she is worried
the quotas will destroy his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, he's not going to be stable enough to stay in
business,'' Eldredge said. ``He's going to have to sell his
quotas.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons will be evident on Thursday's weather map. Summery
conditions are expected with tropical rain associated with a
fledgling storm near the central Gulf Coast. Pleasantly cool, dry
autumn air will occupy the Midwest and snow will develop over
western Montana as polar air pours into the region.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front moving off the New England coast will be followed
by refreshing breezes and cooler, less humid air. Clouds and a few
showers will linger over the northern Appalachians. The front will
stall over the Gulf States where abundant moisture will lead to
widespread thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   The chilliest air so far this season will surge into the
northern Rockies accompanied by valley showers and mountain snows.
The West Coast will be dry and not as warm.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: A SEASON ENDS
</P>
<P>
   While some of the strongest hurricanes in history were born as
disturbances in Africa, the season for storms that traverse the
Atlantic is ending. From mid-August until late September,
thunderstorm clusters emerge off the west coast of Africa. Warm
water and steady winds from the east can help nurture these
disturbances until some grow into hurricanes. However, by late
September, the jet stream is moving south. As a result, the chances
increase that African disturbances will be torn apart by strong
westerly winds before they complete their weeklong trek across the
ocean.

 &HT;    When parents kidnap their kids
 &HT;    By Kim Folstad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She'll come here. She'll speak. She'll answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe a few people who otherwise wouldn't care about what
happens when parents kidnap their kids will pay attention, because
even though Barbara Kurth isn't well-known, her story certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she's a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect Kurth to become a ``spokesperson,'' devoted to
``the cause.'' She'll be at the Voice for the Children Inc. Forum
on Parental Abduction on Sunday in West Palm Beach because ``people
are still missing their children, and the general public doesn't
understand what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But this won't become a regular gig.
</P>
<P>
   She has a lot to lose if her daughters don't like what she says.
And, she added, ``I definitely don't want my life to revolve around
this.... It's a miserable way to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's ex-husband, Stephen Fagan, stole away to Florida with
their two daughters in 1979 when, despite his protests that she was
an unfit mother, a Massachusetts court said Kurth should remain the
girls' custodial parent. Outraged, Fagan stretched what was
supposed to be a routine weekend visit with Rachael, then 5, and
Wendy, then 2, into nearly two decades away from their mother. He
changed Wendy's name to Lisa, changed his name to Dr. William
Martin, married well (twice), moved to a mansion and used charm and
a rumor of a resume to create a glamorous Palm Beach lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan told the girls their mother had been killed in a car
accident, and they believed him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the police arrested him in 1998, Fagan told the girls
Kurth was an alcoholic who had neglected them, so he had to come to
their rescue. They believed him again, and continue to defend their
dad.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't yet met with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, 50, who now lives in Virginia, remains hopeful, however,
that a reunion will take place someday, and she won't jeopardize
her chances by talking about Rachael and Lisa to the media or at
the upcoming forum. ``As far as I know, my daughters ... they don't
want me to say anything about them _ or me and them,'' she said
softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get specific about the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the points she hopes to make at the conference is
that children who are abducted by a family member need to be
defended from the kind of criticism her daughters received when
they remained loyal to their father and refused to meet with her.
</P>
<P>
   Although she appeared on Dateline NBC and Larry King Live
shortly after Fagan and her daughters were located, Kurth has
remained low-profile since then. She spoke briefly about the
abduction at a P.A.R.E.N.T. International Conference in 1999, but
she was not a scheduled speaker at the event. When the group asked
her to return for the 2000 conference, she declined.
</P>
<P>
   375,000 children taken
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marianne Malky, who runs the Palm Beach-based
not-for-profit Voice for the Children Inc., managed to convince
Kurth that she could offer an interesting perspective on more
general topics, such as dealing with the media and pushing for
legislation that makes it more difficult for friends and family to
lie to protect an abductor.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth said there are plenty of experts to offer advice ``with a
lot more knowledge than I have. And contacts.'' Her story received
more publicity than most, but according to Justice Department
statistics, 375,000 children in the United States are taken by
their non-custodial parents each year, and 10 percent of those kids
never come home.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's role is to make sure parental abduction stays a hot
topic for reporters and politicians. ``Nobody who has had the
experience wants (this issue) to go away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Malky used Kurth's name, with her blessing,
to provide impetus for Florida legislation. Senate Bill 320, which
passed in May and later was signed into law, requires parents who
hide their children from a spouse or ex-spouse they believe is
neglectful or abusive to notify law-enforcement authorities within
10 days. Failure to do so is a third-degree felony.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be a deterrent to a determined parent bent on
taking the kids, Malky said, but it does give some teeth to the law
when a kidnapper is finally caught.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 58, pleaded guilty to kidnapping in Massachusetts in May
1999, but he avoided jail with a deal in which he got five years
probation and agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and perform 2,000 hours
of community service at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Riviera Beach.
</P>
<P>
   SB 320 was labeled the Fagan Bill because Stephen Fagan said
Kurth was putting the girls in danger when he took them. His
supporters pitched a sympathetic picture of a man who did what he
had to do, and said Kurth was a neglectful mother who didn't much
care what happened to her daughters _ before or after they
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That's the charge that was repeatedly leveled by Fagan, his
family and even Rachael and Lisa. If she really loved her
daughters, Kurth's detractors said, she'd have tracked them down no
matter how clever and convoluted her ex-husband's cover story got.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kurth's goals is to dispel the myth that parents who
can't find their missing children just aren't looking hard enough.
``They don't understand what a thing it is to get people to help
you,'' she said, her subdued voice suddenly spiking with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now, Kurth added, people act as though all you have
to do to find someone is type a name on a computer. ``They don't
believe you unless you challenge them. It's hard to find people
when you do have some idea where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of abduction
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, a biologist at the University of Virginia, maintains she
used whatever resources were available to her to keep the search
going.
</P>
<P>
   The sad reality is, if you don't have any money, you're not
going to find your child, agreed Malky, who has been trying to
locate her son since 1974. He was 7 when his father abducted him,
she said, and she's hired a dozen private investigators to track
him down.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Malky has meticulously documented her efforts,
so if need be, she can prove to her son she was looking all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Malky will talk about at the Voice for the
Children forum, as will guest speaker Paul Keller of Palm Beach
Gardens, who was abducted by his father when he was 2. Although
they exchanged a few letters and spoke on the phone, Keller regrets
that he never had a face-to-face reconciliation with his mother,
who died in 1980. He has become close friends with Kurth, and has
advised her to keep a journal of her feelings to give to her
daughters someday.
</P>
<P>
   Her emotions haven't always been an easy thing to describe,
though, Kurth said. Particularly when Fagan was first found.
``Reporters kept asking, 'How do you feel?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea how I felt. People kept expecting me to be a
certain way. Half the time it was shock, which means half the time
you don't feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she is sure of, though, is that she feels better than
she did in 1979. ``I now know where my daughters are,'' Kurth said.
``I'm not picturing two little girls who, suddenly, their mom is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   They're grown up and they look good, she said. And they no
longer live with their father, which makes her happy.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even live in Florida _ Lisa is a student at Boston
University Law School, and Rachael works in New York City. Perhaps,
Kurth said, their father doesn't have as much control over them as
he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is coming to Fagan's turf, Kurth is hoping her
appearance here won't cross the line with her daughters. She'd like
to meet with them as soon as possible so their grandmother, who is
75, can share in the reunion she still envisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always have hope of that,'' Kurth said.

CRUZ CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  Spain's hottest export since paella works hard to be the woman on
top 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably don't know Penelope Cruz. That is, unless you make
movies, in which case you're probably willing to do just about
anything to put her in one of your films.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Crowe (``Almost Famous'') flew halfway across the world
to convince her to co-star opposite Tom Cruise in his next comedy,
``Vanilla Sky.'' Billy Bob Thornton held up his adaptation of
Cormac McCarthy's ``All the Pretty Horses'' until studio executives
gave in and let him cast Cruz for a role as a Mexican heiress.
(``They wanted someone famous; I wanted someone Hispanic,''
Thornton says. ``It's not like `F-Troop' where old Jewish guys are
playing Indians.'')
</P>
<P>
   And the high-profile parts don't stop there. The Spanish-born
actress just returned from a small island off Greece (that's where
Crowe flew to have dinner with her) where she was working with
director John Madden (``Shakespeare in Love'') and Nicolas Cage in
the sweeping, World War II love story ``Captain Corelli's
Mandolin.'' She's also wrapped ``Blow,'' a harrowing drug story
that co-stars Johnny Depp.
</P>
<P>
   With this resume, Cruz clearly transcends being labeled a
flavor-of-the- month. Sure, she's beautiful. Magazines (GQ and
Vanity Fair among them) have been putting her on the cover for the
past year, usually in connection with ``All the Pretty Horses,''
which has seen its release date move more times than football's
Raiders franchise. Cruz's pretty face obviously doesn't hurt sales,
but it's her acting skill that has filmmakers drooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful, she's fearless, and she challenges herself to
be different every time out,'' Crowe says. ``And the camera loves
her. I feel fortunate to have her in my movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 26, has been acting since the age of 15 and has nearly 25
films to her credit. At the moment, though, audiences here have
only had the opportunity to see her in three English-language
films. There was the little-seen western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' and
the even-less-seen romantic charmer ``Twice Upon a Yesterday.''
Both were fine movies; neither found audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's latest is ``Woman on Top,'' which probably isn't going to
be the movie that plants her in the consciousness of moviegoers
(``All the Pretty Horses,'' coming this Christmas, will likely
accomplish that) but makes for a pleasant enough diversion
nonetheless. Its magic realism will undoubtedly recall for some
Laura Esquivel's ``Like Water for Chocolate,'' and Cruz's
charismatic presence carries you through some of the film's weaker
stretches.
</P>
<P>
   If Cruz is antsy about her impending stardom, she's not showing
it. She's probably been too busy working (see the aforementioned
list) to have time to contemplate such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the process I went through in my country is
repeating now here,'' Cruz says. ``When I started, every little
part I was given was making me very, very happy. My goal is not to
lose that. I feel so lucky that I'm not being typecast. I look for
that, and I'm having the trust of people to give roles that I
haven't done before. If they have trust in me, why should I say
no?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why she hasn't said no and why she's been working
nonstop since making ``All the Pretty Horses'' two years ago.
Which, in turn, is why during a recent 15-day break between movies,
Cruz's well-earned vacation consisted of ``walking from the bed to
the sofa and from the sofa to the swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think she likes working like that,'' says ``Woman on
Top'' director Fina Torres. ``I've known her for many years, and I
knew ever since seeing her in 'Belle Epoque' that she was going to
be big. She has a mixture of innocence and sensuality that's rare.
Usually you get one or the other. Penelope can be convincing in
both respects.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixture that has always been there, from her adolescent
appearances in Spanish movies like ``Jamon Jamon'' (a video store
favorite with lonely men) and the Oscar-winning ``Belle Epoque.''
And now that she's honed her acting abilities, Cruz can even get
away with playing a pregnant nun (another Oscar winner, Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'') and make the character
completely recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Penelope could have played that part,'' Almodovar
enthuses.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to the opening thought: If all these
directors keep calling, thinking that ``only Penelope can play that
part,'' what then? She'll be the ``woman on top,'' but will she
have time for any kind of life outside of movie sets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make the movie with Cameron, then I go back to Spain
for a film, and then I will live,'' Cruz says, noting that next
year's looming Screen Actors Guild strike could neatly dovetail
with her desire to work less. ``In that event, at least I won't be
tempted,'' she says. ``I won't be on holiday thinking, 'Oh maybe I
should be doing this or that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What will she be doing? Looking for an apartment in New York and
a house in Madrid. Spending time with her beloved mother and father
and younger brother and sister. Going from the bed to the sofa and
from the sofa to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time for everything,'' she says. ``I've never felt
like I've had to sacrifice anything to have this job. It's a crazy
life, but I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing. I'm not
thinking, 'Oh, I wish I was home with a baby.' I'm not ready for
that now. Some day, I hope, but there will be a time for that.''

 &HT;    New Mexico State has plenty of Nebraska ties but few wins
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga., - New Mexico State has a ``Nebraska flavor,''
according to Georgia coach Jim Donnan, though it certainly doesn't
show up in the Aggies' all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State coach Tony Samuel played at Nebraska in the
1970s and was an assistant under legendary Cornhuskers coach Tom
Osborne for 11 seasons. All of Samuel's assistant coaches played or
worked at Nebraska, and the Aggies use an option offense similar to
the Cornhuskers'.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparisons between the programs stop there. When Samuel
led the Aggies to a 6-5 record last season, it was just the third
time in 32 years that the school finished with a winning record.
They haven't finished two games above .500 since they had a 7-2-1
record in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dismal history, Donnan said the winless Aggies
(0-2) will be seeking more than the $375,000 paycheck owed them
when they travel to Athens on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about New Mexico State,'' Donnan said. ``We know
it's not a given that we can throw our hats on the field and play.
Certainly, they're capable of beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Aggies won their first three games, including a
35-7 victory over then-No. 22-ranked Arizona State. It was New
Mexico State's first victory over a ranked opponent in 16 tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are well coordinated and they play hard,'' Donnan said.
``New Mexico State is a good, fundamental team and a team you have
to beat. They are not going to beat themselves, and we have to
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, 44, calls New Mexico State ``a diamond in the rough.''
Located in Las Cruces, about 45 miles from El Paso, Texas, the
school will move from the Big West Conference to the Sun Belt
Conference next season.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, in his fourth season at New Mexico State, has watched
his team improve since his first two teams finished 2-9 and 3-8.
The Aggies finished 31st in the country in total offense in 1999,
and this year's team is ranked 18th nationally in total defense,
second against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Samuel said his team might be catching Georgia at an
inopportune time. The Bulldogs are coming off a stunning 21-10 loss
at then-unranked South Carolina on Sept. 9, and they have had two
weeks to prepare for the Aggies. New Mexico State lost to the
Gamecocks 31-0 on Sept. 2 in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they can't have another loss,'' Samuel said of
Georgia. ``It's kind of a double-edged deal because they've had the
week off, it's early in the season, and they do have Arkansas next
week. It makes you wonder a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I know they're going to be prepared for us, because our
brand of offense takes a fair amount of preparation and they're
coming off a tough loss. We were hoping they'd won that game so
they'd be nice and relaxed when we played them.''

 &HT;    Bush may get bounce out of `Oprah'
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The country probably hasn't changed enough for Oprah Winfrey to
be elected president. On the other hand, being president isn't what
it used to be, while Oprah has carved out a unique niche: the moral
voice of Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime is a fascinating cultural territory. In television
broadcasting terms, it has always designated those soap operas,
game shows and talk-and-confrontation shows, from Donahue to
Springer, that are intended to appeal to a presumed audience of
moms, maids and class-skipping teens who watch the tube during the
day.
</P>
<P>
   We think of it as cheaper and sleazier than prime time _ which
is only half true. It is much more racially integrated, and as any
commercial break will confirm, it is clearly geared toward women.
Winfrey, more than anyone else, has grasped just what that means
and taken her medium seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush have both paid calls on Oprah over
the past couple of weeks, giving her audience of 7 million mostly
female viewers the chance to ``decide who feels like the right
candidate for you,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases she was firmly in charge of her turf, brandishing
a freshly won Emmy before Gore's introduction last week, promptly
ejecting a heckler during her Bush interview, prodding both
candidates in the way she has in the past fished personal details
from quarreling couples and the clinically depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance last week did him no harm, but Bush may have
enjoyed his best day in weeks Tuesday: an hour spent on twins and
tax cuts, without any of the distractions that have dogged his
campaign recently. He got his chance at the top of the show to talk
directly to a voter who epitomized the demographic areas where he
needs help: a young, single African-American woman.
</P>
<P>
   The constellations may be in alignment for a Bush poll bounce.
For starters, a significant portion of the punditry has pronounced
the race to be over, which means it's probably good for another
twist. And while Bush was tearing up on Oprah, Gore was having his
own problems staying on message, wrestling with the veracity of the
candidate's comments about his mother-in-law's drug bill.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome his fundamental disadvantages in this race, however,
Bush has to narrow the gender gap, a goal that seemed promising a
couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The news from the latest batch of polls isn't entirely
discouraging for Republicans. Gore leads among women, but married
women _ who might be likelier voters _ favor Bush. In any case,
Bush's challenge is not so much winning over the demographic cross
sections as it is gaining credibility on the issues that interest
them.
</P>
<P>
   If all the political differences between women and men were
erased overnight, the term ``women's issues'' might have to be
retained as a useful anachronism. It really refers to a large
sandwich of concerns, from prenatal care through Medicare, that
have an impact on both sides of the gender line. But during the
years when the Angry White Male was the voter in focus, Republicans
increasingly ceded this territory to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush implicitly promised his party with his campaign of
``compassionate conservatism'' was that he could reverse this trend
and compete in the arena of prescription drugs and reading
programs.
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be very difficult for Bush to do, but at least
he made a start on the Oprah show.

THE ART IS IN GOOD HANDS
</HEADLINE>
  LACMA's new kid-friendly exhibits encourage visitors to look and
touch 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking young children to an art museum? That has to be almost as
much fun as taking them to the dentist, or forcing them to sit
quietly through a religious service, or maybe spending an entire
weekend with them at their great-aunt's house _ the one who has no
toys or videos and lots of breakable stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The powers that be at Los Angeles County Museum of Art believe
that kids will enjoy museums much more as they mature if their
first experiences are fun. Really, really fun.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking behind the development of its new show
titled ``Made in California: NOW,'' the first exhibition developed
by LACMALab, the museum's new research and development unit that
tests innovative ways for visitors to take in art.
</P>
<P>
   The family-oriented exhibit is considered a prequel and sequel
to the LACMA exhibit titled ``Made in California: Art, Image and
Identity, 1900-2000,'' running Oct. 22-Feb. 25. That show looks at
how the arts have shaped California's image over the past century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 California artists who created projects for the exhibit _
including Jennifer Steinkamp, John Outterbridge, Erika Rothenberg,
Jim Isermann, Allan Kaprow and Martin Kersels _ do not usually
cater to young audiences, but they rose to the occasion (or maybe
got down on their hands and knees) to come up with some very
playful, inviting works that defy the stuffy, repressive image of
the typical art museum field trip.
</P>
<P>
   While the ladies who lunch walk through the museum's main
galleries, talking just above a whisper about the Monets, Sargents
and Picassos, kids can enjoy a near playground atmosphere over at
LACMA West (the old May Co. building), where everything is meant to
be touched, if not climbed on. And noise is definitely allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The installations begin at the entrance to the Boone Children's
Gallery with Steinkamp's psychedelic video canopy. Another
Steinkamp work stands just inside the entry: a large video screen
with colorful patterns and composer Jimmy Johnson's swooshing
sounds set in motion by visitors using the swingset in front of it.
Behind the translucent screen is a bright beam, inviting playmates
to cast funny shadows for the amusement of themselves or the
swingers.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg's stage has a podium with working microphones given
by local media, and a video camera projecting the speaker's image
on a screen behind him. Whatever a kid says or sings is amplified
in the gallery and also piped to a speaker-equipped ``microphone
tree'' outside. The wall behind the stage is available for posting
children's drawings, created in the gallery's well-stocked studio
or brought in from home. Title of the installation: ``Hey Kid,
Wanna Be Famous?''
</P>
<P>
   Outterbridge has built a colorful, Watts Towers-inspired,
three-masted ship, complete with a treasure chest that welcomes
visitors' own creations. Two 6-year-old guests donated treasure
maps made from large sheets of paper, cut-out magazine headlines
and yarn ties.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Hashimoto's ``Water-Table'' floor sculpture has an
undulating turf-green surface _ suggesting a scaled-down version of
St. Andrews, perhaps _ covered with small round trapdoors. Crawl
across it and lift the lids to look into an artificial ecosystem of
plastic flowers, bubbling fountains, breezy electric fans and other
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fun stopping points is Kaprow's ``No Rules
Except ...,'' as free-for-all as any museum exhibit ever has been.
His space, designed with his 11-year-old son, Bram Crane-Kaprow, is
a bunker covered floor to ceiling in white bed pillows. Most are
attached but several are loose on the floor, game for tossing,
mounding and pillow-fighting. Kids can leap from one ladder in the
middle of the room or another against the wall. Pushing a large
punching bag triggers a soundtrack of snippets of children's
voices, sounds reminiscent of whispers that continue long after the
lights-out order at a bunking party.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sain, director of LACMALab, said the notion of a museum
commissioning art for a children's audience ``is a new animal, not
only at LACMA, but at museums all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exhibition by dare,'' he said of the concept, which
was limited only by budget and square footage.
</P>
<P>
   Sain said traditional exhibits are complete in their own right
even when no one is looking at them, but ``Made in California:
NOW'' ``requires the viewer, the audience to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting at a lot of questions: the role of artists in
the life of museums, the role of museums, the future
stakeholders,'' he said. ``Not just growing the audience, but
inspiring kids who someday will be the museum's benefactors, its
staff, even artists themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   LACMALab is actively seeking feedback from visitors, and so far
the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Maybe it's easier to
rave about an art exhibit when it's clear the curators care what
you think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have institutional permission to not like it,''
Sain said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 people visited the Boone Gallery _ with free
admission made possible by the Boone family's endowment _ in the
show's first week. Many families have come several times, almost
like a visit to the neighborhood park. And the average stay has
been about two hours, compared with about two minutes' time spent
viewing a painting in a conventional show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first child screaming in tears, and I thought, `Oh my
God, what's happened?' '' Sain said. ``The parent simply told him
it's time to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a really great exhibition for kids,'' video
artist Steinkamp said. ``If I'd seen something like that at a
museum when I was a kid _ well, I'd still be an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   As one young observer said, as she gooshed the moist, waxy sand
of Victor Estrada's sculpture playscape through her fingers, ``This
is the first time I've been to an art museum that's fun.'' &QL; 
---``MADE IN CALIFORNIA: NOW'' &QL; 
What: A family-friendly, interactive exhibit that lets kids be part
of the art. Where: Los Angeles County Museum of Art's LACMA West
building, northeast corner of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire
Boulevard. When: Noon to 8 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays;
noon to 9 p.m. Fridays; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

&HT;     BUSH ACCUSES GORE OF FABRICATING FACTS TO WIN WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush seized upon Democrat Al Gore's
embarrassing misstatements in a campaign anecdote about
prescription drug costs to accuse the vice president Wednesday of
making up facts to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, ratcheting up attacks on Gore's credibility after weeks of
faltering in the polls, also accused the Democratic nominee of
flip-flopping on his threat to crack down on Hollywood for
marketing sexually explicit or violent films, music recordings and
video games to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The flap came as Gore tried to fend off Bush's steady gains in
nationwide surveys that showed the Texan eating into the slight
lead that Gore had forged beginning in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Gallup Poll of likely voters showed Gore's margin
over Bush cut to 4 percentage points _ down from 8 points last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   State-by-state polls gave Gore the edge in 20 states with 267 of
the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Bush held the
lead in 27 states with 214 electoral votes, according to a running
summary maintained by the National Journal's Hotline newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sharply challenged Gore's credibility by questioning the
vice president's claim that his mother-in-law, Margaret Ann
Aitcheson, had paid nearly three times as much for the arthritis
medication Lodine as the Gores pay for the veterinary version of
the same medication for their 14-year-old Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported Monday that Gore drew the comparison
for the catchy campaign anecdote used before an audience of senior
citizens in Tallahassee, Fla., on Aug. 28 from a House Democratic
study on soaring prescription drug costs, rather than from actual
Gore family expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has a tendency to make up facts to make his
case,'' Bush told the Reuters news agency Wednesday during the
Texas governor's visit to Media, Pa. ``The idea that he would make
up facts about a family member confirms what I have said in the
past _ that he'll say anything to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney accused the
vice president of ``playing fast and loose with the facts'' and
``making up stories to scare senior citizens.'' Cheney said Gore's
action was ``not presidential, it is not a trait of leadership,
it's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics have long accused Gore of embroidering the
truth, citing his claims that he played a role developing the
Internet and that his courtship of his future wife, Tipper
Aitcheson, inspired Eric Segal's book and movie ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway rejected Bush's criticism. ``We've
seen that Governor Bush will do anything to get elected,'' Hattaway
countered. ``People can't believe Governor Bush when he says he's
going to talk about the issues because he's back to personal
attacks already.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking with reporters before Bush's comments, said his
mother-in-law and specifics about the medications were not as
important as ``how seniors are charged much more for the same drugs
that are prescribed for animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president's
mother-in-law paid $2.13 per pill for the prescription drug Lodine
while the Gore family pays about 92 cents per pill for the family
dog, Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Bush accused Gore of softening his criticism
of the entertainment industry since going to Hollywood on Monday to
raise money. Gore and running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman had threatened government intervention to discourage the
marketing of sexually explicit or violent films, music recordings
and video games to children following a Sept. 11 report by the
Federal Trade Commission that criticized entertainment industry
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he must be auditioning for a Broadway play
because he keeps changing his tune,'' Bush told a town hall-style
meeting in Media, near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bush challenged Gore as he touted discipline and ``tough love''
in unruly classrooms to make sure that ``every child in America is
educated.'' Bush also picked up the endorsement of the Fraternal
Order of Police in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore devoted a campaign rally in Sunnyvale, Calif., to
lambasting the nation's pharmaceutical companies, saying that it's
``just wrong'' for corporations to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to persuade consumers to buy ``newer and more expensive
medications'' rather than spending on drug research and ``then
charging seniors more than they can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his 10-year, $253-billion overhaul of Medicare will
cover prescription drugs for nearly 40 million Americans, paying
half the cost up to $5,000 a year and providing catastrophic
protection after $4,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 10-year, $158-million Medicare overhaul would provide the
elderly a wider choice of plans within Medicare to help reduce
out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later returned to Washington, D.C., to attend a dinner for
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and prepare for an address on
Thursday attacking oil companies and outlining federal steps to
hold down soaring energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush campaigns used television ads, as well, to
pitch their competing prescription drug proposals and critique the
rivals' blueprint. Gore launched an ad in 17 states on Wednesday
that accused the GOP of misrepresenting his position in an ad that
claims that the Democrat's plan would ``charge seniors a new
$600-a-year government access fee'' for prescription drug coverage
and force seniors to ``join a drug HMO selected by Washington or
they are on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore ad counters that Bush's plan ``forces seniors to go to
HMOs and insurance companies for prescription drugs,'' adding that
Gore's plan is the only blueprint that ``gives all seniors coverage
and choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Republican chairman Jim Nicholson
``forcefully and without equivocation'' repudiated a controversial
television ad being aired in Kansas City, Mo., by an independent
organization, the Republican Ideas Political Committee. The ad
portrays a fictional mother withdrawing her son from public school
in response to drugs and violence because there was ``a bit more
diversity than he could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, responding to an appeal from Democratic chairman Joe
Andrew, said the ``sneering reference to the word `diversity' seems
to me to be racist or race baiting in intent.'' Kansas City is
engaged in a struggle over school desegregation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America embraces many of Australia's most accessible exports
(Russell Crowe, Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, koalas), but one of the
most compelling aspects of the culture _ Aboriginal art _ remains
largely unknown in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aborigine'' is the name given to Australia's many and various
indigenous tribes. And their art, characterized by the use of
painted or carved lines, dots and simple figures, is as beautiful
and fascinating as the celebrated wildlife and landscapes of
Australia. The lines and dots mysteriously evoke the mythical
history and collective psyche of the Aborigines, weaving images of
Australia's odd-looking animals, lithe dancing figures,
spear-wielding hunters and primitive symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The art form represents thousands of years of sacred
storytelling and inspiration that have, in more recent generations,
survived the attempts of English colonists to annihilate them.
Aboriginal paintings and carvings, along with their oral
traditions, capture the myths and histories that define their
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the paintings recount the mythic time before
civilization, when their legends were formed, known as ``The
Dreamtime.'' That is when the spirits placed the shark in the sea
and the evening star in the sky, when fire was born and when evil
first intruded on gentle people.
</P>
<P>
   With the English colonization of Australia, beginning in the
late 18th century, and the subsequent decimation of the Aborigines,
their culture was at risk of disappearing. But in the second half
of the 20th century, the Australian government began to re-examine
its brutal and inhumane treatment of the Aborigines. And in the
past 20 years, Aboriginal art has enjoyed growing popularity and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Olympics' focus on the land Down Under whets your
appetite for things Australian, include Aboriginal culture in your
exploration. Check out www.dreamcreations.com.au, an online source
for Aboriginal art that features the work of female artists;
www.dacou.com.au, which represents the work of an all-Aboriginal
owned and operated gallery; or www.aboriginalart.com.au, an
award-winning site that includes information about the history,
music and legends of the Aborigines along with the artwork. &QL;

WHAT A CHICA WANTS? A BIGGER FAN BASE

   Christina Aguilera's first all-Spanish effort has just arrived
in music stores everywhere, she's on a major tour of arenas and
state fairs, and her self-titled debut, having sold more than 7
million copies, is still in the top 20 more than a year after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say synergy? Aguilera is a cute little teen-ager who has
been extremely well-marketed, and this CD is a not-too-shabby bid
to cement her popularity among Hispanics and all over Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Mi Reflejo'' (My Reflection) couldn't come at a better
time: Aguilera is hanging tough in the marketplace; it's basically
her and Britney Spears neck-and-neck in the Cute Pop Singer
sweepstakes, the prize being untold millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera and her handlers are very smart in making this move,
because (thanks to Aguilera's dad being from Ecuador and her
hearing Spanish in the home as a kid) she can easily pull this off,
and because an all-Spanish-language CD is something we can't
imagine Ms. Spears doing.
</P>
<P>
   By recasting five of her biggest hits _ ``Genie in a Bottle,
Come On Over, I Turn to You, What a Girl Wants'' and ``Reflection''
_ Aguilera is wooing an enormous new audience, something that will
pay her major dividends in the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   And, honestly, ``Mi Reflejo'' is on par with her debut, the
difference being that this time there are, of course, Spanish
lyrics and a couple of salsas to go along with the slick,
squeaky-clean pop with which she's made her name.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera handles the Spanish vocals fairly well, even though she
clearly doesn't have the mastery of phrasing of someone who grew up
singing mainly in Spanish. This becomes obvious on the ``Pero Me
Acuerdo De Ti'' and ``Por Siempre Tu,'' neither of which is all
that impressive. The CD's lone duet, ``Si No Te Hubiera Conocido''
(with Luis Fonsi) is better.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, then, Reflejo'' does what it sets out to do: gives
the Hispanic audience its own versions of her major hits, adds in a
little spice, and gives her the chance to become a major player in
Latin music. The inevitable Christmas CD, ``My Kind of Christmas,''
is due Oct. 29. &QL;

COMING SOON: PAPERBACKS THAT SOUND LIKE HIP-HOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life is good for Jerome Usher, who drinks Dom Perignon and lives
in an enormous apartment with three bedrooms and a walk-in closet
with rows of Versace, Armani, Valentino and Gucci suits, a $15,000
billiard table, an 80-inch Mission armoire and 10 universal remotes
with which he can flip on Mobb Deep's ``Hell on Earth'' or just
about anything else. Usher also has a collection of watches, from
Cartiers to Patek Philippes, and a 6-foot Mosler safe, which holds
an assortment of handguns and silencers and an AR-15 sniper rifle.
They are his professional tools. Usher is a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   He is the main character in the first of a series of bold and
provocative pulp fiction paperbacks to be produced by a small
publishing house that has popped up on the West Coast. The novels
are geared directly and unashamedly to black urban youths and are
meant to be more than just reads. They are the literary equivalent
of hip-hop videos, using the language and metaphor and rhythms of
hip-hop, its sex and violence, only in prose rather than lyrics and
beats. Indeed, each novel comes packaged with a Def Jam CD, with
tracks by artists like Jay-Z, Foxy Brown, Memphis Bleek, who have
more or less donated their work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one can argue that the last thing the world needs is a
series of novels for young people that glorify sex and mayhem. Or
one can argue that getting young people to read, whatever they
read, is an important end in itself. Whatever the argument, and
whatever one wants to make of these novels, the idea behind the
enterprise is being examined with both fascination and wariness by
some traditional publishers because there are plenty of other
interesting impudences about these books besides their content.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the books will be sold first not in bookstores,
but in record stores and clothing shops. And each book will contain
six or seven one-page color advertisements. Included in the first
novel is an advertisement for Saucony sneakers and one for L.L.
Cool J, as well as one for ``The Art of War,'' the latest movie
featuring Wesley Snipes (who is an investor in the publishing
company). Not since the early days of paperbacks have books carried
advertisements. Despite the book's violence, about 1,000 copies
have been shipped, so far, to prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Each novel will be about 6-by-6 inches, slightly larger than its
accompanying CD; each will have a shimmery cover with a parental
warning. Each will be about 150 to 160 pages and sell for $16.98,
book and CD.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the novels will be in stores next month. It is
``Street Sweeper'' by Ronin Ro, the author of ``Have Gun Will
Travel: The Spectacular Rise and Violent Fall of Death Row
Records'' (Doubleday, 1998). There are 50,000 copies of ``Street
Sweeper'' ready for distribution, the publisher said. The second
book, in January, will be ``The International/Assignment Hong
Kong'' by Antoine Black. The authors receive modest advances,
ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   How does one describe Jerome Usher, the protagonist in the first
novel? One part Richard Gere in ``American Gigolo,'' one part Sean
Connery as James Bond and one part an emotionless Wesley Snipes in
``The Art of War.'' Toss in a touch of ``Goodfellas.'' Then make
him bad and black, put a roll of $100 bills in his pocket and
provide a different woman nearly every night. Wow, what kid
wouldn't want to be Jerome? Still, Jerome becomes somewhat ennobled
in the end, showing an unanticipated moral resolve when he falls in
love, leading to a violent denouement, a recognizable scenario if
you watch enough music videos. The ending is just unclear enough
that if the book is a success perhaps the hit man will be back.
</P>
<P>
   The books are being published by [S) Affiliated, an imprint of
Syndicate Media Group, a small company in Los Angeles whose
president, Marc Gerald, is one of two whites involved in the
business. His previous experience in book publishing was as the
editor, from 1996 to 1999, of the Old School Books imprint at W.W.
Norton, which specialized in African-American suspense novels but
not hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments, of course, will center on whether reading this
stuff will encourage violence. Which is much the same debate that
surrounds rap music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only goal is to sell books to a readership that just
hasn't had books,'' Gerald said. ``They are not about the urban
realism people expect. They're about style and suspense and no more
violent than a Don Westlake or an Elmore Leonard novel.'' He argues
that anything that gets young people reading is probably positive,
almost regardless of its cultural virtue.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's not our burden to be responsible. Our burden is
to make people read, even if the books tread on dangerous ground.
Nobody asks white kids to read responsible books. People need a
first book to make them read more.'' Self-serving? Of course.
Gerald is a businessman, and just about anything that will sell
between covers, he'll consider publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But next year, to sort of balance things, Syndicate Media Group
plans to offer several series of nonfiction books, also aimed at
black urban youths. These books will be about self-help, finances,
about relationships, sexuality, mental health and faith and
spirituality. ``We'll tell young black men what Wall Street doesn't
want people to know about investing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's perhaps for the future. For now there are the novels, and
for many black parents these books are not necessarily a positive.
One African-American professional called them ``the literary
equivalent of a sugary soft drink.'' She said: ``They're diversions
that I don't think add anything to the understanding kids need of
the world or themselves. Kids need to learn good contemporary
writing and the classics. Pandering or dumbing down books for poor
black kids is offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Diggs, an African-American who heads the One World imprint
at Ballantine Books, said the whole enterprise ``doesn't sound like
anything new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to read Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim under the covers
when I was a teen-ager,'' she said. ``I don't think that's what I
should have been reading. This is the same wine in new bottles.
Would I want my daughter to read them? No, I want kids to read
substantial fare, enriching books.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly traditional publishing floods the world with books for
children and teen-agers. How many are aimed at young black readers?
That's for another column.

  With true commercial success, the mix master will stay afloat 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Sunday' refers to Sept. 24, 2000.) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't laugh, but Moby's got a whale of a hit on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the techno pioneer and direct descendent of ``Moby
Dick'' author Herman Melville was especially fishing for one with
his ubiquitous ``Play'' disc, which has sold millions around the
world and surfaced on a gang of TV commercials and film
soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the musician born Richard Melville Hall finished
the textural, sample-driven masterpiece, he assumed it would sink
into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. ``Play,'' an eclectic, often heart-tugging mix of
contemporary music styles blended with samples of Alan Lomax's
scratchy old field recordings of African-American folk, blues and
gospel, struck a nerve almost immediately upon release last year,
bringing Moby widespread critical praise, two Grammy nominations
and reaching platinum status in 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Songs from the album, including the gorgeous ``Porcelain,'' are
used in commercials for Nordstrom, American Express and Nissan,
along with the films ``Any Given Sunday,'' ``The Beach,'' ``The
Next Best Thing'' and ``Cecil B. Demented.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every one of ``Play's'' 18 tracks has been licensed for
commercial use. You'd be forgiven for saying the album has been
swallowed hook, line and sinker.
</P>
<P>
   Strange to think the disc probably wouldn't have seen the light
of day in the United States if not for the long commute between
Manhattan and Woodstock, N.Y., which was where V2 Records talent
scout Kate Hyman heard an early track on a college radio station
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing a 12-inch British import of (the album's
gospel- driven opening cut) `Honey,''' Hyman recalled. ``I pulled
over to the side of the road and called the station and found out
who it was and immediately called Moby's management.''
</P>
<P>
   Another label was already in the running for ``Play'' but wanted
Moby to go back and ``cut a single,'' Hyman said. In the end, V2,
the company, launched by ex-Virgin Records founder Richard Branson,
got the disc as is _ and then simply stood back and got out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea it would take off,'' said Moby, 33, who got his
nickname as a child. ``My favorite records are always destined for
obscurity. I'm thrilled by the success of 'Play.' I'm very proud of
the music I make. And if I have to watch TV commercials, I'd rather
hear my music than someone else's. I find it very flattering
because there's so much music that could be used. That they wanted
mine is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who never heard Moby's music before ``Play'' _ or have
only been exposed to the Amex commercial featuring Tiger Woods _
might think he's a new artist, but actually he's made interesting,
provocative records throughout the late '80s and '90s, consistently
confounding expectations by refusing to limit himself to any
particular style.
</P>
<P>
   Moby, who appears Sunday at the Greek Theatre, found himself
drawn to the energy of house music in the late '80s and his first
singles, ``Go,'' ``Drop a Beat'' and ``Next Is the E,'' were
staples of the early rave scene, soaring into the British charts.
</P>
<P>
   But Moby's music differed from the hedonistic sounds of modern
disco, and so did his lifestyle. He became known for his devout,
radical Christian beliefs, as well as his environmental and vegan
activism.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, with the release of his first true long-player,
``Everything Is Wrong,'' Moby's music had blossomed into a
multifaceted blend of styles, from house and jungle to rock and
thrash, often within a single track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play,'' however, goes much further. Recorded over a year's
time at his home studio in New York's Little Italy, the disc can be
divided into three sections. The first is built around Lomax's
field recordings, followed by tracks featuring Moby's own vocals,
followed in turn by reflective instrumental tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Moby not only wrote all the songs, but played all the
instruments and handled production and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dilettante about gospel and blues,'' Moby said. ``I
don't know anything about it, but I really like it. On a simple
emotional level, I find these field recordings very effective. When
I first heard them, I was so moved. They became the starting points
for the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The musician was born in New York and raised in Connecticut. His
father died when he was 2, and he was subsequently raised by his
open-minded mom, who encouraged him to pursue whatever creative
avenues appealed to him. That freedom led Moby to explore classical
guitar at age 10, followed by teen involvement in a series of
diverse rock, punk and new wave bands.
</P>
<P>
   V2's Hyman said that despite acclaim for ``Everything Is Wrong''
and the later ``Animal Rights'' (both on Moby's former label,
Elektra), there wasn't a great deal interest in signing the
performer early last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if most labels didn't even bother
listening to the advance tapes of 'Play,''' she said. ``People in
this business don't listen to records as much as they should. They
base their opinions on the last record they heard by the artist. Of
course, if they did listen to 'Play' and then turned it down,
that's even sadder. All I knew was it had to come out, and I wanted
to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The album has somehow connected on a cultural level. Still, it's
somewhat disconcerting when the best new music turns up as fodder
for TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case where radio didn't lead; it followed,'' Hyman
said. ``A lot of stations were forced to program 'Play' because it
just wasn't going away. It was getting under everyone's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the tracks radio has pounded are ``Porcelain,'' ``Honey,''
``Natural Blues'' and ``Bodyrock.'' Recently, Moby and longtime pal
Gwen Stefani of No Doubt recorded a duet for the ``Play'' track
``South Side,'' which will be available in November.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, more ads and film soundtracks will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially felt getting those songs used on commercials and
in movies was the only way to get people to hear the music,'' Moby
said. ``It was the only way to expose the music. I go along with
it, but I have a clause that says they're not allowed to use my
music to advertise meat products, tobacco or weapons. What's funny
is, every label that heard the album last year said it lacked
commercial potential because it didn't fit any format.''
</P>
<P>
   At sales of 5 million and counting worldwide, some people need
their ears examined. &QL;

 &HT;    Alarm sounded over trade deficits
 &HT;    By Matt Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Emory University business professor Jeffrey Rosensweig
is warning that continued record U.S. trade deficits run the risk
of ``selling America'' to foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote address to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce
2000 International Summit today, Rosensweig will report that one
reason for a global economy that is much stronger than anyone
predicted is that the United States has become ``buyer of last
resort'' of imported products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is we can't keep running record trade deficits
without running up new debt to foreigners,'' says Rosensweig,
director of the Global Perspectives Program and associate dean at
Emory's Goizueta Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't yet sold America but are so busy with our credit
cards buying luxury goods that we are falling into the trap of
selling America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, however, the bottom line is quite positive. The
United States is the leader in the new global economy, and
foreigners just keep lending to us and investing in us. This is
fueling our record economic expansion and job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only downside is they keep bidding up our U.S. dollar,
thereby making our goods and services expensive in global
competition. If we don't put away the credit cards, someday we will
have to pay the piper.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosensweig's advice to Georgia companies looking to diversify is
to export products and services to countries like Mexico and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to economic reform and the North American Free Trade
Agreement, the Mexican economy is strong and able to purchase U.S.
products, he said. Korea's currency has been strengthening since
1998 ``and its economy is on a tear.''

&HT;     MANY VOTERS UNCOMFORTABLE BY RELIGION IN POLITICS, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although seven in ten voters say it is important
for politicians to have strong religious beliefs, half report they
are ``uncomfortable'' when political figures talk about their
faith, according to a study released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report was sponsored by two think tanks here, the Pew
Research Center and The Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The study asked 1,999 registered voters to say if they agreed
with the statements ``it's important to me that a president have
strong religious beliefs'' and ``it makes me uncomfortable when
politicians talk about how religious they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were asked between Aug. 24 and Sept. 10, in the
weeks after Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut became the
Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee, the first Jew on a
major-party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been widely praised and criticized for his
unabashed religious references and allusions to a higher power on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   During his acceptance speech, he invoked God a dozen times.
Later, in a speech to the Fellowship Chapel Church in Detroit, he
called on Americans to ``renew the dedication of our nation and
ourselves to God.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, a
Jewish organization that fights anti-Semitism, urged Lieberman to
stop ``hawking'' his religious beliefs and asked him to tone down
his expressions of faith, calling them ``inappropriate and even
unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, evangelical Christians applauded his willingness to
invoke God while campaigning. The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman
of the Traditional Values Coalition, a religious right
organization, said after the attacks that ``we are granting him an
honorary status as an evangelical Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the study, John Green, head of the University of
Akron's Institute of Applied Politics, said that Americans ``like
their politicians to be religious because it symbolizes good values
and good moral character. But on the other hand, they don't want
their politicians to be sectarian. When people talk a lot about
their faith, it often comes across as proselytizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Green noted that because Lieberman's religion does not seek to
proselytize, his discussion of faith may be more palatable to
voters than comments by evangelical Christians, who are encouraged
to seek converts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Green said, because Jews make up such a small percentage
of the population _ about 3 percent _ frank discussions of faith by
Jewish candidates might be viewed as less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a
conservative think tank here, said, ``Evangelicals are impressed
with Lieberman.'' He characterized their view as: ``We just want
somebody to say there's some transcendant reference point in their
life. I'll take that person seriously, even though I may disagree
with him theologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelicals have charged that an unfair double standard
allows Lieberman's public expressions of faith but stifles those of
Republican presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush.

   During a debate among Republican presidential candidates in
December, Bush said Jesus was his favorite political philosopher,
adding that he is a born-again Christian and Jesus has changed his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a number of liberal organizations and press
pundits criticized his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore also took some flak,
although milder, after saying he was guided by the phrase, ``What
would Jesus do?'' when making important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public's reactions have been mixed, Green said,
declarations of faith are a clear way that politicians can
``demonstrate their morality.'' In a campaign where candidates are
trying to distance themselves from President Clinton and ``scandal
in high places,'' voters can expect more religious rhetoric, Green
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When candidates want to demonstrate they are not part of that
mess in Washington, one way to do it is to talk about their
faith,'' he added. ``It's a language most Americans understand.''

   BOEING-AIRBUS (Seattle) _ Boeing has won more orders this year
than in all of 1999, when it was badly beaten for the first time
ever by Airbus. Boeing seems certain to finish ahead of Airbus this
time. But the aerospace giant could end up with more orders than
Airbus and still find itself in the shadow of its European rival,
industry analysts say.

not a man built for regret. And why should he be? Banners

both of which cancer spent years trying to take from him.

 &HT;    CLINTONS ARE CLEARED IN $52 MILLION WHITEWATER PROBE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Robert Ray concluded a six-year
investigation Wednesday of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton without charging either one with wrongdoing in the
Whitewater land development affair.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement wrapping up the $52-million inquiry, Ray said his
probe had produced ``insufficient'' evidence to warrant formal
charges against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Ray confirmed that they were investigated for allegations of
lying under oath and obstructing justice in connection with an
Arkansas land development venture that pre-dated Clinton's election
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry looked at whether the Clintons were involved with
improper loans allegedly made to the Whitewater development company
by troubled financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Except for certain pending matters not involving the Clintons,
the federal Whitewater inquiry is closed, said Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either President or
Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct,'' Ray
stated in a summary report of his findings issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence relating to their testimony and conduct in
connection with this investigation, and other investigations
involving the same entities, was also, in the judgment of this
office, insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
that either of them committed any criminal offense, including
perjury or obstruction of justice,'' the report continued.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusion effectively cleared the Clintons of allegations
that have dogged them for six years and that the president has
angrily denounced as ``bogus from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   A new federal grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence
from Ray's office stemming from Clinton's involvement with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Ray's office will determine,
after Clinton leaves office in January, whether to seek an
indictment against Clinton as a result of those investigations.
</P>
<P>
   While walking through the White House Rose Garden with visiting
Italian Prime Minister Guiliano Amato, Clinton ignored a reporter's
question on the Whitewater findings hours after Ray released his
report. He left it to his press secretary, Joe Lockhart, to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Ray is now the latest investigator to complete an
examination of the transactions related to Whitewater Development
Company and conclude there are no grounds for legal action,''
Lockhart said in a prepared statement he read to reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   An equally restrained Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in New York
state for a U.S. Senate seat, said she hoped the Whitewater case
could now be set aside as voters consider whether to back her in
elections seven weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that this is finally over,'' she said during a
news conference with New York reporters from the Associated Press.
``Now everybody can just move on and be focused on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater investigation has provided a distracting backdrop
to six years of Clinton's presidency and has lent an air of scandal
to much of his time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has railed against that impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all know that the Whitewater thing was bogus from day
one,'' Clinton told reporters during an East Room news conference
on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'scandal' has been thrown around here like a clanging
teapot for seven years,'' he went on, adding that ``a whole bunch
of this stuff was just garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions of the Independent Counsel's investigators
appeared to provide legal justification for at least part of those
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the legal effect of an exoneration,'' said
Bruce Yannett, a former prosecutor in the Independent Counsel's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it is remarkable that it took the independent counsel
this long to come to a conclusion and to issue its report on this
aspect of the investigation,'' said Yannett, a partner in the New
York law firm Debevoise and Plimpton.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' role in the Whitewater company and related bank
dealings were the subject of a congressional inquiry as well as an
investigation by the Resolution Trust Corp., set up to help the
federal government resolve hundreds of billions of dollars in
claims tied to bankruptcies in the savings and loan industry.
</P>
<P>
   Neither inquiry resulted in any formal charges being filed
against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into the Whitewater affair have resulted, though,
in convictions of at least a dozen people. They include former
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker; the Clintons' former associates, Jim
and Susan McDougal, and; former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations surrounding the Clintons concerned the
Whitewater Development Corp., a speculative real estate venture in
Arkansas; the Madison Guaranty Savings And Loan Association and
Capital Management Services, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office looked into a number of questions stemming from
allegations that improper loans were made to Whitewater from the
the financial institutions. Madison Guaranty eventually went
bankrupt in a failure that federal regulators said cost U.S.
taxpayers $73 million.

WHAT A CHICA WANTS? A BIGGER FAN BASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Aguilera's first all-Spanish effort has just arrived
in music stores everywhere, she's on a major tour of arenas and
state fairs, and her self-titled debut, having sold more than 7
million copies, is still in the top 20 more than a year after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say synergy? Aguilera is a cute little teen-ager who has
been extremely well-marketed, and this CD is a not-too-shabby bid
to cement her popularity among Hispanics and all over Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Mi Reflejo'' (My Reflection) couldn't come at a better
time: Aguilera is hanging tough in the marketplace; it's basically
her and Britney Spears neck-and-neck in the Cute Pop Singer
sweepstakes, the prize being untold millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera and her handlers are very smart in making this move,
because (thanks to Aguilera's dad being from Ecuador and her
hearing Spanish in the home as a kid) she can easily pull this off,
and because an all-Spanish-language CD is something we can't
imagine Ms. Spears doing.
</P>
<P>
   By recasting five of her biggest hits _ ``Genie in a Bottle,
Come On Over, I Turn to You, What a Girl Wants'' and ``Reflection''
_ Aguilera is wooing an enormous new audience, something that will
pay her major dividends in the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   And, honestly, ``Mi Reflejo'' is on par with her debut, the
difference being that this time there are, of course, Spanish
lyrics and a couple of salsas to go along with the slick,
squeaky-clean pop with which she's made her name.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera handles the Spanish vocals fairly well, even though she
clearly doesn't have the mastery of phrasing of someone who grew up
singing mainly in Spanish. This becomes obvious on the ``Pero Me
Acuerdo De Ti'' and ``Por Siempre Tu,'' neither of which is all
that impressive. The CD's lone duet, ``Si No Te Hubiera Conocido''
(with Luis Fonsi) is better.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, then, Reflejo'' does what it sets out to do: gives
the Hispanic audience its own versions of her major hits, adds in a
little spice, and gives her the chance to become a major player in
Latin music. The inevitable Christmas CD, ``My Kind of Christmas,''
is due Oct. 29. &QL;

   ``Shattered'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Dick Francis &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mystery &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, $25.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't know that the author of ``Shattered'' was the
esteemed Dick Francis, I'd be pondering a bigger mystery than the
one I just read _ namely, how did this even get published?
</P>
<P>
   Francis, of course, is the jockey-turned-novelist, author of
more than 40 mysteries, most of them wildly successful. Apparently,
his name on the cover is enough to validate the publication of just
about anything. No matter that he seems to have run out of ideas,
or that he apparently just phoned this one in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shattered's'' improbable plot, such as it is, turns on the
death of jockey Martin Stukely, who is thrown off his mount during
a race on New Year's Eve. After his apparently accidental death, a
mysterious videotape finds its way into the hands of Stukely's good
friend, glass blower Gerard Logan. The tape is soon stolen, and
Logan begins a dangerous search for it, battling a band of shadowy
characters and abetted by a band of only slightly less mysterious
allies. Problem is, when you learn why the tape is being so hotly
pursued, it doesn't seem particularly plausible. Most readers will
also anticipate the ``surprise'' plot twists well before they
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, though, isn't the worst of it; that would be the
paper-thin characters. We learn little about Logan's police-officer
love interest beyond the fact she likes leather jackets and rides a
motorcycle. The villains are cartoonishly evil, without any
redeeming qualities. Luckily for Logan, they also prove inept at
almost every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he has exhausted his horse-racing themes,
Francis uses the racetrack only as a backdrop. He goes into much
more detail about the art and science of Logan's profession, glass
blowing. He has researched it well, and the tidbits gleaned about
the art are among the most interesting portions of the book. But
that, even combined with a couple of amusing minor characters and
Francis' lean prose, can't save ``Shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, Dick Francis has written some mysteries
that make him, if not the genius he was anointed by the ``Los
Angeles Times,'' at least well worth reading. Try one of his
earlier titles instead of ``Shattered.'' &QL;

TRANSLATION OF CUBAN MISERIES IS A RAW LOOK AT REAL LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 OF SUMMER-BOOKREVIEW-TEX  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By STEPHEN G. MICHAUD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Color of Summer, or, The New Garden of Earthly Delights'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Reinaldo Arenas, translated by Andrew Hurley &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Viking, $28.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reinaldo Arenas' world was wild, often ugly, and full of
extremes. Raised in dire poverty by his abandoned mother in rural
eastern Cuba, Arenas received a haphazard formal education. Yet,
somehow, his creativity was ignited. Arenas matured into a
Rabelaisian figure with an incandescent talent with which he, more
than any other writer, illuminated the terror, lies, meanness and
banality of Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In his posthumously published autobiography, ``Before Night
Falls,'' Arenas painted a horrific portrait of his mid-1970s
imprisonment on morals charges in the infamous Morro Castle prison
on Havana Bay. Physically assaulted, degraded and nearly starved to
death (Arenas learned to supplement the prison diet by catching and
eating sparrows), he was at the same time becoming an international
literary celebrity. Artists and intellectuals around the world
pressed the Castro government for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas tried twice to escape to the United States. He finally
made it to south Florida as part of the 1980 Mariel boat lift; a
police psychologist ``diagnosed'' his homosexuality and approved
his departure with the rest of the island's ``undesirables.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, at age 47, in the last stages of AIDS, Arenas took his
own life in New York City. In a farewell note, he blamed his
disease on Castro _ an artful and characteristically witty touch.
</P>
<P>
   Given this personal history and the evidence of the previously
published parts of his five-book ``pentagony,'' as he called it _
particularly ``Singing From the Well'' and ``The Palace of the
White Skunks'' _ it is no surprise that ``Color of Summer, or, The
New Garden of Earthly Delights'' surveys a world where Wilde,
Genet, Borges and, most definitely, Divine, all would recognize the
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Much happens in this translation by Andrew Hurley that defies
explication in a family newspaper. Much is repetitive, obsessive,
undisciplined and wearying. Even as his death approached, Arenas
wrote with such uncouth ferocity that I doubt ``Color'' will ever
appear in an audio edition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a raw, original power in this sprawling epic. Told
from multiple points of view, the novel begins with an outlandish
50-page theater piece, part Marx brothers, part Grand Guignol, all
X-rated, in which the author clearly was out to even some old
scores, particularly with Castro _ called ``Fifo'' _ and his
brother, ``Raul Kastro.'' The former is a goaty megalomaniac, the
latter a drag queen.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas, who calls himself ``Skunk in a Funk'' throughout,
describes ``Color of Summer'' as ``a grotesque and satirical (and
therefore realistic) portrait of an aging tyranny, and the tyrant
himself, the apotheosis of horror; it recounts the struggles and
intrigues that go on around the tyrant (who is aided and abetted by
the hypocrisy, cowardice, frivolity, and opportunism of the
powerful of the world), the attitude of not taking anything very
seriously in order to go on surviving, and sex as the immediate
means of escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenas accomplishes his effect via dream sequences, epistolary
interludes, parables, straight narrative, many (mostly obscene)
tongue twisters and, more than halfway into the book, his
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to note that (this) is not a linear work, but
circular,'' he notes in rare recourse to understatement, ``and
therefore cyclonic, with a vortex or eye _ the Carnival _ toward
which all the vectors whirl.''
</P>
<P>
   There are bacchanals and debaucheries to make Caligula blush.
Intercut are scenes of touching, sometimes angry, empathy for all
the world's freaks and misfits, stories clearly based on Arenas'
direct experience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is the sad and appalling tale of a literal
lunatic in the Morro prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loco'' bays and whimpers with each full moon. Over the years,
he also has filled a large vat with water, bit by bit, using an
eyedropper. When the vessel at last is full, ``Loco'' explains to
Skunk in a Funk, it's at last time ``to go to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   He builds a fire around the vat, climbs in and cooks himself.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, Skunk in a Funk finds the dead Loco curled
underwater in the fetal position: ``On his face was the placid
expression of a child who, cradled by his mother, had just fallen
off to sleep. At that, Skunk in a Funk realized that the man had
flown off to the moon, for his smile was not of this world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Color of Summer'' is a difficult book, and not a perfect one;
but it rewards reader perseverance, and emphasizes what a rare,
wonderful talent Reinaldo Arenas was.

BUSH CONTINUES ATTACK ON GORE'S CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George W. Bush brought the hopes of his presidential
campaign to the bright lights of New York City Wednesday, mocking
Al Gore along the way as an actor for criticizing Hollywood titans
about entertainment violence and later taking their money at a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his attack on the Democratic nominee's credibility,
Bush said: ``It seems like he must be auditioning for a Broadway
play because he keeps changing his tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the week, he sounded awfully tough on
Hollywood. He talked about `six months' (to make reforms) and
sanctions. He talked tough language. After a couple of
fund-raisers, he's changing his tune. He's going out there to
Hollywood to collect some money,'' Bush said at an appearance en
route to New York in Perrysville, Pennsylvania.

   The Republican nominee was reacting to the Democratic ticket's
tepid criticism of the entertainment industry Monday night at a
fund-raiser in Beverly Hills. The $4.2 million donated was a record
for a political fund-raiser at a private home. Among the 300 guests
were actors such as Tom Hanks and studio executives such as Jeffrey
Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will nudge you, but we will never become censors,'' Gore's
running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman, told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president mentioned the ``controversy of the previous
week,'' but avoided any talk of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in reaction to a Federal Trade Commission report
about violence in children's movies and video games, Lieberman had
told a Senate committee that he and Gore would take action against
industry executives who did not reform their practices within six
months. After that, Gore pledged to seek sanctions through
legislation or regulatory action.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of anti-Hollywood hypocrisy was Bush's second sharp
rebuke of the vice president this week. On Monday, Bush, in the
wake of a Globe report, pounced on the vice president for telling a
campaign audience that his mother-in-law paid nearly three times as
much to buy the same prescription arthitis medication as the family
pays for its dog Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign later admitted the details were lifted not
from the family's medical bills, but a House Democratic study of
presription drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in an interview Monday: ``I have been always concerned
about Vice President Gore's willingness to exaggerate in order to
become elected. He's exaggerated about my record for a long period
of time. Now he's exaggerating about family members of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that same day, Gore recalled for a Teamsters audience in
Las Vegas about being raised on union lullabies, singing out,
``Look for the union label.'' The popular song was not written
until 1975, when Gore was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, before a crowd in the Great Hall in suburban
Pittsburgh, Bush returned to the Hollywood theme, saying it was
time to ``call in these captains of the entertainment industry and
explain to them loud and clear that our country can do a better job
of raising our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kym Spell said it was Bush and his running mate
Dick Cheney who were being hypocritical -- in their case, on the
subject of oil prices. During an appearance Wednesday in
Perrysville, Pa., Bush told one questioner that the nations in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must increase crude
oil production to reduce gasoline prices in the United States. Last
year, while still head of the oil services company Halliburton,
Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, told a group of oil executives
that reduced production levels would help companies such as his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for the big oil ticket to decide. Do they
want oil production increased, as Governor Bush now says, or
reduced as Dick Cheney previously urged?'' Spell said.
</P>
<P>
   As to the fund-raising charge, she said: ``What the vice
president did was to provide leadership after he took a look at the
FTC report. He took that message out to Hollywood. I think what
would be hypocritical would be if he took money from a group and
supported policies they wanted us to support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's stated focus of the day was his proposal to reduce the
so-called marriage penalty that occurs when working couples end up
paying more taxes as newlyweds than they paid as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The governor highlighted one couple, Dan Steele and Vicky
Trybend of Castle Shannon, Pa., who will be married the day after
Thanksgiving. The 28-year-olds face an additional joint filing
burden of $996, but under Bush's proposal to restore the 10 percent
deduction for two-income married couples, their extra tax would be
only $91.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a $500 billion package of tax cuts targeted at
the middle class, including marriage penalty relief, but Steele and
Trybend would only see their bill fall 40 percent under the Gore
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cast the difference between him and Gore in a larger,
philosophical light.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vision of government is it's the role of Washington to
pick and choose winners and losers, the `right people' I presume,
the wrong people,'' the governor said. ``That's not the way I view
the role of government. I think government needs to be fair,
even-handed. I don't think they ought to play favorites.''

ANNUAL BOEING-AIRBUS BATTLE COULD GO DOWN TO THE WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With more than three months left in 2000, The Boeing
Co. has already won more orders for new airplanes than in all of
1999, when it was badly beaten for the first time ever by Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has a lead of more than 100 orders and looks to finish
comfortably ahead of Airbus this year as it reclaims all-important
bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the aerospace giant could end up with more orders than
Airbus and still find itself in the shadow of its European rival,
industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   That's because several of the year's most important order
campaigns have yet to be decided. Still to come are crucial
showdowns that pit the Airbus A3XX super jumbo against Boeing's
proposed 100-passenger stretch of its venerable 747 jumbo jet, as
well as the long-range Airbus A340-500/600 against Boeing's
long-range 777X.
</P>
<P>
   To use an election-year analogy, Boeing could win the popular
vote but lose the electoral count and the election.
</P>
<P>
   Or Boeing could win both votes in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most significant battle still being fought is in
Asia, where Singapore Airlines, the region's most profitable and
influential carrier, is expected to announce by October whether it
will buy the A3XX, Boeing's 747X Stretch, or both.
</P>
<P>
   An order from Singapore Airlines would be worth its weight in
marketing gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick a key campaign, this is it,'' said Joe
Campbell, aerospace analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the big one,'' agreed Richard Aboulafia, senior
aviation analyst with the Teal Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore unquestionably represents the biggest single
up-front customer for any new big aircraft, and many airlines
follow its procurement decisions,'' Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   Another key battleground is in Australia, where Qantas is
considering proposals from Boeing and Airbus to upgrade its fleet
of 37 Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Qantas has an all-Boeing fleet and any inroads by Airbus there
would be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the battles that I had hoped to see Boeing and Airbus
duke it out for this year, very few have actually been decided,''
Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of battles, however insignificant, have been won
and lost this year.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 12, Boeing had 386 firm orders for the year. Airbus,
which updates it orders monthly, had 262 firm orders at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a significant rebound for Boeing, which won only
332 firm orders in 1999 to 476 for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Web site lists 391 new orders in 1999. But the figure
is misleading because it includes planes ordered in 1998 and in
1997. In December of last year, Boeing decided that for the first
time it would begin to count orders from customers who did not want
to be identified. So Boeing added 163 such orders to its 1999
totals. But 59 of those were actually placed the previous two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus had been running neck and neck in new orders
this year until late June, when Boeing pulled away with an order
from Southwest for 94 single-aisle 737s. Since then, Airbus has
fallen further behind.
</P>
<P>
   Of Boeing's 386 orders this year, more than 325 are for its
narrow-body jets, the 737 and 757.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look at the rest of the year, most of the narrow-body
orders have probably already been placed,'' said Campbell of Lehman
Brothers. ``The narrow-body battle really doesn't mean all that
much. Boeing and Airbus are splitting the market. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind,'' he added, ``the issue is what is going to happen
in these big-airplane campaigns that have not yet been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as Qantas and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In the Qantas campaign, Airbus is pitching its A340, including
the long range A340-500 and A340-600 now under development. Boeing
is offering the 777, including the long-range 777-200X and
777-300X.
</P>
<P>
   As with the pending Singapore orders, the industry is closely
watching Qantas and the duel between the 777X and the A340-500/600.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two crucial markets that have not yet been decided _
the 777X vs. the A340-500/600, and the A3XX vs. the 747X Stretch,''
Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet seen the market firmly make a statement (on
those planes), and it would be nice to see that happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Qantas is also considering the A3XX and 747X Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing is trying to interest Qantas in the
747-400X. This plane would be the same size as the 416-passenger
747-400 but would be able to carry more fuel in an auxiliary tank
in the forward cargo hold, with the option of a second tank.
</P>
<P>
   That additional fuel is important to airlines such as Qantas
that use 747-400s on long-haul routes against winter headwinds.
Often, these jumbo jets are flying with fewer than 300 passengers
because they would not have enough range to reach their
destinations with a full load of passengers and fuel. And that
means lost revenue to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The 747-400X would use the stronger wing from the 747-400
freighter and would have an increased takeoff weight of 910,000
pounds, about 35,000 more pounds than the 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   And the 747-400X could be flying by 2002, about three years
sooner than the 747X Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he believes there will be a strong market for the
747-400X.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about seats, it's about range,'' he said. ``A bunch
of people are going to buy this plane.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Singapore may order the 747-400X.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Waggener, Boeing's deputy director of product marketing,
said Singapore, at least for now, seems focused on the A3XX and
747X Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Singapore announced its interest in buying 10 of the
555-passenger A3XX jets from Airbus, plus six options.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Boeing has mounted an all-out offensive to sell the
carrier on a stretch version of its jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's intense competition between the two manufacturers,''
Rick Clements, the airline's vice president for public affairs,
told reporters at a conference this month in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia, the industry analyst, believes Airbus has more riding
on the Singapore order than does Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the airline goes with the A3XX, Airbus has merely scored a
tactical and necessary victory,'' Aboulafia said. ``But if it goes
with Boeing, the A3XX is in trouble, and possibly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not go so far as to say it's a make or break deal for
the A3XX, but it is very important,'' Campbell said. ``A lot of
people will be watching. The decision will influence a larger group
of airlines, and in that context it is more important than the
actual size of the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines operates more than 50 Boeing 747-400s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the 747X Stretch would be a natural fit there,''
said Larry Dickenson, Boeing's senior vice president of sales who
led a Boeing delegation that quickly visited the airline after it
publicly signaled interest in the A3XX earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has not signed any customers for its 747X Stretch, even
though Chairman Phil Condit has said he expects the plane to be
launched by the second quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines could be the key launch customer for the
Boeing plane.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has said it hopes to launch the A3XX by the end of the
year, if it can get 40 to 50 firm orders. Airbus signed memorandums
of understanding with three airlines for a total of 22 A3XXs at the
Farnborough air show outside London in July.
</P>
<P>
   Pending a formal launch, Emirates ordered seven planes, Air
France 10 and International Lease Finance Corp. agreed to buy five.
</P>
<P>
   The heated Singapore competition is not just between the A3XX
and the 747X Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus have both submitted proposals to replace
Singapore's aging fleet of 15 Airbus A310-300 widebody planes,
which were delivered in 1982. Those jets seat 184 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is not expected to make a decision on the
replacement order until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Singapore Airlines has been a master at playing
Airbus and Boeing off each other to get the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very clever buyer,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Singapore will end up ordering both the A3XX and the
747 Stretch, along with some 777s.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will be paying close attention to the breakdown of the
Singapore orders.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline buys only a handful of A3XXs, that would not be
seen as a ringing endorsement for the double-decker Airbus plane,
Campbell said. But a firm order for 10 or more of the big jets
would go a long way toward establishing the A3XX as a formidable
competitor to the 747.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see a big number (of A3XXs ordered) it will certainly
raise eyebrows,'' Campbell said. ``If you see a small number,
people will question how Airbus can ever get this plane launched.
If these important carriers commit to the 747X Stretch, then they
are sending a message that the A3XX is a niche plane for them. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be either be very small niche product, or over time
the 747 is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing were up $2.29, or 4 percent, to close at $59.06
on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday.

 &HT;    As swimming winds down, focus turns to Jones' attempt to win
five gold medals
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Now that the Torpedo is about to hop out of the pool,
the focus of the Sydney Games shifts from Ian Thorpe to the oval
track and Marion Jones' quest for five gold medals. Can she go
where no woman in Olympic history has dared to venture?
</P>
<P>
   Considering all she's taking on, the logical answer is no. But
this isn't an ordinary Matilda, as the Aussie are known to call
women, and Jones catches a break with Inger Miller injured and out
of at least the 100 meters. Not that the Southern Cal sprinter
figured to take gold, but the heat is turned down a tad with her on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Marion Jones show opens Friday with the first two rounds of
the 100 meters. All told, over eight days, the former North
Carolina point guard is likely to run at least 10 races and also
have qualifying and finals in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very concerned about the physical fatigue because I
know that I am in the best shape of my life,'' said Jones, who
broke down after three events in a dry run at last summer's World
Championships. ``Mentally, it is going to be very interesting
getting to that last day and really seeing where it is going to
take me, but I am not concerned in the least bit if I am going to
be pumped up ready to go. I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't first crumble to the track, as Maurice Greene and
Michael Johnson did at the Olympic trials this summer, the
24-year-old appears a cinch to handle the sprint field. She and her
U.S. teammates are certain to at least chase gold in the two
relays, though the dream could end with the drop of a baton. Where
it turns dicey is the long jump, where Jones remains short on
technique and long on speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fly is she's a sprinter who long jumps, not a long
jumper who is a sprinter,'' offered John Chaplin, the U.S. men's
Olympic coach. ``Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis were long jumpers who
sprinted. ``
</P>
<P>
   Here's a glimpse at some of the potential pitfalls that lurk
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   100 METERS
</P>
<P>
   Only the late Florence Griffith-Joyner has run faster, and Jones
hasn't lost at 100 or 200 meters since the close of the 1997
season. The field is without luster after two-time Olympic champ
Gail Devers failed to qualify in the sprint and Miller withdrew
from the event. Her chief threat could be her training partner in
Raleigh, Chandra Sturrup, who represents the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I put together the race I know is quite possible
I'll be difficult to beat,'' Jones said. ``I am not invincible, but
I am on the top of my game . . . running fast and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Solid gold. A breeze with Inger Miller on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   200
</P>
<P>
   Here again, Miller's hamstring injury works in the favor of
Jones. She still holds out hope of running the 200, but Miller
obviously has had to back off her training and has yet to beat
Jones, even on a good day.
</P>
<P>
   A sleeper could be former University of Georgia sprinter Debbie
Ferguson, who performed particularly well in the early European
season. But it would be a huge upset if Ferguson or anyone else
prevailed, unless Jones were to be injured or suffer a horrendous
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any woman on this earth would ever beat her, then that
person would be sitting real good as far as the publicity and
everything else,'' said Ferguson, representing the Bahamas. `` It's
a big thing. It does get you all riled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Solid gold. Only Miller can come close, if healthy.
</P>
<P>
   LONG JUMP
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy, hold on tight. Jones has the potential to flirt with the
world record or see her dreams go up in smoke. She messed around
with her technique early in the season, but after mixed results
she's back to a choppy run-up followed by a jarring landing.
</P>
<P>
   But she's beaten everyone in the field at some point, and could
do so again if she nails a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long jump actually is very special to me because it is the
big question,'' Jones acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Iffy. Unless she pops big one, Fiona May of Italy and
Russia's Tatyana Kotova probably vie for gold.
</P>
<P>
   400 RELAY
</P>
<P>
   Here's where her archrival's injury is a pain, if Miller can't
run the relay or if she does and pulls up lame. Another dicey issue
is clean exchanges of the baton, which the U.S. men have known to
struggle with.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas won last year's world championship (Jones didn't
run), and they've been eyeing a chance to beat the Americans at the
Olympics. ``They have a pretty good team, but if you much up our
times we're faster,'' Ferguson said. ``Speed-wise, we have the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Good bet. The Bahamas a close second.
</P>
<P>
   1600 RELAY
</P>
<P>
   Jones hasn't run the 1600-meter relay since her sophomore year
at North Carolina, but she earned a spot running a 49.59 for 400
meters early in the season. She'll probably run the third leg, and
the Germans and Russians will also be running for gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to come down to that last event,'' she
said. ``Hopefully, I will be at four gold medals already, and be
trying to obtain my fifth and I am going to be definitely running
on adrenaline and sometimes that will take you far.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Too close to call. A definite medal, with Jones running
on fumes.

   With seven gold medals, more than any woman in U.S. Olympic
history, swimmer Jenny Thompson will try to get her first gold in
an individual event. But it will take a tremendous effort in the
100 -meter freestyle to upset world record holder Inge de Brujin of
the Netherlands. American Dara Torres is also in the finals. The
prospects of gold are much better for American Lenny Krayzelburg in
the men's 200 -meter backstroke, in which he holds the world's
record. Women's gymnastics returns to prime time on NBC with the
individual all-around finals. Amy Chow, Elise Ray and Kristen
Maloney are the Americans in the competition, but the favorites
include Russians Svetlana Khorkina and Yelena Produnova. In the
late-night hour, Marietta's Shareef Abdur-Rahim will join his
fellow NBA stars for a basketball romp against Lithuania, although
the U.S.-Yugoslavia match in men's volleyball figures to be more
competitive. But the day's most compelling matchup may be in
softball on MSNBC. The U.S. women have lost two straight and now
must try to snap out of their slump against Australia, considered
the Americans' biggest rival.

 &HT;    UGA prof doubts elections can force Milosevic out
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - University of Georgia professor Bill Ragland has
traveled throughout the Balkans for more than a decade, including
frequent visits during the wars that accompanied the breakup of the
former Yugoslavia. Now, Ragland is back, doing research in Croatia.
Ragland, 66, is a professor of avian medicine, pathology and
medical microbiology and parasitology. He is working with the
Division of Molecular Medicine at Rudjer Boskovic Institute in
Zagreb. But his rarefied specialty has not stopped him from keenly
observing the events transforming the societies around him.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest story in the region at the moment is the election
campaign now unfolding in Serbia and Montenegro, the last two
republics remaining in Yugoslavia. Just days before Sunday's
election, Ragland interrupted his research in Croatia to answer
questions about the region. An excerpt, edited from his comments,
follows:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the breakup of the old Yugoslavia into independent
nations been a good thing overall?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but if the West had behaved better, it would not have
been so traumatic. I think the West knew there would be a war,
actually several wars, and there may be another. The West probably
thought Serbia would win quickly, and the West preferred to deal
with one large country rather than many small ones. ... Yugoslavia
always was an artificial country, as the Sudan and some others are.
It was a good idea, fine in theory but poor in (practice). Here I
lay most of the blame at the feet of Serbia. ``Yugoslavia'' to most
Serbs was the same as ``Serbia.'' Revenues from all republics went
to Belgrade, and only a part was returned to the republics. ...
Slovenia and Croatia were being bled financially, and Serbia
benefited from their hegemony. This is what broke up Yugoslavia.
The Croats were going slowly, trying to avoid conflict, and planned
to give ``Yugoslavia'' another year, but the Slovenes had clearer
vision. When Slovenia said they would not wait and would declare
independence, Croatia decided not to be left behind. Then the war
started. It is unfortunate Bosnia did not declare with them because
Bosnia's failure gave Serbia time to prepare for the rape and
murder of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Elections are scheduled in Serbia and Montenegro on Sunday,
and, in the polls, Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic is trailing
the opposition. What are you hearing about the likely outcome?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows for sure, but almost ... (no one believes) for a
minute that Milosevic will concede. The opposition will get the
majority vote, but Milosevic controls the count, and he probably
will be declared the winner. If not, we expect a putsch. The Hague
has indicted him (as a war criminal). He has nowhere to go. He must
stay in power at any cost. He has cleansed his own crowd, and he is
surrounded by fellow criminals who need him as much as he needs
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would the Balkans be more stable without Milosevic in power?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many say (challenger Vojislav) Kostunica is honest and a
sincere man, but he has not condemned the atrocities perpetrated
mostly by Serbs against others in the Balkans. His private feelings
may be different, but we do not know. Until the Serbs change in
their view of themselves and their relations with others, there
will not be stability in that part of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The relationship between Serbia and Montenegro is tenuous,
and many people fear another war could flare there. Would an
independent Montenegro be a viable state?
</P>
<P>
   A: We believe that when Milosevic ``wins'' or takes control, and
the West wrings its hands in typical fashion, he will turn on
Montenegro and they will have a war. The West may say they will not
let it happen, but they will not prevent it. The Montenegrins are
fierce tribal people, but a large percent of their population is
retired Serb military. The war will be strongly contested and I
have no opinion who will win. (But) yes (Montenegro could be a
viable state). There are about 500,000 people in Montenegro. It is
a poor country with little industry but a magnificent coast and
majestic mountains. It will never be a rich country, but that is
not the question. Viability depends on the quality of government.
San Marino, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Luxembourg and Monaco are
smaller, and they are stable, some even rather prosperous.
Montenegro would have to be content to be a city state, but even
Slovenia with its 2 million is basically a city state and a good
one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: International efforts are still under way to stabilize Bosnia
and Kosovo. Bosnia seems to have progressed toward a measure of
stability. Do you see any happy outcome in Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kosovo (Kosova in Albanian) is still a hot spot. No one is
willing to say it, but the only viable solution is independence.
... The problem will be in
</P>
<P>
   assuring fair treatment for the minorities, the Serbs and
Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there other potential hot spots?
</P>
<P>
   A: As long as the Macedonians and (ethnic) Albanians can get
along together there will be no major trouble in Macedonia. ...
Vojvodina (a province of Serbia) is a problem that has been ignored
too long. Milosevic simply and illegally revoked their (autonomous)
status, as he did in Kosova. ... At least, the people of Vojvodina
should have a referendum on their status, and Serbia should not
conduct it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell us a little about your life in Croatia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always felt comfortable in Central Europe. My
attraction to Croatia was not because it was exotic, but familiar.
The trams, people walking the streets, open green markets, dinner
later in the evening than in the U.S., certain courtesies ...
reminded me of the Richmond, Va., of my youth. There were
differences, of course. Richmond did not have coffeehouses and
sidewalk cafes. Croatia did not have the racial problems, although
there were, and still are, some ethnic reservations. ... Zagreb is
a city of more than 1 million. It is more than 900 years old. The
old part resembles Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how would you characterize those ``ethnic reservations?''
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to emphasize Croatia, especially Zagreb, is a diverse
society. While there are ethnic reservations, much like the
reservations Southerners and Yankees, or Easterners and Westerners
once had, the representations that there is a great deal of ethnic
prejudice and discrimination is an exaggeration. I work with Serbs,
Albanians, Slovenes and others without difficulty. My housekeeper
is a Serb from Bosnia. We have no problems, and she apparently has
no problems living here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you characterize the level of democracy in Croatia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not think Croatia is any less democratic than the U.S.
We had an open and free election. The former government used its
influence to restrict access to the press by the opposition, but it
was only partially successful. ... The opposition won, and we had a
smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What role should the United States be playing in the region?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the U.S. should back the U.N. and The Hague. The best
would be to get Milosevic and his gang and prevent him from
mischief in Montenegro. But that may be too strong a commitment for
the U.S. Concerning the other states, now that Croatia has turned
away from raw nationalism, the U.S. should have normal intercourse
with these states, as with any other.

INDUSTRIES WEIGH EFFECT OF CHINA'S FREE-TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many companies, free trade with China will likely bring big
gains with little pain.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses ranging from financial-services giants to
telecommunications startups are likely to benefit from the trade
pact that passed the US Senate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the mix of industries and the types of companies here,
we stand to benefit more than most,'' said Brian Gilmore, executive
vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts. ``The
technology focus here, even among traditional manufacturing firms,
provides both opportunities and protection other (regions) don't
necessarily enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost manufacturing operations threatened most by free
trade have already fled New England for the most part, Gilmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That process started 15 years ago,'' he said, ``and isn't
likely to be impacted either way by Chinese trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, permanent normalized trade between the United States
and China isn't yet a done deal. Unless China is accepted as a full
member of the 138-nation World Trade Organization, all bets are
off.
</P>
<P>
   And even if things do go smoothly, economists are likely to
debate the costs and benefits for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 83-15 vote by the US Senate, though, does set the
stage for the world's biggest Communist country to trade
more-or-less freely with the world's dominant capitalist countries.
The House gave its approval to the same legislation by a 237-197
vote in May.
</P>
<P>
   Without the agreement, which was hammered out by US trade
representative Charlene Barshefsky nine months ago, China would
have eventually joined the WTO anyway. In that case, WTO members
with bilateral trade deals would have been able to sell their
products and services to the 1.3 billion Chinese with fewer
barriers than US firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been on the outside looking in,'' said Cynthia
Gordan, vice president and general counsel of Quaker Fabrics in
Fall River, Mass. ``Our competitors in Europe and Asia would have
had a chance to play there, while all we could do was watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Quaker Fabrics was among the hundreds of companies that lobbied
Congress to approve permanent normalized trade relations with
China. Gordan said the company's high-end upholstery fabric, which
markets itself based on quality rather than price, should find a
ready market in China.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, though, farms and agricultural firms are expected to
gain the most. China has agreed, for example, to immediately import
several million tons of wheat at a 1 percent tariff, far lower than
normal. It also has agreed to loosen the government's monopoly on
agricultural trading, allowing some private buyers and sellers into
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Carmakers, too, stand to get an immediate boost to the bottom
line. As part of the agreement, China has agreed to increase its
annual quota of imported vehicles from $2 billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the other things will get phased in over time,'' said
Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``Change will come, but not necessarily as quickly as a
lot of companies would like.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, for example, won't be allowed to do business in Chinese
currency until two years after China gets into the WTO, and then
only with other companies. They won't be allowed to accept deposits
from or loan money to the general public until five years after WTO
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies won't be allowed to market their products
beyond a few select cities until three years after China is
accepted into the WTO fold. And non-Chinese asset managers,
including US mutual fund companies such as Boston's Eaton Vance,
Fidelity Investments, and MFS, will have to wait three years before
they can buy stakes representing up to 49 percent of
money-management companies there.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a huge, complicated, ancient country, and it's naive
to think it will change economic course on a dime,'' said Debra
Spar, a professor of international trade at the Harvard Business
School. ``So I wouldn't expect passage of this bill to have a great
impact right away, although medium- to long-term it could be pretty
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications and high-tech companies that dot the
corporate landscape in New England, for example, are salivating at
the chance to peddle their Internet, wireless, and phone services
on the Chinese mainland. China is already the second-largest
consumer of mobile-phone services in the world, and is expected to
bypass the United States as the worldwide leader before long.
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered trade with China is also expected to be a boon to the
US entertainment industry, which would benefit companies such as
Avid Technology in Tewksbury, Mass. Avid makes editing equipment
used by movie studios, television and radio stations, and computer
programmers creating three-dimensional animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese broadcasters are no different than broadcasters in
Europe or the US, except that there are more of them,'' said Avid
chief executive David Krall. ``We're already selling some products
there, but permanent normal trade would provide the stable business
environment we need to make a substantial long-term bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lardy, of the Brookings Institution, said American imports from
companies such as Avid are certain to jump in a free-trade
scenario. But he said the US trade deficit with China, already the
largest of any trading partner, is likely get bigger rather than
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exports will rise, but our imports will probably rise even
faster,'' Lardy said. ``But at last American companies will have
the opportunity to sell more products and Chinese companies will
have to play by the WTO rules, such as intellectual property
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Free trade won't be a panacea, agreed Gilmore of Associated
Industries of Massachusetts. There are still plenty of issues left
to be ironed out when it comes to both business and politics _ in
China, in fact, the two are usually inseperable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're delighted at this first step,'' he said. ``In this
part of the country, especially, this is a pretty good deal.''

EXAMINATION OF BUFFALO BILL THINKS A LITTLE TOO MUCH

   ``Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Joy S. Kasson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hill and Wang, $27 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our age of hype, big hype and even bigger hype, it is
probably time for a book examining the life of William F. Cody _
one that describes his influence on the portrayal of the Old West
in literature, graphic art and film.
</P>
<P>
   Joy S. Kasson's ``Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' is almost that
book. It is valuable and well-researched, but it also suffers from
some modern-day flaws.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Cody, a child of the frontier, bounced from job to
job, as did most young men of his place and time. He drove oxen, he
trapped, he prospected briefly, and he scouted and hunted, first
for the army and then for the westward-moving railroad builders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, discovered by Ned Buntline (the dime-novel entrepreneur
who ``opened the West'' in his own way as much as Daniel Boone
did), Cody became Buffalo Bill, part real person, part fable. He
then evolved (with the enormous help of several partners) into Col.
William F. Cody, star and owner _ well, part-owner _ of Buffalo
Bill's Wild West, an extravaganza that brought a highly exaggerated
touch of the frontier to audiences in the East and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kasson does an admirable job of delineating this passage from
farm boy/buffalo hunter to the first modern celebrity (one famous
for being famous, and for what the public thinks it knows about
him). Cody, as Kasson says, probably did have an innate
understanding of what the public wanted, and a gift for frontier
showmanship. He was fortunate to hook up with partners who used
media connections to further his career.
</P>
<P>
   The hype worked. And, as a study of how it works, and how Cody's
arena version of the West _ much cleansed compared with the real
West _ not only captured the world's imagination but also laid the
track for so much future portrayal of the American frontier,
Kasson's book succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   What detracts from the tale is the author's very modern tendency
to insert psychological surmise. She may overstep when she calls
the Wild West show ``another example of the wild world of exotic
others brought under the control of white, civilized authority.''
</P>
<P>
   She stretches further in linking the lure of the Wild West show
in England to visions of British imperialism. She goes beyond
revisionism to draw parallels between Cody's popularity during the
1890s and the rebirth of national respect for Robert E. Lee. She
overemphasizes any influence Cody's buckskin-clad persona had on
the invention of the Boy Scouts. She reads too much into how
characters are posed in publicity photos.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, entertainment is just entertainment. It was, and is,
done for money, not to rewrite culture.
</P>
<P>
   Cody and his co-conspirators invented whole genres of
entertainment and hype. Give them credit for that, and let the rest
of it go. &QL;

RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT UNIT FACES `RISKS,' CEO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. has acknowledged more problems in its
commercial-aircraft business unit and criticized leaders of a
striking union with whom it has broken off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an investor conference in New York Wednesday, chief
executive Daniel Burnham said Raytheon faces ``risks'' on programs
such as the one to produce a new business jet and in its dealings
with commuter airlines, according to a presentation posted on the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Raytheon said the Lexington, Mass. defense
contractor did not describe any financial impacts the problems
might generate. On Tuesday, Raytheon said that it expects to
receive certification from the Federal Aviation Adminstration for
its Premier I business jet in the fourth quarter of the year, not
the third, as previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, a commuter airline, Mesa Air Group of Phoenix,
said it had agreed to return 20 planes to Raytheon's aircraft
division and to refinance up to 36 more planes. In January,
Raytheon said problems at its Wichita, Kan., aicraft unit
contributed to a 79 percent decrease in fourth-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also outlined recovery plans for the company, including
work on various military projects like the National Missile Defense
system that's under development. If approved by the next president,
Raytheon said, the system could be worth up to $5 billion over five
years for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Raytheon traded more charges with leaders of a
strike that began Aug. 27, when 2,700 blue-collar employees walked
out, seeking more benefits and job-security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has complained to the National Labor Relations Board,
alleging the union unfairly set up pickets in front of the homes of
its executives and is failing to bargain in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The company also canceled a negotiating session that had been
scheduled for Tuesday, though Polk said the company will consider
future meetings. Polk wouldn't say exactly why the company canceled
the talks; some observers suggest it may be waiting for state
regulators to decide whether strikers should receive unemployment
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Raytheon also complained of improper activities at
executives' homes, including ``a threat in the mail,'' and said
labor leaders made untrue criticisms of the company's decision to
cancel health-care payments.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Lichwala, president of the striking union, Local 1505 of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said he would
condemn any threatening behavior and that Raytheon had its facts
wrong on the health-care matter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's class B stock closed at $25.06 on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 6 cents.

IT'S SOMETHING TO CROWE ABOUT &HT;    By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
Cameron Crowe's box-office and critical success with ``Jerry
Maguire'' earned him the chance to make ``Almost Famous,'' a major
film (costing $60 million) without a star.
<P>
   The result is his most personal and best film yet.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the early 1970s, it goes on the road with a rock band,
the fictitious Stillwater, which is on the verge of breaking into
the big time: The group is almost famous.
</P>
<P>
   The story is filtered through the eyes of William Miller, a
smart but naive 15-year-old reporter for Rolling Stone magazine who
finds himself in way over his head. He's falling in love with
groupie Penny Lane, becoming too close to the musicians he's
supposed to be covering, and trying to keep his editors from
realizing they've hired a youngster to do a cover story.
</P>
<P>
   A personal touch
</P>
<P>
   How personal is the film?
</P>
<P>
   Very. Most of it comes straight from the writer-director's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent,'' said Crowe, who toured with several bands,
including Led Zeppelin, as a writer. ``Oh yeah, it's painfully
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we lived with them (bands) for weeks at a time,
because for some reason they felt we understood them as musicians.
I got very close to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So the details are drawn from life, but the story is not exactly
true. Crowe took most of the pieces from his personal experiences,
many of them saved for years in his notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron did a wonderful thing,'' said Kate Hudson, who plays
Penny.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, the 21-year-old daughter of Goldie Hawn, explained that
Crowe would ``share his personal stuff, but he never made us feel
we had to be portraying some authentic character _ or it wouldn't
have been as real and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   While the film is viewed from William's perspective, Penny's
experiences are at the core of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has been asked if she found her role as a groupie
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what you're getting into. You know you're setting
yourself up for heartbreak,'' she said. ``Any groupie of any type
is aware what they're doing _ whether it's groupies for actors or
athletes or musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that Cameron wanted to make clear was that 1973 was
about the music. That's why these women were there _ not only that
they inspired it, which a lot of women did, but were inspired by
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's such a sadness about somebody who would decide to
do that with her life. There is that lost little girl and that
vulnerable part of Penny Lane. It was very important for me to have
that be a part of her essence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she finished shooting ``Almost Famous,'' Hudson has become
romantically involved with a real-life musician, Chris Robinson,
33, of the Black Crowes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Chris after the movie and I thought, uck, I'm falling in
love, and I just lived this for six months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the '70s
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' is Crowe's fourth film as writer and director,
after ``Say Anything,'' ``Singles'' and ``Jerry Maguire'' (he also
wrote ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''), but it's the one he's been
intending to do since the start. Somehow, either the timing wasn't
right before, or he wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   If he had filmed it before ``Jerry Maguire'' made him a hot
property in Hollywood, budget restrictions would have forced a much
smaller scale. But he never gave up on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen so many TV shows and movies set in the '70s, and
none of them really capture what I remembered,'' Crowe said.
``There just came a time when I had to put up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Crowe is glad he couldn't make the film earlier.
Not only is he now more experienced and confident in his craft, but
the film is different from what he originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up really being about loving music, but the original
goal was to just capture a feeling about the time,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier versions of the script were more about the band, or
jokes about the band. But now, with `This Is Spinal Tap' and
`Behind the Music' and even `Still Crazy,' we've seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if we've seen (this) story as it's wanted to
be told most of all, which is how the music affected my family _
and the people I met back then, who were bit players in the world
of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral judgments
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's films often deal, on some level, with conscience or
morality. ``Jerry Maguire,'' which was nominated for five Oscars,
dealt with a sports agent's crisis of conscience that cost him his
job.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' William is also dealing with ethical
standards, but he's facing them from a different perspective, as a
novice just entering his chosen field.
</P>
<P>
   William had written for small rock magazines, but his
journalistic ethics aren't challenged until he travels with
Stillwater and finds that some folks want to influence what he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make us look cool,'' one of his band ``friends'' tells
him. But at the back of his mind, something keeps telling William
that a reporter is supposed to be objective and tell the full
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make a moral judgment every time you write an article,''
Crowe said. ``It was fun to write a script that was about the
making of the moral judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Crowe noted, there are plenty of articles, books and
movies about the dark side of rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Let's put a little bit of that in the movie,' but
just like when I was writing the articles, it was, `Let's not let
the music get clouded by the traditional cliched sex, drug and rock
'n' roll stuff.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got into music or a piece about music because I knew
the guy was rowdy or not rowdy, or on heroin or not on heroin.
That's part of the lifestyle. You can write about the lifestyle,
but you should also write about the music, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, now 43 and married to Nancy Wilson of the rock band
Heart, was 15 when he began writing for various rock magazines.
Just like in the movie, he was soon hired to write for Rolling
Stone. In the film, he's hired over the phone by editor Ben
Fong-Torres, who assumes he's an adult. Mostly, Crowe said, this is
all true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it got simplified a touch, but just a touch. Ben
Fong-Torres did not know how old I was. Somebody took me to meet
him at a concert, but mercifully the lights went down, and my hair
was long and in my face, and he still didn't know how young I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   And the character of William, sweet-faced and eager, is not
exactly Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Cameron,'' said 17-year-old Patrick Fugit, the
marvelously expressive unknown actor who plays William. ``William
is so different from Cameron, but it's Cameron's experiences on the
road compiled into a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a tiny bit more the prankster (than the character). I
was the class clown. It gave me something they remembered me by.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies are made for audiences, of course, but sometimes an
artist wants to satisfy himself first. So, you have to wonder, is
Crowe satisfied with this very personal film?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' he said, still sounding as though he's surprised by
it. ``I'm strangely beyond happy. A feeling seeped into the movie,
between the cast and the music and the way (director of
photography) John Toll shot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more musical than my other movies. I felt a little bit
more of a musician than a director on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   A Led seal of approval
</P>
<P>
   Before he was satisfied, though, Crowe had a test he had to
pass, at least in his own mind. He set up a special screening in
London for Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. It was a
meeting that made him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I would talk to them or do liner notes for the
Led Zeppelin box set, but I hadn't really spent time with the two
of them in about 20 years,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed them the movie in London. We weren't even sure they
were going to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my notebook under my arm as Plant and Page got out of
the elevator, and Plant looked at me and saw my notebook and said,
`Well, nothin' changes, does it? Let's watch the movie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty great, though. I couldn't bear to watch them
reacting. But then it was over, and they really got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, they liked the several original
'70s-esque songs that Crowe and Wilson, who created the score,
wrote (under fake names) for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was amazing,'' Crowe said. ``I couldn't wait to get on
the phone with my wife and say, `Robert Plant and Jimmy Page liked
your songs.'''

WOODARD SURPRISES WITH TOP-NOTCH PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On paper, it didn't appear to be much of a matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez against the Indians' Steve Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   A Cy Young Award candidate against a guy who opposing batters
have lit up for a .319 average and 25 home runs in 37 appearances
this season.
</P>
<P>
   A Cy Young Award candidate against a guy who hasn't pitched more
than six innings in any start, was 2-10 with Milwaukee and
Cleveland, and sported a 6.34 earned run average this season.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it wasn't supposed to turn out this way.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodard matched Martinez pitch for pitch over six innings,
left with a 1-0 lead, and then watched as Paul Shuey and Bob
Wickman held the Red Sox in check down the stretch en route to a
2-1 win in the opener of Wednesday's day-night twinbill at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that Woodard?'' said Indians manager Charlie Manuel.
``Woodard did OK, didn't he? He pitched a good game. He threw
strikes and was getting his breaking ball and changeup over. He
kept them off-balance and took us exactly where we wanted him to
take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Woodard took the Indians was into the seventh inning with
a 1-0 lead. He was nicked for three hits _ an infield single by
Darren Lewis and wall doubles by Nomar Garciaparra and Dante
Bichette _ and matched his season high with four strikeouts while
walking none.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't always gone that well for the righthander, who
came to the Indians July 28 from Milwaukee with Jason Bere and
Wickman in a seven-player deal.
</P>
<P>
   With the Brewers, he was 1-7 (5.96 ERA) in 27 appearances and
with the Indians, he's 1-3 (7.30) in 10 games, including eight
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should really help his confidence,'' said Manuel. ``I
think he just needs more experience. He needs to pitch. He's a
young guy. There's things about him that I like. Today he proved he
definitely is able to pitch a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Woodard told Cleveland writers that he was going to
pitch well. He delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of stuff working today, threw strikes and got some
good defense,'' said Woodard, who in his last start was roughed up
(four innings, seven hits, five earned runs) by the White Sox.
``When you have a defense like this, let me tell you, you can throw
strikes and not worry about the ball being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really throwing against Pedro Martinez, I was
throwing against the Boston Red Sox. But it lifted me up throwing
against somebody like that. You know you have to go out there,
throw your pitches, and concentrate more because you know you can't
give up too many runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days that everything was working and I was
able to get ahead of everybody. It was nice to go out there in the
first inning with the lead. Usually you've got the jitters, but
once I got that run and got through that inning, I felt pretty
comfortable. It's been an up-and-down year, so to contribute
something like this feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuey, who worked the seventh and eighth, said Woodard's
performance was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this first game was probably the biggest game of the
year for us,'' said Shuey. ``We've had some great games leading up
to this one, but to have Woodard, who basically, you almost look
like you're giving up against Pedro because we're not going with
one of the higher aces of our staff, pitch like this was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw him out there and basically told him `Give us what
you've got.' He stuck it to Boston. You know we just beat Pedro in
Boston and that's something we've had a little trouble doing. What
(Woodard) gave us today was enormous. This was huge. Like I said,
this game was the biggest of the year for us. Easily.''

   CANCER CONNECTION: If you can't get to the conference, the
conference will come to you. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance's
annual gathering is in Washington through Saturday, but many events
will be online in hopes of reaching women battling the disease who
are unable to make the trip. The highlight: A first-ever live
Webcast from the conference at 9 a.m. Friday. It will focus on the
latest research about disease detection, risk factors and treatment
options for the thousands who have ovarian cancer, including some
23,000 who will be diagnosed this year. The Webcast and other
programs will soon be added to the Web site.

   STILL FIGHTING: The woman who helped spark the civil rights
movement by refusing to give up her seat on a bus is again fighting
for her space _ this time on the Internet. The Chicago lawyer for
87-year-old Rosa Parks says she has won domain name rights to
www.rosaparks.com. According to Park's attorney, Oscar Alcantara,
the site was created by a man with no relation to Parks who planned
to auction it. Alcantara says he sent a cease-and-desist letter to
Lester Shaw of Tulsa, Okla.; the attorney says Shaw subsequently
agreed to give up the domain name.

   MOUSE TRICKS: Go ahead, wiggle your mouse. Just don't be
surprised if it soon returns the favor. Ecards.com, an online
greeting card company and generic mouse-maker Logitech are
unveiling a device that does more than just point and click. The
companies say the iFeel mouse will be capable of sending ``tactile
sensations'' to users that will correspond to images displayed on
the Ecards site. As the mouse is maneuvered over icons, menu items
and hyperlinks, it sends different sensations to the user's hand.
The sensations include vibrations as well as side-to-side and
up-and-down motions. The plastic, motorized iFeel mouse should be
available in about two weeks; it sells for about $40 for the basic
version and $60 for the deluxe model.

Uniquelyme.com is billing itself as the one-stop shopping site for

 &HT;    Follow MTV into a prison: It will give you the creeps
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're going to love this _ if you're a squirmy high schooler or
a good-for-a-goof college student or even an adult in touch with
your 'fraidy cat self.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's ``Fear,'' which airs for a commercial-free hour tonight,
is the music network's latest entry in the reality genre it kicked
off a decade ago with ``The Real World.'' It's a ``Blair Witch
Project''-style reality show that plays like a parody of both
``Blair Witch'' and reality _ until you realize that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's serious, and that's a riot. Where ``Blair Witch'' was a
movie disguised as a documentary, ``Fear'' is a documentary
disguised as a game show. Five more episodes will roll out over the
year, each in a different location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear'' delivers six young adults between the ages of 18 and 24
_ y'know, MTV's prime demographic _ to an abandoned prison in West
Virginia that's supposed to be haunted. A cork board greets them
with photos of former inhabitants: an inmate who hanged himself,
another burned to death by a fellow inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Each contestant is then hooked up with cameras and
walkie-talkies _ no circling crews or Jeff Probsts here _ and sent
out in the middle of the night, looking like ghostbusters, into the
abandoned catacombs of the ancient prison.
</P>
<P>
   A computer gives them tasks: walk through the death row
graveyard, sit on the old electric chair for 15 minutes in the
dark. The contestants don't do anything during the day: they're
housed in a chapel where they can watch movies from this selection:
``The Exorcist,'' ``Rosemary's Baby,'' ``The Omen'' and ``The
Shining.'' Those who last three nights in the prison win $3,000 _
``Who Wants to be a Thousandaire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is every silly dare every kid has ever imagined, and that's
its appeal. It works the way ``Scream'' worked: it's manipulative
and ridiculous while playing out all the tried-and-true horror
conventions that will leave you squirming and jumping in spite of
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so scared in my life,'' one contestant says,
``and I don't even know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at 8 on MTV, repeat at 10 .
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Scariest thing on TV since Gervase Peterson tried to
eat grubs on ``Survivor.''

CABLE-EQUIPMENT STARTUP SCOOPED UP FOR $2.25 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broadband Access Systems, a start-up that makes a one-box system
for cable television companies looking to add telephone and
Internet services, is being acquired for $2.25 billion in stock by
a Minnesota telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer ADC Telecommunications Inc. of Minnetonka said Wednesday
it will keep 200-worker Broadband in Westborough and continue
growing the company there. It will use Broadband to round out its
already extensive line of products aimed at cable TV, telephone,
and Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   While Broadband's systems can also support fixed-wireless
Internet access and telephone digital subscriber lines, its main
market to date has been among cable TV franchises upgrading for
``broadband'' Internet and phone service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Time Warner, Comcast, and other cable providers are
pouring billions of dollars into upgrading lines serving the 68
million US homes that get cable TV so they can also sell them
services such as high-speed Internet access and local phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, the number of homes getting cable
broadband Net access in the United States is widely projected to
grow from under 4 million now to 15 million or more, with up to 13
million US homes also using cable lines for phone service by 2005,
according to Strategis Group.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, for example, AT&AMP;T
Broadband, which owns the former MediaOne, now has more than
150,000 high-speed Net access subscribers and is looking to boost
its local phone-over-cable offerings with new pricing plans this
fall. MediaOne spent nearly $2 billion on the system upgrade
locally.
</P>
<P>
   While these upgrades are creating a multibillion-dollar market
for equipment suppliers, in many cases they have required cramming
and lashing together up to a half-dozen different devices inside
cable switching stations.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband Access's Cuda line of products combines several
telecommunications services and TV delivery in a single
refrigerator-size box, saving carriers money and speeding service
deployments.
</P>
<P>
   ADC's chief financial officer, Bob Switz, said the company
considered several acquisitions and concluded that ``BAS had the
most advanced product of anybody today, and one that is currently
ready for shipment. We think we bought the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Komanecky, Broadband's vice president of marketing and
development, said the company had been aiming for an initial public
offering. But, he said, ``it was pretty clear that we needed to
develop some relationships with other companies to provide an
end-to-end solution'' for cable franchise upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel really good about joining forces with ADC,'' Komanecky
said. ``We see a lot of synergies with their product line.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Broadband, founded in early 1998, expects to
report sales of about $5 million this year but is not expected to
add to ADC's profits until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While spending over $2 billion for a company with such currently
thin revenues may seem astonishing in many industries, deals in the
superheated telecommunications sector are often viewed according to
how much market capitalization the acquirer is giving up.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, ADC is spending less than 10 percent of its
total market value for BAS, a company that could help it grab a
bigger share of the billions of dollars of future revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ADC senior vice president Arun Sobti said BAS products ``will
form the cornerstone of ADC's strategy to offer next-generation
systems'' using Internet protocol to deliver voice and Net services
over upgraded cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   ADC said it will issue 54 million to 66 million of its shares
for Broadband, under a collar arrangement that would lead to the
deal being worth less than $2.25 billion if its shares trade below
$34.13 the five days before the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading, ADC shares dropped $2.44 to $32.44. They
traded as high as $49 in late July.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.2 billion price appears to be in the range of a 15-to-1
return over barely two years for some of BAS's venture investors,
although the companies would not disclose exact ownership shares.
</P>
<P>
   BAS has raised $72 million in five rounds of funding. Matrix
Partners and affiliates own about 27 percent of the company's
outstanding voting shares and North Bridge Venture Partners owns 14
percent. Vulcan Ventures, the investment arm of Microsoft cofounder
Paul Allen, also put early money into BAS.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at a BAS rival RiverDelta Networks in Tewksbury,
Mass., were elated by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really excellent news that values what we are all
doing in this space,'' said Jeff Walker, RiverDelta's marketing
vice president. ``The value has certainly been established for
addressing the huge opportunity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   RiverDelta has yet to announce either revenue or trial customers
for its device, which is similar to the Broadband Cuda system. But
the RiverDelta device includes what Walker called some unique
capabilities for allowing broadband providers to bill people for
one-time downloads of huge video or music files that take more than
their standard 1.5-megabit connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an appropriate offer'' to buy RiverDelta, ``we'd
certainly entertain that,'' Walker said. ``But right now we are
driving toward the IPO,'' or initial public offering. RiverDelta
has 200 employees and has received $46 million in venture capital
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband customers to date include Adelphia, Time Warner Inc.,
interTECH, Tele-Media, and Utilicom.
</P>
<P>
   ADC said the acquisition will cut earnings by 2 cents per share
in the fourth quarter and 5 to 6 cents a share in 2001. ADC said it
will take an unspecified additional charge against earnings for the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ADC counts annual sales of $2.8 billion and nearly 21,000
employees. Earlier this year, it bought two Scandinavian
fiber-optic component companies to boost its product offerings and
compete with Corning Inc., Lucent, and other optical component
makers.

 &HT;    Ex-Falcon leaves game behind in latest thriller
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giving up football wasn't difficult for Tim Green. The former
defensive end played his last game for the Atlanta Falcons in 1993
and smoothly segued into careers as a sports announcer for the Fox
network, a lawyer in upstate New York, a father of four, and a
best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was removing football from his novels. ``When my
editor told me I'd have to divorce myself from the world of sports,
I remember saying, `Hey, can the main character have a boyfriend
who used to play football?' But they said, `No football.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, after five football-themed thrillers _ including
``Ruffians,'' ``Titans'' and ``The Red Zone'' _ Green, 36, has
written a novel with no punts, passes or penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in stores this month, ``The Letter of the Law'' (Warner
Books, $24.95) is the story of Marcia Lipton, a young attorney who
reluctantly agrees to defend her former law professor on charges of
murdering a student. The professor is acquitted, but there are
indications he may be a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Green has solid literary credentials. At Syracuse University, he
studied under renowned writers Tobias Wolff and Raymond Carver and
graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in English.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wants to continue writing popular fiction, he hasn't
given up his desire to reach the next literary level.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I would love to write a book as well-written and
compelling as `Cold Mountain,''' he says. ``But I know right now
I'm not anywhere near that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  War stories: David Hackworth is the most decorated soldier
since Audie Murphy. He also is one of the military's harshest
critics. With nonfiction books such as his memoir ``About Face''
and ``Hazardous Duty,'' Hackworth hammered away at wasteful defense
spending, incompetent leadership and sagging morale.
</P>
<P>
   Now the retired Army colonel is taking a different tack. ``The
Price of Honor'' (Doubleday, $26.96) is the fictional story of
Sandy Caine, a Green Beret officer who has doubts about the Army.
With a journalist's help, Caine begins investigating his father's
mysterious death in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth says he turned to fiction after seeing the success of
Tom Clancy. ``Then, when I considered what books influenced my life
the most _ `The Red Badge of Courage,' `From Here to Eternity' _ I
realized fiction is a more powerful medium than cold facts. I felt
by going to fiction I could cross over and get a broader
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A former military correspondent for Newsweek, Hackworth writes a
weekly syndicated column called ``Defending America.'' His message
in his columns is the same as the one in his novel: ``We spend $300
billion a year on defense, and our military machine is third-rate.
Our leadership must learn that wars are won by warriors, not
weapons, and return to the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth's solutions include reinstating the draft, overhauling
the Pentagon's purchasing system, disbanding the Air Force and
merging the Marines, Army and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   And what does the top brass think of the man who joined the Army
at 15, fought in two wars, and collected more than 100 battle
medals and eight purple hearts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm their worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth will sign books 7-9 p.m. Tuesday at Barnes &AMP; Noble
Cumberland (2952 Cobb Parkway, 770-953-0966).

   &QR;  Wilting Plant: With Part 3 of Stephen King's serialized
e-novel scheduled to be posted Monday, the future of ``The Plant''
will depend on the number of downloaders who pay. For the first two
installments, the numbers are just under 70 percent. As King notes
on his Web site, www.stephenking.com, he needs a 75 percent pay
ratio or he'll pull the plug. King also is asking readers to
respond to a poll about the experiment at

 &HT;    African-American museum in Macon, Ga., spreading its wings
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Macon's museum devoted to African-American art, history and
culture is getting a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor C. Jack Ellis announced plans to construct a
46,000-square-foot facility at Cherry and Poplar streets downtown
for a new Tubman African American Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The building completes Macon's arts, entertainment and cultural
corridor, which includes the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, the
Georgia Music Hall of Fame, the restored Douglass Theater and the
Macon Centreplex.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the city's support, Ellis is heading the capital
campaign for the $15 million building, which he called ``the
largest fund-raising effort central Georgia has ever seen for a
cultural or arts organization.'' The board and local foundations
have already promised $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans a February groundbreaking and a grand opening
on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Tubman, which welcomed 65,000 visitors in 1999, has been
operating in a cramped, 8,500-square-foot renovated warehouse since
opening in 1985. That has meant dismantling permanent exhibits to
accommodate traveling shows, and being limited by 8-foot ceilings.
A number of its programs, including children's dance and art
classes, occur off the site. There is not even room to store the
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum will unite all activities under one roof, add
space especially for temporary exhibitions and encompass a cafe and
more room for the museum shop, which specializes in Afrocentric
items. Two 4,000-square-foot galleries will chronicle the
African-American experience from 1619 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby will be a soaring rotunda, but not an intimidating
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of our visitors are coming to a museum for the first
time, we wanted it to be welcoming but impressive,'' said Tubman
director Carey Pickard.
</P>
<P>
   The Tubman also looked to architect E. Verner &AMP; Associates of
Cambridge, Mass., in consultation with Robert Madison International
of Cleveland, Ohio, to create a special vocabulary for the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the building to be Afrocentric, but not African,''
said Pickard. ``We're African-American. We express our mission
through strong geometries, texture and color.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the largest African-American museum in Georgia, the
Tubman hopes its new facility will establish it as a regional
center for education about African-American issues while capping
the city's downtown revitalization plans. Bibb County donated the
land for the project, and the city helped fund a portion of the
initial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ellis called the new Tubman a symbol of Macon's
progressive, New South vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the most significant addition to downtown Macon in
our lifetime,'' he said, ``and will change the face of our city.''

<P>
   SHERWOOD PARK, England _ When Europe's single currency was
introduced in 11 countries last year Britain stood aloof, refusing
to abandon its venerable pound. It brushed aside domestic critics
and business leaders who said their land might be setting misplaced
nationalism ahead of the opportunity to participate in the
Continent's greatest financial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 21 months later, with the euro staggering against the
American dollar, the European currency's misfortunes seem only to
have strengthened those convictions. Still aloof _ and proud of it
_ many Britons seem to feel vindicated in their belief that the
smart money was on abstention after all, while the costs of
isolation from the euro-zone have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved against the grain of European opinion for
centuries,'' said Lord David Owen, one of several political
grandees linked with business groups opposed to Britain's joining
the euro at this stage. ``It's been happening over a long period of
time, and we mustn't be afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only politicians who sense that the euro is out of
favor here. Business and financial interests were once largely
united in favoring the euro. But a survey in mid-September by
Merrill Lynch found that, for the first time, a majority among
British fund managers had ``lost their enthusiasm'' for the euro,
arguing that it would not be in the country's long-term economic
interests to join. As recently as March 1999, the survey said, 60
percent of British fund managers had favored British membership.
That figure slid to 40 percent in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Denmark, which rejected the treaty establishing
the single currency several years ago, is set to vote again on
whether to join the euro in a referendum on Sept. 28. With opinion
among Danes shifting against membership, the British fund managers
said a Danish ``no'' would not only make British membership less
likely but perhaps damage the currency throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``An upset in Denmark could be the next shock that triggers euro
selling,'' said Trevor Greetham, global strategist at Merrill Lynch
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups skeptical of the euro _ assembled in a newly
launched campaign called ``Euro No'' that depicts the European
currency as a set of handcuffs _ declared in full-page newspaper
advertisement: ``Our economy hasn't been so healthy in our
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is intensely political and emotional, with few
indisputable economic facts to sway the argument either way in what
is by far the largest of three holdouts against the euro _ Britain,
Denmark and Sweden. Greece, which was left out originally because
of its weak economy, is scheduled to join the euro in January.
</P>
<P>
   While Britain's trade with the Continent has started to suffer,
the nation has nonetheless survived a hint of recession with flying
colors. It has also suppressed inflation and achieved more robust
growth than Continental Europe largely because the Bank of England,
free of the euro-zone's control by a ponderous and indecisive
European Central Bank in Frankfurt, has been able to massage
interest rates to shield the economy from its own boom-to-bust
history.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, said Ian Stewart, an economist with
Merrill Lynch in London, ``the benefits of being outside outweigh
the benefits of being inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The City of London, Europe's financial district, has made brisk
business from the euro, both in the eurobond market and from
Europe's record-setting wave of cross-border consolidations. ``This
is one area where there has been no sign of any losses,'' said
Alasdair Murphy, a director of the pro-euro Center for European
Reform.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, as the British pound has
strengthened mightily against the euro, it has made British exports
to Continental Europe _ half of its trade _ far more expensive.
That has inflicted pain on manufacturers, who have shed hundreds of
thousands of jobs since the euro's inception.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite complaints from auto industry giants like Ford,
BMW, Nissan and Toyota about the pound's strength, Britain has
maintained its lead as the principal target for foreign
corporations seeking a toehold in Europe's 15-nation single market.
Government figures released in July show that Britain's
attractiveness has pushed the total value of overseas investment
here to $382 billion, up a stunning 25 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments form pillars of the anti-euro case. But more
distant horizons seem less sparkling. Many overseas investors have
come to Britain not just for its low labor costs and easy
hire-and-fire laws, but because they assume that, sooner or later,
Britain will join the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the pound weakening against the dollar, and
long-term interest rates between Britain and the euro-zone looking
set to converge, some economists argue that Britain is heading for
a de facto alignment with the euro-zone that would make its
membership simpler to achieve economically, if not politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that that we will be in at some stage, so
there's no need to take short-term measures or to start rethinking
strategic considerations,'' said Graham Bishop, an independent
economic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But if Prime Minister Tony Blair's tentative schedule to call a
referendum on joining the euro within the next couple of years
begins to slip _ as it now might with Blair's government facing a
sudden loss in popularity _ ``then that begins to make people
nervous,'' Bishop said.  &QL;

 SHERWOOD PARK, England: Bishop said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the economic disputes, however, the decision on joining
the euro will ultimately be a political one. Blair's government,
which is guardedly in favor of the euro, has promised that it will
not move until after the next election, and will hold a referendum
on joining the currency before abandoning the pound. And,
alarmingly for those who support the euro, Blair's Labor Party has
suddenly and surprisingly been overtaken in the opinion polls by
the staunchly anti-euro Conservative opposition, raising questions
about the government's fortunes at the next election for
Parliament, which it is expected to call next year and cannot delay
past May 2002. The mood swung against Labor over its handling of
blockades by protesting truckers and farmers that threatened to
paralyze the economy and could well swing back again before the
vote is held.
</P>
<P>
   But Labor's loss of support could have wider ramifications. The
Conservatives have placed their visceral and now united opposition
to the euro at the center of a populist election campaign that can
only become stronger if Labor is unable to win back popularity at
home. And the anti-euro forces could gain further ground if other
omens abroad _ particularly the Danish vote and the euro's swoon on
foreign exchange markets _ reinforce their argument that the single
currency is turning into a failure.  &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In setting out the arguments for and against, hard economic data
is scarce and ambiguous, hinging thus far on three questions. Has
Britain's isolation from the euro damaged foreign investment? Has
it been a setback for the City of London as one of the world's
mightiest financial centers? And has Britain suffered from the
swings in the euro's value against the pound?
</P>
<P>
   Only in the latter category can manufacturers and exporters
trace losses that have cost jobs _ 200,000, according to Kitty
Usher, the chief economist of the pro-euro Britain in Europe group.
Against that, though, Britain's overall unemployment figures have
declined since the introduction of the euro, suggesting that other
jobs have been created over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Among foreign investors, particularly the vocal Japanese
automakers who have established major operations in Britain, the
picture remains murky. Honda has announced a doubling of capacity
at its plant at Swindon, west of London. But Toyota is set to open
a new factory in France next year and Nissan could move production
of a new subcompact to the French installations of its partner,
Renault.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and Ford both cited the pound's strength against the euro as
reasons for their decisions to close assembly lines in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That could deepen what some pro-Europeans see as a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globally, our share of foreign investment is falling,'' Usher
said, arguing that, while still at a record level, Britain's
overall slice of the world's accumulated foreign investment had
declined to 24 percent from 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three million jobs, or one in nine, are directly or indirectly
linked to exports to the euro-zone, Usher said. ``Those jobs could
be affected by anything that would weaken our trading links with
the euro-zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she added, it did not really matter whether the exchange
rate was defined by the euro's weakness or the pound's strength.
``It's all semantics,'' she said, ``if you are the person whose job
is threatened.'' &QL;

ECONOMIC SCENE: EXAMINING DIFFERENCES IN DRUG PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By By HAL R. VARIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prescription drugs have become politicized. Al Gore recently
criticized the manufacturer of the arthritis drug Lodine for
selling it for $108 a month when prescribed for humans and $38 when
prescribed for dogs. It's not just the doggy divide that has
politicians upset; international price differences for drugs are
another flash point. The House and Senate recently approved a
measure allowing pharmacists to import prescription drugs from
countries where they sell for substantially less than in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Charging different prices for humans and animals, or different
prices to consumers in different countries, is what economists call
``third-degree price discrimination.'' It is a common practice for
pharmaceutical companies. A month's supply of the anti-depressant
Zoloft sells for $29.74 in Austria, $32.91 in Luxembourg, $40.97 in
Mexico and $64.67 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of differential pricing is motivated in part by drug
companies' cost structure, and in part by differences in bargaining
power. It can cost millions of dollars to research, develop, test
and market a new drug. Once these fixed costs are incurred,
however, actually producing the drug may cost very little. Since
the market price is often far greater than the marginal cost of
production, there is always a temptation to cut prices to generate
incremental sales and profit. The problem is that the revenue gain
from the incremental sales would not make up for the revenue loss
on the sales the drug company would have made anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The natural strategy is to selectively cut prices and set
different prices for different markets. Drugs sold for humans
generally sell for more than drugs sold for animals. Drugs in rich
countries tend to cost more than drugs in poor countries. A daily
dose of the AIDS drug PLC sells for $18 in the United States and $9
in Uganda, while a generic equivalent sells for $1.50 a day in
Brazil. Even at $9 a dose, the drug company makes a profit on
incremental sales. But if the drug were sold at $9 to everyone,
profits would be substantially lower than they would be under
differential pricing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ends up paying more for drugs since it is much
richer than the rest of the world and tends to spend a large
fraction of that wealth on health care. Furthermore, in most
countries, a single governmental health care provider bargains over
drug prices. America's health care system is much more fragmented,
which tends to reduce the bargaining power of health care providers
in negotiating drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Price discrimination is not popular with consumers, especially
those paying the higher price. What does economics say about
whether this kind of differential pricing is good or bad? To answer
this question, we have to ask what price would prevail if only one
price could be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that there are only two countries involved, the United
States and Uganda, and PLC sells for $18 here and $9 in Uganda. If
the drug company had to charge the same price in each country, what
would it be? In this case, it is likely that the price would be
closer to $18 than to $9. True, sales would drop significantly in
Uganda, but that loss in revenue would be very small compared with
the revenue loss in the United States from setting a price close to
$9 because it is a significantly larger market. In this case,
mandating a fixed price makes the Ugandans a lot worse off and does
little for U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But it could work out differently. Imagine an anti-malarial drug
that lots of people in Uganda might buy at $2 a dose and a few
people in America might buy at $10 a dose. If the Ugandan market is
more than five times the U.S. market, the drug company, if it could
set only one price, would be better off putting it close to $2.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question, from the viewpoint of economics, is
whether differential pricing or a flat price leads to more people
getting the drug. In the case of the AIDS drug, differential
pricing leads to more total consumption; in the case of the
anti-malarial drug, it is the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   When two different prices are charged, people paying the higher
one are convinced that if the company were forced to charge one
price, it would be the low one. Alas, it's not always so. Sometimes
forcing one price results in just cutting off the small market,
rather than lowering the price to the large market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, public health advocates have argued for a long time
that pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to invest in
developing drugs for tropical diseases, since they tend to be a
problem only in poor countries, where people can't afford to pay
for drugs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   All the money is in the rich countries, and drug research
focuses on health problems of interest to those markets, like
obesity, heart disease and cancer, virtually ignoring diseases that
strike the residents of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   From the economic viewpoint, this behavior is entirely
understandable: That is the way the incentives are set up. If you
want to change the drug companies' behavior, you have to change
their incentives. The World Health Organization has advocated
offering monetary prizes for companies that develop effective drugs
for tropical diseases, as long as they subsequently sell the
manufactured drug at marginal cost.
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy answer as to whether price discrimination, in
general, is a good thing or a bad thing. It tends to raise
additional revenue that can be plowed back into research and
development, which creates better incentives to invest in drug
development. When it allows markets to be served that would
otherwise be ignored, price discrimination will tend to be socially
useful. But if differential pricing is just an excuse to raise
prices that would otherwise be low, it doesn't have much to
recommend it. &QL;

   WHITEWATER-REPORT (Washington) _ In a decisive end to the
six-year-long Whitewater investigation, Robert Ray, the independent
prosecutor, said Wednesday he has concluded that there was
insufficient evidence to show that either President or Mrs. Clinton
had committed any crimes in connection with the Arkansas real
estate venture that vexed his presidency through two terms. But Ray
was notable in the the spareness of his language. He said only that
on each of the allegations his office had investigated, ``there was
insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' that a crime had been committed. By Neil A. Lewis.

FASTIDIOUS SINGAPORE HAS NO PATIENCE FOR CROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The men with shotguns gathered in the park at dusk,
loaded their weapons and fanned out along the shoreline between the
palm trees and the concrete path with its signs warning joggers:
``Beware of falling coconuts.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the front lines of Singapore's long-running war
against a hated foreign intruder, the crow. There are about 100,000
crows on this Manhattan-sized island nation, 50,000 too many, the
government has decreed.
</P>
<P>
   So since 1982, authorities have entrusted the Singapore Gun Club
with helping them cull the crows. The government furnishes the
ammunition. The club provides its members, who volunteer their time
and skills in tracking down and killing as many crows as they can.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular evening, the crows obliged by appearing over
the tree line, winging their way back from a day of foraging to
roost in a copse of mangroves, unaware of the ambush ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the early birds,'' said Dennis Lim, the club's
mild-mannered second vice president, as he eyed the cawing mass
gathering over the tiny mangrove swamp. By day an editor of a local
news station's Web site, after hours Lim is head of the club's
anticrow commandos. ``We'll wait for more shooters,'' he said.
``We're not at full strength yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharpshooters arrived, 18 in all, not in rusted pickups with
gun racks, but in BMWs and shiny new Japanese sedans. The club
secretary, Tang Kee Khong, emerging from a vintage Mercedes,
launched the attack. Making mock caws to lure a circling mass of
crows from the swamp, Tang aimed skyward and _ pop, pop _ two crows
plummeted to the ground, dead. The sound of gunfire soon filled the
park as sharpshooters on the opposite side of the swamp began
flushing the birds from the mangroves.
</P>
<P>
   Maligned almost everywhere as pests and bad omens, crows are a
particular nuisance in a city-state so fastidious that vandals are
caned, litterbugs are fined and the sale of chewing gum is banned.
</P>
<P>
   Crows are also suspected of carrying disease. In the United
States, crows are believed to be spreading the deadly
mosquito-borne West Nile virus even as it decimates their
population. Singapore authorities are concerned that the birds
could spread illnesses from the carrion and waste they eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dirty,'' Lim said. ``I've seen them eating the carcass
of a dead dog hit by a car, with maggots in their beaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agri-Food Veterinary Authority puts it this way: ``Crows are
a social menace. They are aggressive and tend to attack people when
they are guarding their nests, including snatching food from
children. The crows destroy TV antennae, tear up refuse bags and
soil the area with spillage. They gather in large numbers to roost
in the evenings and cause noise nuisance and soil the area with
their droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the crows even more insidious to Singaporeans is that
the worst offender is not even from around here. It is the
so-called house crow, a species smaller than the crows native to
these parts, that is most troublesome. Naturalists believe that the
British brought the birds here from India.
</P>
<P>
   Traps do not work: Crows are too clever to be fooled more than
once. The same goes for poison bait, which is equally lethal to
popular species like mynas, doves and egrets.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the government enlisted the help of the
military's shooting club, but the volunteers still account for the
most kills. Last year, they were responsible for the deaths of
nearly 11,000 of the 18,000 crows shot down. So far this year, they
have killed more than 12,000 crows, and Lim says they will probably
kill 20,000 by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore is not the only place where crows have drawn a death
sentence. Malaysia conducts its own crow culls. Authorities in
Tokyo have begun raiding crows' nests and putting the chicks to
death. And many American farmers and hunters have long treated
crows as moving bull's-eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Lim, 48, has been shooting crows with the club since 1988. A
veteran hunter, he grew up hunting fruit bats with his brother at
night in local cemeteries before skyscrapers replaced Singapore's
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The other marksmen come from various walks of life. One is a
dentist, another a stock trader. Some are better shots than others.
``I've hit zero so far,'' said Lee Eng Hong, a contractor, with an
embarrassed grin. ``Sometimes you overlead. Sometimes under.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough gun laws make firearm ownership rare in Singapore. Anyone
who wants to buy a firearm must undergo a lengthy background check
and interview with the police. Once they buy their weapon they
cannot take it home. Firearms have to stay under lock and key in a
club armory.
</P>
<P>
   But the crow hunters have special permission to take their
shotguns outside the club. Even so, they are not allowed to be
alone when they do. And not everyone can join the fray, Lim said.
He handpicks the most experienced volunteers from among the club's
200 or so members. While on this night they worked among the
joggers, at other times they hunt in shipyards and even housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working so close to humans, Lim said, the club
volunteers have not hit one yet.
</P>
<P>
   There is no bloodlust evident among the men, only a solemn
respect for their foe's notorious cunning. Social animals, crows
will signal others of danger and organize to defend wounded fellows
if possible. Marksmen swear that the crows recognize guns on sight
and fly out of range.
</P>
<P>
   Don't the hunters ever feel for the crows? ``We do,'' said
Dennis Lim, ``but if you don't cull them, they multiply.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Singapore feels the same way. The volunteers say
angry bird lovers occasionally confront them. Not all the crows,
after all, die immediately. A few unlucky ones lie writhing on the
ground, bleeding to death.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, the public seemed supportive. ``Hey! Long time
ago you should come shoot,'' one jogger yelled as he gave the
sharpshooters the thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   But being a crow hunter can be hard on family life, said Lim.
They get home long after dinner is cold, he said, and their wives
often find it hard to stomach the blood-spattered clothing they
occasionally wear home.
</P>
<P>
   Given the private costs and the absence of public reward, Lim
says it is getting harder and harder to keep volunteers. He is
trying to recruit younger men to replace those who retire, marksmen
like Jason Ang. Ang, 27, has wanted to shoot crows since he first
saw the club in action at the age of 13. ``By the time I was 18, I
was in the gun club,'' he said as he reloaded a double-shot
Browning older than himself.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 p.m., it was over. The hunters put their dead birds into
garbage bags, collected their empty shells and gathered by their
cars to tally their kills. Tonight's estimated toll: 391, including
those birds the marksmen saw drop into the mangroves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' proclaimed Tang, who claimed 40 kills of his own. A
park employee collected the garbage bags for incineration. The
birds that fall in the swamp are left behind. The monitor lizards
will eat them.

FORGOTTEN BABY'S DEATH RAISES ISSUE OF STRESSED PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As her 16-month-old granddaughter flashed a shy, silly smile,
Princess Raye sat in her white van and thought about what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   When the baby was four months old, Raye was supposed to bring
her to work one day. She got out of the van and walked into the
office, a purse in one arm and a diaper bag in the other. No baby.
She sat down at her desk and started making phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Raye's boss knew of her plans and asked about the baby.
The baby had only been alone for a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   That brush with disaster gives Raye, 52, sympathy for Peter Bos,
the computer programmer whose five-month old daughter, Aliyah, died
after being left in a car all day Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' said Raye, 52, of Boston. ``There's two
sides to every story. I can't judge him, because these things do
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in sharp contrast to Raye, most parents interviewed
Wednesday said forgetting one's child inside a car all day is
inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many psychologists and family life experts said Bos's fatal
mistake is a symptom of a larger problem in today's culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case triggers the very real issue that parents today are
over-stressed, over-worked, and pulled in too many directions.
They've lost the capacity to focus their attention,'' said Linda
Braun, coordinator of the family studies graduate program at
Wheelock College. ``I know in my bones that that's not good for the
human psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   One Boston researcher argues that parents forget their babies in
cars far more often than most people realize. A few years ago,
Anara Guard began compiling statistics on cases in which unattended
babies and toddlers die of heat stroke in motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on news reports, Guard has catalogued 92 such
instances nationwide from the past five years _ and that's only
cases that resulted in death.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, about a third involved children who climbed into
parked cars and couldn't get out. In another third, fathers were
responsible. The rest were the result of mistakes or neglect by
mothers, other family members, or day care providers, said Guard,
who has presented her work at professional conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neglected issue,'' said Guard, who works at Join
Together, a Boston group fighting substance abuse and gun violence.
``It's not that unusual, and it's 100 percent preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard's advise: Busy, distracted parents should put magnets or
notes on the dashboard to remind themselves if the baby is in the
backseat. And day care centers should routinely call parents when
children don't show up, as most centers' policies dictate.
</P>
<P>
   Many mothers and fathers, though, say vigilance is their
ultimate responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, there's not enough stress in the world to
make you forget your children,'' said Greta Simpson, 33, of Boston,
a hair dresser who was grocery shopping Wednesday with her husband
and three daughters. ``When you're a parent, you're a full-time
parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and psychiatrists agreed that Bos's case was an
extreme and baffling instance of parental forgetfulness. They added
that they didn't have enough information to explain the computer
programmer's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But all bemoaned the burdens that weigh down today's working
parents. Bos and his wife, Leslie, who held three jobs between
them, are clearly no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Especially with an infant Aliyah's age, sleep deprivation piled
on top of long hours on the job and work pressure can make it
almost impossible to function normally, said Dr. Eugene Beresin,
director of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residency Training
program at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are frenzied and harried, they tend to have
accidents,'' Beresin said. ``We don't let Mass General residents
stay on call for more than 36 hours anymore because they make
mistakes they would never make if they were not overtired or
preoccupied.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-month old baby may wake up crying every hour and a half
at night, leaving her parents to sleepwalk through the day, said
Dr. Helene Stein, a psychologist who has worked with families and
infants for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stein and others said, this week's case raises troubling
questions about Bos and that investigators need to do a through job
of examining the family.
</P>
<P>
   While most people don't forget their children for hours at a
time, Braun said the stress of our manic, plugged-in life takes a
terrible, toll on many families, in less spectacular, less visible
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Children, not getting the focused attention from their parents
that they need, develop behavior problems or poor self esteem.
Parents, then, ``feel guilty and inadequate and torn and
helpless,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to look far to see the frantic, half-mad look
in the eyes of young parents. Wednesday, in the Bos's neighborhood,
a father in shorts and sandals marched down the street with a baby
carriage and a preschooler clinging to his back. He was too rushed
to comment on Bos. ``What time is it?'' he asked instead, barreling
ahead. ``Three-twenty? That's the time I have to be at the
Hernandez School!''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said psychologist Aline Zoldbrod, one family's
tragedy is a warning, a wake up call to weary parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrifying story, but not because he's a bad
man,'' Zoldbrod said. ``With the limits of the mind, and the state
of the modern world, maybe we should all be a little scared. Maybe
it should be a sign to slow down.''

OFF TO MARKET, WITH A DIGITAL MOVIE AND A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I think of us as the garage bands of the year
2000,'' Eva Ilona Brzeski said over a cup of coffee. Across the
street at the Angelika Film Center, other young directors like
Brzeski were screening their films at the IFP Market, a combination
film festival and workshop this week in Manhattan. Like Brzeski's
``Last Seen,'' an 87-minute feature about the disappearance of a
high school volleyball player, many of the films have been shot,
wholly or partly, on digital video.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Independent Feature Project, an alliance of
moviemakers and distributors, the market gathers directors,
producers, distributors, agents, broadcasters, Web site operators
and all manner of provocateurs on the independent movie scene to
view new work, finished or in progress, and make connections that
will help filmmakers find development money and outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 400 projects being screened, 43 percent were shot on
digital tape, which records information as electronic impulses
rather than images. Relatively economic to shoot and produce,
digital video has thrown open the filmmaking doors to all comers.
Economy doesn't equal quality, of course. But plenty of good
material is being turned out by small, low-paid (if they are paid
at all), hard-pressed believers in the digital way.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, hope surges in the hearts of every garage band.
Todd Solondz's ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' was discovered at the
market, as were Richard Linklater's ``Slacker,'' Michael Moore's
``Roger and Me,'' Edward Burns' ``Brothers McMullen'' and the
Academy Award-nominated documentary ``The Farm,'' by Jonathan Stack
and Liz Garbus. They weren't wielding digital videocameras,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Nontraditional filmmakers still cope with traditional means of
distribution: the theater run, home video, cable, satellite and
broadcast television. Here the avenues, as any agent or distributor
at the market will attest, are as narrow as ever. Once broadband
technology brings delivery up to speed, the Internet may become a
huge pipeline for feature films, which can be shown on the Web now
but are too long for satisfactory transmission. Distributors say
that should happen in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the infancy stage right now,'' said Gary Zeidenstein,
a founder of Alwaysi.com, a Web company. His site shows both shorts
and features and awaits the day when broadband will accelerate
distribution of full-length movies. Meanwhile his company
represents all kinds of independent films and filmmakers, listing
them on its site and promoting them in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   This week he is patrolling the market for both film and video,
though he is guarded about video. ``Ninety-eight percent of what we
have is film,'' he said. ``We don't have a lot of digital product
on-site. Digital will revolutionize the industry, but it depends on
the production value and the story line. I worry that a lot of
people are going around making any kind of movie they want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Many digital video filmmakers say that freedom is exactly the
point. ``The technology means that you can try something you
wouldn't get funding for from a studio,'' Brzeski said. ``It's
exciting that filmmakers burdened by the complexity and expense of
our art form can now take a risk. It comes closer to painting or
writing; you have a more direct way to express your ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The market guide describes ``Last Seen'' as ``darkly funny,
haunting and strange.'' Brzeski, whose short films have won awards
at many film festivals, combined 16-millimeter film and digital
video, relying on a small crew of believers who worked for turkey
sandwiches instead of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it in the can for $10,000,'' she said. Then she honed
the results on an old Avid editing machine she bought for her
company, Apple Valley Pictures. The Avid is also digital. ``For my
style of filmmaking it was such a good match, because it allows you
to try things out fast, manipulate the images, create textures,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the video look. Many digital video directors
embrace _ or are resigned to _ the hand-held rush of ``The Blair
Witch Project,'' whose incredible success left moviemakers weak in
the knees. Shot on video, ``Blair Witch'' was transferred to film.
But the average video production does not present itself as an
obvious candidate for the big screen. Brzeski said she would like
``Last Seen'' to be transferred to 35-millimeter film for a theater
run before moving to video and television and into the foreign
market, where she said she thought it would do well. ``The Germans
like weird views of America,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile she stands with what she has made. ``A lot of people
use digital video to make Hollywood-type films on a smaller
budget,'' she said. ``But we take the form for what it has to
offer. It's cinematic without making apologies for being on video.
We're not trying to be anything else.''  &QL;

HARVARD STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON `MOZART EFFECT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In findings that will dismay some arts advocates, a Harvard
study released Wednesday casts doubt on the link between the arts
and academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard
researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music
improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art
classes help students read better or score higher on tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying don't use the arts in presenting other
topics,'' said study co-author Lois Hetland, a psychologist
affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Education. ``We're
saying don't risk putting all your eggs in the basket that art will
raise math scores, because the evidence is not strong enough to
support that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has
written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea
that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the
connection between music and thinking defies measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create
different perceptions and sensations within different regions of
the brain,'' Campbell said. ``The Mozart effect is far more than
any one study can measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University
of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago. In that
study, a small group of college students did better on certain
spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a
piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata
for Two Pianos in D Major.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the Wisconsin researchers not to read too
much into the results, the study spawned a cottage industry of
classical music videotapes and CD's designed to help infants, or
even fetuses, think better. Georgia and a handful of other states
even began handing out classical music CD's to new mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, advocates for school art and music classes, trying to
reverse decades of budget cuts by cost-conscious school boards,
began pointing to the Wisconsin study and others like it to bolster
their arguments. Given the national obsession with high-stakes
tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music
classes as a way to boost test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study suggests they should take a different tack.
Hetland and co-author, Ellen Winner, discovered a connection
between music and spatial thinking and between drama and verbal
skills such as reading, writing, and oral understanding. But they
didn't find any solid evidence that music, art and dance improve
reading, or that classes in the arts improve test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Hetland says she's a strong supporter of art and music classes,
but that they deserve a place in the curriculum on their own
merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask history to justify itself on the basis of whether
it raises English scores. It's valuable on its own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Rose of the Creative Movement and Arts Center near Boston,
has been introducing children to music and dance for 20 years. She
said music has a developmental impact, if not a direct academic
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music really enhances the learning experience, even if it
doesn't necessarily spawn geniuses or people who excel in
particular areas,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can
affect overall student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Aprill of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education said
expanding the arts in Chicago schools has improved students'
attitudes toward other subjects, spurred parents to get more
involved, and even raised test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the arts become integrated into the curriculum they are
an important part of whole school improvement that shouldn't be
ignored,'' Aprill said.

 &HT;    Back-up Olympic flames purloined night of Opening Ceremony
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - OK, so Australia's not perfect. Someone stole the two
lanterns that carried the Olympic mother flame from Athens to
Sydney. The two lanterns, which contain the back-up flame for the
Olympic torch, were taken on the night of Opening Ceremony. They
had been guarded closely by police as they traveled with the
Olympic torch before the Games, but they disappeared after police
relinquished custody when the cauldron was lit Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The city too busy to cook? Seems the Aussies are so wrapped up
in the Games that fresh food sales at groceries have dropped
considerably. In-restaurant dining is also way down _ but fast food
and home food delivery services are way up.
</P>
<P>
   They are everywhere, the green flags portraying a yellow
kangaroo in red boxing gloves, facing the stars of the Southern
Cross. The battle banner of Australian sport, the Boxing Kangaroo,
is flying proud, especially at the Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol dates to 1983, when Australia Two finally wrested
sailing's America's Cup away from the United States. Recognizing a
great potential windfall, the Australian Olympic Committe
eventually bought up the design.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to symbolize a fighting spirit. Plus, it looks
really cool.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Thorpe, the 17-year-old swimming idol has done his part to
help marketing efforts by taking a stuffed boxing kangaroo along
with him to medal podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious to everyone that the Boxing Kangaroo has a
special place in our hearts. The chanting, the singing and the
sight of the 'roo spurred on our swimmers,'' said Herb Elliott,
Australia's gold medal track star (1500 meters) from 1960. A 'roo
will do that. _ Steve Hummer
</P>
<P>
   Sydney police have disbanded a crack security team called Grass
Watch 10. Its job: Guarding pallets of grass that were to be laid
at Olympic venues, to ensure that no one planted a bomb in the sod.
When the last of the turf went down at Olympic Stadium this week,
the group's work was done.

   SURF SHACK: Friends _ and total strangers _ have congratulated
U.S. swimmer Ed Moses on his silver medal in the 100-meter
breaststroke. The messages, part of the 137,303 already delivered
to athletes at the Olympics, have reached Moses via e-mail at the
IBM Surf Shack in the athletes village. ``They gotta put their last
name on there,'' Moses said. ``Some of them sound like they're your
next-door neighbor and you don't even know them. You get a wide
variety of people, which is really cool.'' Around 2,000 athletes a
day come through the Surf Shack to check their messages, look at
their personalized homepage and maybe scan a Web site or two. There
are 70 terminals and athletes are allowed 45 minutes for each
session. They also have six laptops which serve as ``express
lanes'' of 10-15 minutes.

   Subject: Aborigines' anguish
</P>
<P>
   Had some time between events on Tuesday, so I took a train ride
over to Redfern, a community of aborigines. They are considered the
oldest living culture; and it is a culture still writhing in the
pain of Europeans coming along centuries ago and massacring their
people.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1970, aborigines' kids were taken from families
in a so-called experiment to integrate them into white culture.
This went on for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to South Africa in 1994, the first person I saw
greeted me thusly: ``Welcome home, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When I went to the Redfern section of Australia, I was nearly
trampled by aborigines who were thrilled to see someone from
America who looked like them. ``Brother, tell the world about us,''
one man said.
</P>
<P>
   I left there and went back to the Games, but my heart wasn't
into it so much anymore. I felt their pain.

CLINTONS CLEARED IN WHITEWATER PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The six-year, $52 million Whitewater investigation
came to a close Wednesday, as Independent Counsel Robert Ray
announced he had found ``insufficient evidence'' to bring charges
in the widest-reaching special prosecutor inquiry ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Ray concluded there was ``inconclusive''
evidence that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton participated in, or
were aware of, any illegal activity tied to the Whitewater real
estate venture in the 1970s and 1980s. That brought an
anticlimactic end to the saga, which ran the course of Clinton's
presidency and indirectly led to his impeachment over the Monica S.
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I'm just glad this is finally over,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ended speculation that new revelations might
affect the outcome of the first lady's New York Senate campaign.
But it appeared to bring little comfort to President Clinton,
coming just four months before the end of his term and leaving
unanswered a critical question: Whether Ray will indict the
president for his handling of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   That matter, which Ray inherited from his predecessor Kenneth
Starr last October, is under consideration by a grand jury
assembled by Ray five weeks ago. But as of Wednesday, the
Whitewater case _ the original matter for which the independent
counsel was appointed on Jan. 12, 1994 _ was officially closed.
According to legal experts, there is no way for the case to be
reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for limited pending matters, the Madison
Guaranty-Whitewater investigation is now closed,'' Ray said in his
six-page statement, which was posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he had reached his conclusion after investigating
numerous allegations about the Clintons, from giving false
testimony about their business ventures to obstructing justice. Ray
also blamed the Clintons for the unprecedented amount of time the
investigation took, saying their refusal to cooperate led to
serious delays.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ray said Mrs. Clinton's billing records from the
Rose Law Firm did not materialize until early 1996, some 18 months
after they were subpoenaed. The sudden reappearance of the billing
records was one of the biggest mysteries of the investigation, but
Ray Wednesday said he could not explain what happened to the
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said Susan McDougal, a business partner of the
Clintons, had long refused to testify, and he cited the Clintons'
``unmeritorious litigation'' _ legal challenges to the prosecutor's
requests for documents _ as a reason the case stretched over so
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House response was muted, officials made
clear their bittersweet reaction to the announcement, saying it was
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Ray is now the latest investigator to complete an
examination of the transactions related to Whitewater Development
and conclude that there are no grounds for legal action,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing in the Rose Garden with Italian Prime
Minister Giuliano Amato, did not respond to questions. But his
wife, campaigning in the state capital of New York, responded with
a hint of anger. Finally free of the issue that marred her tenure
as first lady and the early part of her Senate campaign, Mrs.
Clinton expressed confidence that Whitewater had been a non-issue
all along, saying most people had ``made up their minds a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that taxpayers have a right to ask why was all this
money spent, especially since...the conclusions were readily
available five years ago,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Whitewater case often left observers befuddled by
its many characters and tangled interactions, most of them
stretching back more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the complex case was a failed Arkansas
real-estate venture called Whitewater Development Corp., in which
the Clinton were partners with Jim and Susan McDougal. The inquiry
also covered the activities of former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy
Tucker and Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of Mrs. Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations Ray pursued were whether Mrs. Clinton had
concealed her involvement in a fraudulent land development deal
with Hubbell near Little Rock; whether President Clinton lied when
he said he knew nothing about about a fraudulent $300,000 loan to
Susan McDougal; whether money from the McDougals' failed S&AMP;L was
improperly used to prop up the Whitewater project; and whether the
Clintons funneled payments to Hubbell to keep him from cooperating
in the independent counsel's case.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people were convicted in the wide-ranging inquiry. The
McDougals, whose Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan Association cost
the public $73 million when it failed, were found guilty of fraud
in 1996. Jim McDougal later died in prison, and his wife, Susan,
spent a year and a half in prison for refusing to testify about
Clinton, who had given videotaped testimony in her trial.
</P>
<P>
   The inherent complexity of the case was part of the reason it
was allowed to drop, said Michael Johnston, a professor of
political science at Colgate University in New York. Asked whether
he understood the essence of the investigation, Johnston replied:
``No one does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been part of the problem all along. There have been a
variety of legal issues floating around, and you can reduce some of
it to conflict-of-interest against Hillary, but there's always been
a question of whether there's any there there,'' said Johnston.
``People talk about Clinton's lawyerly denials? Well, it looks
today like he got a very lawerly exoneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throughout his statement, Ray avoided the word
``innocent.'' Instead, he stressed that there was not enough
evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime
had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard is the correct one,'' said Viet Dinh, who was the
associate special counsel to the Senate Whitewater committee. Asked
whether it was still possible the Clintons had committed a crime,
Dinh said: ``Any responsible prosecutor has to make a judgment
whether or not he or she can prove criminal activity to a jury _
beyond a reasonable doubt. Short of that, it really is irrelevant
whether criminal charges should be brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial Whitewater case, first launched by
independent counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. and picked up by Starr in
August 1994, was intended to investigate only the business
ventures, Starr's inquiry was broadened to include allegations
about firings at the White House travel office, the compilation of
FBI files by White House officials, and, in 1998, the Lewinsky
case. Eventually, the president's testimony about Lewinsky became a
key reason for his impeachment by the House in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's vigorous pursuit of those investigations transformed the
special prosecutor's office into a hotbed of controversy, as
Democrats charged it was being used for a partisan ``witch hunt.''
Wednesday's announcement was sure to fuel that argument further
still.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marre Moerel, a fresh-faced, pigtailed, 34-year-old
lighting designer, walked through the industrial hangar where
Cappellini, the Italian furniture manufacturer, was having its
press preview during the Milan furniture fair last April, greeting
peers and smiling nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Moerel, who looks more like an Olympic swimmer than an ex-art
student, was on top of the world. Cappellini, the Vatican of design
houses, had just signed her and her lamps to a three-year contract.
To a young designer, it was an answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their collection is so immaculate, the most progressive,'' she
said last month, sitting in the kitchen of her Hester Street
apartment in New York (the shower was in the kitchen, too). What
Moerel discussed next is the part of design that never gets talked
about _ not what's new, what's now, but what's the deal: in this
case, a few thousand dollars, a 3 percent royalty on sales and no
promises to take what you do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically you can't live off of it,'' she said. Moerel's
monthly expenses are $2,000. She works as an artist's assistant to
pay her bills.
</P>
<P>
   The lamps will be produced to order; all bets are off on how
many that will be. Marcel Wanders' Shadow collection, which
Cappellini's New York showroom said does ``very well,'' sells 50
lamps a year here. Moerel periodically thinks about becoming a
sculptor again. ``A gallery would only take 50 percent, instead of
97,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the buzz, design is the hot topic right now _ it's
got its own vodka-sponsored events, its own young fashionable
audience pushing into the openings at stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching the art world of the 1980s take shape in the
design community,'' said Tony Whitfield, chairman of the product
design department at Parsons School of Design. With few exceptions,
though, young independent designers are the 21st century's new
starving artists, hard pressed to translate their talents into
careers with designs that will be manufactured, marketed or sold
with any success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media engine is producing design stars,'' Whitfield said,
``but if you examine their livelihoods, you'll find they're not
congruent.''
</P>
<P>
   Design's popular image resides in renegade figures like Philippe
Starck. The tattooed Starck is in Minneapolis presenting his vision
of inexpensive housewares to the Target Corp. Or Michael Graves _
Target has sold millions of dollars' worth of the architect's
merchandise since introducing it last year. Both designers received
a fee, plus less than 3 percent royalties. Or Karim Rashid, whose
1996 plastic Garbo trashcan for Umbra, retailing for approximately
$7, is a 1.5 million-unit bestseller. Karim got no design fee, but
a royalty of roughly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the buzz, and the new ubiquity of design awareness in
corporate America _ a k a jobs _ enrollment in design programs is
up at the fine art graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids, youth culture, exist with design in a way they never
have before,'' said Peter Stathis, who heads a design department at
Cranbrook Academy of Art. ``It was an invisible profession. Now
there is much more awareness from even parents that this is a
career option.''
</P>
<P>
   The student is changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it was a young male who had mechanical
aptitude,'' Stathis said. ``Design is much more about the control
of culture now. There are more women than ever, and over the last
two years, a change in nationality _ from 65 percent American and
European to 60 percent Asian. The Westernization of the world is
taking hold, and students want to be close to the culture that's
setting the tone of trends globally.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the ideas is the easy part, it turns out. Getting their
designs out of the studio and into your house is the problem many
young designers resist tackling or fail to solve. Independence has
its price.
</P>
<P>
   David Metzger's Brooklyn business, Design This, exhibited 10
basic wood furniture pieces in New York last year to much acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   With cost-effective manufacturing lined up in Romania to produce
the minimal designs with a maximum of craft, the designer took
large orders: 60 pieces from one store alone. Seeing the volume,
the manufacturer got cold feet and backed out. Metzger, a
cabinetmaker, executed a few individual pieces himself, refusing
the bulk orders. It cost him $60,000, out of his own blue-jeaned
pocket, to get the collection to the fair. He broke even.
</P>
<P>
   The designs themselves are now up for sale: Metzger is looking
for licensees. He is also looking for employment. His annual income
has been $50,000 for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger, 34, giggles with incredulity when you mention how hot
design is, or the great parties. ``Everybody sort of wants to be a
furniture designer now,'' he said. ``But it's difficult to do. It's
a weird thing. I've been independent for 10 years, and I look at
succumbing to corporate America as a failure.'' Metzger
acknowledged that a company like Crate &AMP; Barrel could effectively
make the designs inexpensively, in Indonesia, but that the level of
quality in the products would be lower than his intentions for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Granger Moorhead, 31, a Yale-trained architect, and his brother,
Robert, 27, a Rhode Island School of Design graduate in industrial
design, are now designing furniture together in the Canal Street
loft where the younger Moorhead also lives. The Moorheads exhibited
their first two products _ a folded-felt stool and a rubber hanging
lamp _ at the New York fair in May, as a way of running up their
flag. Ray Kennedy, director of Herman Miller for the Home, an
influential visitor to young designers trying to break out of
anonymity, took a hard sniff at the Moorheads' tiny booth but has
not made a move to pick the products up. A contract with Cappellini
or Herman Miller can be a step onto the ladder, toward work with
companies like Target.
</P>
<P>
   Granger's architectural commissions, with Robert's assistance,
pay the bills. The Moorheads haven't developed their designs with
manufacturing or a customer in mind, though like young designers'
standard heroes, the Eameses, they would like them to be
accessible, even affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been very practical about that,'' Robert
Moorhead said. ``My direction has never been with an end result in
mind. It's been more of an artistic exploration, discovering what
materials have to offer, and trying to express that.''
</P>
<P>
   Without making the calls, the wait for a break could be long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a hundred companies in the United States,'' Rashid
said, recalling the start of his design business in 1993.
``Letters, phone calls, going to visit. I got one client.'' His
office now has 22 employees and billings of over $1 million. He
has, by his count, executed 900 projects in seven years, including
Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid isn't interested in manufacturing his designs, either,
but has no problem in getting them produced. His advice: ``Young
designers tend to chase companies who are established as design
companies, like Cappellini,'' he said. ``Go to companies who are
unknown for design, visit the factory, see what the weaknesses are.
Starting working with them _ you can do critical things, and grow
together.''

   David Weeks' lighting designs were well received at the New York
furniture fair five years ago. His business, which now grosses
$150,000 annually, has had moderate success with commissions like
the lamps at the newly renovated Brasserie and with retail sales at
stores like Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really been a living until the last year or two,''
said Weeks, 32, sitting with his wife, Georgianna Stout, a partner
in 2 x 4, a New York design studio.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the business is hitting a ceiling. Weeks still makes the
lamps by hand, as he did when he started, subcontracting some of
the manufacturing to outside companies. He produces several hundred
lamps a year. He also answers the telephone and does his accounting
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks is reluctant to actively look for a business partner or
capitalization. He understands the potential value of a licensing
arrangement with a large company (he met with George Kovacs last
week) but is torn by the loss of control and equates that with
personal integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very instinctual business,'' he said. ``I'm not
one to get my investors organized and run with a product. I mean,
it should happen. It probably will in the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks recently diversified, designed a chair. A retailer has
approached him about producing it. The fee: $3,000, which would be
an advance on future royalties. He has formed Butter, a second
company, with Lindsey Adams, a fellow designer, to try
mass-marketing their inexpensive clip-on shade. It is being sold at
Urban Outfitters for $25. Butter has shipped 900 in three months,
but ``we have more bills than money right now,'' Weeks said.
</P>
<P>
   Other young companies, like Blu Dot in Minneapolis, have
established themselves surely _ and quickly _ by drafting a
business plan as a part of their design strategy. They also don't
design what can't be inexpensively produced, which made them
instantly attractive to companies like Crate &AMP; Barrel and Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design is 30 percent of it,'' said John Christakos, a partner.
``How do you build it, how do you ship it, how do you service it _
that's the other 70 percent. Practicality is the key word. We knew
that we would have to be smart about the pieces we designed and the
way they were built.'' Introduced at the New York furniture fair in
1997, Blu Dot had sales of $5 million this year. It is a rare
example of success as a new, young furniture design company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the star system lights the sky over the design scene, it
may be that the independent young designer is already a thing of
the past, an antiquated romantic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it's vanity is to belittle the pride of your work,''
Ellen Lupton, a curator with the Cooper-Hewitt National Design
Museum and its recent Triennial, said in defense of the importance
of designers' independence historically. ``To be able to control
your product _ its quality, the ownership of the design _ is very
valid. The Eameses are associated with their work for Herman
Miller, but they did it from their own studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students graduating now are taking corporate jobs, as
in-house designers for both big and small companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who went independent immediately,'' said Pearce
Lashmett, 28, design director of Nanz Custom Hardware in New York,
who graduated from Parsons last year. ``It seems kind of naive. I'm
designing hardware, overseeing graphics. I'm learning how to bite
into the market and get it done.'' His eventual independence is a
five-year plan, Lashmett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design as a kind of craft is going away,'' said Stathis at
Cranbrook. ``A lot of these boutique practices are becoming an
anachronistic model for producing design in America. It's not
necessarily a bad thing. Design is maturing. Designers need to,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   His new puppy playing under the table, the summer evening
turning to night, Weeks recalled his decision to become a designer,
and the career that he thought it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just make beautiful objects and the people will come,''
he said. ``That's what you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it doesn't always work that way.

OFFICIALS AWAIT AUTOPSY REPORT ON FORGOTTEN BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FARAH STOCKMAN AND MAC DANIEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A day after a five-month-old baby girl died in her car
seat because her father had forgotten to drop her off at a day care
center, law enforcement officials awaited pending results from an
autopsy on the infant.
</P>
<P>
   David Meier, chief prosecutor of the homicide unit for the
Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said the Medical
Examiner's Office performed the autopsy on Aliyah Bos Wednesday,
but investigators were still waiting for results of additional
tests taken during the exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation into the circumstances surrounding this
tragedy is ongoing,'' Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the parents of little Aliyah Bos remained in
seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew the couple described them as devoted,
family-oriented parents and caring neighbors with no criminal
record or any hint of child neglect, factors that seemed to weigh
heavily in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meier would not comment on whether prosecutors were considering
filing criminal charges against Aliyah's father, 31-year-old Peter
Bos, or what charges might apply in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the investiation is complete, once all the facts
surrounding this tragedy are known, we will make a reasoned
determination as to whether or not any criminal charges are
warrranted,'' Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one Boston police official, speaking hours after
the girl's death Tuesday night, indicated that he saw the girl's
death as a ``tragic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Bos, a 31-year-old web page programmer, told police he thought
he had taken the baby to her day care center in the city's West
Roxbury section before departing for work.
</P>
<P>
   Bos often dropped his daughter off at day care, according to
Bryan Nelson, whose wife, Linda, runs the home day care center
Aliyah attended.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Bos and his wife, Leslie, shared the responsibility
of dropping the girl off at Linda's House Family Child Care.
</P>
<P>
   But the baby usually didn't spend Tuesdays at the neat corner
home on Chilton Street in West Roxbury. Nelson said her parents had
called the Nelsons to make a special request to leave their
daughter in their care that day.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the parents made the request. According to
those who work with Leslie Bos at the Neighborhood Development
Corporation, the mother typically worked Mondays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   But baby Aliyah never arrived at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing it, Peter Bos told police, he drove his Saab 900
directly from the family's home on Wyman Street to work, with
Aliyah strapped into her rear-facing car seat.
</P>
<P>
   She remained locked inside the car, parked in an outdoor lot on
a 78-degree day with the windows rolled up. Bos did not realize
that his daughter had stayed in the car all day until he walked
into the day care center Tuesday evening and asked for his
daughter. Then, an employee told him the baby had never been
dropped off, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Bos raced back to his car and found the child
unconscious in the back seat. She died less than an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Arsenault of the state Office of Child Care Services said
the facility, Linda's Home Family Day Care, has been in good
standing with the state since the Nelsons first registered their
business in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Nelson, who is certified to take in no more than six
children, called the Office of Child Care Services to notify state
officials when Aliyah was found in the back of her father's car.
Arsenault said state officials are conducting a standard inquiry
and plan to provide support to the Nelson's day care center when
those checks are complete.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arsenault, no state regulations require day care
center providers to contact a parent if a child does not show up
when scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Bos Family members refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   But friends and acquaintances expressed sorrow and support for
the couple, married since 1996. Friends said the infant's death was
the worst punishment imaginable for two caring parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really beautiful people,'' said Nelson. He has known
the Bos family since their older, 3-year-old daughter began
attending day care there. ``It really is a tragedy,'' he said.

IMF SET TO GRAPPLE WITH AILING EURO AND RISING OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The slumping euro and fuel price
inflation quickly took over as the dominant themes on Wednesday in
advance of a global financial summit meeting, with the European
currency weakening to a new record low and oil prices reaching
another 10-year high.
</P>
<P>
   French leaders, alarmed at the soaring cost of oil and gasoline
that have aroused protests across Europe, demanded a unified stand
when they meet here this weekend among the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations for lower fuel prices. The top official of the
International Monetary Fund also warned of the risks of high oil
prices and, in unusually blunt remarks, urged the Group of Seven
countries to intervene in the currency markets to strengthen the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Horst Koehler, the IMF's managing director, put
pressure on the United States and its partners to attempt their
first global currency intervention since their rescue of the
falling Japanese yen two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a weak euro and expensive oil is considered
especially perilous in Europe just as new signs are emerging that
the region's vibrant economy may be slowing. On Wednesday, for
instance, Italy reported an unexpected slowdown in its quarterly
growth rate, and a widely watched indicator of business confidence
in Germany fell for the third consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius asked other big
oil-importing nations to jointly demand that oil exporters lower
what he called ``the massive and brutal rise in prices.'' He spoke
as the commodity price of a barrel of crude oil reached a high of
$37.80 before settling a bit lower.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, speaking to reporters here in the Czech capital, called
the euro ``heavily undervalued'' and urged that central bankers
take steps to increase its exchange rate against the dollar and the
Japanese yen. ``In my mind it is clear that intervention cannot be
a taboo,'' he said. ``My advice is to get the euro back to values
based on economic fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments reflected growing worries in Europe not only about
the euro's value but also its viability as the region's common
currency.
</P>
<P>
   When 11 West European nations, led by Germany and France,
introduced the currency in January 1999, some European leaders
thought it might soon displace the dollar as the world's preferred
storehouse of value.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the opposite has happened. The euro slipped from $1.17
at the start and is now suffering the worst rout of its 20-month
life, touching a new low in European trading on Wednesday of 84.44
cents, then improving in New York to settle at 84.72 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rising price of oil, which Koehler said had put
growth prospects in many importing countries in jeopardy, the IMF
has stressed that the weak euro could undermine generally
optimistic prospects for the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's diminished value means that much of the Continent
must pay more for imported goods, pushing up inflation and
potentially forcing the European Central Bank to raise interest
rates. That would slow the region's growth, which along with the
United States economy has contributed to the strongest world growth
in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disconcerting for European policy makers, the
currency's tumble comes a few days before Denmark is scheduled to
vote on whether to adopt the euro. New polls show that Danes have
turned decidedly negative on the euro as their Sept. 28 referendum
approaches, a serious blow to proponents of the single currency,
who hope to expand its domain to include other European nations,
especially Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The weak euro also has an impact in the United States by
strengthening the relative value of an already strong dollar.
Though the dollar has been a cornerstone of America's long economic
expansion, import-loving Americans have helped amass an
unprecedented trade deficit, now 4.3 percent of the gross domestic
product, a level many economists consider too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious psychological bubble that has pushed the
euro way down and the dollar way up,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head
of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ``and
it could do some serious damage. My conclusion is that the only way
they are going to turn this around is with a positive psychological
shock'' _ concerted intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten said the leading powers should repeat their rescue
operation of the sagging Japanese yen during the Asian financial
crisis of 1998. At that time, the United States, Europe and Japan
coordinated an effort to buy yen and scared off speculators who had
been driving the yen down. The yen rebounded, rising by almost a
third against the dollar and has remained largely stable.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior European officials have signaled that they favor
intervention, but Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers has so
far shown no interest in joining them. Without American
participation, any intervention will carry a high risk of failure.

LOS ANGELES AGREES TO LONG-SOUGHT CURBS ON POLICE CONDUCT
</HEADLINE>
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bowing to the inevitable, Los Angeles city
officials have agreed to accept a federal court agreement that
would require a series of long-sought changes in police management
and training, to head off a threatened civil rights lawsuit over
what the Justice Department has called a systemic pattern of
abusive conduct by officers.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted 10-2 on Tuesday to accept a binding
federal consent decree, after Mayor Richard J. Riordan rescinded
his threat of a veto and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks reluctantly
dropped his opposition. Riordan won office in 1993 on a pledge to
expand the police department and succeeded in doing so, only to
find himself over the last year facing the threatened lawsuit, plus
a separate local investigation into police corruption and
evidence-tampering that amounts to the worst such scandal in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which has not yet been given final approval by
the Justice Department and a federal court, would require the
department to collect data on the race of people stopped by
officers in an effort to determine the extent of racial profiling,
install a computerized system to track complaints and disciplinary
actions against officers, strengthen the civilian board of
commissioners that oversees the police and create a special
department unit to investigate shootings and use of force by
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just terrific as a first step to police reform,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the
University of Southern California and the author of a recent report
for the police union that had recommended similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only caution is that it's just a first step,'' Chemerinsky
said. ``I think it's very important that this not be the occasion
for declaring victory and moving on, because there's a lot it
doesn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the question of police conduct has been a major civic
and political issue here at least since the videotaped beating of
the motorist Rodney King in 1991 and a subsequent inquiry by Warren
Christopher, which recommended broad changes in police management,
some of which, like the tracking system for problem officers, have
been delayed and argued over ever since. One goal of the threatened
lawsuit, which federal officials announced in May, has been to
force such changes now.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the assistant attorney general for civil rights,
expressed satisfaction at the council's vote. ``This is yet another
positive step, and we look forward to working with the negotiating
team to reach a final agreement,'' Lee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been conducting its inquiry since
1996, centering on excessive use of force by officers. It is
operating under a 1994 federal law inspired by the King beating and
the 1992 riots sparked by the acquittal of officers charged in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizes federal prosecutors to go to court to force
changes in the operations of local departments if it finds a
``pattern and practice'' of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles would be the largest city to come under such
supervision, but the Justice Department has already reached consent
decrees with police departments in Pittsburgh and Steubenville,
Ohio, and with the New Jersey state police, where the aim was to
bar racial profiling in traffic stops by troopers. The U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn has amassed what officials call
evidence of systemwide problems in the New York Police Department's
handling of brutality complaints, and the office is pressing New
York for changes with the threat of a similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   The city attorney and a majority of the Democratic-controlled
City Council here, many of whose members have been seeking changes
in the Police Department for years, had favored a consent decree,
which would be overseen by an independent monitor and supervised by
a federal judge. But Riordan, a Republican, and Parks had bitterly
resisted any measure that smacked of ceding local control and had
resisted collecting data on racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan agreed to support an agreement as long as it ensured
that city officials would retain management of the department, that
paperwork for officers would be minimized and that the consent
decree would expire after five years unless the Justice Department
sought to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Police Department reports to a board of
commissioners appointed by the mayor, but it has long enjoyed an
unusual degree of autonomy and resisted civilian oversight. Voters
approved creation of the office of an inspector general,
recommended by Christopher's commission, to review department
conduct, but the first two people to take that post have complained
that the department resisted requests for documents and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question about the consent decree is will Parks
comply,'' said Joe Domanick, the author of ``To Protect and to
Serve,'' a 1994 history of the department. ``Because it goes
against his entire professional and temperamental grain. But I do
think it'll have to be a bit different now, because if the chief
doesn't comply, then the monitor can take the department to federal
court and order him to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other elements the Justice Department has said would be
part of an agreement are tightened controls of the police
department units that monitor gangs, stricter guidelines for the
use of confidential informants and a campaign of ``community
outreach'' aimed at restoring public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, the city has been shaken by a police corruption
scandal that came to light after a former officer in an anti-gang
unit confessed to shooting an unarmed suspect and leaving him
paralyzed, then testifying falsely at trial to send him to jail.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 100 convictions have been thrown out by judges
and prosecutors and 20 officers have left active duty. Officials
say they expect more than 250 lawsuits to be filed by people
wrongly accused of crimes, with potential legal costs to the city
running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

 &HT;    Pack's Rivers will test Tech's pass defense
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ North Carolina State has combined the passing of
freshman phenom Philip Rivers with a heavy dose of good luck to win
its first three games under new coach Chuck Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack needed two overtimes to beat Arkansas State and
then had to score in the final minute to beat mediocre Indiana.
Last Saturday, State dismantled SMU, 41-0.
</P>
<P>
   The start has everyone wondering if the Pack is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the guy on the street,'' Amato said. ``How good
are we? We're 3-0. There's some teams out there that are 1-2 that
are saying, 'We're the best 1-2 team in the country.' I'd rather
say I'm the worst 3-0 team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers really has been phenomenal. The 6-foot-5, 221-pounder
from Athens, Ala., has completed 57.1 percent of his attempts in
passing for 1,069 yards. He also has accounted for 10 touchdowns
and has only two interceptions in 133 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Tech ranks 111th in the nation in pass defense, so the Jackets
have been making some changes this week to both strategy and
personnel. ``If they stay in character and don't change, we expect
them to throw it against us,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said.
``We'll know we're in trouble if our coverage isn't what it is
supposed to be or if we're not rushing (the passer) well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets practiced their nickel defense all week and
experimented with a defensive line of Nick Rogers, Felipe
Claybrooks, Greg Gathers and Merrix Watson. That lineup is quick
but small. Rogers weighs 250, Claybrooks 255, Gathers 260 and
Watson 285.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets plan to go after Rivers. They hope to hurry him and
give their defensive backfield chances for interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary shakeup, freshman Jonathan Cox will start in
place of Jamara Clark at cornerback. Marvious Hester, back from his
pulled hamstring, will be at the other corner. Strong safety Chris
Young and free safety Jeremy Muyres remain at their positions, and
Tech will add safety Cory Collins as the nickel back.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Daryl Smith is starting his second game at middle
linebacker, and the speedy Recardo Wimbush is playing outside
linebacker, to give O'Leary his fastest defensive unit in his six
years

COUPLE CLEARED OF RESPONSIBILITY IN DEATHS OF SIX FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The homeless couple who tipped over a candle and set an
abandoned warehouse afire cannot be held responsible for the deaths
of six men who died fighting the blaze, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Timothy Hillman threw out manslaughter
charges against Julie Barnes and Thomas Levesque, saying they had
no legal duty to make an emergency call when they accidentally set
the Dec. 3, 1999 fire in Worcester, Mass. And he said the pair
could not have imagined the fatal consequences of a blaze that, one
deputy fire chief has said, went from routine to deadly in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that not only a reasonable person, but a
reasonable experienced firefighter, would have failed to realize
the gravity of this danger,'' Hillman wrote in a 15-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the decision marked a surprising turn in a case
that had divided a city. Worcester is still pained by the loss of
the firemen, but some have cautioned against a search for
scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' attorney, Michael Wilcox, said Hillman made a brave
legal stand in the face of public pressure to hold someone
responsible for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did feel that it would take a good deal of courage to do
what this judge did, in light of the enormity of the tragedy,''
Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the Worcester firefighters' union said that
though he accepts Hillman's reading of the law, he'd prefer the law
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Raffa, said his union will push for a bill requiring
people to report fires, or face prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something that is wrong, you need to report it to
the proper authorities, so we can avert future tragedies,'' Raffa
said. ``I think we maybe need to take a second look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the decision trickled through the city, most public
officials were careful to take a more neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
   Acting City Manager David Moore said he hoped the ruling would
``aid the healing process for all involved.'' And he noted the fire
has spurred some action on the city's part: a task force charged
with reducing the dangers of Worcester's many abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are taking steps to tear down a cold storage
building that's similar to the insulated, maze-like warehouse that
claimed the firemens' lives in December, he said. And they are
considering a contract with a company that secures vacant buildings
with material sturdier than plywood.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic good to come from the fire, ironically
enough, has been in the lives of Barnes and Levesque, as their
attorneys noted. Both have scant education, troubled family
backgrounds, and mental disabilities. But they now have access to
wider networks of support than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   An on-again, off-again couple, the pair spent the years before
the fire drifting between homeless shelters, friends' homes and
hotel rooms, and a room they had set up after prying open the
vacant warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was pregnant with Levesque's child; she gave birth to a
boy in June, while still in prison. The child is in the custody of
the Massachusetts Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months in prison, Levesque was freed and had a
tearful reunion with his parents, said his attorney, Edward P. Ryan
Jr. Now, he said, Levesque plans to enter a residential program
that will teach him to live independently.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan would not identify the program, but said he had been
working to place Levesque there for months, in the hope that he
could convince Hillman to reduce Levesque's bail.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman had released Barnes from prison in July, into the
custody of unlikely patrons: the Ellsworth, Maine family that had
adopted her younger sister. Debb and Tim King raised Barnes'
$25,000 bail, and brought her into their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our new daughter,'' Debb King said of Barnes, who was
aware of the decision, but hardly reacted to it. ``I don't think
she really understands, or it hasn't hit her.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Kings are now seeking guardianship of Barnes, and want
to become foster parents to her infant son Joshua. They have found
a job for Barnes in a nursing home, through a state job placement
program for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   And they are trying to contain their excitement, King said, in
case Worcester District Attorney John Conti's office decides to
appeal Hillman's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Conti only said he is reviewing the decision,
and weighing his options. It was also unclear whether several
firefighters' widows, who have filed a negligence lawsuit against
the building's owner, would also sue Barnes and Levesque.
</P>
<P>
   But as Worcester residents debate the usefulness of a civil
suit, or the wisdom of Hillman's ruling, they still share one clear
enemy, Raffa said: the now-razed building where the fire took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We avoid that site as much as possible,'' Raffa said. ``And if
you're forced to drive by the site, you don't look at it.''

PEDRO 9, INDIANS 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a playful dig, but nonetheless a sure sign the
Indians relished their first victory over Pedro Martinez in 10
tries. When second baseman Roberto Alomar heard that Martinez had
complained about the size of the strike zone, he leveled one last
hit at the Red Sox righthander. With mock seriousness, Alomar said,
``There's no crying in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians worked hard for their win by attacking Martinez'
fastball in the first inning, and they would not have their
accomplishment diminished. Stoically, the Indians had suffered
through loss after demoralizing loss to Martinez. Until Wednesday.
In Game 1 of the twi-night doubleheader, the Indians defeated
Martinez and the Red Sox, 2-1, at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a win over (Pedro) is a huge win,'' said Alomar, who
went 1 for 4 but drove in the lone run scored against Martinez.
``If we are able to get where we want (into the playoffs), we have
to beat the big pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe would not willingly admit that Martinez held a
psychological advantage over them, but past results provided enough
evidence. Thanks to Cleveland, Martinez rose to mythic status in
Red Sox Nation with his Game 5 performance in the American League
Divisional Series last fall. Pitching injured out of the bullpen,
Martinez appeared to intimidate the Indians by simply standing on
the mound as he allowed no hits in six innings in securing the win.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter whether or not he had his best stuff that
night. Martinez toyed with the Cleveland psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got a couple of hits together in the first
inning,'' said Omar Vizquel, who went 2 for 3 against Martinez.
``We really wanted to get him because we know he has been
outstanding against us for a while. You always feel like you want
to win against this guy. It doesn't matter how. You always have
that playoff atmosphere in your mind. We beat them one time. They
beat us one time. It's always like a rivalry between the two
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez changed his approach after surrendering three hits in
the first and watching the Indians rocket one fastball after
another into right-field singles. According to Vizquel, the ace
threw more breaking balls after the opening inning than he had in
the past. But he was still effective, getting first-pitch strikes
with breaking balls and changeups.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Cleveland hitters took an aggressive approach
and made solid contact. The singles hit by Lofton, Vizquel, and
Alomar were not lightly skipping grounders. In fact, Vizquel hit
the ball so hard it blasted past first baseman Brian Daubach before
he could get his glove down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at Pedro as Pedro and try to battle that at bat,''
said Lofton, who went 2 for 4 with a home run in the ninth off
Derek Lowe. ``We're always aggressive. We just don't get no hits
out of it. It just happened that the ball fell today.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When you face Pedro), you try to swing at strikes because his
ball moves so much. You got to make sure you swing at strikes or
you swing at pitches that he wants you to swing at and it gets you
in trouble. All in all, I think we kept our composure.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez settled down after the first inning, the early
lead gave the Indian hitters all the confidence they needed. It's
confidence carried over from a Monday night victory over Roger
Clemens. It's confidence the Indians hope will sustain them as the
fight for the AL wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to beating Pedro for a long time,''
said Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel. ``I think everybody in
baseball knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody in baseball knows they can.

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An independent prosecutor Wednesday put an end to
the six-year Whitewater investigation, saying he had concluded that
there was insufficient evidence to show that either President
Clinton or his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had committed any
crimes in connection with the Arkansas real estate venture that
vexed his presidency through two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray, the prosecutor, said that he could not prove that
the president or first lady had been involved in any criminal
behavior in connection with a set of complicated Whitewater-related
financial and legal transactions in Arkansas. Nor, he said, could
he prove that they had concealed information from investigators or
obstructed justice in any manner related to Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   In clearing both the president and his wife of any criminal
wrongdoing, Ray was notable in the the spareness of his language.
On each of the allegations his office investigated, he said only
that ``the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt'' that they had committed any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ray's statement was a definitive legal conclusion
on the issue and thus was regarded by the White House and its
supporters as a significant victory, especially for the first lady,
who is running for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions also appeared to largely undercut
concerns that it was unfair to Mrs. Clinton for Ray to issue a
statement only weeks before she faces Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican
congressman from Long Island, in the Senate voting. The Ray
statement seemed to provide little ammunition for her opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater investigation began in January 1994 when the
president asked for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate
his Whitewater land dealings. That investigation began with
accusations that the Clintons had received special treatment from
their fellow investors in the land venture on the White River,
James and Susan McDougal, because he was the governor of Arkansas,
a subject that was first raised in a news article in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   From that narrow beginning, the investigation expanded several
times to cover a wide range of allegations that eventually came to
include whether Clinton lied under oath about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a one-time White House intern. That issue resulted
in Clinton's impeachment in the House in 1998 and his acquittal in
the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, was quick to issue a
brief statement Wednesday, saying, ``Robert Ray is now the latest
investigator to complete an examination of the transactions related
to Whitewater Development Co. and conclude that there are no
grounds for legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-page statement from Ray is a summary of his final
report on the matter, which will number in the hundreds of pages
and will contain far more detail of his investigation. Ray said he
has not yet submitted that report under seal to a special panel of
three federal judges as the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he is waiting to wrap up some loose ends, notably an
investigation begun this year as to whether anyone in the White
House concealed e-mail messages from investigators. That
investigation is not expected to involve the Clintons directly,
law-enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves as Ray's principal remaining task a decision over
whether to indict Clinton after he leaves office for his sworn
statements in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has said that he and a recently empaneled grand jury will
announce that decision shortly after the new president is
inaugurated next January.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the investigation of the Clintons' investment in
Whitewater was the question of whether the first lady in her role
as a lawyer in Arkansas worked to prop up a failing savings and
loan association. The savings and loan, Madison Guaranty, was used
to keep the Whitewater investment afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Guaranty eventually collapsed at a cost to the federal
government of nearly $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues investigated by Ray was the unexplained
disappearance of the first lady's billing records when she was an
Arkansas lawyer. They were initially sought by investigators to
determine how much she might have known about real estate
transactions that were eventually deemed a sham to deceive federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the records was found in the family quarters of the
White House in January 1996, some 18 months after they were first
subpoenaed by investigators. Ray said his investigation of the
records' disappearance was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The statement on Whitewater was the third such one issued by
Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr last October.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Ray investigated how the White House came to
improperly acquire hundreds of confidential FBI personnel files,
many of them of prominent Republicans, and concluded that it was
the result of unwitting mistakes by low-level officials in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He was generous in his language then, saying there was ``no
credible evidence'' that either the president or first lady had
secretly collected the files to gather intelligence on Republican
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In his second report last June, Ray cleared the first lady of
charges that she engineered the dismissal of seven longtime
employees of the White House travel office and their replacement
with friends and relatives. In contrast to the previous report, Ray
seemed to criticize Clinton, saying her sworn statements that she
was not involved were misleading, but did not warrant criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's statement used similar narrow language, declining to
declare as he did six months ago that there was no credible
evidence to support the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either president or
Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct
involving Madison Guaranty, CMS or Whitewater Development or knew
of such conduct,'' he wrote. CMS is Capital Management Services
Inc., a company operated by an Arkansas figure named David Hale who
had dealings with Madison Guaranty.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, where she was campaigning, the first lady told
reporters that, ``I'm just glad that this is finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   She said at a meeting in Albany of state members of The
Associated Press: ``I think that most New Yorkers and Americans had
made up their minds a long time ago about this.'' She added that,
``Now everybody can just move on and be focused on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the issue of the billing records, Ray
investigated several other Whitewater-related allegations that he
effectively divided into two categories: the Clinton's involvement
in Whitewater and whether they attempted to cover up information
from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In the first category, Ray investigated the charge that Clinton
telephoned an official in her husband's administration to receive
preferential treatment for Madison Guaranty. Clinton said she could
not remember having made the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of whether the Clintons gave misleading
testimony or blocked investigators, Ray investigated several other
issues, concluding that there was insufficient evidence that a jury
could be convinced a crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those issues was whether the president knowingly gave
false testimony in 1996 at the trial of James McDougal and Gov. Jim
Guy Tucker of Arkansas when he said that he never sought to borrow
any money from Madison Guaranty, and when he said that he was
unaware of a $300,000 loan made to CMS, David Hale's company, by
Madison Guaranty.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he also investigated how the first lady came to
represent Madison Guaranty. The first lady had said several times
that a young associate in the firm, Richard J. Massey, had brought
in the firm as a client. Massey testified that while he tried to
bring in Madison he was not responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ray investigated whether either of the Clintons
helped arrange employment for Webster Hubbell, a former associate
attorney general, ``as a criminal quid pro quo'' to buy his silence
and prevent him from testifying about their involvement in a
variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a longtime friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, who
served in the Justice Department's number three position in the
early Clinton years was convicted by the independent counsel and
went to jail on charges of defrauding his former law firm. After he
left office, he was given lucrative consulting contracts by Clinton
supporters.

NO CHARGES IN DEATH OF MAN BEATEN BY AIR PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City have decided not
to file any charges in the death of a 19-year-old man who was
beaten by fellow passengers last month after he broke into the
cockpit of a Southwest Airlines flight to Salt Lake from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   As many as eight of the 120 passengers on the Boeing 737 subdued
the man, Jonathan Burton of Las Vegas, who was removed from the jet
after it landed and taken to a Salt Lake hospital, where he was
pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators and prosecutors declined to provide
details of the incident or the investigation that followed,
including the names of the other passengers involved in the
incident. But the U.S. attorney for Utah, Paul Warner, who
concluded last week that the death was a homicide, said the
passengers who subdued Burton acted out of self-defense and did not
demonstrate ``criminal intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Stewart, a spokesman for the airline, said on Wednesday that
it was ``crystal clear'' Burton was trying to disrupt the flight,
calling his actions ``less an example of air rage than an attempted
hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said Burton had tried several times to break in the
cockpit door, succeeding on his third attempt, which prompted the
passengers to wrestle him to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all accounts,'' Stewart said, ``he was hitting everybody.
It was a matter of trying to restrain him. By his third attempt to
get into the cockpit, children were crying, it was pandemonium.
People were in panic. Everybody who had him grabbed an arm or a
leg. One guy trying to grab him wound up with a busted lip.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one passenger on the flight, a Canadian who was not
interviewed by American investigators, offered an account of events
that suggested one passenger, more than the others, might have
caused some of the injuries that led to Burton's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian passenger, Dean Harvey, who was traveling with his
wife and infant son on the Aug. 11 flight, told The Edmonton
Journal that he had seen ``a burly man'' jump onto Burton's chest
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to stop,'' Harvey was quoted as saying in an
article that appeared on Wednesday. ``I said, `You've got the guy
subdued. What more do you want? You don't have to pound his head
in.' The guy was being held with his arms outstretched. He had no
chance to absorb the shock.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing Burton's family, Kent Spence of Jackson,
Wyo., said on Wednesday that he was unaware that a passenger had
publicly described what he saw on the flight. Spence, the son of
the prominent defense lawyer, Gerry Spence, said neither the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, federal prosecutors nor Southwest
Airlines would share any information about the incident or the
investigation, other than the medical examiner's autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
   That report said that Burton suffered injuries to his torso,
face and neck and died of suffocation and that when police arrived,
`` Burton was lying face down with at least one individual standing
on his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence said that Burton's family had not decided whether to file
a wrongful death lawsuit. But, he said, he would try to contact
Harvey to hear his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Matthews, a spokesman for the Salt Lake office of the FBI,
said investigators had interviewed ``most everybody on the plane,
those we could locate'' and included the results of the interviews
in a report to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents could not locate Harvey until Tuesday, Matthews
said, and on Wednesday were trying to arrange a time to interview
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews said agents wanted to talk to Harvey ``out of the
course of business, like any other passenger, not because he made
any fantastic claims.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his account to The Journal, Harvey and his wife,
Flavia, saw Burton ``flying down the aisle towards the cockpit,
yelling, `I can fly this plane! I can fly this plane!'''
</P>
<P>
   With about 20 minutes left in the 75-minute flight, Harvey told
the newspaper, he saw Burton break through the cockpit door. ``He
reaches right in with both arms and grabs each pilot, one with each
arm,'' he said, adding that Burton was then surrounded and
restrained by five people, including the man who began jumping on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said he had determined that a ``verbal altercation'' had
occurred on the flight between Burton and a flight attendant,
adding that Harvey's account was the first he had heard suggesting
that Burton broke into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Salt Lake, said Warner had decided not to prosecute anyone because
he did not believe he could gain a homicide conviction, which
requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said that the results of the interview with Harvey
would be sent to the prosecutors, who would consider whether his
account was reason to re-examine the case. But Matthews said he did
not believe agents would spend much more time on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, once they decline to prosecute, we're finished,''
he said.

 &HT;    Crooked workers cost stores
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Best Buy stores around metro Atlanta, it's hard not to notice
the security.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow-shirted employees _ called loss prevention specialists _
are stationed near the doors to check customers' receipts and
monitor a bank of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't just watching for potential shoplifters, however.
They're spying on employees as well.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy and other retailers are trying to stem an increase in
employee theft, which is stealing the spotlight from shoplifting as
a costly problem.
</P>
<P>
   Employee theft is expected to cost U.S. retailers about $12.85
billion in 2000, up from $11 billion in 1997. It will account for
44.2 percent of U.S. retailers' inventory loss, or ``shrinkage,''
according to the latest data from the National Retail Security
Survey compiled by the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting worse,'' said Richard Hollinger, a sociology
professor and author of the survey. A tight labor market and high
turnover don't help the situation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is the economy is in robust shape and lots of
consumers have disposable income. But the bad news is retailers are
lowering the bar on hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The average dollar loss per employee theft incident was
$1,004.35, compared with $158.86 for the average shoplifting
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees have great access to assets,'' said Bruce Van
Kleeck, vice president of member services at the National Retail
Federation. ``They know the systems and know the security people.
They have a number of advantages over the typical shoplifter.''
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with better technology, retailers are rooting out
tactics such as ``hook-ups,'' a term for store employees helping
friends shoplift.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, for instance, a Home Depot cashier was arrested
for a hook-up. According to an Atlanta Police Department incident
report, an employee at the Sidney Marcus Boulevard store in
Buckhead rang up $4.25 in merchandise, allowing a man she knew to
leave the store with a shopping cart full of Motorola two-way
radios, a dog kennel and other goods worth more than $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot security cameras caught the entire transaction on
tape, the police report said. It also said that Home Depot had
suspected the cashier of similar transactions so the company was
watching the employee closely.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wolfe, vice president of loss prevention at Home Depot, would
not elaborate. But generally, he said, ``the difference between a
shoplifter is they come and hit you one time. Employees can do the
stealing 40 hours a week. In reality, you don't catch them the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scams include making returns with gift receipts. Some
retailers send customers home with two receipts, one for the sale
and another to be used for gift returns.
</P>
<P>
   Dishonest employees allow friends to buy merchandise with cash
to obtain both receipts, then steal an identical set of
merchandise. Later, all the goods are returned for cash using both
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Another mode of stealing involves ``Dumpster diving.'' The
employee puts merchandise in trash bags and throws it out with the
garbage. Later, after the store closes, the employee or cohorts
retrieve the goods.
</P>
<P>
   To combat such incidents, retailers are spying on employees with
undercover shoppers, cash register alert systems and cameras that
watch everything from bagging activity at the register to trash
disposal out back. Some require trash to be taken out in clear bags
so security workers can easily check what's in them.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera, the Alpharetta-based photo and camera chain,
deploys mystery shoppers who secretly watch suspect employee
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Murphy, a loss prevention specialist at Wolf, said the
biggest problem is with employees who ring up cash transactions as
``no sales'' and pocket the money instead. Some employees ring up
fake returns for the cash.
</P>
<P>
   At Best Buy's store in Smyrna, loss prevention specialist Jason
Craven can manipulate his electronic surveillance camera and tilt,
pan or zoom in on anything with a joystick. At the door, he
searches bags, including those of exiting store managers.
</P>
<P>
   The chain pays bonuses to employees who turn in dishonest
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Beedle, a Best Buy spokeswoman at the company's Eden
Prairie, Minn., headquarters, said the measures help keep inventory
shrinkage well below the national average of 1.73 percent of total
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some companies allocating more resources to it than
ever before,'' said Douglas Wicklander, partner of Wicklander
Zulawski &AMP; Associates, nationally recognized specialists in loss
prevention and investigative services. ``Technology is enabling
retailers to be more effective at their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Clucas, a marketing executive with Sensormatic Electronics
Corp., the nation's largest electronic security systems provider,
said his company sold $650 million worth of services in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have black boxes (attached to cash registers) that tie into
camera systems,'' Clucas said, citing an example of one anti-theft
system. ``Those black boxes take in the data of transactions and
alert management to suspicious under-rings and returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 11 bookstore, which has 13 locations in metro Atlanta,
recently fired two employees who stole more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been going on for six to nine months,'' said Barbara
Babbit Kaufman, president of the bookstore chain. ``It was not easy
to track down, but we made a few changes and started graphing
things going on in the store. The problem highlighted itself, and
we pinpointed what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee theft can be toughest on smaller retailers, which
typically don't have deep pockets for security. Kaufman said it's
too costly to install anti-theft devices.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the dishonest workers she fired are not in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose to get rid of the trouble rather than prosecute,''
Kaufman said. The legal fees, she said, would put Chapter 11 out of
business.

 &HT;    Aikman says he's starting
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman has been cleared to play football
again, and will be the starting quarterback Sunday against San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he says, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman told about 20 bystanders in front of his locker that he
will resume his role in the starting lineup for the Dallas Cowboys.
That came as news to Coach Dave Campo, who said such a decision has
not been made.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, owner Jerry Jones said Aikman will start unless
symptoms of his latest concussion return.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion came 17 days after Aikman sustained the ninth
concussion of his career in a game against Philadelphia. Aikman was
benched two games while he had headaches and nausea, but the
12-year pro said Wednesday that he is ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't play if I thought I'd be tentative,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate that happening. It never has in the past.
If it is, I'd be the first to say I shouldn't be playing. I don't
think you can play the game effectively if you're concerned about
getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman took the majority of snaps at Wednesday afternoon's
practice at Valley Ranch. He took most of the snaps last week, too,
but he was ruled out of Monday night's game against Washington
after a team of doctors recommended he skip it.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he was medically cleared to play Wednesday. Campo
responded by saying he did not know his top quarterback was given a
clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than last week,'' Campo said, admittedly
surprised Aikman declared himself the starter. ``He took snaps last
week. We'll make a decision (on who starts at quarterback) at the
appropriate time. If he's ready, he'll be our starter.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a sensitive issue in Dallas because backup
quarterback Randall Cunningham has played well in Aikman's absence.
He led the Cowboys to a surprising 27-21 victory over Washington on
Monday, which started speculation that there is a quarterback
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case, according to players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more in the outside arena,'' Campo said. ``Our football
team wants to win. We're going to go out to win the football game
against San Francisco. That's the only thing we have in our minds.
There are no agendas here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan McNeil said there will be no hard feelings if
Aikman replaces Cunningham on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows their role,'' he said. ``That's one thing
(Cunningham) made clear when he signed here. His job is to lead the
team when No. 8 is not available. And he's done a great job with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has completed 47 of 83 passes for 563 yards, six
touchdowns and two interceptions in three games. He has made some
dazzling runs, something Aikman is not noted for, and has thrown
deep passes with pinpoint precision.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered his concussion in the first half of
Philadelphia's 41-14 victory Sept. 3 at Texas Stadium. He passed
five times, completing none, and was removed after being sacked for
the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   Although he admitted having severe headaches, he wanted to play
the following week against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said those headaches have disappeared. Furthermore, he
does not believe his teammates will protest if he replaces
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this town for 12 years and it's never mattered
who is backing me up,'' he said. ``There is an expectation to
perform, and when that doesn't happen, people let you know about
it. I don't think there is any added pressure now.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo has done his best to convince people there is no
quarterback controversy. Aikman, the highest paid player in the
NFL, will be re-evaluated today, and a decision on his availability
will be made by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the fact that Troy's excited about
playing,'' Campo said.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ With Yugoslavia's presidential election
only days away, the two main rivals held competing rallies here
Wednesday night, speaking as if to two separate nations, with
President Slobodan Milosevic taking up the fight for his future in
an extraordinarily personal fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in memory, Milosevic made two appearances in
a single day, delivering slashing attacks on opposition leaders at
rallies in Montenegro and in Belgrade, calling them ``rabbits, rats
and even hyenas'' who had ``the loyalty of dogs'' to the NATO
masters ``who bribe and pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, his main opponent, Vojislav Kostunica, appeared
before an enormous, excited crowd estimated at 100,000 people,
urging them to vote for his own vision of ``a normal European
democratic country'' where ``the government is not afraid of the
people, and the people are not afraid of their government.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election on Sunday, the campaign suddenly seemed to
take on weight and moment, with Milosevic trying to beat back the
challenge of those he considers traitors while the opposition
gathered courage from numbers and from the obvious nervousness of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, hoarse and tired from his campaign of retail politics
across Serbia, urged the crowd to have courage, saying, ``There is
a great chance and hope that after these elections, we will begin a
new life in a different Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a country that is ``hostage to one man,'' he said,
``I know you want to live in a good, democratic European state, one
that is free inside and free abroad, too, that is independent, with
a normal economy, industry, banking system, social and health care
and media.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd shouted slogans like ``He's finished!'' about
Milosevic, and ``Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was happy, helped by the performance of two famous
Yugoslav musicians, Bajaga and Bora Djordjevic, who endorsed
Kostunica. Nebojsa Ristic, a television journalist jailed for 339
days by the government for supporting free speech, also endorsed
Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on an outdoor stage in front of parliament, Kostunica
was flanked by the leaders of 18 opposition parties who had chosen
him as their joint candidate. While some have said they are
uncomfortable with his deeply felt nationalism, they decided that
Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, was their best answer to
Milosevic's appeal to Serbian patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, both in his speech and an earlier appearance on state
television, spoke in strong terms Wednesday night about ``NATO's
criminal bombing of Yugoslavia'' last year and the damage the war
did to the ``international legal order.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his assertion that the tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, that indicted Milosevic on charges of war crimes at
the end of the Kosovo War ``is an American tribunal _ not a court,
but a political instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said again that he disagreed with the indictment of
Milosevic, ``which puts Serbia in a difficult position'' and gives
Milosevic ``no way out except to make the whole country his
hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's appearance in Montenegro was his first visit to
Serbia's sister republic in four years, and he went to a carefully
protected military air field in Berane, just across the border from
Serbia, an indication of how little he can call Montenegro his own.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, split with
Milosevic in 1998 and has turned to the West while edging toward
independence from Serbia. Djukanovic has urged a boycott of the
Yugoslav elections, but up to a third of Montenegro's 440,000
voters are likely to cast ballots in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, before about 10,000 people, Milosevic mocked
Djukanovic and Serbia's opposition leaders as those ``bribed and
blackmailed by the mighty,'' calling them rats ``who want to turn
this great nation into a permed poodle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Djukanovic would surrender Montenegro's true
freedom and independence, and that its traditional musical
instruments and costumes would be reduced to museum exhibits ``for
American stars and British spinsters to see after they swim for
free on the beaches of Sveti Stefan,'' a famous Montenegrin resort.
</P>
<P>
   While bellicose, he was also conciliatory, urging Montenegrins
to carefully consider their future. ``I think your interests are to
live with Serbia, but it is up to you to whether or not you wish to
live with Serbia or if you choose another way,'' Milosevic said.
``Whatever happens, I wish you good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative blue suit and white shirt, Milosevic appeared
confident. ``How long Yugoslavia will survive will depend on the
Montenegrin and Serbian people,'' he said. ``If they want to live
together, no one will be able to separate them.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd, many bused in from other parts of northern
Montenegro and some from Serbia, cheered and clapped for Milosevic,
who stayed barely 35 minutes. They shouted, ``We love you, Slobo,''
and ``We are all Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   He then returned to Belgrade, apparently by helicopter, for a
second rally Wednesday night, opening a sports hall originally
built for a 1994 world basketball championship that international
sanctions made impossible to hold here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a conservatively dressed crowd estimated at
15,000 people, who gave him standing ovations and rhythmic
applause, Milosevic continued to attack his opposition as tools of
the same Western countries that bombed Yugoslavia. He said the
opposition was inspired by the West ``to spread terrorism and
crime'' and ``to destroy families through religious sects, spy
groups and drug lords.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those alleged political parties, united or on their own _ it
makes no difference _ are tasked with spreading lies and defeatism,
provoking crime and terrorism, inciting chauvinism,'' Milosevic
said. He accused the opposition of ``abusing children and youth
through sects and other intelligence organizations, terrorist
groups and the narco-Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance in Montenegro was the main feature on state
television, whose broadcast was also shown simultaneously on every
channel in Belgrade, something unprecedented even during the war,
when state television headquarters was bombed by the Atlantic
alliance. (One young girl of 7 was infuriated when ``Baywatch'' was
pre-empted by Milosevic in Montenegro, asking her mother whether
something was wrong with the television set.)
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians interpreted Milosevic's appearances as a
sign of nervousness about the results of the election; he continues
to trail Kostunica in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote on Sunday, a
runoff between the two top finishers will be held two weeks later.
But opposition leaders believe that Milosevic will find a way _
even through electoral fraud _ to declare victory in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also appealed Wednesday to the army and the
police not to let themselves be used to save Milosevic if he loses
the election. ``Your sacred duty is to defend the country and peace
in it, and this means to respect the will of the people,'' the
opposition said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of staff of the Yugoslav military, Gen. Nebojsa
Pavkovic, said Wednesday night that the army would accept Kostunica
as head of state if he wins the election. Pavkovic, who has come
out in support of Milosevic, repeated his view that the military
would support the elected head of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no controversy over the fact that the military will
accept the victory of Vojislav Kostunica if he is elected
president,'' Pavkovic told Montenegrin state television.
</P>
<P>
   It was less clear what would happen if both Milosevic and
Kostunica declared victory, or if the opposition went into the
streets to protest a rigged victory by Milosevic.

 &HT;    Other tires brands linked to Firestoen trouble
 &HT;    By Kevin Carmody
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At first Laura Cartwright felt relieved when the
tires on her 1997 Ford Explorer turned out to be Seiberling brand
Trailriders, not one of the three Firestone models recalled last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But then she started wondering about the safety record of those
Seiberling tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept checking the Internet and calling tire stores and
nobody seemed to know much about those tires. But finally a guy at
a discount tire store had me check the manufacturing code, which
was VDHL,'' said Cartwright, a movie production supervisor. ``When
he came back to the phone he said: `Oh oh, it's the same code as on
the recalled Firestone Wilderness tires from that plant in Decatur
where there were problems.'''
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked
Firestone to expand the recall to include 24 of the 137 different
models of Firestone tires it is investigating. The federal
investigation includes some tires from its associate brands, such
as the Seiberling line, that don't display the Firestone name.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer attention has been focused on the 15-inch Wilderness AT
tires made in Decatur, Ill., and ATX and ATXII tires of the same
size (P235/75 R15) that Firestone voluntarily recalled Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Federal traffic safety officials have since issued a warning
advisory that 24 other Firestone tire model and size combinations
have failure rates higher than the recalled models, though they
haven't said what those numbers are or what they cover.
</P>
<P>
   The warning list includes other sizes of ATX and Wilderness
tires plus 10 types of Firestone's Firehawk ATX, ATX 23 Degree and
Widetrack Radial Baja tires. About 1.4 million were produced.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has declined to expand its recall. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration can order a recall, but any
non-voluntary recall must be based on the kind of evidence that can
take months to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials deny that any non-recalled tires have a high
failure rate. ``The tires with problems have been recalled,'' said
Firestone spokesman Joe Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   The 137 tire types under investigation were manufactured during
the past decade and are being scrutinized because of similarities
with the recalled models. ``Firestone did manufacture some of those
tires under a different name, but they are the same tires as those
that have been recalled, and in some cases manufactured at the same
plant,'' said Rae Tyson, spokesman for the traffic safety agency.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said: ``The 137 types of tires covered by the NHTSA
investigation have low incident rates, and our experience has shown
that only the tires made in Decatur have had problems. The agency
has cast a wide net.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its main Bridgestone and Firestone tire brands,
Firestone makes tires marketed under the names Dayton, Seiberling,
Dunlop, Polaris, Roadking, Gillette and Peerless. Bridgestone tires
are the top-of-the-line models, followed by Firestone models,
according to the manufacturer. The associate brands are generally
the least expensive and are not carried by most Firestone stores in
the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   The associate brands are usually sold as replacement tires,
unlike the three recalled Firestone models. Those came as standard
equipment on many Ford Explorers, which have experienced
catastrophic accidents involving tire failure, and some other SUVs
and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic safety agency said the failure rates for some of the
24 models on the advisory list exceeded the failure rates of the
recalled tires by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion was based upon a review of Firestone documents
the company turned over to the agency, Tyson said. Because the
company said the documents contain proprietary information, the
agency can't release information on the types of failures motorists
have been experiencing, exact failure rates or other data such as
injuries or deaths attributed to the tires' failures.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is reviewing whether the company is justified in
trying to protect that information, or if it can be publicly
disclosed, Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   An updated federal database of 2,223 consumer-reported
accidents, released Tuesday, showed that the number of fatalities
in Explorer/Firestone accidents has risen to 103, with more than
400 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Firestone, Seiberling tires are sold at independent
shops in Bastrop, Round Rock, Cedar Park and Waco. Dayton tires are
sold at one shop in Austin, and also in Bastrop and Waco and Cedar
Park. The Roadking brand is available at one shop in Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, who purchased her Explorer from a used car lot in
north Austin last year, said she is troubled by the difficulty she
had in obtaining basic information about the Seiberling tires that
came with the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other people are completely unaware that there are
Firestone tires from the Decatur plant, that they are of the same
size that are recalled as unsafe, and nowhere on those tires does
it say `Firestone?''' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the only Seiberling Trailrider tire under investigation
is the all-season model, and Cartwright has the all-terrain
version, she has decided to buy new tires.You may contact Kevin

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON __ First it was the Sprint-WorldCom merger. Now it is
AOL's proposal to buy Time Warner. Two mergers between American
companies stymied by the European Commission, the administrative
arm of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   It may surprise some Americans, but, yes, the Europeans have
enormous power over decisions involving United States industries,
simply because all business is global these days. But before
Americans bristle at such hubris, they should consider the
advantages of European intervention in everything from United
States antitrust policy to food safety.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the best friend of American consumers may be the
European Union's office in Brussels, rather than Congress, or
federal and state consumer protection agencies, or trial lawyers
who sue companies in favor of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To understand this development, we need to start with the
American tradition of keeping government out of the marketplace as
much as possible. This approach has been a positive force in the
country's economic development, but the markets, when unchecked,
have sometimes gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is inclined toward allowing industry to
regulate itself, even on sensitive matters like what Internet
companies may do with the personal information they collect from
consumers. On this front, Europe's regulatory agencies provide a
valuable counterweight, because they are usually willing to stand
up to corporate interests, and the strategy appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Clinton administration has announced
policies that, in effect, defer to the European method of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In March, for example, the Agriculture Department announced
stringent new standards for organic foods, making it impossible for
genetically modified products to be labeled organic. Officially,
these new rules responded to the demands of a small group of
American organic farmers. But the Clinton administration also
wanted to defuse trans-Atlantic trade tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans refuse to let genetically modified foods or
hormone-treated beef into their markets. The administration hoped
that introducing a labeling standard acceptable to them might be a
way out of the stalemate. In the meantime, American consumers
benefit from having more complete information about their food.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of European pressure is in protecting privacy on
the Internet. In the United States, companies that do business on
the Web have been relatively free to track and measure the spending
habits of consumers and to trade such information with other
businesses. But American companies, seeking to expand overseas,
have recently run into trouble with European regulators, who insist
that they meet Europe's privacy standards.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a regulatory agreement between the European
Commission and the United States Federal Trade Commission that will
protect the privacy of European consumers. How long will it be
until Americans start wondering why their government is willing to
ensure the privacy of Europeans but not Americans?
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's review of corporate mergers adds more than
just a second layer of review to the United States Justice
Department. More often than not, the European Union helps
strengthen the hand of American antitrust agencies, by sharing
information and looking at the international repercussions of
mergers between American companies.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the E.U. blocked the merger of WorldCom and Sprint,
citing its effect on telecommunications. And in the proposed
AOL-Time Warner merger, it is likely that the E.U. will require the
combined company to shed some businesses or change some practices.
</P>
<P>
   Any business that wants access to Europe has little choice but
to play along with what the E.U. wants. American companies face a
trade-off. To expand into the lucrative European market, they must
be willing to accept regulation that they have fought at home. Yet
those compromises make it harder to battle new regulations in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's active role in protecting consumers doesn't
mean that it is slowing the march toward global economic
integration. In fact, the E.U. helps the cause by reducing the
abuses of globalization. That takes ammunition away from the
powerful anti-globalist forces. In this way, Europe is providing a
public service not only to American consumers but to its
corporations as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS, N.Y __ After my mother-in-law died nine months ago, my
family found itself among the 2 percent of Americans required to
pay an estate tax. Suddenly we are among those whom President
Clinton and Al Gore tag as ``very rich.''
</P>
<P>
   But my wife's parents hardly lived an elite life. It is a leap
to equate all the people required to pay estate taxes _ those whose
assets exceed $675,000 _ with the very wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As Gene Sperling, the president's economics adviser, has noted,
half of all estate-tax revenues come from the top one-tenth of 1
percent of estates _ the assets of the truly wealthy. I suspect the
rest of the families are much like my wife's.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa and Peter emigrated to New York from Germany in the 1930s
as newlyweds. They came with few possessions and even less money.
They worked first in a joint endeavor sweeping a movie theater
together for minimum wage. Elsa graduated to cleaning houses and
then to working as a hospital phone operator. Peter became a sales
clerk. By 1940, they had entered the lower middle class, occupying
a two-bedroom, fourth-floor apartment in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the eventual value of their assets put them in the ranks
of the exceptionally rich _ or so the sound bites would imply _ the
next chapter in this story might be expected to feature my in-laws
starting an enormously successful company.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Peter remained a sales clerk until his death in 1989 at
87, and Elsa retired from 40 years of answering phones. She died in
the same fourth-floor apartment the couple had first occupied 55
years before. In their lives, they owned one car, a 1960 Dodge.
They never made much money, but, fiercely proud, they took no
assistance beyond Social Security in their later years.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter (my wife) worked from the time she was 16.
</P>
<P>
   By living frugally, Peter and Elsa managed to put away a few
dollars every month, investing in what they considered to be safe
stocks. (AT&AMP;T was their largest holding.) When my father-in-law
died, the savings were a cushion for his wife, but not even on the
radar screen of the estate tax threshold.
</P>
<P>
   His widow, then approaching 80, was satisfied to have the
cushion to provide for contingencies (read: nursing home). And near
the end of her life, when it was clear that she wouldn't outlive
her assets, she was proud she would be leaving money to her
daughter and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Then the stock market took off, and now my wife is about to give
Uncle Sam a big chunk of Peter and Elsa's lifetime investments _
more than a third of everything over $675,000. (The tax is
graduated, with a top rate of 55 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   If my in-laws had been among the really rich, they would have
had a coterie of tax lawyers setting up trusts to shield their
heirs from a portion of the tax bill. Instead, like most people
with middle-class lifestyles, they had a plain-vanilla approach to
financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Most children and grandchildren who must forfeit part of an
inheritance are from similarly middle-class families where assets
arose from hard work and steady savings _ family values that
shouldn't be penalized.

TALIBAN OPEN A CAMPAIGN TO GAIN STATUS AT THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Four years after taking control of most of
Afghanistan, the Islamic Taliban movement sent a high-level
delegation to New York this week to lobby for the country's seat in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to challenge the United Nations on their reason for
not recognizing us,'' the team leader, Deputy Foreign Minister
Abdur Rahman Zahid, said in an interview. ``How can they recognize
that band of thugs sitting beyond our borders?''
</P>
<P>
   Zahid, taking the Taliban on the diplomatic offensive for the
first time, was referring to the mujahedeen, a loose coalition of
mostly exiled holy warriors whom the United States once supported
in their war against the Soviet Union. For the last few weeks, in a
succession of speeches and meetings affecting Afghanistan here, the
mujahedeen have been the sole representatives of a country they no
longer rule.
</P>
<P>
   The mujahedeen alliance controls less than 10 percent of
Afghanistan. Its president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, is in exile, and
its legacy to the country, U.N. officials say, was the destruction
of the capital, Kabul, and much of the nation's public works in
interfactional war.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the recent summit meeting here, the Taliban have had
no opportunity to speak officially, even though they have been
excoriated from the General Assembly podium for supporting
terrorism, exporting opium and abusing human rights, especially
those of women. Yet the United Nations is the organization, Zahid
said, that is trying to teach the Taliban cooperation, tolerance
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the world that we live in,'' he said. ``A government
is recognized that does not exist. Its president does not have an
address. But they have the U.N. seat, all the Afghanistan
embassies, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban government _ largely isolated at the behest of Iran,
Russia and the United States, if for different reasons _ is
recognized by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking on Monday at a
program sponsored by the White House Project, an organization that
supports women in politics, repeated Clinton administration demands
that the Taliban agree to a broad-based democratic government. To
the Taliban, that amounts to giving part of the country back to the
armed opposition and rekindling the war, Zahid said, adding, ``If
the U.N. at least vacated the seat, the opposition would have an
incentive to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, weapons flow in. ``We are up to our necks in arms,''
Zahid said. ``What we need are pencils and books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban recently banned the cultivation of opium poppies.
Echoing warnings last week from Pino Arlacchi, the top anti-crime
official for the United Nations, Zahid said that crop-substitution
projects were failing because help in building sugar and cotton
mills had not materialized and that the Taliban had no other
incentives to offer poppy growers.
</P>
<P>
   Zahid said outsiders often forgot that some opium trade
originated in the opposition-controlled areas, where Russian and
Central Asian crime figures operate. Gemstones _ rubies, emeralds
and lapis lazuli _ are also smuggled and sold in Europe by the
opposition, including diplomats of the defunct government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Taliban government is not recognized by U.N.
members, who will again consider what do with Afghanistan next
month, it is treated as the de facto government by U.N. agencies,
which run programs there. Afghanistan is also under Security
Council sanctions for refusing to turn over Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born militant, to American courts.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, Zahid, who is meeting U.N. officials and other
diplomats, said Taliban officials now let women work in health
services, the Interior Ministry, at airports and for certain U.N.
agencies like the World Food Program. But he said demands for a
representative government and elections were unrealistic in a
country destroyed by two decades of war, a drought and almost no
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they expect us to be in a position to hold elections?''
Zahid asked. ``In all of Afghan history, there has never been an
election. After 20 years of war, when we are only beginning to
create institutions, when we are the first Afghan government to try
to stop opium production, how can they expect us to do this now?
They are demanding of us what they never before expected of this
country.''

CANCER SURVIVOR MAKES MOST OF SECOND CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This could be a season of middle-aged regret for Scott
Lautman.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, young Americans cut through the water in Australia to
win Olympic glory. Twice, a mere second stood between Lautman and a
place on U.S. Olympic teams _ in 1972 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, not a man built for regret.
</P>
<P>
   A man can't have many regrets when he has his life and his left
leg, both of which cancer spent years trying to take from him.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been doesn't mean much when you swam the English
Channel two weeks ago. Banners celebrating his achievement festoon
his cubicle at Alaska Airlines, where he is employee-relations
manager. A faux gold medal hangs from a Wheaties box, which a
co-worker doctored to feature Lautman's mug in hero-of-the-moment
position.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers threw Lautman, 47, a welcome-home party, joking that
he should display his prowess in the fountain inside Alaska's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special amount of courage and ability to do what he
has done,'' said Lautman's brother, Chris. ``I don't know how he
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one stroke at a time,'' Scott Lautman said of
swimming the channel. But he could have also been talking about
facing down bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 40,000-plus strokes, but just one stroke at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first strokes came at Lake Burien, near Seattle, where
Lautman learned to swim. By grade school, he was swimming
competitively. Around age 14, he read something about crossing the
English Channel and decided he wanted to swim it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just kind of captivated my imagination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lautman reached high school he was determined to
learn how good a swimmer he was. He trained twice a day, getting
out of bed at 4:15 each morning for his first session.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that he was pretty darn good. He was an
All-America at the University of Washington who dreamed of setting
a world record and going to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, he swam the butterfly at the U.S. Olympic trials. He
finished sixth in 1972, then fifth four years later _ both times
out of the running for the three spots on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Lautman graduated and was coaching swimming at his alma mater,
Highline High School. He figured he might have a shot at the 1980
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A boycott, however, kept America out of those games. And cancer
nearly took Lautman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Egg-sized tumor found
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, doctors discovered an egg-sized tumor above his knee
and removed it. The tumor had probably been growing for years. In
his training logs, Lautman had complained over the years of pain in
his knee or shin. But world-class athletes are used to shrugging
off pain.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't shrug this off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like it happened, and he almost lost his leg,''
Chris Lautman recalled. ``It seemed like every year he went through
a surgery. The cancer either recurred or his leg broke.''
</P>
<P>
   The tumor returned. The doctors cut it out. The tumor returned a
third time, and a third time doctors dug into meat and bone to
remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Now there were worries that the cancer would spread. Some
doctors suggested Lautman should lose his leg to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to take my leg off up to here,'' he said, pointing
to his hip. ``And then hope that I would live for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   He heard about experimental surgery at the UW that meant he
might be able to save his leg _ and his life.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would insert a bone from a cadaver where the bone in
Lautman's leg had been cut out.
</P>
<P>
   It was risky. Lautman knew a friend who had lost a leg to cancer
as a child. He told Lautman what it was like to hear one of his
children cry in the middle of night and have to put on his
prosthetic leg before rushing to comfort the youngster. Keep your
leg if you're not risking your life, the friend told him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, surgeons inserted the bone _ a 6-inch segment taken
from a 26-year-old man killed in a motorcycle accident in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer was gone, but the leg seemed likely to follow. Four
times over the next five years the graft broke. Each time, just
walking was enough to snap it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nasty, very nasty,'' Lautman said. Each break
devastated him more, stealing the hope that he could keep his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Each time it broke, physicians repaired the leg. Lautman spent
more than a year on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, doctors inserted a metal rod from his hip to knee. It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' Lautman said, slapping his left thigh. ``It's
mine. It's pink. It's warm.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows nothing, least of all his left leg, is a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the back of mind it's going to happen again. It's
not going to last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling a dream
</P>
<P>
   The leg still hurts. Getting out of bed in the morning, Lautman
said, is not a pretty sight. He is not supposed to carry a weight
of more than 25 pounds or walk farther than a quarter-mile without
a cane.
</P>
<P>
   But walking never much interested him. Swimming did and still
does.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, he turned to open-water swimming and such events
as a competition in the Pacific off San Diego. This summer, he swam
around Manhattan Island in another event.
</P>
<P>
   He did well, ranking high among swimmers in his age group. This
summer, he finished ninth among a large group in the Manhattan
swim.
</P>
<P>
   And always, there was his dream of tackling the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got sick, I thought, `Well, there's something I'm never
going to get to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   From Dover in England to Cape Gris-Nez in France is 24 miles.
The water is cold and often rough. Hypothermia stops many attempts.
So does dehydration brought on by seasickness. Tides push swimmers
miles out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Capt. Matthew Webb paddled his way to France in
1875, the English Channel has drawn swimmers from across the world.
Some spend a summer at Dover, getting used to the cold water and
waiting for the right combination of tide and weather. Some fail,
then wait for a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people have managed to swim the channel. This
year, about 70 set off from Dover. Only about half made it to
France.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers sign up a year in advance. They need to hire a support
boat and follow a path of rules or their try is not officially
recognized. You can't touch the boat, for example. Food and water
are supplied by a pole. The only protective clothing allowed are
goggles and swim caps. Swimmers slather on petroleum jelly and
lanolin, but that protects from chaffing, not the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible challenge,'' said Joann Brisling, women's
swimming coach at Dartmouth College and an old friend of Lautman's.
``It's the Mount Everest of swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Frigid training waters
</P>
<P>
   Physical conditioning isn't enough. It's only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Lautman, a bachelor, was spending hours each day training in a
pool. Alaska Airlines allowed him to work flexible hours to fit in
his training.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lautman turned to Angle Lake, then to the airline's
headquarters in SeaTac. When the lake got too warm in the summer,
he headed for Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Summer water temperatures of 56 or 58 degrees weren't so bad.
There's no getting used to 50-degree water, he said, but after a
few minutes, you're too numb to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I would think, `What have I gotten into?'
There were a lot of days that I would wade into the water and say,
`Oh, no!'''
</P>
<P>
   A kayaker paddled alongside, shielding him from boat traffic.
``He'd start out swimming to Vashon and back. Everyone knows he is
an amazing swimmer,'' said Kevin Heutink, who was often in the
kayak.
</P>
<P>
   Lautman would imagine the last strokes in the channel and a
sandy French beach awaiting him. ``I'm heading for the sand,'' he
would tell himself.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs about that visualization now. The beach he hit in
France was nothing but rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Experts told Lautman that he would have to gain 25 pounds to
insulate himself against the channel's cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate everything and anything. It was a joke. I'd go through a
bag of Oreos in a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to pack 216 pounds on his 5-foot-10 frame. And he
planned to swim the channel in September, when the tide isn't as
high as usual.
</P>
<P>
   From his office, Lautman would check the Internet for reports
from two channel buoys, watching the water temperature rise as high
summer approached.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, he flew to England with his team: his brother,
Heutink and Brisling. They would check his stroke, offer
encouragement, food, water and Advil. And they would ask him
questions to make sure he hadn't gone loopy from hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   He joined a band of others waiting for their moment and training
in Dover harbor. There would be horror stories to tell. The tides
took one swimmer so far off course that he had to surrender.
Another was pulled out of the water after vomiting non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   Bludgeoned by the sea
</P>
<P>
   Lautman's time came on Sept. 4 _ Labor Day. ``The weather was
just going to go to hell after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 a.m., the alarm went off in his room at a Dover bed and
breakfast. ``I was like, `Oh, my God!'''
</P>
<P>
   Lautman wanted to leave before dawn so that he would approach
France in the daylight. He wanted to be able to see land to spur
him on.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, the Aegean Blue, took him to a secluded beach under
the Cliffs of Dover. He swam ashore and climbed up to land. When he
was ready, he was to raise his arms, a horn would sound and his
swim and the clock would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lautman reached up to adjust his goggles on the beach
and heard the horn. His channel swim began at 3:21 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The water was 62 to 65 degrees. By Puget Sound standards, it was
downright inviting.
</P>
<P>
   With his body occupied on the swim, Lautman knew he would have
to find something to occupy his mind. Focusing on his stroke would
leave him batty.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about all the pools he had competed in and all of his
coaches. Those thoughts would lead to others, which led to still
others. Soon he was cutting through the Atlantic, all the while
thinking of pools in West Seattle and Victoria. Once an hour, he
focused on different co-workers at Alaska Airlines who were
battling cancer or a serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   For the first five hours, the seas were rough. There were heavy
wakes from oil tankers and other large ships.
</P>
<P>
   The sea was bludgeoning him.
</P>
<P>
   Sea water was getting in his mouth, making his tongue swell.
Food, water and mouthwash _ to clean out the salt water _ would be
passed to him every 20 minutes. He would grab one item, the sea
would take the rest and Lautman would be well behind the boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst of it, the Aegean Blue listed to 45 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the water, Lautman threw up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little worried it was so rough,'' Chris Lautman
said. ``You could not move around the boat without planning it out
first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were big swales, very big swales,'' Brisling said. ``But
at the same time, I never had any doubts. His stroke was strong,
and it had a snap to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to France
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lautman swam along with his brother for a couple of hours
to encourage him. At five hours, he jumped in the Atlantic and told
him that he was halfway to France.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the pull of tides, however, no swimmer makes it straight
across. Lautman's route looks like a badly drawn ``Z.'' It took him
34 miles to cover a distance that is a straight 24 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Lautman focused on France _ not the waves, not the distance, not
the taste of sea water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real sense have you have one shot,'' he said. ``This
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, people from the boat were telling him that they
could see land. Lautman could see only waves.
</P>
<P>
   Nine hours out, Chris Lautman was preparing to get back in the
water. But Michael Oram, the skipper, stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   Oram told Scott Lautman to pick up his pace. His strokes went
from 62 to 67 a minute. The boat crew skipped one of his
three-an-hour feedings.
</P>
<P>
   Oram wanted Lautman to get closer to the protection of the
French coastline or a changing tide would have pulled him away.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 hours, 37 minutes, Lautman made his crossing. People have
swam the channel in as little as seven hours. Others have taken
more than 26 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just flat out did it,'' Brisling marveled.
</P>
<P>
   The rocky beach and the effects of being in the water all that
time made it tough to stand. He fell three times before being on
his feet in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't dancing, screaming or yelling. For me, it was quiet
satisfaction mixed with a great deal of relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends were waiting on the wrong beach. Exhausted,
Lautman climbed in the Aegean Blue and rode to them. Then he swam
to the beach in what Chris Lautman calls ``a re-enactment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautman got back in the boat and was asleep before it reached
Dover.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need dreams. He had just lived one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, what an opportunity I've had,'' Lautman said this week.
``I had a second chance. It's a chance I never thought I would
have.''

LAURA BUSH TAKES CENTER STAGE IN HUSBAND'S CAMPAIGN

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDIA, Pa. _ As Gov. George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, toured
a Chicago classroom earlier this week, a sixth-grader asked him how
he would feel if he were running for election against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come in second,'' he said. For even though Bush still
likes to tell audiences how his wife, a former school librarian,
married him years ago on the condition that she would never have to
make a political speech, those days are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Bush in a drive to win back some of the female voters
who polls say are leaning toward Vice President Al Gore, his
campaign is counting on Laura Bush to carry political appeal of her
own. And all this week, she has been center stage at her husband's
side, holding her own microphone and taking her own questions.
</P>
<P>
   In this era when candidates may be judged by how they smooch
with their wives, she is the one who introduces the Republican
presidential nominee at his town hall meetings. Her adjectives make
clear that the campaign is a joint endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our favorite events are these where we actually get to meet
with people and talk to people about what their hopes are for our
country,'' Mrs. Bush told an audience of loyal Republicans as the
couple's campaign day began at around 8:30 a.m. in the Great Hall
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush portrays her as a reluctant convert to politics,
Mrs. Bush has become a seasoned campaigner after all her years in
the Bush clan. And with her twin daughters now off to college, she
said she planned to stay on the trail this fall.``I am very
comfortable with campaigning,'' she said in an interview in the
back of his campaign plane. ``I've been the first lady of the state
for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush suggested that reporters show a ``certain cynicism''
when they think that ``candidates and candidates' families are
trying to act a certain way to appeal to voters.'' She said:
``People are more natural than that. George is more natural than
that, and I am too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's aides do not disguise their belief that she is a
particular asset with swing voters, independents as well as women.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush can sound like a political pro as she recounts how her
husband's television appearance with Oprah Winfrey allowed him to
get around the ``press filter.'' And introducing her husband at the
town hall meeting on Wednesday, she stuck faithfully to the message
of the day. ``Today he's going to talk about taxes and the way that
the marriage penalty affects married couples,'' she said. ``When a
man and woman say `I do' and they put their two incomes together,
they get into a higher tax bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush took over the microphone, he once again told the tale
about promising that his wife would never have to make a speech.
``If all goes well, she'll make a fabulous first lady for the
United States,'' he enthused.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Gore of hypocrisy over his appearance at a Hollywood
fund-raiser at which he muted his criticism of the entertainment
industry. ``Seems like he must be auditioning for a Broadway
play,'' Bush said. ``He keeps changing his tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the week, he sounded awfully tough on
Hollywood,'' Bush said. ``He talked about six months, sanctions. He
talked a tough line. After a couple of fund-raisers, he's changed
his tune. Go out there to Hollywood to collect some money, no
longer is it six months and tough talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience's questions played directly into Bush's
campaign themes. The only query that stumped the governor came from
a woman who asked him if he supported the Violence Against Women
Act, but referred to it only by an acronym. ``What?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   She then gave the full name of the measure and told him its
reauthorization was being held up by congressional Republicans.
Bush asked her to send him information on the legislation. Later
his spokeswoman, Karen P. Hughes. said that he supports the
reauthorization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush is not always at her husband's side. Sometimes she
peels off for her own events. On Thursday, when Bush campaigns in
Cincinnati, she is to go to a school in Columbus. When he is in
Tampa on Friday, she will go to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments Mrs. Bush leads the George Bush cheering
section. When her husband bantered with Oprah in Chicago this week,
Mrs. Bush sat in a restaurant across the street watching the show
on television with Lt. Gov. Corrine Wood, and a group of female
supporters. A banner proclaimed ``W stands for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were invited in as the show came on and the crowd of
women tapped their watches and chanted, ``It's time for us to
win.'' When Winfrey said she had interviewed Al Gore too, the group
booed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush says she is often asked who she more resembles _
Hillary Clinton or Barbara Bush. ``I say I am like myself,'' she
said on the campaign plane. On the stump, she speaks of the
importance of education or of how Americans for all their diversity
have ``so much in common'' such as ``sacrifices we make for our
loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when a questioner wanted to know her favorite
books, she used the moment to plug Texas authors, recommending
``Gates of the Alamo'' by Steve Harrigan, ``Goodbye to a River'' by
John Graves and ``House on Mango Street'' by Sandra Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas is not a swing state. So when she mused, ``Let's see
who I can think of who isn't a Texas writer,'' her husband chimed
in that perhaps she should find ``a Pennsylvania writer.''

 &HT;    Softball team suddenly vincible
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blacktown, Australia
</P>
<P>
   Were it up to Michele Smith, they'd just be getting loosened up.
Night would turn to day, and day to dusk, and she'd still be
windmilling pitches at the Chinese. Sit down Tao. Sit down Wang.
Sit down Wei. We'll stay here until the Closing Ceremonies if we
have to.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, as Ralph Raymond, the old gray coach of the U.S. softball
team said, ``Without runs, all that pitching means absolutely
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of Michele Smith's night going down as a case study
in diamond-tipped resolve, it became the unsightliest wart in the
last 18 years of U.S. women's softball.
</P>
<P>
   The team of the incredible winning streak _ 112 games _ turned
into one on a losing skid _ two, entering a tough one against the
Aussie homegirls. When China outlasted the alleged sure things 2-0
in 14 innings, it was the first time since 1982 the U.S. women had
tasted consecutive defeats in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as shocking as the basketball Dream Teamers losing
back-to-back. Just a 75 percent match.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, they had played the longest game in the short
history of Olympic softball just to lose 2-1 to Japan. Then, they
went three innings more against China. They'd have time to shower,
but perhaps not to towel off before turning around to meet the
Australians. A coronation parade to a second gold in softball's
second Olympics has turned into a hard march toward humility.
</P>
<P>
   Only after there were no more Chinese to face did the pitcher
let on her fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm drained. I'm tired,'' said Smith, who threw all 14
innings. ``Every time I walked off the field, I believed it was
going to be the last inning. When it wasn't, I said OK, and went
back out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was over, I was stunned. It has been an incredible 48
hours. We haven't been in this position much.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerability has come to call on the softballers, winners of
gold in Atlanta, carvers of a place for the women's game in the
American wilderness, stalwarts who had spent more than two years
forgetting how to lose until these Olympics. And it is a visitor as
persistent as mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Think we'll let Smith, a 33-year-old on leave from a Japanese
pro league, off the hook for this development. The kind of numbers
one determined softball pitcher can amass are like nothing a
follower of baseball can grasp. They seem total fiction, stats on
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Smith just kept throwing, the equivalent of a one-woman
doubleheader, as if on automatic pilot. She gave up a hit to the
first hitter she faced, then not another one until a two-out bunt
single in the 14th. ``My arm just kept going like this,'' she said,
still able to rotate her overworked left. The time to pack up and
go home had passed long ago. Even the sprinklers knew it, popping
to life in the top of the 14th. Smith kept throwing. She totaled
185 pitches, struck out 21, gave up three singles and still took
the loss. Winning pitcher Zhang Yanqing needed just 179 pitches and
16 strikeouts to beat the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just a guess, but I think they need to move the rubber back a
few feet. Or make the pitchers wear, if not a complete blindfold,
at least an eye patch.
</P>
<P>
   This so often is a game of a single opportunity. China's was a
hard-hit ball that caromed off Smith and eventually was thrown away
by second baseman Jennifer McFalls in the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   There is some forgiveness in the round-robin part of the
program. But nothing will forgive the U.S. should it continue this
type of offensive ennui (one run in 27 innings going into the
Australia game). In her first four Olympic games, softball's
proclaimed best player, Lisa Fernandez, was hitless in 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're miles away from USA Softball kind of
softball,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like the same ballclub it was one week ago,''
said Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   They picked a heck of a time to be human.

<P>
   SYDNEY _ The education of Shareef Abdur-Rahim began in his first
practice as an Olympian. He had been giddy about the appointment
and was riding the emotional high of having been married the week
before. Being a member on the sure gold-medal team would be an
extension of his honeymoon. After all, the workouts were in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no luau. This, in a very real way, has been summer
school for the former Georgia high school standout.
</P>
<P>
   The courses:
</P>
<P>
   _ How to approach practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ How to be effective without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   _ How to be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The professors: Team USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``I didn't know what
to expect, but it's been very good for me. Already I've learned a
lot of stuff that I can take back to my team and to the NBA season
to be a better player.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim admits that he arrived in Maui last month with the
idea that working out with the talented team would amount to
pineapple-picking. Instead, it was a lesson in the value of using
each practice as an opportunity to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me has been seeing how the veterans
work, how they look at a practice,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``It's a
no-nonsense approach. That has been the biggest impact on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Captains Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton and Jason Kidd set the
climate by encouraging heated, intense workouts. The 6-foot-10
Abdur-Rahim followed their lead. He had to in order to pass the
course, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' said Payton, the superb Seattle SuperSonics
guard. ``Shareef's a big man with a lot of talent. It's great for
him to be on the team, but only if he put in the work he needed to.
He probably came in not knowing it was going to be like this. But
he's a good student. He picked it up quick that we're going hard
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of knowledge Abdur-Rahim can transfer from the
Olympic experience to his team, the Vancouver Grizzlies. And for a
club that has yet to make the playoffs, what its best players
shares from this experience can be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the players here,'' said Philadelphia coach Larry
Brown, who serves as an assistant on the Olympic squad, ``Shareef
could benefit the most. He's among the youngest. He's spending time
with veteran, mature guys who can teach him more about the league
during this experience than he's learned in three years. This is
the kind of experience you can't really put a price tag on.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a college education. Abdur-Rahim played just one year at
California before being the third player selected in the 1996 NBA
Draft. He came into the league with a reputation as a fluid scorer,
and has justified the acknowledgment by averaging more than 20
points in his career.
</P>
<P>
   However, as part of his education with the Olympic squad,
Abdur-Rahim has learned that he can still make an impact without
scoring. He's watched Kidd play the perfect style for a team like
this. That is, Kidd looks to pass to others, a mindset that has
permeated the team - especially Abdur-Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that you've got to play the whole game,'' he
said. ``You look at the way we play, and it's very little
one-on-one. We're all looking to make each other better. It's clear
everyone has one goal in mind - winning. If you can get that with
your NBA team, that's half the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim's role with the United State's team has been that of
a reserve. There has not been a single play called for him so far
in the Games. ``I just try to fit in,'' he said. ``It's not hard to
do. This whole thing - being on this team is big-time. I'm learning
a lot, including creating my own opportunities without the ball
going to me and being a contributor without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made defense our No. 1 priority, so I'm playing that end
harder than I ever played it. With this team, if you contribute
with defense and rebounding and passing, you're helping the team
win. With the Grizzlies, they need me to score. But this whole
experience has taught me how important it is to contribute in other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The other way Abdur-Rahim has learned to contribute is as a
leader. Usually, the best player on a team is looked to for
guidance. Considering Abdur-Rahim is so young (23), he really
didn't know how to guide. Really, he was still trying to navigate
his way around the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Shareef is not the average 23-year-old to begin with,''
said former Vancouver Grizzle general manager Stu Jackson, who
drafted Abdur-Rahim. ``He's very mature. And you put him in this
kind of situation, where he's learning from some of the best
players in the league, well, he'll be much improved. It'll go a
long way toward him leading his team.''
</P>
<P>
   In Payton, Abdur-Rahim sees a leader who verbalizes what he
wants done. In Kidd, he sees a quiet leader who shows the way by
example. In Mourning, there is an emotional leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting it all here,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``All these guys
bring something different to the game, to the team. My job -
besides playing hard and making a contribution - is to take it all
in and learn from it. I'm more of a quiet guy, but I've seen where
sometimes being more vocal is important or more emotional. Overall,
I just see being on this team as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always work on my game all summer. But I know I've gotten
better mentally because of the knowledge on the approach to the
game and how to play the game and to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim _ who'll get a visit from his parents and wife,
Delisha, this weekend _ had been told by coaches prior to training
in Hawaii that the experience would eclipse anything he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kind of wrote that off,'' he said. ``I didn't really
take heed to it. But they were right. This whole thing has been
just a great learning experience.''

FOR ORTHODOX JEWS, A GATHERING PLACE ON THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 24)  
Ari L. Goldman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University,
is the author of ``Being Jewish,'' published this month (September)
by Simon &AMP; Schuster. By ARI L. GOLDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, a prominent Orthodox rabbi was a guest on a
Jewish music and talk show on the noncommercial radio station
WFMU-FM. The rabbi, Haskel Lookstein, was so impressed with the
knowledge and easy manner of the host, Nachum Segal, that he told
him after the show: ``Nachum, you could do such a great job in the
rabbinate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Segal said, ``but tell me, rabbi, where am I
going to get a pulpit with 40,000 listeners?''
</P>
<P>
   Today that audience is up to 54,000, according to an independent
audit, making the show, ``JM in the AM,'' one of the most popular
in the small Jewish radio market.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jewish High Holy Days beginning Friday night with Rosh
Hashana, pulpit rabbis are preparing their synagogue services and
sermons. Likewise, Nachum Segal is slowing down the pace, savoring
slower, more contemplative melodies, especially cantorial
selections from the synagogue liturgy, rather than the frenetic
Jewish music he normally plays (mostly Hasidic, yeshivish, klezmer
and Israeli). The community calendar, the mazel tov messages to
listeners and the political interviews that normally dominate the
moments between the musical numbers are giving way to on-air
sermonettes on holiday themes of repentance delivered by Orthodox
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``JM in the AM'' is unapologetically Orthodox, with rightward
leanings. Now in its 18th year, the show stands out at WFMU (91.1),
the Jersey City station that celebrates itself as ``freeform''
radio, playing everything from blues to yodeling. WFMU prides
itself on being unpredictable _ except from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., drive
time, when Segal presides over ``JM in the AM,'' which stands for
Jewish Moments in the Morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lookstein, the former president of the New York Board of Rabbis
and longtime principal of a modern Orthodox day school in Manhattan
known as Ramaz, said that he was glad that Segal did not take his
advice of years ago and pursue the rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nachum Segal is one of the best things that's happened
to radio as far as our young people are concerned,'' he said.
``He's full of good values, gives them a certain amount of news and
plays beautiful music.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great counterforce to `Imus in the Morning' and
Howard Stern,'' the rabbi added.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish educators, as well as musicians, however, feel that
the program has moved too aggressively to cater to the Orthodox
right. They note that fewer and fewer female vocal artists are
heard on his program (women's singing voices are not welcome in
some Orthodox circles), that Segal's political preferences,
especially when they relate to Israel, are increasingly hard-line,
and that serious Jewish choral music is passed over in favor of
what his critics call unsophisticated ``yay-di-dai'' Hasidic and
yeshiva tunes. Still, few are willing to criticize him openly for
fear that their CDs, concerts and events will not get air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only game in town,'' a person active in a modern
Orthodox group said.
</P>
<P>
   Segal, who is 37, acknowledges that he is right of center on
Israeli politics; for example, he is not sympathetic to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's latest peace initiatives. But he added, ``My
politics are very typical of the young Orthodox person today.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   His music choices are also in tune with the tastes of his
audience, he said; the Hasidic and yeshivish tunes are more popular
than Jewish choral music. ``It's what the young people want to
hear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Jewish radio is a niche market. It has not blossomed to become a
major community force the way that black radio, for example, has
succeeded, with its own networks and talk and music shows. spam
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Segal's show, the only other major daily Jewish radio
program in New York is the talk show broadcast by Zev Brenner
weeknights on WPAT-AM (930) and on Saturday nights on WMCA-AM
(570), a Christian radio station owned by the Salem Radio Network.
Brenner's are commercial programs, supported largely by Jewish
advertisers. Segal also has a commercial show, ``The Nachum Segal
Show,'' on Monday through Thursday nights at 7 on WNSW-AM (1430).
</P>
<P>
   But Segal made his mark on WFMU. ``I can't consider the station
without him,'' said Ken Freedman, the general manager of WFMU.
``Nachum's part of the chemistry of the station.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a large part of the station's finances. Ten years ago,
contributions from ``JM in the AM'' listeners accounted for
one-third of the station's revenues. Today, that percentage is down
to about 11 percent, Freedman said, because the station has been
successful in tapping other sources of income, such as leasing its
broadcast license and space in its studio. WFMU has an annual
operating budget of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``JM in the AMs'' audience of 54,000 represents nearly half of
the station's total audience of 115,000, Freedman said, citing
audited figures for weekly listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Segal grew up in Newark, the son of Zev Segal, the rabbi of the
Young Israel of Newark. Nachum is the fifth of six children in his
family. He discovered radio at Yeshiva University, where he became
the general manager of WYUR, the Yeshiva radio station. In 1983,
during his senior year in college, he became host of the Jewish
morning show at WFMU that later became ``JM in the AM.''
</P>
<P>
   He stands out at the station, and not just because he is 6 feet
6 inches tall. One recent morning, he arrived at work at 6 a.m. in
a long-sleeved white shirt with a dark tie. Atop his head was a
black knit yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, the station manager, arrived a few hours later,
hatless, wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He excused himself to go out
and clean up garbage that was strewn around the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, Segal prays. An Orthodox man is obligated to
pray each morning wearing a prayer shawl known as a tallit and
leather boxes containing verses from scripture. These boxes, known
as tefillin, are affixed to the arm and head with leather straps,
an outfit that reminds some of a blood pressure apparatus. With
delight, Segal tells how one morning a station volunteer entered
the studio during the prayers and, startled, asked, ``Medical or
spiritual?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the question of, `How do you make a living?,' the
question I get most often is, `When do you daven?''' or pray in
yiddish, he said. ``The answer is: before, during or after the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, it's during. Segal will pray while he plays the long
sets of music that run from 6 to 7:30. ``People like to wake up to
music,'' he said. The last hour and a half, his prayers finished,
he spends much more time talking.
</P>
<P>
   With a rapid-fire delivery, he'll use words like rebbetzin (a
rabbi's wife), mishpocheh (family), halacha (Jewish law) and nusach
(liturgical formats) without explanation. Expressions like ``shalom
bayis'' (marital harmony) and ``baruch hashem'' (thank God) roll
off his tongue. His audience understands him and he understands his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   He will announce events like the Yeshiva of Flatbush carnival,
the local fund-raising dinner for Shaarei Zedek Hospital in
Jerusalem and a lecture on the 2000 election called ``Is It Good
for the Jews?''
</P>
<P>
   He will then turn back to music, playing CDs by groups like the
Diaspora Yeshiva Band, Regesh, Journeys, Shlomie Dachs, Avraham
Fried and the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach.
</P>
<P>
   Segal will take another break to talk about the issues of the
day that concern the Jewish community. He does his best to keep
neutral on most issues, he says, by inviting community experts to
address them. One frequent guest is Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive
vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get more reaction from my appearances on `JM in the AM' than
I do from CNN,'' Hoenlein said. ``Nachum has a committed audience,
more oriented to the issues I discuss. People remember what you say
on the program. It's an unusual phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein said that he believes the show reaches ``beyond the
Orthodox world'' and, because of its presence on the net
(www.jmintheam &QC; .org), well beyond New York. ``When I go to a
federation event or speak at a non-Orthodox synagogue in different
parts of the country, people come up to me all the time and say
they heard me on Nachum's show.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Hoenlein appeared on the show to discuss the
Camp David summit that failed to produce an agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians and to discuss the selection of Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman as the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, Segal initiates the appearance of Hoenlein, inviting
him to spend some time with him in the studio or by phone. Hoenlein
recalled at least one instance when he requested air time. When 13
Iranian Jews were first arrested last year and charged with
espionage, Hoenlein said that ``we were having trouble getting the
general media to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Nachum and said I wanted to go on the air. He gave me
a platform and I reached my core audience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the ``core audience'' might be Rachel Robinson, a
bookkeeper in her husband's mail-order business, who lives in the
Borough Park section of Brooklyn. She and her husband have five
children, ranging in age from 2{ to 12. ``Nachum does a nice
service for the Orthodox community,'' she said by telephone as her
children were having a lively dinner in the background. ``I can
turn him on and not worry about what the kids will hear. And I
don't even mean what Clinton did in the White House, but even about
rapes, murders and people being thrown off subway platforms.'' The
Jewish music that Segal offers on the air, she said, is a vast
improvement on the rock 'n' roll and rap music offered on other
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost consider him a friend,'' she said of Segal. ``I can't
have a baby or celebrate a birthday without him. If it's not on `JM
in the AM,' it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal creates a sense of community by offering ``mazel tov''
wishes on the air between songs. Birthdays, anniversaries,
weddings, engagements all get air time. People call, fax and send
him e-mail with their family events.
</P>
<P>
   Segal estimates that just over half, perhaps 55 percent, of his
listeners are women. Orthodox men and boys are more likely to spend
their mornings in the synagogue or in the study halls than
listening to the radio. Still, he only occasionally plays music by
women, such as the American Neshama Carlebach or any number of
popular Israeli singers, such as Shoshana Damari, Chava Alberstein
or the late Ofra Haza.
</P>
<P>
   Segal admits to getting pressure from the more traditional
elements of the Orthodox community not to play women, but says he
gets even more calls from those who want women. ``Go try to satisfy
the tastes of everyone in this audience, I challenge you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While he tends to favor the right-wing, he also has given a
platform to the left-wing of Orthodoxy. Among the modern Orthodox
groups to which he's given air time are Edah, whose slogan is ``The
Courage to be Modern and Orthodox,'' and a group called the Jewish
Orthodox Feminist Alliance. He is also an ardent Zionist, even
though some of his listeners are more neutral on Israel, believing
that it is improper to establish a secular government in the land
of Israel before the coming of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he ends every show with the melody of Hatikvah, the
Israel national anthem, and intones: ``Our brothers and sisters in
Israel, we are with you.'' Three of Segal's siblings live in Israel
with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Segal and his wife Staci have four children, among them a set of
triplets. Two of the triplets are boys and their bris in 1998 was
broadcast _ live _ on ``JM in the AM.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Hyman surprised over win in 200-meter butterfly
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Oh, my God! Misty Hyman stole the show. With a swim
that stunned and shocked even her, the United States' Hyman upset
Australia's Madame Butterfly, Susie O'Neill, in front of her home
crowd on Wednesday. Hyman's win in the 200-meter butterfly also
managed to upstage the night's premier event, Pieter van den
Hoogenband's win in the best-ever men's 100 meter freestyle field,
with the elements of surprise and pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman must have repeated that phrase about five times as she
looked up at the Olympic board. Her race could have been on the
undercard Wednesday, if swimming had such a thing. It was
interesting mostly to Australia because it shaped up as another
coronation for O'Neill, who entered as the world record holder and
defending OIympic champion in the event.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's butterfly isn't as quick as that of sprinter Inge de
Bruijn's, who was busy Wednesday setting a world record in the
semifinals of the 100 freestyle. But O'Neill is relentless at the
longer distance. She keeps grinding away until her opponents'
muscles are awash in a sea of burning lactic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman made the turn at 150 meters ahead of O'Neill. She'd been
in that same situation before in less important races against
lesser swimmers only to fade from physical and mental fatigue. She
thought about that as she touched the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those doubts creep in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the doubts didn't steal in, they kicked down her front
door. In May, with the Olympics just months away, she was ready to
quit the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people believed in me and wouldn't let me throw in
the towel,'' Hyman said. As she came down the stretch a lot of
people wondered when the piano was going to fall on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do this. I can finish this,'' Hyman told herself. She
was trying to swim her race and not pay attention to O'Neill or
Petria Thomas, who won the Olympic silver in 1996. When she hit the
wall, she looked up at the board. She looked again. And again. In
the next lane, teammate Kaitlin Sandeno, who finished sixth, kept
telling her she won. Finally, Hyman started screaming with joy and
disbelief. She was a lot happier than the Australian fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson also silenced the crowd by anchoring the U.S.
women's 800 freestyle relay team to a gold medal. It was Thompson's
record seventh gold, all in relays, and the Americans wouldn't have
won it without her. After O'Neill gave the Australians a lead on
the first leg, the United States played catch-up until Thompson
pulled it out and the team celebrated the win and an Olympic
record.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also would have set an Olympic record in the 100
freestyle semifinals with a 54.40-second swim, but de Bruijn set a
world standard of 53.77 seconds and must have left Thompson
wondering what she had to do to win a single individual gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am feeling great every time I go out there. I'm really
feeling strong,'' a smiling de Bruijn said. ``I am just getting out
there and having fun. I'm not a nervous wreck any more.''
</P>
<P>
   MUST-SEE EVENT
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Domenico Fioravanti must be feeling pretty good as well.
He picked up his second gold here, winning the 200 breaststroke
after capturing the 100 version earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 freestyle, however, was the event everyone wanted to
see. For almost a decade, the prestigious race has been owned by
Russian Alexander Popov.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, talented and driven, Popov first won the Olympic 100
freestyle title in 1992, beating out the United States' superstar
from the 1988 Olympics, Matt Biondi. When Popov repeated at that
distance in Atlanta, he became the first since Johnny Weissmuller
in the 1920s to accomplish that feat. In Sydney, he was attempting
to become the first male to win the same individual event in three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Popov not only has talent, he has a presence. The mere sight of
him is enough to psyche out most swimmers. In Atlanta he seemed to
unnerve U.S. hope Gary Hall Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband would seem immune to that kind of pressure.
He's so laid-back that he reportedly can fall asleep just about
anywhere, even while listening to Pearl Jam on a CD player. Plus,
he came in knowing he could beat Popov, because he'd done it
before. A little more than a year ago at the European
championships, he stunned him twice. He had a huge performance at
that meet, winning six gold medals, although it didn't get much
play in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old van den Hoogenband isn't a genetic freak. He's 6
feet 3 inches, about the height of your average Dutch TV cameraman,
and is actually shorter than Popov. As an 18-year-old, he finished
fourth in the 100 and 200 freestyles in the Atlanta Olympics. This
past year he curtailed his medical studies to concentrate on the
Olympics. Late in December he even came to San Antonio for the U.S.
Open meet because it was contested in a 50-meter pool, even though
he had to jet back and swim in the European short course
championships the next week.
</P>
<P>
   All his work paid off. Although he didn't set yet another world
record, he took the gold. Popov settled for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world. I've already got plenty of
medals,'' Popov said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall continued his remarkable comeback with a bronze as Michael
Klim, a world record holder at this distance earlier in the week,
was shut out, finishing fourth. Van den Hoogenband's ascent has
been so remarkable that many are wondering how he's become the
world's best swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't accuse someone of taking drugs just because they
swim fast,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Longhorn Neil Walker, who finished fifth in that
talent-laden final, added, ``He's probably on the most powerful
drug in the world, hard work. I thought I worked hard, but it
didn't come through.''
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. swimmer who has been hitting on all cylinders is Lenny
Krazelburg, who's calmer now that he already has a gold in the 100
backstroke. He was on cruise control in the semifinals of the 200
backstroke when he set an Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come so far, I can't let down,'' the immigrant from
Russia said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. teen-ager Aaron Peirsol was second and said, ``I beat him a
few months ago so I know he can be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno thought the whole U.S. team would be inspired by Hyman's
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``People you don't think can be beaten can be beaten. Anything
can happen,'' Sandeno said.

NO SURPRISES: STEEL'S IRONCLAD FORMULA WORKS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

   The House on Hope Street &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Danielle Steel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delacorte, $19.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there's a beach chair in your immediate future, ``The House
on Hope Street'' is a perfect accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   A recent beach-test of Danielle Steel's latest resulted in easy
reading and a bit of mind-wandering (did I leave the iron on in the
hotel room?). That's the beauty _ and the curse _ of Steel's books.
They are wonderfully mindless entertainment, but also so
predictable as to leave plenty of room for other brain functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House on Hope Street's'' has a familiar formula: Girl
meets boy. Girl initially doesn't like boy. Girl eventually likes
boy, and vice versa. Boy dumps girl. Girl and boy reunite. In
between are several killings and many roadblocks to a lasting
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Although the characters are endearing, it's hard to get past the
blatant stereotypes. Why not make the guy the compassionate lawyer
(there is such a thing, I'm sure), and the woman the brusque
doctor? That would not have made ``The House on Hope Street''
worthy of deep thought, but it would have made it a lot more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   More annoying than the stereotypes is the repetitious dialogue.
On Page 50, ``Liz laughed for the first time'' after the tragedy.
On Page 76, ``Liz laughed for the first time'' since the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there's the biggest plot stretch of all. Five
children in one family who get along well while sharing bedrooms?
This is supposed to be fiction, not a complete fairy tale. &QL;

 &HT;    Australia accomplishes what Atlanta couldn't
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock and Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ How could Atlanta get it so wrong and Sydney get it so
right?
</P>
<P>
   As Australia pulls off an Olympic feat that ranks among the
smoothest in modern memory, that's the question everyone here is
asking.
</P>
<P>
   From the beauty of the city to the convenient location of
venues, almost everything about these Games is being praised. Much
of the chaos and commercialism of Atlanta is missing. The weather
is perfect, the light is crystalline, and the people are friendly
and generous to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-town guests, including the notoriously brutal press, can
do nothing but gush about this new-found Southern Hemisphere
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make it official. Sydney is now the Olympics' permanent
home,'' writes Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly. ``This is
the single most beautiful city in the world. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And the way it works! Great, gleaming silver trains come every
two minutes to whisk you to great, gleaming new train stations,
where great, gleaming Sydney volunteers practically pick you up and
fireman's carry you to great, gleaming stadiums, each one cooler
than the last.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of Atlanta looking back in shame, like a scolded
child standing in a corner, it's time for it to reach closure. Know
this, Atlanta: Sydney would not be where it is now, basking in the
adulation of the world, were it not for its tremendous political
and financial advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic organizers knew who was responsible for the Games
from the very beginning: the state government of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The government built the venues, dealt with transportation and
infrastructure issues and had the authority to add more money or
employees, as needed.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Atlanta had competing private and public entities
that often had different agendas and sometimes worked at
cross-purposes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, New South Wales was responsible for putting up the
lion's share of the money to stage the Games _ an estimated $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, organizers were consumed every day with raising the
bulk of the money from private sources. Many government leaders
were opposed to spending a dime on Olympics chief Billy Payne's
$1.7 billion Games, despite the economic windfall it provided.
</P>
<P>
   Such has not been the case in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, when the city's Olympic committee found itself
$140 million in the red, the state government bailed it out.
</P>
<P>
   And when bus delays and driver shortages threatened to slow
Sydney's liftoff last week, the government quickly added 300 buses
and military drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Billy didn't have. Billy couldn't do that,'' said
Ed Hula, an Atlanta-based Olympic journalist considered an
authority on the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need strong government involvement to put on a successful
Games,'' said Sydney 2000 spokesman Brett Gale.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's various governments provided relatively little in
the way of money and sometimes showed poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mayor Bill Campbell's street vending contracts
almost turned the city into an out-of-control carnival, which
provoked the scorn of Olympic officials and foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to say that not every inch of the Sydney Olympics
is aesthetically beautiful or that every bus runs on time.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Park has a fair amount of Coca-Cola red and Kodak
yellow. There are plenty of chain-link fences, staff trailers and
Olympic gobbledygook tucked in the nooks and crannies of the park.
Only Barcelona did a better job of disguising the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   But for every bus delay or potential gaffe, there's a story of
human kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi drivers unable to make change have cheerily taken less than
the meter fare, and sent their passengers off with a pat on the
back. Stranded journalists working late into the night have been
whisked to their next destinations in private cars.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Atlanta, says Elsie Hasting, a Sydney Olympics
spokeswoman who also worked at the '96 Games, was that ``you had a
clash of cultures. You had people in two-piece suits on MARTA
hyperventilating because they were going to be late for a meeting
next to sports fans who were sitting there with a baseball cap,
relaxed and in no hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is less stressed. Olympic organizers appear to get the
job done in a laid back and self-deprecating sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Atlanta had what the Greeks call hubris, excessive pride
that often leads to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Games organizers continuously boasted that 1996 would be the
best Olympics ever. Yet there were transportation delays, computer
glitches and, worst of all, a bombing in Centennial Park that
killed one person.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, on the other hand, has been more cautious about raising
expectations, both before the Games and during. Even as the
international press heaped praise upon the city this week, Games
officials warned that they aren't off the hook yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get too carried away too soon,'' cautioned Paul
Willoughby, spokesman for Sydney 2000's tranportation agency. ``We
have not begun to experience remotely what it will be like from
Friday on. It's simply too early to say we've done it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic this weekend at Olympic Park is expected to
reach 300,000, or twice what it has been so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a bigger country and a bit more confident in its
judgment than a place like this,'' said Matthew Moore, a Sydney
Morning Herald editor who has covered the Olympics for four years.
``This is a little country on the edge of the earth. It takes the
Olympics very seriously. No government in this country could afford
being ridiculed on the international stage. ... If (Juan Antonio)
Samaranch had ever come to this town and said what he said in
Athens, it would have been a big enough issue to threaten the
government,'' said Moore, referring to the IOC president's stinging
rebuke of Greece's 2004 organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's preparation and its Games demeanor have been exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so blown away by the advanced state of their physical
preparation here, which has allowed them to have the foundation to
deal with other crises,'' Hula said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the events are being played at Olympic Park, which is
expansive and accessible. The government of New South Wales built
the park and the $70 million rail station that anchors it. Sports
fans can catch several events in a day, and non-sports fans can
venture to other neighborhoods of this far-flung city for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney also had the luxury of having more preparation time than
Atlanta _ a full seven years vs. slightly less than six. And
because Atlanta and Sydney share the same language, which has not
happened between consecutive Summer Olympic cities since 1908,
organizers here were able to send a large delegation to Atlanta and
hire departing Olympic employees. With its difficult language,
Greece will not have an easy transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has also enjoyed a strong economy, which helped fuel
government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had seven years of economic growth,'' Moore said. ``We
have missed the Asian recession, which means for the New South
Wales government that the revenue stream has been uninterrupted. If
we had had an economic downturn, as predicted, it would have been
so much harder spending $120 million on a Super Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the lesson to be learned from these comparisons?
</P>
<P>
   If the United States ever stages another Summer Olympics, there
will almost certainly have to be a public-private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than six or seven years to start up a $2 billion
corporation, especially one as politically sensitive and
organizationally complex as the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Moore: ``Having a government run things makes it very, very
easy.''

OIL PRICES CONCERN INVESTORS, BUT TECH SHARES SAVE NASDAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A flurry of afternoon buying of technology stocks
rescued the Nasdaq composite index from an early slide Wednesday,
but other major gauges slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued to fret about oil prices, which made another
10-year high, and the depressed state of the euro as more companies
cautioned that quarterly results would be shy of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, took heart from upbeat Wall Street comments about
Intel and some other technology companies and pushed the Nasdaq
composite index up 31.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,897.44. The
index has declined 4.22 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the market, though firming up on hints that the
government might act to cap oil prices and on a Federal Reserve
survey showing further slowing of the economy, remained in negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.56 points, or 0.6
percent, to 1,451.34, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell
101.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,687.92 _ 7.04 percent lower
than where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the Dow's 30 components advanced. At its weakest
Wednesday, the Dow was nearly 222 points lower.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the narrowly focused Nasdaq recovery during the
day, Ned Riley Jr., chief strategist at State Street Advisors in
Boston, said, ``It's clearly concentrated in the top 15 stocks,
such as Cisco, Sun, Intel and Dell.'' He said the public, rather
than institutions, dominated because transactions of less than
1,500 shares accounted for 75 percent of the volume in such stocks
as Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Some other stocks bucked the downtrend. Boeing gained $2.29, to
$59.06, after the plane maker raised its cash-flow estimates for
this year, and Lehman Brothers added 75 cents, to $144.44, after
reporting sharply higher quarterly profits and a 2-for-1 stock
split. Buffalo-based M &AMP; T Bank announced a 10-for-1 split and rose
$5, to $510.
</P>
<P>
   Darden Restaurants, owner of Red Lobster and Olive Garden, beat
profit estimates for its first quarter and gained $1.25, to $18.56.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sprint PCS said it expects to add fewer
customers than it previously projected and the stock dropped $7.81,
to $33, dragging other wireless shares lower, notably VoiceStream
and Western, $8.19, and $6.50, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Informix, Spartech and TheStreet.com also fell after saying they
would miss earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, with major exposure to currency markets, slumped
$4.60, to $49.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a handful of tech stocks led the rebound,'' said Brian G.
Belski, strategist at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. ``There's no
clearly defined reason to buy'' when so much earnings and other
news is expected in the weeks ahead.

 &HT;    GOP ally scolds Lieberman over Hollywood
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSVILLE HEIGHTS, OHIO _ Former Education Secretary William
Bennett, a friend and ally of Sen. Joe Lieberman, accused the
Democratic vice presidential nominee Wednesday of softening his
criticism of the entertainment industry for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Lieberman failed to talk tough to Hollywood
executives and stars when he and Vice President Al Gore appeared at
a $4.2 million fund-raising event Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened that my friend Joe Lieberman's powerful, direct
criticisms became sotto voce when he was among many of those whose
work he had previously criticized,'' Bennett said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beverly Hills fund-raiser, attended by Dustin Hoffman,
Tom Hanks and other movie and music stars, Lieberman said, ``And
it's true, from time to time we will have been _ and will be _
critics or nudges. But I promise you this, that we will never,
never put the government in the position of telling you by law,
through law, what to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he was disappointed and surprised by Bennett's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether this is a sign of a campaign that is
faltering or kind of anxiously trying to figure out how to regain
the momentum,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that he softened his criticism of the entertainment
industry when he spoke at a Beverly Hills fund-raiser. ``I
distinguish between telling Hollywood what to make and telling them
where they should market it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Bennett, a Republican, have teamed up for three
years to issue annual ``Silver Sewer'' awards to media outlets that
they deem ``cultural polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who headed the Education Department in the Bush
administration, said he was especially offended by Lieberman's
silence in the wake of a comedy routine by Larry David, executive
producer of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a monologue that Lieberman called ``very
funny,'' David made this joke: ``Like (Governor) Bush, I, too,
found Christ in my 40s. He came into my room one night, and I said,
`What, no call? You just pop in?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the joke was the latest example of ``anti-Christian
bigotry'' in America. ``This kind of thing ought to be renounced in
the strongest terms, and I would hope that Vice President Gore and
Senator Lieberman would have been among the first to do so,''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lieberman of the joke: ``I thought that particularly was in
bad taste. I winced when I heard it. On the other hand, that's
freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's remarks intruded on a day in a hotly contested state
in which Lieberman pressed the Democrats' support for managed care
reform.
</P>
<P>
   He listened to managed care horror stories from doctors, nurses
and patients at the Ohio State University Medical Center in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   He also raised $350,000 for the Democratic National Committee at
a reception and luncheon in an upscale neighborhood in Bexley,
outside Columbus.

 &HT;    Rx for saving at drugstore: Shop around
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consumers in Georgia, Florida and Alabama may be able
to cut their prescription drug bills by more than one-third by
shopping around, according to a survey of pharmacies released
today.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Center for Florida Consumers conducted the August
price survey of 201 pharmacies, including 67 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of four drugs were studied: Claritin, an allergy
medicine; Paxil, an antidepressant; Zocor, a medication to reduce
cholesterol; and Prilosec, a stomach medication used to treat acid
reflux.
</P>
<P>
   Across Georgia, prices varied as much as $33.37 for a month's
supply of Claritin, $27.26 for Paxil, $38 for Zocor and $50.98 for
Prilosec, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans in private managed care plans pay a set co-pay
for prescriptions, so shopping around wouldn't give them a break.
But price variability can be a crucial issue for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program for Americans 65 and older and the
disabled, does not cover prescriptions. Many seniors pay full
retail prices, often forking over hundreds of dollars a month for
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Eaves, 83, of Conyers, Ga., who's chairwoman of the
Georgia Council on Aging, said she pays about $250 per month for
her seven prescriptions. ``Many consumers shop around for food
prices, but they don't think to call around about drugs,'' she
said. ``I've never done it either.''
</P>
<P>
   The council was among organizations in three states that are

</P>
<P>
   Because of the rising cost of pharmaceuticals, the issue of
prescription costs for seniors has reverberated in Congress and the
presidential election campaigns. Both Al Gore and George W. Bush
have proposed plans to help Medicare recipients afford
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 20 states have enacted some type of
pharmacy-assistance law, including programs to help seniors and the
uninsured buy prescription drugs. Recent federal legislative
proposals would relax prohibitions against importing prescription
drugs from other countries, where prices tend to be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are folks who can't afford prescriptions,'' said
Michelle Rehwinkel, executive director of the Center for Florida
Consumers. ``They skimp on one prescription one month, and one
another month. Sometimes they skimp on food (to afford
prescriptions).''
</P>
<P>
   By shopping around for prices, she said, ``consumers can take
matters into their own hands, as the battle rages in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug use and costs have jumped sharply for senior
citizens in the past eight years and will continue to do so in the
next decade, according to a recent study by Families USA, a health
advocacy group. The pharmaceutical industry, though, points out
that while drug costs are climbing, innovative new drugs are
keeping seniors from needing more expensive medical care, such as
surgery and hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a bigger and bigger issue,'' said Lew
Yeouze of consulting firm William M. Mercer. ``There's not a quick
fix. There are wonderful (drug) treatments coming along, but
they'll be expensive. It will be a political issue, because not
everyone can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Medicare beneficiaries, many consumers who have
traditional insurance also pay full price for medications, as do
the millions of Americans who have no insurance. ``The people who
can least afford (prescriptions) often pay the most,'' said Yeouze.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for price differentials among
pharmacies, experts say. Georgia Rep. Ron Stephens (R-Garden City),
a pharmacist at the independent Quick Rx Drug there, said many
pharmacies offer low prices on the four drugs studied in order to
bring consumers in the door. Other drugs may get bigger markups at
the same pharmacy, Stephens added.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for drugs can vary even within a chain of pharmacies.
Prices also can depend on the competition in a particular
neighborhood, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said, ``The whole issue comes down to competition _ not
only price but service,'' such as quick turn-around times in
filling prescriptions.

 &HT;    Rx for saving at drugstore: Shop around
 &HT;    By Andy Miller

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consumers in Georgia, Florida and Alabama may be able
to cut their prescription drug bills by more than one-third by
shopping around, according to a survey of pharmacies released
today.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Center for Florida Consumers conducted the August
price survey of 201 pharmacies, including 67 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of four drugs were studied: Claritin, an allergy
medicine; Paxil, an antidepressant; Zocor, a medication to reduce
cholesterol; and Prilosec, a stomach medication used to treat acid
reflux.
</P>
<P>
   Across Georgia, prices varied as much as $33.37 for a month's
supply of Claritin, $27.26 for Paxil, $38 for Zocor and $50.98 for
Prilosec, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans in private managed care plans pay a set co-pay
for prescriptions, so shopping around wouldn't give them a break.
But price variability can be a crucial issue for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program for Americans 65 and older and the
disabled, does not cover prescriptions. Many seniors pay full
retail prices, often forking over hundreds of dollars a month for
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Eaves, 83, of Conyers, Ga., who's chairwoman of the
Georgia Council on Aging, said she pays about $250 per month for
her seven prescriptions. ``Many consumers shop around for food
prices, but they don't think to call around about drugs,'' she
said. ``I've never done it either.''
</P>
<P>
   The council was among organizations in three states that are
releasing the study's findings.

LUTHER HENDERSON, ORCHESTRATOR TO GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orchestrators rarely receive marquee billing. Luther
Henderson knows this as well as anyone. More than 25 Broadway
musicals, a good many more television shows and untold numbers of
club acts and recording sessions have used his distinctive talents
over 50 years. Few ever acknowledged his name prominently. But that
is the lot of the orchestrator-arranger who labors behind the
scenes to construct instrumental settings that animate the music of
others.
</P>
<P>
   At 81, Henderson has worked with giants in the worlds of musical
theater, American popular song and jazz; from Richard Rodgers to
Jule Styne, Lena Horne to Duke Ellington. In doing so, he has
bridged these worlds, particularly those of jazz and musical
theater, as few others have.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday at Carnegie Hall, Henderson's billing for once will
be bold-faced, as Simon Rattle leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's in
an evening of Duke Ellington's music entirely re-orchestrated for
symphonic performance by Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The evening promises to be quite elaborate musically, featuring
a host of jazz luminaries, including the saxophonist Joe Lovano,
the vocalist Dianne Reeves and the trumpeter Clark Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my attempt to give Ellington a `classical' presence with
a `jazzical' sensibility,'' Henderson said recently with
characteristic whimsy, seated in the sun-filled living room of his
midtown Manhattan duplex, where the walls are lined with artworks
by Romare Beardon. ``Any time you play Ellington, it can only sound
like Ellington. He is his own context. I'm simply taking him on a
tour of the classical domain via the symphony orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is spry, goateed and professorial with a reedy
childlike voice. He is a forward-looking man with an incisive,
though admittedly imperfect, memory, and his historical insights,
particularly where Ellington is concerned, are often profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``What shows have I worked on?'' he laughed, firing up a
Macintosh computer in his expansive work space one flight down from
his apartment. ``Heavens, I hardly remember them all. Let me print
out a list.''
</P>
<P>
   The resume that comes out of the printer is astonishing: ``Funny
Girl,'' ``Flower Drum Song,'' ``Hallelujah, Baby!,'' ``Do Re Mi''
and ``No, No, Nanette'' (dance arrangements); ``Ain't Misbehavin'''
(orchestrator/arranger), ``Jelly's Last Jam'' (co-composer and
arranger, adapting Jelly Roll Morton's original compositions).
There are the Ed Sullivan, Red Skelton, Dean Martin, Carol Burnett
Victor Borge, Andy Williams and Ann Margret shows; there is ``The
Hollywood Palace'' and ``The Bell Telephone Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Henderson also provide the dance arrangements for Harold
Arlen's ``St. Louis Woman'' in 1946?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,''` he shrugged apologetically. ``I guess this list
isn't quite complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's spotlit turn at Carnegie Hall in Duke Ellington's
company is, in fact, a return engagement that mitigates a painful
memory. In 1955, the Ellington band was scheduled to make its debut
performing with a symphony orchestra, The Symphony of the Air, at
Carnegie Hall. Ellington engaged Henderson to re-orchestrate a few
extended works for the occasion _ ``Harlem,'' ``New World
A-Comin'''' ``Night Creature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He dubbed me his classical arm,'` Henderson recalled, back
upstairs in the living room, with his wife of many years, Billie,
hovering close by. ``I had my Juilliard training. And he wanted me
to legitimize him in this society we call classical musical. I
didn't know that then. It's taken me 50 years to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was devoted to Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's gifted and
enigmatic collaborative alter-ago, who wrote ``Take the A Train,''
among other Ellingtonian standards. ``While Duke never ever took
credit for `A Train,' no one ever thought it was written by anyone
other than Ellington either,'' Henderson said. ``Well, I wanted to
be sure I got credit for what I'd done. And Duke, he said to me:
`Yes, oh yes. Of course.' But when I went down to Carnegie before
the concert to see if my name was in the program, it was not. I had
to have inserts printed up: `Symphonic orchestrations by Luther
Henderson.' I didn't like him for that. Which was very hard on me.
Because I loved the Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   His association with Ellington went back a very long way. Born
in Kansas City, Missouri, Henderson and his family moved to Harlem
when he was 4. There he attended high school with Ellington's son
Mercer. ``We hung out together on the same street in Sugar Hill,''
recalled Henderson. ``I knew his dad from the time I was 13.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Juilliard in 1942, Henderson worked with
the Leonard Ware trio at Kelly's Stable on the legendary hub of
jazz in New York, 52nd Street. While in the Navy during World War
Two, he provided dance arrangements for the Ellington band. Upon
his discharge, Henderson, with the help of Strayhorn, landed the
job of musical director and arranger for Lena Horne.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this time that Ellington also hired Henderson to write
orchestrations for ``Beggar's Holiday,'' the only Ellington musical
destined to reach Broadway, and that only briefly in 1946. Two
other Ellington efforts, ``Jump for Joy'' and ``Queenie Pie,''
never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellington was not willing to give up his Africanisms for
Broadway,'' Henderson said. ``No matter how suave and elegant he
made himself, he never would surrender who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   And what were these Africanisms?
</P>
<P>
   ``The heartbeat and primal sounds of nature rooted in the
African culture that are handed down by rote rather than written
tradition. What were Bubber Miley and Tricky Sam Nanton and later
Cootie Williams doing with their plungers and horns in Ellington's
band? They were simply talking to each another. About the wind and
the breeze. That's what the blues is.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this unwillingness to reshape his musical vision be the
central reason Ellington failed as a Broadway composer? ``Yes,''
Henderson responded.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson says Ellington rarely deigned even to be present
during previews to work on his shows, as all other musical theater
composers did. He delegated that responsibility to Strayhorn or to
Henderson, a practice unheard of on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with Strayhorn working on `Beggar's Holiday' when the
show was previewing in New Haven,'' Henderson recalled. ``We were
in adjacent hotel rooms. Ellington was on the road with his band.
He would never leave his band to work on a show. The band always
came first. He and Strays would just talk every night on the phone.
`Yes, Edward,' I would hear. `Yes, Edward.' And the next day there
would be a new song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on many, many musicals since then,'' Henderson
added. ``But I've never again worked with an absentee composer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within jazz, Henderson pointed out, Ellington's working
method was unique. ``Ellington's genius,'' he said, ``was knowing
how to project himself through other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson likened this process to that of the West-African
griot, or storyteller, who perpetuates the oral traditions of his
family or village. ``Ellington was actually a griot of
African-American music. He heard things in others, collected their
stories and retold them incorporated into himself, into his music.
That's why his band and his bandsmen really were his instrument. He
provided them a framework within this European culture into which
his and their Africanisms were delivered. And everybody loved it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Except Broadway. While there have been Broadway composers with
``powerful jazz affinities,'' as Henderson noted, from Harold Arlen
through Jule Styne and Leonard Bernstein to Cy Coleman, Broadway
producers have been hesitant to gamble on genuine jazz artists,
whether out of philistine conservatism or outright racism. For the
few composers, like Ellington, however, who were given an
opportunity, mastering the form proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Henderson's contribution takes center stage.
What Broadway has been terrifically hospitable to are the musical
trappings of jazz: the swinging syncopation, the wailing
saxophones, the brass, the blues. The musicians responsible for
bringing this jazz aspect to Broadway have not been composers like
Ellington but arrangers and orchestrators like Luther Henderson.
``Or Will Vodery and Ford Dabney, Eddie Sauter, Ralph Burns,''
Henderson added.
</P>
<P>
   Vodery and Dabney, both of whom were black, brought an embryonic
jazz sensibility to the Ziegfeld Follies when they were employed as
orchestra leaders by Ziegfeld throughout the teens and 1920s.
Sauter, of Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw band fame, ingeniously
orchestrated many Broadway hits, including ``The Apple Tree'' and
``1776.'' While Burns, an early colleague of Miles Davis, conceived
orchestrations for Coleman's ``Sweet Charity'' and Kander and Ebb's
``Chicago'' (among many others) that stand as the quintessence of
jazz and Broadway musical theater blended.
</P>
<P>
   Functioning as both guides and interpreters, Henderson and the
others remade the world of the Broadway musical. ``You can't
extemporize in the theater,'' Henderson said. ``The whole thing
would blow up. A jazz orchestrator, though _ white or black _
brings the mindset of primal African expression into the European
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why, almost alone among black orchestrators and composers,
has only he been able to succeed on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a part of something you've never been exposed
to,'' Henderson said. ``My folks exposed me to everything. And they
gave me the most critical Broadway experience I could have had.
They took me in 1935 to see the first production of Gershwin's
`Porgy and Bess.' That really turned me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks chose to avoid Broadway shows rather than be
relegated to the balcony under the de facto segregation that ruled
in the 1930s. Moreover, black audiences were hardly admirers of
Gershwin's ``folk opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, unabashedly, was a fan then and remains one now. This
receptiveness captures perfectly the middle ground he occupies
between jazz and musical theater. ``We are the inheritors in this
country of two extraordinary 20th-century jazz geniuses,'' he said.
``Ellington and Gershwin. And what's extraordinary about them is
that they both ran on different motors: Gershwin on a European
motor, Ellington an African one.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Ellington despise ``Porgy,'' dismissing its score for
``Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms?''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson smiled. ``I'll bet `Porgy' was unacceptable for
Ellington purely because it was the European version. I too wish
that Ellington had written the definitive black musical of the 20th
century. But when you look back on it, it couldn't be so. Because
they weren't his forms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellington was not steeped in European music. He needed
somebody to help him. Musical theater is not steeped in
Africanisms. It needs somebody to help it; help that ensures that
neither will lose its identity. It's an ongoing thing, one long
continuous continuum. And sometimes it can get you to Carnegie
Hall.''  &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ The 103 deaths now attributed to defective Firestone
tires, most of which occurred in Ford Explorers that flipped over
when their tires failed, have galvanized Congress to tackle a far
larger traffic safety problem: Vehicle rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have blocked federal action on the problem for 27
years, but the last obstacle appeared to fall Wednesday. Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., dropped his objections to a plan put
forward by regulators last May to begin providing consumers with
information this winter on the stability of many 2001 models.
</P>
<P>
   The annual number of deaths involving rollovers has been inching
up since 1993 as sport utility vehicles have become more popular,
according to an analysis by The New York Times of a federal
database that includes all fatal crashes across the country.
Rollovers were a factor in 10,657 of the 35,806 deaths that
occurred in vehicles of all types last year, the analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on
Transportation, Shelby had used his power over the Department of
Transportation's budget this summer to block regulators from
spending money to rate vehicles' stability. The senator's
spokeswoman, Andrea Andrews, said late Wednesday afternoon that the
senator had reached a tentative deal with other House and Senate
lawmakers that would allow regulators to proceed this autumn with
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have chosen a very simple method to rate all family
vehicles, not just SUVs: giving them one to five stars, with the
highest ratings going to vehicles, like cars, that are very wide in
proportion to the height of their center of gravity. But this
method does not take into account new electronic suspension systems
that can improve stability.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative agreement, the National Academy of Sciences
will conduct a nine-month study on ways to improve the rating
method, and regulators will be required to change their method
based on what the academy recommends, which could lead to even more
stringent vehicle tests, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tentative agreement is still subject to approval by
a vote on Thursday of lawmakers involved in the transportation
budget, Shelby has been the only lawmaker publicly opposed to
letting regulators proceed with their original plan. Most safety
groups, like Public Citizen and the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, have favored allowing the ratings to proceed this autumn,
but Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, opposed the
ratings, asserting that any government evaluation should be based
on more stringent tests.
</P>
<P>
   All of the increase in fatal rollovers in recent years has
occurred in sport utility vehicles, for which the number of deaths
has doubled since 1993, to 1,898. The majority of rollovers still
involve pickup trucks and cars, because there are still so many
more of these vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The central dilemma facing policy-makers is this: Although the
average tendency of each new sport utility to roll over has
declined somewhat in recent years, these vehicles remain much more
likely than cars to flip over, and their numbers are increasing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of nearly 1,000 in annual rollover deaths in sport
utilities since 1993 has been mirrored by virtually identical
increases in the annual number of people killed in rollovers
overall, and the annual number of people killed in vehicles by all
types of crashes. Other categories of crash deaths involving sport
utilities have also risen during this period as sport utilities
have become more common. Still other categories of deaths have
declined sharply, such as deaths attributed to drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   The tire-related rollover deaths that have occurred in Ford
Explorers accounted for just 3 percent of all rollover deaths in
sport utility vehicles last year. Even with the tire problems,
drivers of Ford Explorers were only half as likely in die in
rollover crashes in 1998 as drivers of Chevrolet Blazers and Toyota
4Runners, according to insurance industry figures.
</P>
<P>
   Every indication is that the rollover problem will grow worse in
the coming years, not better. Automakers have taken steps to make
sport utilities less prone to rolling over, and to make them
protect their occupants better during such crashes. But the overall
number of sport utilities is rising much faster than the modest
reductions taking place in each sport utility's odds of being in a
fatal rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities account for almost 20 percent of new vehicles
being sold, but still make up only 8 percent of all registered
vehicles because so many older cars are still on the road. As the
cars of the 1970s and 1980s are scrapped, sport utilities will come
to represent a much higher proportion of vehicles in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless sport utility vehicles are redesigned and go through
some comprehensive engineering changes, we're going to see more
rollovers in the future,'' said Sally Greenberg, the senior product
safety counsel at Consumers Union.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There have already been a few signs of improvement. The number
of rollover deaths involving sport utilities has not risen as fast
as the number of sport utilities on the nation's roads, according
to vehicle registration figures from the Polk Co., a market
research firm. Between 1993 and 1997, the most recent year
available, the number of sport utilities in use rose 75 percent,
while the number of sport utilities occupants who died in rollovers
rose 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the likelihood of a fatal rollover for any
single sport utility has inched down. Throughout the 1990s,
automakers built ever larger, heavier sport utility vehicles, which
are somewhat less prone to rolling over because of their greater
weight, although even full-sized sport utilities still roll over
more often than midsized sedans. The first owners of large sport
utilities also tend to be families headed by middle-aged people,
who tend to be cautious drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But safety groups are not satisfied. ``Doing something about
rollovers is a high priority because there is a significant number
of deaths and we are making progress in frontal and side crashes,''
said Brian O'Neill, the president of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, a trade group bankrolled by insurers seeking to
reduce the cost of crash claims.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say that they are addressing the rollover problem, by
lowering the center of gravity of some sport utilities, installing
electronic stability systems in some luxury models and even putting
in air bags that deploy down from the ceiling, so as to reduce the
risk that occupants will smash through the side windows during
rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   An auto industry computer simulation, demonstrated for auto
engineers at a closed-door meeting in late 1997, shows that when a
sport utility vehicle rolls over, an unbelted occupant tends to be
thrown through a side window in the direction the vehicle is
rolling, and is then crushed by the vehicle. ``I know you've heard
about people being thrown clear in an accident, but believe me,
that's an old husband's tale,'' quipped Helen Petrauskas, Ford's
vice president for environmental and safety issues, at a press
conference last January, when the company announced that it would
start offering the ceiling-mounted air bags on the 2002 Explorer,
which goes on sale in January.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities, particularly the larger models that have been
popular since the mid-1990s, also do tremendous damage to cars that
they hit. Some safety experts have expressed additional concern
about what will happen when these vehicles begin to age, start
suffering mechanical problems and are resold to younger drivers.
Many automakers have announced plans this year to build sport
utilities that will be less dangerous to other motorists, through
design changes that will make them less likely to ride over cars'
bumpers and door sills.
</P>
<P>
   The public image of rollovers, shaped by television footage of
vehicles weaving at high speed through slalom courses of safety
cones, is that vehicles tip over when drivers swerve too sharply in
trying to avoid road hazards. But federal regulators say, and auto
industry engineers tend to agree, that less than 10 percent of all
rollovers happen purely because of sharp maneuvers on a paved road.
</P>
<P>
   Federal studies have found that as much as 92 percent of
rollovers occur when a vehicle is ``tripped.'' This can happen
either because the vehicle strikes a car, curb, guard rail or other
low object, or because one side of the vehicle starts traveling
over a surface that slows it down, like a muddy shoulder of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis found that a vehicle rollover was the first
thing that went wrong in 4,125 of the 10,657 rollover deaths last
year. Sport utilities accounted for a quarter of all crashes that
started with rollovers, even though sport utilities still make up
only one-twelfth of all vehicles in use.
</P>
<P>
   The federal database does not provide enough information to
determine how many of these rollovers involved vehicles that
tripped over an object. The rest of the rollover deaths occurred in
vehicles that flipped over only after a crash had begun with some
other event, such as striking another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best answers would be to persuade more people to wear
seat belts. A data review by regulators in 1998 found that only 327
of the 1,482 people who died in sport utility vehicle rollovers in
1997 were wearing their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Since two-thirds of motorists wear their seat belts, this shows
that the rollover problem is partly related to seat belt usage.
Indeed, a study sponsored by Ford a year ago found that belted
sport utility vehicle occupants had a slightly lower death rate in
all types of crashes than car occupants who wore seat belts. But
sport utility occupants who did not wear seat belts had a higher
death rate than unbelted car occupants.

CHINA WELCOMES TRADE STATUS, BUT SOME BRACE FOR ITS AFTERMATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China greeted its new prospects as a permanent
American trade partner with official applause on Wednesday, but it
is now shifting its focus, with private trepidation, to its future
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese worry that the country is ill prepared to face the
global competition that membership will bring. Membership will
force Chinese industries to become stronger in the long run, but
many people will lose their jobs along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of double edged sword,'' said Shen Dingli, an
expert on China-U.S. relations. People here are worried about the
edge most likely to cut them.
</P>
<P>
   The new trade status became clear on Tuesday when the U.S.
Senate overwhelmingly passed a trade bill to end what China
considered a humiliating annual debate about whether it deserved to
be treated as a normal trade partner or warranted punishment for
its perceived shortcomings along with countries like Libya, Iraq
and North Korea. The House earlier approved the bill, and President
Clinton is set to sign the law, which he considers a crowning
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The new relationship gives both countries ``a chance to start
anew,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's easy to find people here who worry about what that new
beginning will bring. On Nanjing Road, Shanghai's busiest shopping
street, two parking lot guards discussed the bleak prospects for
Shanghai's auto industry, one of the town's biggest employers. ``I
think they'll die,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   And the manager of a cramped grocery store downtown shrugged
with resignation when asked about the WTO's likely impact on his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already, medium-sized shops like us can barely compete with
the foreign megamarkets,'' said the gray-haired manager, who gave
his name as Qiu. His prices are higher, the store's aisles narrower
and its selection poorer than any of the sprawling Carrefours or
Metros scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high tariffs to protect us now, but after we join the
WTO there'll be no such protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill has no direct bearing on China's membership in
the 138-member regulatory group, which is likely to come later this
year. But it clears the way for American companies to take part in
the open markets that China promises to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Granting China permanent normal trade relations eliminates one
of the main risks for American companies investing here.
American-owned factories in China previously operated under the
threat that they could be blocked from sending products home if the
United States ever withdrew China's normal trading status. And
Americans selling to the Chinese market worried during each year's
debate that they could suffer an anti-American backlash.
</P>
<P>
   That cloud has now disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   With the bill approved and China's membership in the trade
regulatory group on its way, China has become a more reliable
low-cost production base for American companies, which have already
invested more than $24 billion here. More investment dollars are
now on their way to get a piece of the expanding market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking, this is a better deal for the U.S. than it
is for China,'' said Lloyd Meeds, a former congressman and lobbyist
from Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Lu Zhiqiang, deputy director of the central
government's top think tank, worry that China's local governments,
industrial regulators and state-owned enterprises are ill prepared
for what's to come and predicts that a wave of bankruptcies will
sweep through the economy. ``Solid and down-to-earth preparatory
work is scarce,'' he was quoted as saying in state-run China Daily
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   China's 900 million peasants are among the least prepared. After
China joins the WTO, duties for agricultural products will fall
sharply from as high as 85 percent to 18 percent in some cases and
import quotas will disappear, forcing China's farmers to compete
with importers selling cheaper yet higher quality American corn,
soybeans, pork and chicken. American meat has already begun
arriving in China under a related trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of the economy that have long been sheltered by
government protection, telecommunications and banking, for example,
will undergo wrenching change if China follows through on its WTO
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better prepared businesses are those in sectors where
there is already competition, such as manufacturing,'' said Zhang
Xiaoji, an economist and member of Lu's research group. ``The
sectors that are still more or less monopolized by the government
are less prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain won't be reserved for Chinese companies alone. Western
companies that have invested heavily in China often did so under
the weight of costly obstacles, like lobbying, and they may now
face competition from newcomers whose cost of entry to the market
will presumably be lower, since barriers will be done away with
under the WTO.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Beijing to deliver its economy to slaughter.
Instead, its engagement in the WTO beyond the tariff reductions or
other well-defined areas is likely to be spotty and slow. For one
thing, WTO rules themselves are often vague. And despite China's
scramble to create a body of laws compatible with WTO rules, the
interpretation of those laws will be left up to government agencies
or local authorities which often have their own interests at stake.
</P>
<P>
   What Beijing commands isn't necessarily what local authorities
obey. Companies that find themselves up against a WTO infraction
will direct complaints to the U.S. trade representative's office,
which will undoubtedly be inundated with such claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think implementing the WTO reforms is going to be a very
gradual drawn out process,'' said Jon Eichelberger, a Beijing-based
attorney for the American law firm Perkins Coie. He says that new
laws and regulations take years to be adopted. And China usually
leaves much up to the discretion of the agencies that carry them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, parts of China's economy are preparing for WTO
membership. Through a spate of acquisitions, companies like
Tsingtao Brewery are trying to build the critical mass necessary to
compete with the world's multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   And some sectors are relaxing restrictions ahead of schedule in
hopes of helping domestic industries gain a better footing before
of new competitors arrive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government has begun lifting restrictions on
what models auto makers can produce, and it has allowed companies
some freedom in setting prices, even though the WTO won't demand
those changes for another two years. The auto makers' prospects are
among the dimmest of China's key industries.
</P>
<P>
   China is also opening its drug market to foreign retailers
early, hoping to build a domestic industry that can compete. At
least five foreign companies have teamed up with Chinese
pharmaceutical companies to set up drugstore chains, among them
Wal-Mart, which plans to set up pharmacies in the southern city of
Shenzhen and Shanghai, China's commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
   And foreign investors are being offered a majority stake in a
proposed $2.4 billion, 2,500-mile natural gas pipeline from China's
far western Xinjiang Autonomous Region to the east coast, an offer
that would have been forbidden by Beijing before. .
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies will soon also be allowed to bid for mineral
prospecting rights, which were formerly off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the process of bidding has become more transparent.
Projects up for bid must now be advertised in designated state
newspapers, including the English-language China Daily. The
government has set up a Web site to help: www.chinabidding.com.cn.
</P>
<P>
   China will remove restrictions on distribution services for most
products within three years after joining the WTO. But it is
already allowing logistics companies that help move imports in and
out of a free trade zone in Shanghai to open branches in most
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   China has already agreed to lift joint venture restrictions on
large department stores and for virtually all chain stores. And it
recently said it would allow foreign firms to own up to 65 percent
in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, WTO membership will simply legalize what already
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign headhunters will be officially allowed into China,
though many of the big executive search firms are already operating
here. And the much of the foreign investment in Internet companies,
now officially banned, will suddenly be legal.

PILOTS AT AMERICAN REJECT EARLY EXTENSION OF CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pilots at American Airlines overwhelmingly rejected a one-year
contract extension Wednesday, dealing a blow to the airline's
efforts to improve relations with one of its most critical employee
groups.
</P>
<P>
   About 66 percent of the 8,200 pilots who participated in the
vote cast ballots against the agreement. The result is a setback
for both Donald J. Crate, the chief executive of the AMR Corp., the
parent of American, and Richard T. LaVoy and Brian A. Mayhew,
president and vice president of the Allied Pilots Association. All
three men had enthusiastically hailed the contract extension, which
was announced in July, as the foundation of a new relationship
between the airline and union.
</P>
<P>
   Past strains between the two sides led pilots to stage an
extensive sickout in early 1999, forcing American to cancel 6,700
flights and disrupting travel for tens of thousands of passengers.
Two years earlier, the union went out on strike but was immediately
forced back to work by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the agreement's being accepted plunged in late
August when pilots at United Airlines, which is the biggest airline
in the country, followed by American, negotiated a contract that
raised wages as much as 28 percent and greatly increased retirement
benefits. Several of the American union's board members who had
initially endorsed the agreement changed their minds and urged
pilots to vote against it after the United contract was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's result means that the union and the company will
begin negotiating a new contract next June, just before the current
agreement comes up for renewal. The rejected deal would have
extended the contract until Aug. 31, 2002. It also means that
American Eagle, American's commuter subsidiary, is restricted to
flying just 67 regional jets with 45 seats or more, while other
airlines have much more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Carty tried to put a positive spin on
Wednesday's defeat. ``The talks that led to this agreement are
proof positive that American and the Allied Pilots Association can
work together constructively, and we will continue to work on
improving our relationship,'' he said. Last week in New York he
told Wall Street analysts that he expected a no vote because of the
United contract and that the company would not suffer financially
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy, the union president, was fatalistic. ``You've got to
respect the membership's wishes,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It was never a slam dunk anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have allowed American Eagle to fly hundreds of
50-seat regional jets virtually anywhere in the country. It would
also have forced pilots to spend more time flying a single type of
jet, like a Boeing 737, before moving up to a bigger aircraft,
reducing the airline's training costs.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, American pilots were to receive a 3 percent wage
increase and the promise that AMR would expand the airline,
creating more opportunities for pilots to move up the ranks. The
company also agreed to forgive the $45.5 million fine that a
federal judge ordered the union to pay the airline as a result of
the 1999 sickout. The deal was controversial within the union from
the beginning. A group of pilots calling themselves PACE, or Pilots
Against Contract Extension, set up a Web site to promote their
objections and campaigned hard to defeat the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The group asserted that the extension was negotiated in secret
by LaVoy and Mayhew. The two men were also the only individuals
named in the $45.5 million fine, leading PACE to question the
objectivity of their endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Mayhew said Wednesday that it was unfortunate that the contempt
fine was tied to contractual issues in the extension. But he added
that he did not believe that that was a decisive issue because it
was clear that the company was always going to forgive the fine.
``It's a matter of when it gets settled, not if it gets settled,''
he said.

 &HT;    Presidential race gets closer in Ohio
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The presidential contest in Ohio is tightening
and both camps predict their candidates will be in Ohio fighting
over the state until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll, released Wednesday,
showed Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican, leading Vice
President Al Gore, the Democrat, by 4 percentage points, 47 to 43,
among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   That is nearly within the poll's margin of error, 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results show the race tightening. Bush had led Gore by 6
percent in early July. Gore's support among Ohio voters has inched
up since spring while Bush's 47 percent support is the same as Ohio
Poll results from April and July.
</P>
<P>
   With 47 days until the election both candidates are faced with
the prospect of duking it out in the state until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the amount of candidate appearances we're getting and
the amount of attention and no indication this is going to let up,
I think there is the potential for this to stay very, very tight,''
said Eric W. Rademacher, co-director of the University of
Cincinnati Ohio Poll.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign official said the results show their strategy is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the convention we've been moving forward and they've
shown the gap closing and the momentum is with us and we're going
to win Ohio,'' said Kara Gearhardt, spokeswoman for the Gore
campaign in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying that, after the convention, people really
begin focusing on the issues, and when they do, they like where the
Gore/Lieberman agenda is going to take the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign worker said the poll results are not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected these numbers to tighten but we're glad that
Governor Bush's message and real plans for real people is
resonating with independent and swing voters,'' said the Bush
campaign's Midwest spokesman, Bob Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The race for Ohio continued in earnest this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., made
campaign stops in Columbus and suburbs east of Cleveland on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to discuss Social Security during a visit to
Cleveland today. His wife, Laura, will read to students at a
Columbus elementary school, accompanied by Hope Taft, wife of Gov.
Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Bush or running mate Dick Cheney have been to Ohio 10 times
since July 30. Gore or Lieberman have been here seven times.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns and their supporters have been running television
advertising on and off throughout the state since early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's role in the election has become magnified as other states
appear to have made their choices. With the surprise exception of
Florida, Bush is seen as being strong in Southern and Western
states. Polls show Gore up in the vote-rich states of New York and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was expected to lean toward Bush because his brother,
Jeb, is governor. But recent polls have shown a close race there.
</P>
<P>
   A Wayne State University/Detroit Free Press poll released this
weekend showed Gore with sizable leads in Illinois and
Pennsylvania, two battleground states both campaigns have targeted.
It measured Bush's lead in Ohio at 2 percent, within the poll's
margin of error at 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the volatility in Ohio, according to Rademacher, is
that 27 percent of Ohio Poll respondents say they are not strongly
in support of either candidate and could change their mind by
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The race could be decided by the 6 percent of the poll
respondents who say they are independent and likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Independents are split evenly between Bush and Gore so far, but
that is where there is the potential for movement, Rademacher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is why you've seen so much effort in Ohio not in
energizing their base but going into enemy territory,'' Rademacher
said. ``They're trying to find as many independent votes as they
can and they're trying to find as many votes as possible that they
can steal from the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found third-party candidates had yet to make much
impact. Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader and three others are pulling a small but equal number
from both candidates, according to the Ohio Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Poll results are based on telephone interviews with 628
likely voters around the state conducted Sept. 5 through 16.

<P>
   It tends to be very race specific. When you see a situation like
this. This kind of race is different than we did in some years, it
is very, very close at this point. Clinton up 9 points in
September, that lead did tighten a little bit between then and
election day, but that was a pretty good indication. There wasn't
much movement on Clinton on that race, there wasn't a lot of
movement on Dole. I think one of the things you might want to think
about, we do have an indicator,
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the 20s who say they are not committed yet. 27
percent could change their mind. There is the potential for
volatility in this race. Given the amount of candidate appearances
were getting and the amount of attention and no indication this is
going to let up, I think there is the potential for this to stay
very very tight. I think there is the potential for this one to
take fire. We're expecting this is going to be a very tight race
between now and election day. For Gore to take this kind of lead is
a big swing. Dems and Reps are both lining up firmly in their
candidate. We're seeing a higher percentage of Dems comprising the
likely voter group, they are getting energized. You're getting to
the point where there could be equivalent turnout. Independents can
fluctuate back and forth, and right now their tied. Bush/Gore.
We're running men and women basically even, Bush has a 10 pt lead
among men. Nationally, Gore usually leads with women. We are seeing
two groups of women on the side of Bush: white women, married women
(54/43). When you look at women as a whole they are still even in
Ohio. Gender. I think that is why you've seen so much energy in
ohio not energizing your base but going into enemy territory.
They're trying to find as many independent votes as they can and
theyre trygin to find as many votes as possible that they can steal
from.
</P>
<P>
   Basically a lot of polls have come out. Since the convention
we've been moving forward and they've shown the gap closing and the
momentum is with us and we're going to win Ohio. We've been saying
that after the convention people really begin focusing on the
issues and when they do they like where the Gore/Lieberman agenda
is going to take the country. They like Where

<P>
   BOSTON _ Acknowledging the state may have lost credibility with
Hollywood, Governor Paul Cellucci named a retired judge Wednesday
to examine alleged excesses by the Teamsters in negotiating
contracts with the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will also consider whether his administration needs
to advocate reforms in laws and procedures to attract more
filmmaking to Massachusetts.
</P>

   Cellucci appointed Robert A. Barton, a former prosecutor who
spent 22 years as a Superior Court judge before retiring in June,
as a special adviser to determine if the head of the region's
largest Teamsters local has lived up to his pledge to help attract
more movie business for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's action is the first attempt he has made to respond to
criticism he has taken in recent months for maintaining political
ties to George W. Cashman, the region's most powerful Teamster,
whose local is under federal investigation for its dealings with
the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   After securing Barton's agreement for the assignment at a
meeting at the State House, Cellucci told the Globe in an
interview: ``We want Judge Barton to make sure that we're doing
everything we can to insist that the Teamsters, or any other union,
be fair, reasonable, and law-abiding so we can make sure we
continue to get this business in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is currently investigating whether Teamster
officials used extortion in negotiating with Hollywood executives
looking to make movies in Massachusetts to secure lucrative jobs
and extra privileges for their members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to documents made public last month, the
Massachusetts Film Office relayed complaints from several film
executives to Cellucci and his predecessor, William F. Weld, about
their contract negotiations with the Teamsters and their
dissatisfaction with the work of some of the union's members on
production sets.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was not worried that either Barton's
examination or the federal investigation would uncover anything
improper in his dealings with Cashman, president of Local 25, which
handles all negotiations with studios and independent filmmakers
who are seeking to shoot movies in Massachusetts as well as Maine,
New Hampshire, and Vermont. Through Cashman's efforts, Local 25
endorsed Cellucci for governor in 1998, and Cellucci responded by
appointing Cashman to a second seven-year term on the Massachusetts
Port Authority last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman did not return a phone call for comment. Peter F. Carr
II, of the Boston law firm Eckert Seamans, which represents Cashman
in the criminal investigation, said Cashman supports Barton's
``fresh look'' at the state laws and procedures that affect the
movie industry's business in Massachusetts. Asked if Cashman will
cooperate with the review, Carr would only say that Cashman would
agree to meet with Barton, as a first step.
</P>
<P>
   Barton will be provided staff to conduct interviews with film
executives about their experiences with the Teamsters, and he will
research all relevant state laws and regulations to determine if
changes are needed to encourage more movie making in the state,
Cellucci said. Barton's examination is expected to last two months
and he will report his findings directly to the governor's office,
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Barton said he wants to determine if
the apparent problems encountered in dealing with the Teamsters are
unique for Massachusetts. ``Is there something going on here that
makes any problems special for our state, or if other states are
facing the same thing but we just don't know about it,'' Barton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was drawn to Cashman in the early 1990s because
Cashman had promised to cooperate with the new administration's
efforts to bring more films to Massachusetts. Since then, Cellucci
has interceded on several occasions with Cashman to get him to
compromise with filmmakers who were interested in shooting in
Massachusetts but were put off by Cashman's refusal to budge from
the terms of the benefit-laden contract for his drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my efforts were geared to improving the situation and
every time I called, whether it was on the `Perfect Storm' or `The
Love Letter,' we got the movies made,'' Cellucci said. ``If that
means when someone in the union does something wrong then people
try to blame it on me, then I guess it goes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all of my efforts have been directed at trying to get the
Teamsters to do exactly what they told the studios they would do _
they were the new Teamsters, not the Teamsters of old.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he met with one Disney executive on a trip to Los
Angeles last month. He said Whitney Green, vice president of motion
picture production for Walt Disney Pictures, told him that problems
with trade unions are ``not unique to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to the extent that there are news reports of a federal
investigation, that is not a good thing,'' Cellucci said. ``So we
want to demonstrate to her and others that we intend to keep the
momentum moving forward. We don't want to fall backward.''

NEW YORK LAW FIRM ACCUSED OF AIDING IMMIGRANT SMUGGLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors on Wednesday accused one of New
York City's busiest immigration law firms of working hand in hand
with the smugglers who bring illegal immigrants from China and then
keep them as virtual indentured servants in the United States until
the price of their passage is repaid.
</P>
<P>
   In two indictments filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
the government described the Manhattan law firm of Robert E. Porges
as a racketeering enterprise and accused Porges; his wife, Sheery
Lu; and six current and former employees of receiving $1.2 million
in fees from unnamed smugglers over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, said that in return for that money, the firm acted as an
adviser to smugglers, even suggesting the best points of entry into
the country to avoid detection and arranging transportation to New
York City for immigrants who had succeeded in sneaking into the
country by land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   She also said some law firm employees, mainly under the
direction of Mrs. Porges, helped the smugglers seize the illegal
immigrants upon arrival in the city and hold them as ``hostages''
until the $40,000 to $50,000 they had promised to pay for their
passage was paid.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief hearing following the unsealing of the grand jury
indictments, Porges, 62, was released and given two weeks to post a
$2 million bond on behalf of himself and his wife. She was ordered
held until the bond was posted.
</P>
<P>
   No pleas were entered at the hearing, and Porges did not speak
to reporters. He appeared pale and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kaiser, his lawyer, said, ``We're confident that after
a speedy trial, Mr. Porges will be shown to have represented his
clients honestly and ethically for over 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the law firm and some of its employees are accused of
having direct contact with smugglers and helping them ``abduct''
illegal immigrants, no one is named in the indictment as a
smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   White said that at least one person already convicted of
immigrant smuggling in the last few years was connected to the
Porges firm.
</P>
<P>
   But she refused to provide specifics or explain the genesis of
the case. She would not say whether any more people would be
charged with smuggling, abducting or holding immigrants hostage in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Chinese men and women who enter the United States
illegally end up in New York sweatshops and restaurants, where they
work long hours in sometimes dangerous conditions for years to pay
back the smugglers _ often referred to as ``snakeheads'' _ who
brought them from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to pay the snakehead or attempts to escape from a
smuggler's control can bring retribution against family members
back in China, according to social service groups and academics who
work with Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure in the case is Mrs. Porges, 47. Prosecutors
called her the ``chief of staff'' of the operation and charged her
with aiding snakeheads in the kidnapping of 17 Chinese immigrants
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, however, who has represented Chinese immigrants in
many of the country's highest-profile asylum cases, was not accused
of participating in the seizure of immigrants who owed money to the
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Porges worked as much as possible from behind the
scenes,'' White said. ``Porges' wife allegedly functioned as the
enterprise's chief of staff and liaison to the Chinese community.''
</P>
<P>
   Others charged with membership in the racketeering operation are
Rity Sulan Peng, 26, a paralegal; Heidi He, 34, the law firm's
office manager; June Liu, 37, a translator; Jin Wen Shan, 37, a
member of the support staff; and a staff member identified only as
Michael, whose last name was not known by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A separate indictment charging two former law firm employees
with aiding in immigrant smuggling named Peng and Jeffrey Tse, 45.
</P>
<P>
   Porges, while charged with racketeering, is mainly accused of
directing his staff to concoct stories of past persecution on
behalf of clients who were seeking asylum to legally remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants, even those who arrive illegally, are entitled to
request political asylum on the ground that they would face
persecution if forced to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The Porges firm, which employed about 40 lawyers and paralegal
workers, handled thousands of such cases over the years. Robert
Porges represented many of the Chinese who survived the Golden
Venture shipwreck off the Rockaway peninsula in Queens in 1993 in
their asylum applications, as well as some of those who were caught
off the coast of New Jersey in 1998 after their smugglers' boat ran
aground.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented several Chinese teen-agers abducted from
foster homes in Seattle in 1995 and held for ransom in connection
with an unpaid debt to a snakehead. At the time, an Immigration and
Naturalization Service official credited Porges with reporting one
of the kidnappings to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments came after a 30-month investigation led by the
INS.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of immigration, Doris Meissner, described the
indictments as a significant blow to the multibillion-dollar
business of smuggling illegal immigrants. The accused lawyers and
legal assistants, she said, may be ``Manhattan attorneys in
three-piece suits, but the people indicted today are just as
ruthless and unscrupulous as the snakeheads with whom they
collaborated for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Porges law firm was accused of receiving direct payments
from unnamed smugglers and receiving about $12 million since 1993
from about 6,000 asylum seekers whose applications, according to
the indictments, contained false information.
</P>
<P>
   That number does not represent all the asylum cases handled by
the firm, according to INS officials, and not all of the Porges
cases are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of how lawyers help and even coach an asylum
seeker _ as Porges is accused of doing _ to make a case is
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most immigration lawyers, as well as numerous charitable and
social service agencies, handle large caseloads of asylum
applications from Chinese immigrants and others.
</P>
<P>
   Some said illegal immigrants were often prepared by the
smugglers _ even before they see a lawyer _ to offer a false or
too-pat story of persecution, and do not know their rights.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them doubly vulnerable, said Jacqueline Baronian,
chairwoman of the New York chapter of the American Immigration
Lawyers Association, who added that she did not know Porges or the
details of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems with these people who abuse
immigrants and take advantage,'' she said, ``is that unfortunately,
there are times when some of these aliens have very, very valid
asylum claims. They are frightened, they don't know what to say.''

EX-JUDGE TO PROBE TEAMSTERS' ROLE IN MOVIE CONTRACTS

<P>
   BOSTON _ Acknowledging the state may have lost credibility with
Hollywood, Governor Paul Cellucci named a retired judge Wednesday
to examine alleged excesses by the Teamsters in negotiating
contracts with the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will also consider whether his administration needs
to advocate reforms in laws and procedures to attract more
filmmaking to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appointed Robert A. Barton, a former prosecutor who
spent 22 years as a Superior Court judge before retiring in June,
as a special adviser to determine if the head of the region's
largest Teamsters local has lived up to his pledge to help attract
more movie business for Massachusetts.

 &HT;    Pagans gather to dispel myths about their worship
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ More than 300 pagans gathered Wednesday to
dispel myths about their ancient religion, which they say has been
unfairly demonized by Christians pushing for prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is, you can have no religions in the public schools
or you can have all religions in the public schools, but you are
not going to have just the Christian religion in the public
schools,'' said rally organizer Ginger Strivelli.
</P>
<P>
   She is a co-founding priestess of the Appalachian Pagan
Alliance, which organized the rally in response to last month's far
larger We Still Pray rally. That rally attracted more than 12,000
Christians to the football stadium at A.C. Reynolds High School in
protest of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling against
school-sponsored prayers before football games and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they hoped the pagan rally on the same high
school grounds would help the general public understand that they
do not cast spells or engage in satanic rituals that involve
killing animals or people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not ride a broom. I do not have a crooked nose. I do not
eat children,'' said Beth Fox, a member of the Alliance's chapter
in Hickory, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the pagans said, they practice a religion that respects
the spirituality and harmony of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Carol Sweeney, said that as a Christian,
``you give your faith to a power, God, that you allow to change
you. Now I am saying the power is in the grass, the trees, the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally resembled a typical Friday night football crowd more
than what many might expect of a gathering of pagans.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried wooden staffs and played drums in a solemn, soft
beat, and the program included the chanting of the pagan credo.
Some participants also wore black, including one woman with a black
pointed hat. But many wore jeans and shorts and T-shirts. The cries
of babies and young children punctuated the cool, quiet evening,
fading blue against Big Cedar and Little Cedar mountains.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as the rally, about 25 members gathered for
Wednesday night prayer meeting inside the Rose Hill Baptist Church
on a grassy hill overlooking the football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve Burnette, 83, attended last month's Christian rally
and she said, ``It is nothing but fair. If they want to meet, let
them meet. We had ours.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Baldin, 73, chairman of the church's board of deacons,
said, ``It is a shame the pagans could not have chosen another
night. They are right here in our face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely we need to pray for these people. They are atheists. We
pray for all lost people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said it was a coincidence that Wednesday's rally coincided
with the annual See You at the Pole voluntary prayer around
flagpoles at schools all across America, including
AshevilleReynolds High School.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pagan rally occurred on the eve of today's pagan
holy day for the harvest and Friday's autumn equinox, a symbol of
the last harvest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The rally at Reynolds High School brought pagans from as far
away as Maine, Maryland and Oklahoma. The Appalachian Pagan
Alliance, one of several local Wiccan circles, has 100 members,
according to Strivelli.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rasmussen, the high priest of Coven Oldenwilde, a Pagan
congregation, said he hopes the rally will also promote Asheville
as ``an oasis in the South of alternatives to the mainstream
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to realize this is not the buckle of the Bible
belt,'' said Rasmussen, who moved to Asheville eight years ago from
northern California where, he said, paganism lacked the sincerity
he's found in Asheville. ``It is a hole in the Bible belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in the rolling Blue Ridge mountains, this city of 70,000
people has grown in recent years in traditional ways, with retirees
and others seeking the region's natural beauty and recreation.
Asheville also has drawn an increasingly visible population
``outside of the mainstream_artists, activists, pagans, and gay and
lesbian people,'' said Brendan Conley, an editor at the Asheville
Global Report, an alternative weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Asheville's ``free thinking'' goes back to the city's origins,
Rasmussen said, as a haven after the Revolutionary War for
Scotch-Irish immigrants from northern Ireland. Their livelihoods
there had been ruined by restrictive British tariffs on wool and
weaving.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1800s, Asheville had a national reputation as a
health resort and, later, as the location of the magnificent home
of George Vanderbilt, Biltmore Estate.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Asheville's revitalization has included alternative
businesses, such as Malaprop's Bookstore, the French Broad Food
Co-Op, and the employee-owned Blue Moon Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen described the Jubilee Community Church as ``counter
culture. It still wants to explore Christianity, but is fed up with
being preached at about damnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of people, paganism starts out as a reaction to God
and his heaven condemning you to hell,'' Rasmussen said. ``I think
of it as climbing out of that God box.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   By day, Jonathan G. Lebed was just another 15-year-old high
school student in Cedar Grove, N.J., a suburb of New York. But
after school, securities regulators say, Lebed masterminded a stock
manipulation scheme on the Internet that earned him almost $273,000
in illegal gains.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, just days before Lebed's 16th birthday, the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused the teen-ager of
orchestrating a scheme to increase the prices of nine obscure,
low-price stocks he had bought by sending upbeat messages to
investing chat rooms on the Internet. As other investors read his
messages and bought the shares, prosecutors said, Lebed sold his
holdings at profits ranging from $11,000 to $74,000 a trade. The
scheme began in August 1999, when Lebed was 14, prosecutors said,
and continued until Feb. 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed settled with the SEC on Wednesday, neither admitting nor
denying the civil accusations but agreeing to pay back the money he
made plus interest, for a total of $285,000. The SEC did not
require him to pay a fine or penalty.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Kevin H. Marino, said, ``The Lebeds feel that this
is a reasonable settlement, and they are very happy to have the
entire matter behind them.'' Neither of Lebed's parents were
accused of wrongdoing. Lebed was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday afternoon, Gregory Lebed, Jonathan's father,
stood outside the family's two-story brown shingle house greeting
reporters. Dressed in jeans and a gray T-shirt, he said he could
not comment on his son's situation other than to say he was fine.
``He's a good student,'' he said. Acknowledging that many people
are trading stocks on the Internet these days, Gregory Lebed said:
``So they pick on a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said Lebed was the first minor to be sued by the SEC.
``Jonathan Lebed's conduct was essentially a pump-and-dump scheme,
and it was every bit as serious as other Internet fraud cases we
have brought,'' said David S. Horowitz, assistant district
administrator at the SEC's Philadelphia district office. ``What's
different is his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed conducted his trading in accounts set up for him in his
father's name at two different brokerage firms. One was a firm that
caters to online investors.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven times, regulators said, Lebed bought a large block of a
small stock. A few hours after each purchase, he would send as many
as 500 false and misleading e-mail messages to various Yahoo
Finance message boards promoting the stock he had just bought. The
messages were sent using fictitious names, making it seem that many
different investors thought the stock held promise.
</P>
<P>
   Often at the same time that he bought the shares, Lebed would
place an order to sell them at prices well above the prevailing
market, Horowitz said. This was done to ensure that he could profit
from a jump in the stock even if it came during the day while he
was at school, Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed lured investors into the stocks with predictions that the
shares would soon skyrocket in price. He said in one message that a
company trading at $2 would be trading at more than $20 ``very
soon.'' Another posting said that a stock would be the next ``to
gain 1,000 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said that Lebed's messages always caused the
price and volume of the mentioned stocks to increase significantly.
In some cases, the stocks reached their record highs in both price
and volume after the e-mail messages. Shares of all nine of the
companies Lebed sent e-mail messages about are traded on the
over-the-counter bulletin board, a market for the smallest and
least-known stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks involved in Lebed's scheme were the Manchester
Equipment Co., Just Toys Inc., Yes Entertainment Inc., Fotoball USA
Inc., Man Sang Holdings Inc., West Coast Entertainment Inc., Havana
Republic Inc., Classica Group Inc. and Firetector Inc. None of the
companies have been charged with any wrongdoing in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Marino described Lebed as a self-taught stock trader who
developed an interest in the market when he was 12. ``He has done
other investing and has done extremely well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four years ago, Lebed and two schoolmates at the
Memorial Middle School in Cedar Grove entered a nationwide
stock-picking contest and did very well, said a resident who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. The three were written up in the
local newspaper, The Verona Cedar Grove Times.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed was described as a loner and an outsider in a high school
known for its cliques. ``He's a nice kid, just a little
different,'' the resident said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebed home is in a hilly, wooded neighborhood where some
residents can see Manhattan. A neighbor out tending his lawn on
Wednesday, who declined to identify himself, raised his eyebrows
when he heard about the profits Lebed had been accused of making.
He said, ``I just wish he'd told me about it, that's all I can
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators declined to say how they discovered Lebed's scheme.
Horowitz said that the SEC's Internet surveillance team often
identified unusual trading activity in stocks that could lead to
such cases. He also said that brokerage firms sometimes tipped the
agency off to highly profitable, short-term trading in customers'
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this case is that there are
investors who will buy stocks based on anonymous Internet tips.
Even though the messages had little substance _ one characterized
an investment as ``the most undervalued stock ever'' _ investors
rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald C. Long, administrator of the SEC's Philadelphia district
office said: ``I implore investors to be highly skeptical of any
advice they receive from the Internet. People should do thorough
research before making investment decisions and verify all
information before acting on it.''

 &HT;    Prayer service held at Ohio school
 &HT;    By Ericka M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, Ohio _ In a time when the nation's public schools are
devoid of organized prayer, millions of students, teachers and
parents bowed their heads Wednesday morning commemorating the
annual ``See You at the Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered
at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with
their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand''
just before the start of the school day.
</P>
<P>
   The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as
for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help
everybody be a witness for God.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere. You got to pray
everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new
legislation that bans open religious expression during
extracurricular activities including sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took
away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
``I thought that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This event allows us to keep (children) focused upon God,''
said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away. ``He
is the answer to all of our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event
allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to freely practice your faith. That is the
foremost amendment in the Bill of Rights. I think it's important
for us to do that here at school. This is lawful. This is what the
courts say we are allowed to do,'' Mignery said. ``I think the
reason we are losing many of our rights is because may of us aren't
exercising our rights today.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``See You at the Pole'' Website, the event
draws more than 3 million participants each year. The site said the
event is student initiated and came out of the desire of `` a small
group of teen-agers'' from Burleson, Texas, in 1990.

BUSH APPEARS TO ENJOY SUPPORT OF MANY IN MILITARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam.
George W. Bush joined the Texas National Guard and did not. But for
many in uniform, especially officers, that makes little difference.
It is Bush, not Gore, who seems to enjoy some automatic credibility
with the military because of his party affiliation, his policy
positions, his running mate, his advisers _ and his father.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore hoped his own military record would make him more
palatable to the nation's 1.4 million men and women in uniform _
and by extension the 24 million who are veterans _ he might be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after President Clinton's lack of a military record
and his advocacy for gays in the military set the stage for his
administration's roiling relations with the Pentagon, Gore appears
to have far less support in the military, especially among the
officers' corps. Bush, who did not serve in Vietnam but trained as
a fighter pilot during his National Guard stint, has wide support.
</P>
<P>
   In about 20 interviews in recent weeks, those in uniform or
recently retired from service expressed overwhelming, though not
universal, support for Bush _ not only as the Republican
presidential candidate, but as a veteran and the son of President
George Bush, who many said served ably as commander in chief during
the military's shining moment after Vietnam, the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   They cited Bush's policy proposals, his accusations that the
Clinton administration had overseen a ``military in decline,'' and
his high-profile military advisers, including his vice-presidential
running mate, Dick Cheney, a former secretary of defense, and Gen.
Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who Bush has all but said would be a member of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just more comfortable with the idea of a
Bush-Cheney-Powell team in the White House again,'' an Army colonel
said. (Even an Air Force colonel inclined to vote for Gore said he
wished he could still cast a vote for Powell as secretary of
state.)
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to military service, an issue that dogged
Clinton's campaign in 1992, many of those interviewed gave Bush the
benefit of the doubt for his time in the National Guard, which
attracted thousands of young people trying to avoid going to war in
Vietnam. And they offered only grudging respect for Gore's decision
to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it is not hard for Bush's supporters in uniform to
find something to admire in his service flying F-102 Delta Dagger
fighters for the guard, even if he never went to war. ``Anybody who
was willing to take the risks to learn to be a fighter pilot is
worthy,'' said one Army general, himself a Vietnam combat veteran.
``He made a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Several military men noted that Gore was an Army journalist _ a
profession of ill repute to many in uniform even if he was toiling
on behalf of the Pentagon _ and served an abbreviated tour in
Vietnam. ``If he had served in combat and brought home a Purple
Heart,'' an Army colonel said, ``the contrast might have been
greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as another officer put it using the sort of colorful
language often heard in the military, ``He was a public affairs
puke.''
</P>
<P>
   The men and women in the military, of course, have traditionally
been more conservative than the general electorate, especially
those in the officer corps. In recent years, more of its members
than ever have identified themselves as Republican. A survey last
year by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, a nonprofit
foundation based in North Carolina, found that 64 percent of young
officers were Republicans, compared with only 8 percent who were
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   So support for Bush from those in uniform is not altogether
surprising. Throughout his campaign, Bush has surrounded himself
with so many retired generals and admirals, including Powell and
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, that some Gore advisers have taken to
envious sniping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of thing you see in the Third World _ all
these generals lining up behind the politicians,'' one Gore adviser
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cheney announced the endorsements of an array of
retired military leaders, including several senior officers who
served in influential positions under President Clinton and Vice
President Gore, a fact the Bush campaign was careful to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   One of those endorsing Bush, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, who recently
stepped down as commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf,
said he did not agree with some of the harshest accusations that
Clinton and Gore had deliberately run down the military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zinni said a changing world and mounting problems with
readiness, including shortages of spare parts and problems with
recruiting and retaining quality troops, needed more attention than
they had received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've have these problems for a couple years and they haven't
been addressed,'' Zinni said. He, too, praised Bush's advisers,
including Richard L. Armitage, a senior Pentagon official in
President Ronald Reagan's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that people like Cheney and Powell and Armitage will
be part of a Bush administration,'' he added, ``encourages me that
there might be answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The military is not monolithic, of course. And Gore has several
high-ranking military retirees supporting him. Gen. John M.
Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
Adm. William Owens, a former vice chairman, have both advised the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several of those interviewed said Gore had stronger support
among the enlisted ranks, which are more racially and economically
diverse than the officer corps. One Army officer said that Gore was
seen as more likely to be supportive of expanding the presence of
women in uniform, noting that the Republican platform calls for
separating new recruits by sex in basic training, something many
women in uniform do not support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women and minorities will look at who is giving them
the best opportunities,'' the Army officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was clear that Gore _ despite his own record, his
service on the Senate's Armed Services Committee and his relatively
more hawkish views on defense issues compared with other Democrats
_ suffered from his association with Clinton, whose relations with
the military, especially early in his first administration, were
famously tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, people still serving
in the military are prohibited from making disparaging remarks
about civilian leaders, and the Pentagon's policy forbids overtly
partisan political activities, so all of those interviewed in
recent weeks spoke only if they would not be identified by name
and, in some cases, rank, service and base.
</P>
<P>
   Several said concerns about military readiness, which Bush has
relentlessly raised, had grown on Gore's watch.
</P>
<P>
   They also cited one of Gore's early missteps. During the
primaries Gore said he would make support for gays in the military
a condition for officers being considered for a position on the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gore reversed himself within days, but to
many the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a disaster,'' a Navy officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Leon S. Fuerth, a senior adviser to Gore, said that Gore had
built enormous credibility on defense issues as a senator and as
vice president. Fuerth also said Gore's service as an Army private
would give him ``some insight and understanding of military life''
that would help him in dealing with the Pentagon's brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton developed an excellent rapport with the
armed services as time went on, but at the very beginning of the
first Clinton administration, that wasn't yet in place,'' Fuerth
said. ``In the very beginning of a Gore administration, it would be
in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Bush's staunchest supporters _ the former commandant
of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles C. Krulak _ agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people I talk to in the military, both those serving
today and those who like me have retired,'' Krulak said, ``they're
just happy to have somebody who knows how to salute.''

 &HT;    New law puts girls in the game
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mount Zion-Jonesboro softball player Megan Burckhalter
doesn't have to deal with 20-minute bus rides to practice and play
home games at a local park anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Since her county athletics department decided to convert
baseball fields for softball use this fall, Burckhalter just walks
across the campus parking lot to scoop grounders.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Bianca Carter doesn't have to sit at home bored until
basketball season arrives. Since DeKalb County resurrected
volleyball programs that have been dormant for about 20 years, she
serves and sets after school now.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 28 years since Title IX, the federal law that
requires boys and girls sports programs to be treated equally at
schools that receive public funds. But until Georgia's Equity in
Sports Act went into effect in July, little was done to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's being taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   School districts have even more reason to respond to the problem
of gender inequality: Failure to comply could result in a loss of
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that it was not equal,'' Clayton County
athletics director Bob Brannon said. ``But we're trying to improve
and do the right the thing in every way. We should've done it
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   In some counties, they are hustling to find problems and correct
them. Two counties have added volleyball this fall to increase
girls participation numbers. Other schools have begun to break
ground on softball diamonds. Some have added Title IX task forces
to address the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been overdue,'' said Lucia Norwood, athletic coordinator
for DeKalb County. ``Awareness of the inequity was brought about by
several factors. But (the Atlanta Journal-Constitution series last
December) really had people standing up and taking notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Development Authority of Bibb County
forced Westside-Macon's baseball team to find a new home until a
comparable softball field is built at the Bibb County Sports
Complex.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball field _ which once was owned and operated by the
privately run Westside Boosters, Inc. _ was exquisite, with a
Wrigley Field-type brick backstop behind the plate, 50 box seats,
550 bleacher seats, lights and permanent restrooms and lights.
</P>
<P>
   The softball field, on the other hand, was enclosed by a
chain-linked fence, had temporary bleachers, no lights and two
portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, the Westside Boosters turned ownership over to
the publicly funded Development Authority. Public funds means
public rules, so the potential for Title IX lawsuits existed as
long as the boys team continued to play there, while the girls had
a less adequate field on school property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow a team in Bibb County to play at a
facility if playing at that facility is going to violate federal or
state law,'' Bibb County athletics director Raynette Evans said.
``The baseball field at the complex is far superior to the softball
field.''
</P>
<P>
   To level the playing field for boys and girls in some areas, the
playing fields have taken a different look. Patches of grass have
been ripped out of the baseball field and replaced with dirt, to
give them more of a softball feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this better,'' Burckhalter said. ``It's good, but it's
not great. I've played softball since I was 5 and a grass infield
is not softball.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County has spent about $500,000 to build seven softball
fields at its high schools, Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're gorgeous,'' Norwood said. ``We helped start
fast-pitch softball in Georgia, but there were never fields at all
the local schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas County, where volleyball teams were fielded for the
first time last year, lights were added to the softball field at
Alexander this year. On the surface, that appears to be a response
to the Equity in Sports Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look that way, but we planned to do this before,'' said
Samuel B. Duke, Douglas County director of safety, security and
athletics. ``We don't need a law to tell us we need to treat both
sexes the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, one of seven volleyball players at McNair, is glad that
there is a law in place. So is her coach, Vickie Mangum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the chance,'' said Mangum, a former track star
at Columbia High in DeKalb County. ``I want these girls to get more
out of this than I did.''

   To level the playing field for boys and girls in some areas, the
playing fields have taken a different look. Patches of grass have
been ripped out of the baseball field and replaced with dirt, to
give them more of a softball feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this better,'' Burckhalter said. ``It's good, but it's
not great. I've played softball since I was 5 and a grass infield
is not softball.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County has spent about $500,000 to build seven softball
fields at its high schools, Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're gorgeous,'' Norwood said. ``We helped start
fast-pitch softball in Georgia, but there were never fields at all
the local schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas County, where volleyball teams were fielded for the
first time last year, lights were added to the softball field at
Alexander this year. On the surface, that appears to be a response
to the Equity in Sports Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look that way, but we planned to do this before,'' said
Samuel B. Duke, Douglas County director of safety, security and
athletics. ``We don't need a law to tell us we need to treat both
sexes the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, one of seven volleyball players at McNair, is glad that
there is a law in place. So is her coach, Vickie Mangum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the chance,'' said Mangum, a former track star
at Columbia High in DeKalb County. ``I want these girls to get more
out of this than I did.''

 &HT;    Sport's debut shows off versatility
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ David Pichler has that synching feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic diver matches up so well to most other divers that
he was selected for both U.S. men's synchronized diving teams. Four
new synchro events are making their debut at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, a 1996 Olympian who will compete individually on
10-meter platform, and Troy Dumais are the springboard team, while
Pichler and Mark Ruiz will pair up for platform.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Wilkinson and Jenny Keim will be the women's platform
team. The United States did not qualify a team in springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Diving begins Friday at the Sydney International Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized diving follows the laws of science in that objects
that leave at the same time, no matter how much they weigh, land at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jay Lerew decided the synchro teams after three training
camps in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is a veteran, and he knows how to do other people's
takeoffs without any problem,'' Lerew said. ``He knows how to copy
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty versatile diver, I guess,'' said Pichler, who was
sixth on platform in 1996. ``Over the years, I've probably had 20
or 30 different takeoffs. I changed to try to make them better all
the time. It's pretty easy for me to try to do things, being a
gymnast before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese are considered the world's top diving team, in
individual events and synchro. However, Lerew isn't conceding
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys can do just as much,'' Lerew said. ``They do the same
dives, the same degree of difficulty and do it just as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson and Keim originally practiced by watching each other
in a mirror, then practiced mock takeoffs on the ground with their
backs to each other. Someone else watched to tell them if they were
in synch.
</P>
<P>
   On the platform, they have a simple ritual before diving
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura will say, `OK, put your arms up,'' Keim said. ``Then
``1-2-3- Go!''

COMMENTARY: OVER SADDAM'S BARREL 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nervous Nellie is worried about the strike by
gas-gouged truckers in France and the panic buying of petrol by
drivers in Britain. Nellie's fears are compounded by the rising
price of gasoline in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Be calm, replies Rosie Scenario. The tripling of the price of
oil to $35 a barrel will soon be rolled back by increased
production from our sensible friends in OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous Nellie presses: What if Saddam Hussein crosses everybody
up and reduces his sale of almost 3 million barrels a day, thereby
punishing the West by pushing prices even higher?
</P>
<P>
   That would be foolish of him, Rosie replies. Turning off the
spigot would further impoverish the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   But that never bothered him before, counters Nellie. And by
keeping oil prices up, he would greatly please the Russians, whose
economy is being saved only by the high price of their main export.
Russian technology and scientists in Iraq already help make it
possible for inspection-free Saddam to build weapons of mass
destruction and buy missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Relax, says Rosie, a little testily. Even if the price of oil
stays sky-high, that does not mean it would cause inflation,
triggering higher interest rates, then a stock market drop followed
by recession.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: But isn't that what happened last time?
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: That was then, when we were all hung up on the business
cycle. Rest assured that the New Economy can withstand oil shocks,
bursting bubbles and all the ills that flesh is heir to.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: But there has to be something the president can do. What
if October gets cold in Connecticut and the price of heating oil is
out of sight?
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: No problem _ we dump our strategic oil reserve on the
market and call it the Lieberman solution. Good quick fix that gets
us past the election.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: But what about a war shock on top of an oil price shock?
Saddam is saying that OPEC should defy superpowers, and claims that
Kuwait is stealing his oil by drilling slantwise. Isn't that what
he said last time, just before he started the Gulf War?
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: It's a bluff. Here is a statement from Gen. Paul
Mikolashek of the U.S. Central Command, an unbeatable force
stretched from Pakistan to Egypt. ``I see a lot of rhetoric ...
(Saddam's) armed forces have been degraded.'' Not to worry.
``Degraded'' is Pentagonese for ``hurt'' and shows that the jargon
of our military mind is invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: Like how many troops do we have there? It took over half
a million to stop Saddam last time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: We have 4,500 troops in Kuwait, a couple of Patriot
batteries, an Apache helicopter unit, plus an air base to patrol
the no-fly zone. Maybe 15,000 more troops floating around nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: That's going to stop the whole Iraqi army? Apaches that
couldn't take off in Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: Look, if Saddam miscalculated again, we'd reassemble the
Grand Coalition, call up our reserves, and send in CNN's Bernard
Shaw to narrate the bombing of Baghdad _ the whole nine-yard
megillah.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: Bill Clinton would do that?
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: All from upward of 50,000 feet, with not one U.S.
casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie: But what if Saddam says he has the Bomb? And says he's
willing to commit suicide but would take Tel Aviv or New York along
with him? It may be a bluff, but he's had years to build a nuclear
or biological bomb in secret, and I'd hate to be the president to
take the chance. We have no defense against a single missile, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie: Get over your nightmares. After we call his military
bluff, we'll get next week's G-7 meeting to demand the oil cartel
cut prices to $20 a barrel. Then it's world prosperity as far as
the ear can hear.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right, Rosie Scenario or Nervous Nellie? I say we should
hope for the best and prepare for the worst. That means asking this
president and the candidates to take his place: What if? Are we
ready?
</P>
<P>
   Let each cool-headed debater say during those 90 unforgiving
minutes how he would deal with Saddam's economic and military
threats. As Kipling never wrote: If you can keep your head while
all others about you are losing theirs _ perhaps you don't
understand the seriousness of the situation.

GOLF ON PAR AS OLYMPIC SPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing Tiger Woods, the planet's most famous athlete, won't
have on his impressive 2000 resume is an Olympic moment, unles
Buick's prime-time commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is not part of the International Olympic Committee family,
which includes those noted sportsmen and sportswomen skilled in
shooting BB guns, riding horses in top hat and tails (it's
appropriately n dressage) or playing Ping-Pong.
</P>
<P>
   How stupid is this?
</P>
<P>
   Golf's lineage dates back 500 years or so, putting it in a class
with bows and arrows, and it's played around the world by men and
women. Still, golfers have not been on the invited list since the
1904 Games in St. Louis, when Canadian George Lyon won the title
and bombed a 331-yard drive during the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the game just fades away when the Summer Olympics
whip the globe into nationalistic frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a chance golfers could join the party but probably
not for at least eight years. And as is typical with all things
Olympic, despite the feel-good images being beamed by NBC, the
obstacles to golf becoming an Olympic sport involve politics, ego
and power.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods and his fellow pros are not likely to be welcome,
either, at least under the current format.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle, getting a governing body recognized by the
IOC, has been cleared. It's not the PGA, LPGA, R&AMP;A or USGA,
although the latter two are major players.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has added the WAGC (World Amateur Golf Council) to the
Olympian alphabet stew, deeming it the official federation for
golf. This group doesn't get a lot of publicity, but it's been
around 42 years. The WAGC was formed in 1958 because the Unites
States Golf Association was getting just too darned many requests
for international matches.
</P>
<P>
   The joint secretaries of the WAGC are David Fay of the USGA and
Peter Dawson of the R&AMP;A (Royal &AMP; Ancient), so the emphasis now is
on amateur contestants.
</P>
<P>
   The first WAGC championship was in October 1958 and the
Australian team beat the U.S. contingent, which was captained by
Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In setting up their Summer Games, the Aussies blew a marvelous
public-relations opportunity by not capitalizing on this bit of
history and including golf as a demonstration sport at Sydney.
Foot-dragging is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Berlin, the WAGC won approval to come up with an
Olympic proposal, which will probably take a long time to develop.
But the sport's governing federation has to really !ital!want
Olympic status and the WAGC doesn't sound like it does.
</P>
<P>
   Every two years, the group has its team competition of amateurs
from around the world. At this year's matches in Berlin, the
American team won the title for the 11th straight time, but don't
think we'd dominate the Olympics. France won the women's title.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is inclined to think this in itself is a golden enough
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there is an Olympics of golf held every two
years,'' explained Marty Parkes, senior director of communications
for the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is one of those sports where people argue they already
have a lot of interesting tournaments going on,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of issues involved. Would it be for professionals,
amateurs or would it be open for everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Professional golf has the four major titles and a full slate of
world championships. Amateur golf is the same way. The thinking is
that the Olympics might somehow dilute what is already great about
golf.
</P>
<P>
   I think it would make it even better.
</P>
<P>
   After all, tennis has its own Grand Slam, but Venus Williams,
who owns two of those titles this year, is in Sydney going for the
gold. Track and field has a world championship every year, as does
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a team should not be a problem, since it's done every
year at the professional and amateur level. And Olympic golf could
include team and individual competitions spread over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And there is sentiment to include golf. Aussie Greg Norman
thinks it's a shame his sport is not part of Sydney's festivities.
And American Fred Couples, who is careful about when and where he
plays, endorses making golf an Olympic sport. He said he would love
to make an Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone would love to go through that and you would get
players to go even if it did take two weeks,'' Couples said of an
Olympic experience. ``I wouldn't even bat an eye.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    NAACP establishes group for registering black voters
 &HT;    By Melanie Eversley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NAACP announced Wednesday that it has formed a
new group _ the NAACP National Voter Fund _ to register
African-Americans to vote in several key states, including Georgia,
and educate them about the issues and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real motivation for this campaign was the importance of
this election and the absolute necessity for electing a pro-civil
rights Congress and a pro-civil rights president,'' said Julian
Bond, NAACP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a brand-new organization, 6 weeks old,
and it has staff up and working in Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois,
Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Virginia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group will serve as a political watchdog but also will
include hands-on campaigning. There will be telephone calls,
television and radio ads, trips through malls and door-to-door
visits. In Georgia, a bus is traveling the state so the group can
register voters and educate the electorate on what's at stake. The
National Voter Fund has a different tax status from the NAACP,
which permits it to advocate for issues and provide information
about candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking at voter empowerment, and we're really
talking about three main issues: registration, education and
participation,'' said Mary Peeler, Georgia state director for the
group and coordinator of its office in Southwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Black voting statistics have improved recently, a trend the
NAACP would like to continue. In 1994, for example, only 37.1
percent of eligible African-American voters cast ballots, census
statistics show. But in the next congressional, non-presidential
election, in 1998, African-Americans were the only racial or ethnic
group whose voter participation numbers went up. That year, 40
percent of eligible African-American voters cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   What is key to this new focus is that Donna Brazile ran voter
participation operations for the Democratic Party in 1998, said
Hastings Wyman, editor and publisher of the bimonthly Southern
Political Report newsletter. This year, she is running Gore's
campaign. So far, the organization has registered 21,000 new voters
and drawn 2,300 new volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are important issues to be decided _ the composition of
the Supreme Court, health care, what kind of education our children
are going to have, what will happen to Social Security, the hate
crimes laws, racial profiling. All these issues are paramount in
the minds of black voters,'' Bond said.

<P>
   MIZPE RAMON, Israel _ At the edge of the largest crater in the
Negev, this isolated town draws nature lovers, artists, spiritual
seekers and immigrants with nowhere else to settle. ``The stars
talk to you here,'' one sculptor said, ``and you are tempted to
talk back.''
</P>
<P>
   As a manufacturing center, though, Mizpe Ramon's time has come
and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Its industrial zones stand as skeletal remains in a harsh, lunar
landscape, where some warehouses are occupied by art studios, some
by ashrams. In the deserted industrial park at the entrance to
town, only one factory remains, and in August, 60 immigrant women
barricaded themselves inside to make sure that it did not close.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ from Morocco, India, Iraq, Russia and the Caucasus _
had spent years hunched over aging sewing machines there, stitching
collars and pockets onto army uniforms for the minimum wage. It was
repetitive, mind-numbing work. But it was work, and they were a
community, and when their children dressed to report for military
service, they saw their handiwork and were proud.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the 60 women, humiliated one too many times by the
factory owners who came and went, rose up and took Israel by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When they received their latest in a series of letters of
dismissal, the women decided instead to dismiss the owner. They
soldered shut the warehouse doors so that the equipment and back
orders could not be removed and they took up vigil inside. In
shifts, they talked, ate, laughed, slept and celebrated the
Sabbath, their children zooming through the cavernous building on
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, television cameras, politicians and national union
leaders began traipsing there, and the women became a national
cause celebre, good-natured spokeswomen for several neglected
sectors of modern Israel: the dying blue-collar industries, the
faraway immigrant development towns, even the desert that has never
quite bloomed in the way that David Ben-Gurion, the country's first
prime minister, intended.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, sitting at the workstations whose numbers served as
their names, the women sipped champagne from plastic cups, shaking
their heads in disbelief. This was almost their factory now. They
were signing on the dotted lines to become the first textile
cooperative in Israel, the first all-female cooperative and the
first one in ailing Mizpe Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am a boss,'' Malka Simantov said, beaming, 22 years
after she first started at the plant, on opening day. ``We are all
bosses. And believe me, we are not going to call the girls by their
numbers or snooze in the office while they sweat. It will not be
easy. But for the first time in our lives, we women will be in
control of our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizpe Ramon is about 30 miles south of the humble cabin in Sde
Boqer to which Ben-Gurion, an ascetic, retired when he left
government. In the spirit of his vision for the desert, pioneers
built a town there in 1956, only to be followed by Moroccan and
Romanian immigrants who had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   The government settled them there in cinder-block housing
projects, part of a plan to spread the population throughout the
land. It also granted business owners financial incentives,
including cash grants, tax breaks and lucrative government
contracts, to invest and create jobs in Mizpe Ramon and other
development towns.
</P>
<P>
   The system of subsidies was intended to make the businesses
eventually self-sustaining, but the model did not work in many
places, especially as the Israeli economy became increasingly
high-tech and white-collar. Once the government demanded that the
businesses generate a profit rather than merely sustain a
population, many could not compete with manufacturers abroad.
Factories began to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Mizpe Ramon, unlike other development towns, could trade on its
natural beauty _ and its crater, a phenomenon of nature. It
converted into a tourist economy, albeit a tiny one. The army
placed an officers' training center nearby, and now about 40
percent of the population is in the military.
</P>
<P>
   But old immigrants find it hard to move, and new immigrants are
still settled here by the government. So, with unemployment more
than 10 percent, each minimum-wage job is defended as if it was a
longtime resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you love a job where they make you bring your own
toilet paper?'' asked Havazelet Ingbar, a mother of four. ``Well,
we did. We were making uniforms for the soldiers. My son would come
home on leave and straighten the collar that his mother had sewn
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingbar, 42, who was born in India, always prided herself on her
manual dexterity; she can attach a collar to a shirt in 30 seconds.
But as the petite firebrand who led the women's revolt, she proved
herself politically dextrous, too, and great on camera.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the factory has had but one contractor: the
Israeli army. It used to get a million-dollar contract to produce
military work uniforms, but the army has gradually reduced the size
of its order because of budget cuts and because it has been buying
more uniforms from the United States _ in compliance with the
purchasing requirements attached to military aid grants.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, each time the military cut the contract, the
current factory owner, Moshe Partok, would serve the women with
letters of dismissal, they said. Then, joined by a local labor
council leader, Danny Sheetrit, and a worker, generally Ingbar, he
would travel to the Defense Ministry to argue for the life of the
plant. The contract would be increased, and the factory would go
on.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Partok refused the ministry's slightly enhanced
order. ``When I saw the size of the order, I said, `That's it,' ''
Partok said, explaining that in the last three years, the factory
has lost $125,000. ``I feel the pain of the workers. But you have
to understand, I had no choice. I couldn't go on losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the visit to the Defense Ministry, however, the women
believed that Partok was playing games, ``exploiting us and the
state,'' they said. That is when they barricaded themselves in the
windowless factory, which looks like a hangar, with neon lights
hung high over the worktables piled with khaki fabric. And that is
when Sheetrit brought the case to the attention of the Histadrut
union federation's leader, Amir Peretz, who is also a member of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Partok sought $200,000 for his business. Potential buyers
demanded the government's assurance of a $775,000 contract, which
the government would not give. So Peretz visited the factory and
stunned the women by suggesting that they take over the factory
themselves. He offered a long-term floating loan of $200,000 _
which the union considers a write-off and does not expect to
recover. Nervously, they agreed; they had, after all, been running
the place for years under largely absentee owners.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, before signing, they peppered the union officials
with questions. If the company gets off the ground, they were told,
they stand to earn a far better living. If it fails, they will be
no worse off than they are now, the officials said. Addressing
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the officials acknowledged
and tried to assuage their concerns about collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Partok says he thinks the union is misleading the women. Without
a recovery plan that entails laying off half the employees, he
says, the business will not survive. But because of the sensation
that their case has caused, the women expect to start off with more
orders than Partok could ever secure: civilian as well as
government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   During the signing, for instance, Nir Rubin, a businessman from
Eilat, appeared, prepared to give them a contract for $70,000 worth
of hotel supplies. ``I want to keep the work within the country's
limits,'' he said. A couple from the Haifa area showed up, too,
offering free economic counseling. ``They touched our hearts,''
said Anat Cohen, a worker.
</P>
<P>
   After the champagne and pretzels, Simantov scurried around
cleaning up and preparing lunch for the male union bosses. Old
habits die hard. She was in a sensational mood, though, humming as
she worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man thought he was working with dummies,'' she said. ``He
never thought the dummies would throw him out and take over the
joint.''  &QL;

 &HT;    INSTEAD OF A HIJACK, CUBANS APPARENTLY SOUGHT TO DEFECT IN
STOLEN PLANE
 &HT;    EDS: New top with updates on survivors going to U.S.; revisions
throughout
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ They apparently set off in hopes of finding new
lives of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And the nine Cubans who survived when their small plane
crash-landed in the ocean Tuesday moved closer to their presumed
dream late Wednesday when U.S. officials decided that all of them
should receive medical evaluations here.
</P>
<P>
   Eight survivors were transferred to a Coast Guard cutter that
would take them to Key West, where they would join a ninth survivor
who was already being treated here for head and neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law allows Cubans to apply for asylum and residency if they
reach American soil.
</P>
<P>
   A key to their fate will be whether the FBI concludes that the
plane was flown from Cuba voluntarily or whether it was hijacked,
as Cuban authorities initially reported Tuesday. The U.S.
government could return hijackers to Cuba or prosecutve them in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   If it is determined they left voluntarily, U. S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials will decide whether they qualify
for asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down Tuesday about 60 miles west of Cuba, with
the survivors picked up by a passing Panamanian freighter, the
Chios Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some of those on board the Soviet-built crop duster
said there was no hijacking because the pilot of the plane planned
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no hijack, it was a way of looking for freedom,''
Isidro Puig(cq), father of two men on the plane, told Reuters news
service. Puig, who lives in Hialeah, Fla., said the pilot, Lenin
Iglesias Hernandez(cq), planned the escape attempt for his family
and a few select friends.
</P>
<P>
   News service reports from Cuba supported the story.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters there were told that Iglesias set off Tuesday morning
for a routine day of crop-dusting, but left behind his partner,
flight engineer Juan Jose Galiano Cabrera(cq), saying he had to
take care of an administrative matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Iglesias flew to another small airstrip, picked up his
family and friends and headed for freedom, Galiano told reporters.
Iglesias radioed Cuban air controllers that he was hijacked, but
that was a cover story, Galiano said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why the airplane headed west toward Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula instead of north toward the Florida Keys and
Miami. While there were some reports the plane may have run out of
fuel, Miami television station WSVN reported Wednesday that the
pilot might have ditched the plane on purpose near the Panamanian
freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were hoping to learn the details in the coming
days. They had a brief interview Wednesday with Rodolfo Fuentes,
36, who suffered serious injuries in the crash-landing and was
brought by Coast Guard helicopter to Key West late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes was in stable condition in the intensive care unit with
a concussion, a lacerated scalp and a sore neck, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight other survivors _ two men, three women and three
children _ had remained aboard the Chios Dream most of Wednesday
because rough seas prevented immediately transferring them to the
Coast Guard cutter Courageous, which rendezvoused with the Chios
Dream late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials and FBI agents were aboard the Courageous,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is involved because of the reported hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it doesn't appear to be a hijacking, but until
we interview them we won't know for sure,'' FBI spokeswoman Judy
Orihuela(cq ) in Miami. ``It appears the plane was stolen in
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in Miami said all the survivors hoped to apply for
asylum and to remain in the United States. Activists in Miami's
Cuban exile community began working on their cases, with U.S. Rep.
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican, sending a letter to
President Clinton urging that the asylum requests be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, Cubans intercepted at sea are normally
interviewed there and returned to Cuba unless they appear to have
legitimate asylum claims, which are usually based on a fear of
persecution should they return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who reach U.S. soil are normally allowed to apply for
asylum, although those found to have violated laws in their attempt
to reach the U.S. can be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether stealing the airplane _ which was
property of the Cuban government _ would create problems for the
Cuban survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, who was being cared for at the Lower Keys Medical
Center, didn't talk to reporters Wednesday, but met with his
relatives and Miami lawyer Manny Diaz, who played a prominent role
in trying to keep Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. David Bannan, said Fuentes was in good shape
considering the trauma he had suffered, but was clearly worried
about what the coming days might bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing quite well and his spirits are good, although he's
obviously concerned about his situation,'' Bannan said.

STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIA PLAN WOULD AID AFFLUENT
</HEADLINE>
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A school voucher initiative on the California ballot this fall
would, once fully implemented, give at least $2.6 billion in
taxpayer money to families _ most of them affluent _ whose children
already attend private schools, according to an academic study
released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Proposition 38, would make all the state's
students eligible for a $4,000 voucher that could be used to defray
private-school tuition. While the measure is intended, in part, to
help low-income parents flee failing schools, the report by Policy
Analysis for California Education suggests that the primary
beneficiaries may be wealthy private-school students. Even some
voucher advocates have criticized the initiative for not limiting
the vouchers to impoverished families or struggling schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not expand choice to more families,'' said Luis
Huerta, a co-author of the report, which was a collaboration of
professors at Stanford University and University of California at
Berkeley. ``It's essentially tax relief for the well off.''
</P>
<P>
   While the voucher costs less than the $6,313 California spends
to educate each public-school student, private-school enrollment
would have to more than double to 1.5 million before the state
would break even on the initiative _ that is, before the money
saved by students leaving the system would make up for the vouchers
given to children already in private school. Currently private
schools report only 32,000 vacant seats, though more schools would
probably be created if the initiative passed.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``It's likely that the most disadvantaged
children _ those from low-income families with minimally educated
parents _ would be the ones left behind in mediocre public
schools.''

MARKET PLACE: TELECOMMUNICATIONS WOES SEEM TO BE ROLLED UP IN
SPRINT
</HEADLINE>
  By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an industry that is supposed to be improving the lives of
people around the world, or at least around the United States, the
telecommunications business sure looks ugly these days. Shares in
communications carriers _ large and small _ are in a mire. Growth
rates are slowing. The downturn is so broad that it might even
comfort AT&AMP;T, which is stuck in one of its own periodic funks.
</P>
<P>
   This week's victim appears to be the Sprint Corp. Sprint said
Wednesday that its core operation would fail to meet analysts'
earnings expectations for the third quarter. The company added that
the core unit would grow at its slowest rate since the company
issued a tracking stock for its wireless division almost two years
ago. As for the wireless unit, the company said it would grow by
about 800,000 subscribers this quarter, about 100,000 fewer than
many analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sprint said the wireless unit would generate more
cash flow in the quarter than had been previously expected,
investors dumped the wireless shares, sending them down $7.81, to
$33, on the New York Stock Exchange. Sprint shares fell $1.50, to
$26.81, also on the Big Board. As could be expected, the Sprint
news spread like a contagion, sending down the shares of just about
every big U.S. communications carrier.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it has been recently in the communications
services business. Investors are afraid that too many companies and
too much newly raised capital are chasing too few customers and too
few revenue opportunities. That can be seen as a general problem.
Throw in the specific fact that the long-distance telephone
business is imploding amid ferocious price competition and much of
the industry now has an investor base that is just looking for
reasons to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sprint's wireless unit. The company said that it would
sign up about 11 percent fewer customers this quarter than analysts
had expected but that it still hoped to meet its overall subscriber
target for this year. The shares dropped 19 percent Wednesday
despite the fact that the company said its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be ``in the
low $100 million range.'' An analyst for Salomon Smith Barney said
Wednesday that he had expected that figure to come in at $71
million. A Merrill Lynch analyst had that estimate at $55.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which has about 8 million wireless subscribers, said it
would miss the earlier target partly because of increased
competition, but also because it was cutting off more of its own
users for not paying their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if William Esrey, Sprint's chairman, had had his way,
he would not be running the company today. Sprint was supposed to
be owned by WorldCom by now. It is not, and it turns out that not
only did the failure of that merger bruise some egos, it has also
bruised Sprint's financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Sprint said that its core group (just about
everything except wireless) would grow about 4 percent in the third
quarter compared with results from the quarter a year earlier. Not
only does that mean that Sprint may grow more slowly than AT&AMP;T this
quarter, it also means that Sprint's growth has slowed every
quarter this year. In the fourth quarter of 1999, Sprint's core
unit grew about 8.1 percent compared with figures in the period a
year earlier. The growth figure was 7.1 percent in the first
quarter of this year and 5.5 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The price wars in the long-distance business have certainly
played a role in that slowdown. But so did the collapse of the
WorldCom deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a belief that in getting the merger completed we
would have to divest some of the Internet business,'' Arthur B.
Krause, Sprint's chief financial officer, said in an interview
Wednesday. ``So the focus on those sorts of products was not the
same as if we were trying to grow those markets independently. If
the deal had gone through, you wind up saying, `OK, we're looking
at a combined unit going forward.' So when the deal failed, we lost
some momentum that we can regain with some effort.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkably candid thing for a chief financial officer
to say: Part of the reason Sprint is growing so slowly is that the
company is now stuck with a data communications unit that was
damaged through neglect when Sprint thought it would have to sell
that division to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted
that Sprint's core operation would earn 49 cents a share this
quarter. Wednesday, the company said it would earn 45 to 47 cents.
Krause said that a big part of the difference could be attributed
to Sprint's continued ownership of 25 percent of a money-losing
Brazilian communications venture. People close to Sprint said the
company had expected to have sold that stake by now and was still
trying to find a buyer.

LASORDA LOVES BEING BACK ON IMPORTANT STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There he was Wednesday night at the Olympic
Park Baseball Stadium, that evoker of the Great Dodger In The Sky,
Tom Lasorda, wobbling out to home plate during the pregame
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   And looking so out of place in the red-white-and-blue uniform of
the U.S. Olympic baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Who could figure?
</P>
<P>
   In September of the year 2000, in a city on the Pacific Rim
thousands of miles away, in a time zone 18 hours ahead of Southern
California, in an event that preaches charity, tolerance and
forbearance, in a frenzied atmosphere not exactly conducive to a
gentleman who will celebrate his 73rd birthday Friday, Tom Lasorda
finds himself in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Is there nothing sacred left on this planet?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I know they've stuck a comedian _ and a lousy one at
that _ in the ``Monday Night Football'' TV booth. And I know there
is this weird law they passed in California that won't allow the
citizens to light up cigarettes in bars, of all places. And I know
the irritating Dick Vitale earns more than $1 million a year for
reciting gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Lasorda actually with a chance to lead a team to a gold
medal? Is that Baron de Courbetin I hear doing cartwheels in his
casket?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Lasorda, a Hall of Fame manager who had an
extraordinary career with the Los Angeles Dodgers. But when I think
of the Olympics, I think of young, lithe athletes training years to
pursue their gold-medal dreams, honing their bodies into peak
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lasorda never has been exactly linked with the Olympian
ideal, although it must be said for ol' Tommy, luvvie dear, that he
can run faster, leap higher and display stronger resolve when some
unknowing waiter brings him a dinner check.
</P>
<P>
   America's guest _ at least at restaurants throughout the country
_ suddenly has become the world's guest.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's passion for the Dodgers, obviously, has been exceeded
by his passion to remain in the limelight, or why else would a
septuagenarian who departed the Dodgers managing job four years ago
because of heart problems enthusiastically decide to accept such a
demanding position?
</P>
<P>
   Human beings who are on center stage for a long time often find
it difficult to cope when they lapse into the shadows _ as they all
do _ because too many become hopelessly addicted to fame.
</P>
<P>
   We've all known that Lasorda long has had a compulsion for food,
but now it's apparent that he also has a compulsion for public
adulation. And what better place to find it than in the highest
profile athletic event in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tom Lasorda offered another reason for his managerial
return.
</P>
<P>
   He draped himself in the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had to do this for my country,'' he said after his
team upped its record to 4-0 with a 4-0 win over the Koreans on
first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz's dramatic eighth-inning grand
slam. ``I love my country and this is my way of repaying a debt to
it. I just felt I could take a bunch of young men and make them
believe in themselves. And so far they have. People have been
doubting us, but we're still unbeaten and I'm so proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was standing on the field speaking to reporters near the
runway to the players' locker rooms, and several hundred patrons
were hanging over the railing, telling Lasorda how much they liked
him and how great a guy he is and what a privilege it was to see
him manage again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this, Tommy . . . just look at this,'' implored one
guy, holding a large ``Lasorda For President'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda looked up happily and was savoring every moment of it.
He was back on Broadway after being shunted to the outback, or
whatever you call being Dodgers vice president of keeping out of
the way of Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did Doug Mientkiewicz's home run compare to Kirk
Gibson's?'' I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gibson home run was a tremendous thrill and this was a
tremendous thrill,'' he said. ``I felt overcome with joy in both
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it feel strange being in a uniform other than that of
the Dodgers?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still baseball,'' Lasorda replied. ``I thought I had
given up all that nervousness I once felt when I retired from the
Dodgers. But it has returned. Here I was sitting in that dugout
tonight and it was impossible for me to relax. It seemed like the
game was on the line with every pitch. It was just like the old
days with the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you consider replacing Davey Johnson and returning to
the Dodgers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way. I had my time as a major-league manager. I made the
Hall of Fame. That's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why are you managing again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I'm doing it for my country. No other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda kept waving to those people who were yelling at him.
</P>
<P>
   He was smiling, because again he was hearing the cheers that had
grown silent in recent years.

COMMENTARY: THE WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been trying mightily to present to the nation
an image of a more diverse, more inclusive Republican Party. But
it's not an easy sell because his is a party with more than its
share of troglodytes.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, even as Bush was sending his own message by
happily and comfortably kissing Oprah on the cheek, a
pro-Republican television ad by an independent group in Missouri
was featuring a white woman complaining that she had to ``act
fast'' and get her son out of a public school that had ``a bit more
diversity than he could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press noted that the ad is running in Kansas
City, where a bitter battle over school desegregation is being
fought.
</P>
<P>
   The ad maker tried to have it both ways by sending viewers a
loud message that a vulnerable white youngster was being exposed to
the danger of too much diversity, while at the same time insisting
_ off-camera _ that the word ``diversity'' did not refer to
anyone's ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
   I find that kind of not-so-subliminable poppycock to be rat
funny.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second ad was the work of a conservative commentator and
activist named Richard Nadler, who created an independent group
called the Republican Ideas Political Committee. His goal, Nadler
told me in an interview, is to elect Republican candidates to
office.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is narrated by a woman who says: ``Back in 1994, Ralph
and I started an educational savings account for the kids. Our
Julie attended public school. She was an honors student and the
captain of the debate team. Our accounts helped put her through
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Jason started hanging with the wrong crowd, we had to
act fast. We didn't want him where drugs and violence were
fashionable. That was a bit more diversity than he could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman emphasized the word ``diversity.'' She went on to say
that she and her husband sent Jason to a private school ``where the
moral expectations are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the ad, it is very difficult to avoid the feeling that
its real message is that school integration has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said the word ``diversity'' referred only to the drugs
and violence mentioned in the narrator's previous sentence. I asked
him why _ especially in the midst of a controversy over school
integration _ he would choose to use that word in a context that,
at best, would cause confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he said, ``being a conservative rather than a
liberal I don't genuflect every time I hear `diversity.' On the
contrary, I think it's frequently used as a code word for lack of
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   A description of the ad was contained in a front-page article in
The Washington Post on Tuesday. The article infuriated Nadler. ``I
woke up up this morning,'' he said, ``and discovered I was the No.
1 racist in the nation because some son of a bitch at The
Washington Post said I was.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, The Washington Post did not accuse Nadler of
being a racist. But a number of professional observers have found
the ad to be problematic. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School for Communications at the University of
Pennsylvania, said in the Associated Press article: ``Instead of
making a case for parental choice it appears to make the case
against diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Nadler's motivations, his ad was potentially
embarrassing to Bush and the national Republican Party. In addition
to undermining Bush's efforts to promote diversity within the
party, it comes just a week after it became widely known that the
word ``rats,'' in large white capital letters, had been inserted
into a Republican Party ad attacking Vice President Al Gore on the
issue of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly disavowed Nadler's ads. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman
for the Texas governor, said: ``We talked to the governor about
that. His thought is that it is an inappropriate message and the ad
should not air.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We think that diversity is a strength of America's
public school system. It's a strength of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   I called Nadler and asked if Governor Bush's objections would
lead him to pull the ad. He said: ``Probably not. But we'll see.''

 &HT;    Area shelters forced to turn away homeless
 &HT;    By Ryan Weber
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ohio _ Local shelters have been filling to the brim,
forcing some homeless people to live outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton City Councilwoman Kathy Becker, a coordinator for
Greater Miami Case Management, said she and Hamilton Police
officers have been finding more people around town seeking shelter
in vacant lots and areas overgrown with brush.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the city's Neighborhood Development Department
had tallied 828 homeless individuals in Butler County and 249
homeless families with children.
</P>
<P>
   The trend appeared to peak over Labor Day weekend. Becker
pointed to an area behind the Hamilton Plaza shopping center that
she described as ``condemnable.'' At least six people were living
there, near railroad tracks,
</P>
<P>
   with no access to restrooms or showers.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, an elderly veteran had driven to Hamilton
from Arizona for the holiday weekend when his car broke down.
Becker said police found him sitting on a bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Veterans Affairs) got him a plane ticket home,'' she said.
``We arranged for him to get into a shelter in Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scrambles to find lodging have become all to common, she
said. Two Butler County homeless shelters _ Hope House in
Middletown and Haven House in Hamilton _ have felt some relief
since the holiday, but Becker said the homeless population has
``seen a tremendous increase over the past year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker has her own theories about the cause, placing some blame
on welfare reform turning people away and the inability of minimum
wage jobs to pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud anyone that wants to work, but minimum wage is not a
livable wage,'' she said. ``It's hard for people to make ends meet.
They could be working 60 hours a week and still not be able to
afford basic needs. Some
</P>
<P>
   people lose their housing because one month they have to choose
between medicine for their children and paying the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Becker continues to work with police to find help and
resources for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamilton police have played a major role in this,'' she said,
noting that in some cities officers simply arrest the homeless for
trespassing. ``We don't arrest people here. We look at
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the alternatives are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emergency resources are never enough,'' Becker said. ``But
we've never walked away from someone.''

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore accused
pharmaceutical companies on Wednesday of gouging the elderly,
pointing to the examples of several people he said were having
problems paying for their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not repeat a personal anecdote about
prescription drugs that Republicans have sharply ridiculed: the one
about his mother-in-law, who, he said last month, paid three times
as much for her arthritis medication as he did for the same drug
for his dog.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has since said he based the anecdote on a congressional
study rather than on any actual bills paid by his mother-in-law,
Margaret Ann Aitcheson, who lives with his family at the vice
president's residence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gov. George W. Bush's campaign has seized on news
accounts casting doubt on the anecdote's accuracy, Gore's aides
have insisted that the overall point _ that drug companies are
gouging the elderly _ was valid.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have kept the matter alive, saying the anecdote
demonstrated that Gore makes up stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Gore's Republican rival, kept the heat on Wednesday,
saying in an interview with Reuters that Gore had a tendency ``to
make up facts to make his case.'' Bush added, ``The idea that he
would make up facts about a family member confirms what I have said
in the past, that he'll say anything to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, at a rally in a park here on Wednesday morning, devoted
much of his speech to the problems people on Medicare face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should seniors be charged a much higher price than anybody
else in America and anybody else in the world?'' he asked. ``Drug
companies are running up record profits while seniors cannot afford
the medicines that their doctors prescribe.''
</P>
<P>
   He then mentioned several people, including Florence Sykes of
New Hampshire, Shirley Kendall of Connecticut and Jacqueline
Johnson of Missouri, as burdened by the cost of prescription drugs.
``Now these are the people that I'm fighting for,'' he said. ``And
these are the people that are your parents and your grandparents
and, in some cases, you yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially the point he made last month at a town-hall
meeting in Tallahassee, Fla., when he mentioned his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Tribune gave this account of the meeting: ``After
hearing from several retirees about having to choose which
medications to buy, Gore suggested the pharmaceutical industry
should lower prices. As an example, he offered the plight of his
mother-in-law, who spends $108 a month for a drug called Lodine,
which helps relieve the pain of arthritis. Gore said his
14-year-old black Labrador retriever, Shilo, also suffers from
arthritis and he has a veterinarian's prescription for Lodine. The
difference? It costs less than $39 a month to fill the dog's
prescription for what Gore said is the exact same drug. `Don't you
think that ought to be changed?' he asked as the crowd
applauded.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported on Monday that Gore's remarks were
based on figures from a congressional report, not on his family's
actual drug bills, and the matter has nipped at Gore's heels all
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Gore campaign said the report that Gore had
cited put the wholesale price of Lodine, the arthritis drug for
humans, at $1.20 per capsule and Etogesic, the one for dogs, at 42
cents. The Lodine for Aitcheson cost $2.13 per capsule, while
Shiloh's Etogesic cost 92 cents per capsule, the campaign said. The
campaign did not specify the dosage for humans or for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A check by The New York Times of several pharmacies and
veterinary clinics in Washington found a price disparity between
Lodine and Etogesic capsules roughly similar to that given by Gore.
But the capsules were different sizes. For Lodine, the cost ranged
from $1.81 to $2.29 per 300-milligram capsule. For Etogesic, the
prices were 80 cents to 96 cents per 150-milligram capsule. By the
milligram, Lodine and Etogesic are much closer in price than Gore's
anecdote suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, was inundated again on Wednesday
with questions about the vice president's mother-in-law. Asked why
Gore had not mentioned her on Wednesday as he cited personal
stories, Lehane said: ``The issue is not about him, the issue is
about the American people, and that's the point of this. The Bush
campaign has spent two years trying to find an issue. Apparently
they think dogs is their issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter interrupted, saying, ``No, they think hyperbole is
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said: ``Well, we'll see. I think the American people are
going to be a lot more concerned about who's offering them a real
prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was eager to move on to other subjects. Gore said
today in an interview with Fox News that on Thursday he would
address the increase in the price of heating oil, no doubt
affording him the opportunity to discuss Bush's ties to the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits of the big oil companies have skyrocketed just at
the time when the American people have been paying these gigantic
price increases,'' Gore told Fox. ``I'm going to be making a major
policy speech tomorrow outlining a specific course of action.''

 &HT;    Tamas off-target for Americans
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Shooting 50-meter prone rifle in cold, windy, rainy
conditions, Tom Tamas had a perfect score until his 16th shot, when
he scored a nine. Two shots later, he scored another nine and knew
he was in a bit of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was a flaky one,'' said Tamas, 35, who shoots with the
U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit. ``I thought it would have been a 10.
The other one, I put out. I thought, `I can't drop any more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was fine until the string of shots from 41-50, when he
dropped two more points. He wound up shooting 594 to tie for 13th
with five other shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad, but I expected to be in the final,'' said Tamas,
who shot a perfect 600 to win the 1998 World Championships. ``It's
very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only eight qualified for the final. Jonas Edman of Sweden, who
shot 599 in the qualification, won the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get too mad,'' Tamas said, ``In shooting, you're
going to have a bad time, every now and then. But this was bad
place to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamas said three shots recoiled badly, but he has no idea why
the other three shots missed the bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun being here,'' he said, ``but I'll remember this as
a disappointing event for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Edman's near-perfect qualifying round got him to the finals. A
solid performance there won him the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Edman of Sweden fell one point short of a perfect 600 score in
the opening round and then held on with 701.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Torben Grimmel of Denmark won the silver with 700.4 and Sergei
Martynov of Belarus the bronze with 700.3. Martynov qualified just
behind Edman with 598 points. Grimmel shot a 597 to reach the final
round of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Medal favorites Michael Babb of Germany and Russia's Sergei
Kovalenko failed to reach the final round. World Cup champion Jozef
Gonci of Slovakia, the bronze medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Games,
did not compete.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Faulds of Britain won the men's double trap in a
shootoff with defending gold medalist Russell Mark of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Renata Mauer-Rozanska of Poland won the gold in the women's
50-meter rifle, again denying world-champion Sonja Pfeilschifter an
Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, the 1996 Atlanta double trap champion, led through most of
the competition Wednesday but faltered in the final regulation
round and the playoff, taking silver. Fehaid Al Deehani of Kuwait
won the bronze with a score of 186.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking his Olympic record with 143 points in the
qualifying round, Mark missed both targets in the last round of the
finals to allow Faulds to tie at 187. In the first round of the
shootout, Mark and Faulds each hit one of two targets. Mark also
was 1 for 2 in the second round, but Faulds nailed both to capture
the gold.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Voter attitudes toward Rick Lazio have turned markedly more
negative since June, with suburban women now moving solidly toward
Hillary Rodham Clinton and many New Yorkers saying Lazio came
across as harsh and inexperienced in his debate with Clinton last
week, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which began last Thursday and was completed on
Tuesday night, suggested deterioration in Lazio's standing at the
time that most politicians believe that voters are beginning
serious consideration of the choice before them in the race for
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now has a 9-point lead over her opponent, with 48
percent to Lazio's 39 percent. The remaining voters are undecided
or are supporting minor-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Times/CBS poll, taken in June, Clinton had a 5-point
lead over Lazio, who had just entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   When the undecided voters were encouraged to express which way
they were leaning, and their probable votes were added to the
totals, Clinton broke the 50 percent barrier in the most recent
poll, something of a milestone in this race, leading Lazio by 51
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was taken starting the evening after the debate in
Buffalo, an encounter that seems to have enhanced Clinton's
standing, at least for the time being. Nearly half of the poll
respondents who saw the debate pronounced Clinton the winner. The
candidates are to meet in at least two more debates.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, as aides to both candidates noted on Wednesday,
plenty of time left, in a contest that will not end for six weeks,
particularly given the relatively large number of voters who remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, most of those voters are likely in the
end to favor Lazio, the way they would choose a challenger over an
incumbent, because Clinton is already so well known that voters
have solidly formed opinions about her.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll sketched an electoral landscape that now
seems daunting for the four-term Republican congressman from
Suffolk County who, like Clinton, is running for statewide office
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially of most concern to Lazio is the growing support for
Clinton among a group of voters that has been worrying the first
lady's advisers: suburban women. Lazio was leading among those
voters by 43 percent to 36 percent in June. Now, she has the
support of 54 percent of suburban women, compared to 38 percent for
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton has the support of 56 percent of women in all
areas of the state who describe themselves as moderate. In June,
she and Lazio were tied among those voters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for Clinton's improved standing with those
female voters, the poll findings suggest, was the aggressive
posture Lazio struck toward Clinton at the debate in Buffalo. That
episode has clearly emerged as a watershed in this campaign, since
it was the first time so many viewers had an opportunity to view a
candidate whom most people did not know before the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio attacked her at almost every question, and at the end, he
walked over to her lectern, demanding that she sign a piece of
paper renouncing the use of soft-money campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among women who watched the debate, half of the poll respondents
said that Lazio did not display the requisite maturity and
experience to serve in the United States Senate. Half also said
that Clinton had won the debate, compared to just 26 percent who
said Lazio won.
</P>
<P>
   Men who watched the debate had a more favorable reaction to
Lazio's performance. Still, overall, 54 percent of respondents who
viewed it said that Lazio was too aggressive, compared to just 4
percent who said the same thing about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the aggressiveness and downgrading that Lazio showed
during the debate that did it for me,'' Marie Harvey, 75, a medical
secretary from New Hyde Park who had been undecided, said in a
follow-up interview. ``I had never heard him speak for any length
of time before that. I thought Lazio should have come out with more
of his background in Congress instead of attacking her husband's
actions. I was surprised that Hillary Clinton displayed so much
poise and control during the debate.''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Lazio's difficulties go beyond women
voters. Respondents who now hold an unfavorable view of Lazio have
nearly tripled, to 28 percent, since 10 percent in the last poll,
while his favorable rating is 33 percent, up from 26 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 respondents describe Lazio as conservative, a
13-point jump since June, suggesting that Clinton has achieved some
success in linking Lazio with conservative members of Congress,
like former Speaker Newt Gingrich. There has also been a sharp jump
in the number of voters who believe Lazio is spending more time
attacking his opponent than explaining his positions, and more
voters believe that he is running a more negative campaign than
Clinton is. That might complicate any attempt by Lazio to turn up
the volume of his attacks, as he is planning to do over the next
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted among 1,212 registered voters, of whom
1,066 were characterized as likely to vote. It has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll also found that in the presidential race in
New York, the Democrat, Al Gore, is leading George W. Bush, the
Republican, by nearly two-to-one. That, too, is unwelcome news for
Lazio, since it almost certain means that Bush will not devote time
or money to this state, and that the Democratic turnout could be
particularly high for Gore. In a contest roughly analogous to this
one, when Robert F. Kennedy moved from Massachusetts to New York
State and run for Senator in 1964, Kennedy won in no small part
because Lyndon B. Johnson was elected president with a 2.4 million
vote margin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now doing extremely well in New York City, with about
70 percent of the vote. A strong showing there is essential for any
Democrat running for statewide office. By contrast, upstate, the
Republican stronghold in New York, Lazio has the support of about
half the voters, which is probably below what a Republican
candidate needs to win a statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers disputed the findings of the Times/CBS poll,
and said their own polls showed the race to be tighter, and they
were pleased with the candidate's performance to date and confident
of his victory. ``I hope Clinton believes this poll,'' said Mike
Murphy, Lazio's consultant. ``She's in for a big surprise on
Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said the findings reflected his
polls, and asserted they represented a rebuke to the way Lazio has
conducted his campaign. ``It shows that the voters rejected the
campaign of insults that Rick Lazio launched almost since the
moment he entered the race,'' Penn said. ``I think further it shows
that people are finding out more about Lazio and more about his
record.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the election have clearly shifted since the last
Times/CBS poll, in June, when Lazio first stepped both into the
race to replace Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and into a statistical tie
with the first lady. The change over the summer has largely been to
Clinton's benefit, though her successes would appear, in no small
measure, to be a consequence of difficulties Lazio has encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains where she has been for much of the year:
hovering with between 45 and 49 percent of the vote, with about
one-third of the voters expressing an unfavorable opinion of her.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lazio is no longer the little-known quantity he
once was, and that might not be entirely to his benefit. At 28
percent, his unfavorable rating is nearly as high as Clinton's,
which is 32 percent. And the poll found that one out of three New
Yorker say that Lazio does not ``care about the needs and problems
of people like yourself,'' double what that was in June. By
contrast, more than half of the respondents asked the same question
about Clinton believe that she cares about their problems.

   G'day from Australia &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are not the crassly commercial Games a la Atlanta in 1996.
There are infinitely more trash bins in and around Sydney Olympic
Park than merchandise stands.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in the hunt for souvenirs have to be on the lookout. Sooner
or later their trail leads them to the aptly named superstore in
the shadows of Olympic Stadium. The store is an IKEA of Olympic
paraphernalia. It is 35,000 square feet of stuff stacked to the
rafters _ everything from throw blankets and champagne glasses and
stuffed boxing kangaroos to pins and shirts and caps and autograph
books.
</P>
<P>
   When I caught up with store manager Gary March, he looked a
little weary, having not had a wink of sleep in 48 hours. He has
been all night after the store's 11 p.m. closing, he explained, to
restock shelves and review the day's sales.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he said, 20,000 people filed through the store and
accounted for 10,000 transactions. With precious few pieces of
merchandise priced at less than $10 Australian, that's a lot of
cash changing hands. &QL;

moved closer to easing the Cuban embargo, giving initial passage to
measures that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, as
well as a bill that would ease travel restrictions that currently
bar most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba. If the latter measure
wins final approval, it could prove a bonanza for the Cuban tourism
industry, which has grown dramatically in the past decade.

More than half a century later, amid the ongoing information boom,
social scientists say little has changed. American voters are
disturbingly ignorant about the country's political life and its

   (For Atlanta) TECH-GADEL _ WASHINGTON _ As high-tech companies
mushroom, Georgia's old economy - largely built on peanuts, poultry
and pulp wood - is being transformed. The new foundation rests on
computer bits, bytes and biotech. While only about 4 percent of
Georgians are farmers today, about 7 percent are high-tech workers,
such as computer engineers and programmers. In metro Atlanta alone,
roughly 10,000 tech companies employ about 220,000 people. But
while the tech sector is driving up the state's population and
wealth, Georgia's 13-member delegation to Congress remains outside
the inner circles of tech political power. Though they won't speak
on the record, many of Georgia's business executives and lobbyists
grumble about their lawmakers' lackluster leadership on tech
issues. (Geewax, Cox News Service)

   FLIGHT-SERV _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull
Flightserv.com out of its dive in late May, he faced some
Internet-sized challenges. The Atlanta company's stock had dropped
90 percent from its 52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's
best-performing stock last year. A New York money manager had
cancelled the second half of a $10 million investment. Few business
travelers were using Flightserv's Web site, www.flightserv.com.,
which offers individual seats on private jet flights between
Atlanta and New York. And the company was running out of cash. So,
over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and chief
operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget and suspended
flights. Bottorff also plunged into retooling Flightserv's business
model and rounding up new investors and business partners.

West and the Dry Tortugas. You land there, you're in America.
You've succeeded, according to Bill Clinton's controversial wet

almost assuredly will not be repatriated. Therefore, more and more

   SAVING-CAVES _ Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful

don't stumble upon it, it's safe. For Rusty's, while not a secret,
is not well known, which has protected the formations growing from
the floor and the ceiling. They took thousands of years to form.
They can shatter in seconds. In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of
Lafayette and Bill Putnam of Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying
quiet moments in the cool embrace of the earth. ``You know how some
people are beautiful and stunning and others are just as plain as
plain can be?'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are like that too. Every
one is different.'' Putnam is a director the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc., which Cousineau chairs. For the
past several years, the 600-member organization has rapidly
acquired caverns from West Virginia to Florida both to hold and to
protect. Most are near Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia border, a region
with perhaps more caves per square mile than anywhere in the United
States. ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We
just need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest
goal.'' (Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

not to buy. But the salesmen probably never mention the inevitable

   FERTILITY _ Recent birth of sextuplets in Greenville, N.C.,
focuses international debate about the use of fertilty drugs in
eastern North Carolina. What medical experts, religious leaders,
academic authorities _ and hopefully the parents _ think about the
fertility drug pros and cons. The growing use of such drugs is
increasing the chances of multiple births like the once here, in
Iowa and Italy. Do such pregnancies unnecessarily risk the babies'
lives? Do they place unnecessary financial and emotional strain on
the families and communities that support them? Are such risks and
strains acceptable in the face of infertility? (Greenville Daily

   POLIO _ This summer, world health officials - including the CDC
- acknowledged they would not meet an oft-stated goal of ridding
the world of polio by the end of this year. Next week, (Sept. 27),
many of those officials leading the fight will join Ted Turner and
other big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio
summit'' to explore why the fight is not being won on time. The NYC
meeting is intended to redirect attention away from the
public-health failure and focus media attention on the last push to
eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up
the conference, we take a look at why 15-20 of the 30 countries
which had polio at the end of 1999 still do and ask ``What's taking
so long?'' (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    INSTEAD OF A HIJACK, CUBANS APPARENTLY SOUGHT TO DEFECT IN
STOLEN PLANE
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects name of Coast Guard cutter to Nantucket; adds
sentence in 3rd graf noting that one Cuban died.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ They apparently set off in hopes of finding new
lives of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And the nine Cubans who survived when their small plane
crash-landed in the ocean Tuesday moved closer to their presumed
dream late Wednesday when U.S. officials decided that all of them
should receive medical evaluations here.
</P>
<P>
   Eight survivors were transferred to a Coast Guard cutter that
would take them to Key West, where they would join a ninth survivor
who was already being treated here for head and neck injuries. U.S.
officials have yet to publicly identify a tenth person who died in
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law allows Cubans to apply for asylum and residency if they
reach American soil.
</P>
<P>
   A key to their fate will be whether the FBI concludes that the
plane was flown from Cuba voluntarily or whether it was hijacked,
as Cuban authorities initially reported Tuesday. The U.S.
government could return hijackers to Cuba or prosecute them in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   If it is determined they left voluntarily, U. S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials will decide whether they qualify
for asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down Tuesday about 60 miles west of Cuba, with
the survivors picked up by a passing Panamanian freighter, the
Chios Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some of those on board the Soviet-built crop duster
said there was no hijacking because the pilot of the plane planned
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no hijack, it was a way of looking for freedom,''
Isidro Puig(cq), father of two men on the plane, told Reuters news
service. Puig, who lives in Hialeah, Fla., said the pilot, Lenin
Iglesias Hernandez(cq), planned the escape attempt for his family
and a few select friends.
</P>
<P>
   News service reports from Cuba supported the story.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters there were told that Iglesias set off Tuesday morning
for a routine day of crop-dusting, but left behind his partner,
flight engineer Juan Jose Galiano Cabrera(cq), saying he had to
take care of an administrative matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Iglesias flew to another small airstrip, picked up his
family and friends and headed for freedom, Galiano told reporters.
Iglesias radioed Cuban air controllers that he was hijacked, but
that was a cover story, Galiano said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why the airplane headed west toward Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula instead of north toward the Florida Keys and
Miami. While there were some reports the plane may have run out of
fuel, Miami television station WSVN reported Wednesday that the
pilot might have ditched the plane on purpose near the Panamanian
freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were hoping to learn the details in the coming
days. They had a brief interview Wednesday with Rodolfo Fuentes,
36, who suffered serious injuries in the crash-landing and was
brought by Coast Guard helicopter to Key West late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes was in stable condition in the intensive care unit with
a concussion, a lacerated scalp and a sore neck, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight other survivors _ two men, three women and three
children _ had remained aboard the Chios Dream most of Wednesday
because rough seas prevented immediately transferring them to the
Coast Guard cutter Nantucket, which rendezvoused with the Chios
Dream late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials and FBI agents were aboard the Nantucket,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is involved because of the reported hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it doesn't appear to be a hijacking, but until
we interview them we won't know for sure,'' FBI spokeswoman Judy
Orihuela(cq ) in Miami. ``It appears the plane was stolen in
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in Miami said all the survivors hoped to apply for
asylum and to remain in the United States. Activists in Miami's
Cuban exile community began working on their cases, with U.S. Rep.
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican, sending a letter to
President Clinton urging that the asylum requests be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, Cubans intercepted at sea are normally
interviewed there and returned to Cuba unless they appear to have
legitimate asylum claims, which are usually based on a fear of
persecution should they return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who reach U.S. soil are normally allowed to apply for
asylum, although those found to have violated laws in their attempt
to reach the U.S. can be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether stealing the airplane _ which was
property of the Cuban government _ would create problems for the
Cuban survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, who was being cared for at the Lower Keys Medical
Center, didn't talk to reporters Wednesday, but met with his
relatives and Miami lawyer Manny Diaz, who played a prominent role
in trying to keep Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. David Bannan, said Fuentes was in good shape
considering the trauma he had suffered, but was clearly worried
about what the coming days might bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing quite well and his spirits are good, although he's
obviously concerned about his situation,'' Bannan said.

ANALYSIS: SURPRISE! BEFORE HE'S EVEN GONE, FUJIMORI HINTS AT A
COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ From the moment Alberto K. Fujimori entered
politics just over a decade ago, his most powerful weapon at times
of crisis has been the element of surprise. Now, as he faces the
most serious challenge to his hold on power, he appears to be
counting once again on guile, agility and sleight of hand to save
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's announcement over the weekend that he intends to call
elections in which he will not be a candidate for president caught
even his most bitter enemies off guard and seemed a crushing
admission of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the opposition continues to clamor for his immediate
resignation, he has set about rewriting the rules of the political
game here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not surrendered, not by any means,'' Mirko Lauer, a
prominent Lima political analyst, said Wednesday. ``He is preparing
for a transition to a new government that he expects to follow the
Fujimori line, a transition that is tailored to his own designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was set off late last week with the broadcast of a
videotape showing Fujimori's national security chief, Vladimiro
Montesinos, paying a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman to
get him to switch allegiances. On Saturday night, Fujimori
announced his intention to ``dismantle'' the National Intelligence
Service, which Montesinos heads, but he has not yet ordered either
Montesinos' arrest or his formal dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference called abruptly on Tuesday night, Fujimori
deflected questions about Montesinos' status and whereabouts and
his own relationship with the military, insisting that ``there is
no vacuum of power.'' Instead, he outlined a complicated timetable
for presidential and congressional elections that would culminate
in the swearing in of a successor July 28, more than 10 months from
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going, but I'm staying'' was the headline the daily La
Republica used Wednesday to summarize Fujimori's plan. Another
opposition daily, Liberacion, dismissed the package of
constitutional amendments and electoral changes that Fujimori said
would be introduced in Congress as an indication that he ``wants to
impose his dauphin through fraudulent balloting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, said Santiago Pedraglio, a political analyst here, ``he
intends to maintain his control until July 28 as monolithically as
he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's real objective, Pedraglio added, is ``an orderly
withdrawal of his own people, so as to have the capacity to
negotiate with the new government and pave the way for his own
return'' to power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the news conference, which ended nearly 72 hours of
silence that had this country of 25 million people fearing that a
military coup was imminent, Fujimori proposed constitutional
changes that would allow his return. After ignoring domestic and
international public opinion to gain a third five-year term in
office, he is now proposing that his successor be limited to a
single term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a little surprise for you about what I'm going to
do'' in 2006, Fujimori said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has always shown a liking for the knockout blow that
comes when adversaries least expect it. He shut down Congress and
the Supreme Court to assume authoritarian powers in 1992, crippled
one guerrilla insurgency with a lightning raid that captured its
leader, and wiped out another insurgency by attacking its members
even as they were holding hostages at the Japanese Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fujimori will be able to carry out this new plan,
however, is an altogether different matter. As Lauer pointed out,
Fujimori's problem right now is ``not that people cannot count on
him, but that he has no one on whom he can rely,'' above all
Montesinos and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Peru's fragmented and fractious opposition has
not been able to mount much of a threat to him, and it is unclear
whether it will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities
the crisis offers. ``I think the opposition can win, but I'm not so
sure they can unite,'' Pedraglio said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Alejandro Toledo, Fujimori's
opponent in the first round of balloting last spring, which was
marred by widespread accusations of vote rigging, reiterated the
opposition's call for a transition government led by a figure with
``credibility and international respect.'' He suggested Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the former U.N. secretary-general, or the
government's ombudsman, Jorge Santistevan, as possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Montesinos must first be fired and face criminal
charges; then, elections must be held in four or five months, with
a transition government in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   While saying, ``This is not the time to talk about
candidacies,'' Toledo indicated that he continued to view himself
as the logical candidate of an opposition coalition. But a poll
published Tuesday in the daily El Comercio showed that Fernando
Olivera, the congressman who detonated the crisis by making the
compromising videotapes public, has the same level of popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results highlight a traditional problem here. Peru is a
country in which ``there are no parties, only leaders,'' all of
whom aspire to the presidency, the political analyst Fernando
Rospigliosi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition groups have further hampered themselves by
setting conditions for the resumption of a ``national dialogue''
promoted by the Organization of American States and boycotting
proceedings in the Peruvian Congress. They object to the refusal of
Fujimori loyalists to relinquish control of the legislature, a
stand that analysts say is likely to play into the president's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that Fujimori controls the electoral process, he
can produce opposition candidates made to his measure,'' Lauer
said. ``There could be five or six of them, which would pull votes
away from the united coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   That factor is important because of one of the constitutional
changes that Fujimori is proposing. Instead of needing a majority
in the first round of balloting to avert a runoff, a candidate
would have to register only a 10-point lead over the closest
contender to be elected, a prospect that becomes more likely if the
opposition is fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Toledo vowed to organize street demonstrations if
Fujimori refused to step down. But the opposition, a Latin American
diplomat said, ``has not demonstrated a capacity to convoke mass
protests on a sustained, national level'' and ``found Fujimori's
decision to call new elections so unexpected that it is still
searching for a coherent response.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fujimori is not budging. ``I have a mandate to govern, and I
will continue governing,'' he said Tuesday night. ``A transition
government? There is no way I will allow that.''

HOW THE NEW YORK TIMES/CBS POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (with NY-SENATE-POLL)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of New York state is
based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 14-19 with 1,611
adults throughout the state. Of those, 1,212 said they were
registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a
computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For
each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits,
thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within
each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be
the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region of the
state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2000
election for U.S. Senate are based on the responses of 1,066
``likely voters.'' Likely voters are those who say they are
registered, intend to vote in November, and voted in 1998 or 1996,
further weighted so that those who reside in New York City make up
31 percent of the entire state, which is the city's typical share
of total ballots cast on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all adult residents of New York State. For smaller subgroups the
potential sampling error is larger. As an example, for likely
voters in the suburbs surrounding New York City it is plus or minus
seven percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of
questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A principal author of Gov. George W. Bush's
Medicare plan, Dr. Gail R. Wilensky, serves on the boards of eight
health care companies whose fortunes could be affected by the Bush
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky, a former administrator of the government office that
runs Medicare and the current chairwoman of the panel that advises
Congress on Medicare policy, holds stock and stock options in the
companies worth $4 million to $5 million, according to company
documents and Wilensky's own estimates.
</P>
<P>
   She said on Wednesday that her relationships with the health
care concerns were a matter of public record and denied that there
was any conflict between her service on the corporate boards and
her role as a health policy adviser to Governor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I behave in an open and public manner, and don't try to hide
what I am doing,'' Wilensky said in an interview. ``I might be
opinionated, I might be wrong, but I'm not carrying anybody else's
water.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had recused herself from decisions of the Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission, the congressional policy panel, while
she serves as a health adviser to Governor Bush to avoid the
appearance of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And she asserted that there was no way to calculate the direct
or indirect financial effect of the health plans of Bush or Vice
President Al Gore on individual companies. Nor does her service on
those boards in any way affect the public policy positions she
advocates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Public Citizen, a research group founded by Ralph Nader,
contended that Wilensky represented drug and managed-care interests
directly affected by Bush's plan and called her financial
relationship to numerous health care concerns ``wholly
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch,
said that Wilensky advocated a health care proposal that favored
providers over consumers. And he contended that she stood to profit
personally if the Bush plan were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a central health care adviser to Bush who is a major
representative of pharmaceutical and insurance interests, which is
why the Bush prescription drug program is so favored by the
industry and so opposed by consumers,'' Clemente said. ``It is just
wholly inappropriate and a direct conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's health care proposal leaves much medical decision-making
to private industry, including insurers and health maintenance
organizations. The government would still pay most costs and would
supervise insurers, approving or disapproving all plans.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky wrote much of the plan and explained it to reporters
when it was released. The proposal is consistent with her
longstanding views on the most efficient means of delivering
medical services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen is planning to release a report this week
detailing Wilensky's holdings in health care companies and accusing
her of designing a health plan that could enrich her. The report,
which the group made available to The New York Times, contends that
her financial stake in the medical industry is more troubling than
the Halliburton Co. stock options of Dick Cheney, Bush's running
mate. Cheney might shape energy policy some time in the future in a
Bush administration, the report states, while Wilensky is already
drafting proposals for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said this month that if elected he would forfeit stock
options worth about $3.5 million in Halliburton, the energy
services company that he left to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign reacted angrily to Public Citizen's charges
and defended Wilensky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ridiculous assertion by a left-leaning group which
supports more government control over health care,'' said Dan
Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats and Republicans in Congress believe she has high
integrity and trust her to advise them on health care policy, and
we believe she is an added asset to our campaign,'' Bartlett said.
``The policy that Governor Bush implements or promotes will be
based on what's best for America and will be based on consultation
from a wide range of advisers from a wide range of backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health policy advisers are chiefly full-time Democratic
campaign aides or government officials. The group includes Elaine
Kamarck, Gore's top domestic policy adviser; Sarah Bianchi, a Gore
campaign health policy specialist; Donna Shalala, the secretary of
Health and Human Services; Chris Jennings, the White House's senior
health affairs adviser; and David A. Kessler, the dean of the Yale
University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   None appear to hold any outside employment or corporate
directorships, according to the Gore campaign and public records.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky, 57, who holds a doctorate in economics, is the John M.
Olin Senior Fellow at Project HOPE, an international health
foundation, her only full-time position. She is taking leave and
vacation time from Project HOPE to advise the Bush campaign, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She served in the White House under President George Bush in
1992 as deputy assistant for policy development, working on health
care and welfare issues. Wilensky's largest single holding is in
the United HealthCare Corp., one of the nation's leading
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky has a total of 70,750 shares and stock options in
United, which closed at $92.31 a share on Wednesday. She exercised
her option to acquire 16,000 of the shares at $49.50 a share in
May, yielding a paper profit of nearly $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The face value of all securities of companies she serves as a
director is more than $12 million, corporate filings show. But
Wilensky said that because many of her holdings were in stock
options granted her as compensation for her board service _ and
many had not yet vested _ their actual value was currently less
than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company disclosure documents generally do not reveal the price
at which the options were granted so it is impossible to calculate
precisely the value of Wilensky's holdings. She said she had
disclosed all of her directorships and outside interests under
Congressional ethics rules. However, she added, ``I don't feel I
have an obligation to disclose asset accumulation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of her board service, Wilensky also holds thousands
of shares and options in Gentiva Health Services, Syncor, Advanced
Tissue Sciences, Shared Medical Systems, St. Jude Medical Care,
Quest Diagnostics and Manor Care. The companies provide a variety
of medical services from human tissue replacements to nursing care
to data management.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several of the companies said that they took no
position on the Bush or the Gore health care proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky said that the drug industry had the most to gain or
lose from the presidential candidates' competing health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers Association, has been critical of the Gore plan
because, the group contends, it will lead to government price
controls. The industry has been more sympathetic to the Bush
proposal because it leaves drug purchasing for Medicare largely in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky said she was not a director of any drug company or
member of the industry's trade association.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKEE, Ky. _ Harvey Parrott, who hunts wild turkeys in his
breathtaking native countryside hereabouts, could not believe his
eyes and slammed on the brakes of his vehicle on the narrow forest
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gonna do what?'' he asked, incredulous as a young woman
peered 200 feet down into the creek-side melange of the Adkins Town
Road dump, an illegal eyesore mushrooming at the bottom of a
mountain hollow. She had to tell him twice that the mess would be
rooted up and out by next spring, to the very last bedspring, horse
cadaver and rat's nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we'll plant grass seed and put TV cameras on it after,''
said the woman, Karen Engle, the director of a determined citizens'
cleanup movement, as she studied the fetid jumble below, one of the
countless ``holler dumps'' that long have pocked the beauty of
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I been sick and so sad about that dump forever,'' said
Parrott, who lives just up the switchback road. Delighted with the
news, he was doubtful that friends and neighbors could ever be
stopped from blithely tipping tons of trash, including worn-out
sofas, broken appliances and food scraps, down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   But Engle was here to tell him the news: 40 counties of eastern
Kentucky, intent on scrubbing forth a new national image, have
banded together to root out the countless festering garbage dumps
and the pipes that dump raw sewage into creeks and ditches,
features that long have broadcast a stereotype of backwoods
fecklessness in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern Kentucky effort, called Pride (Personal
Responsibility in a Desirable Environment), an alliance of federal,
state and volunteer workers, was considered politically risky when
it was conceived four years ago by the local congressman, Rep.
Harold Rogers, and the state secretary of natural resources, James
E. Bickford.
</P>
<P>
   After all, even with the opening of modern legal landfills, the
traditions of impoverished mountain hamlets and mining camps die
hard. With no organized sanitation for much of the 20th century,
rural residents had long tolerated the netherworld cascade of
holler dumps and the post-outhouse ``straight-pipe'' way of
sanitation from mobile homes and simple cottages _ sewage
primitively piped straight out into the Great Outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   But the cleanup has quietly caught on, with 1,996 dumps mapped
and targeted by searchers so far and 377 of them eliminated. The
worst of them required a 7,000-ton, $1 million engineering feat,
said Engle, executive director of Pride, a nonprofit agency of six
workers who coordinate the effort. Owners of the first 36,000
straight-pipe sources of pollution, a minority of the overall
problem, are being offered low-interest loans of $1,500 for septic
tanks or sewer linkups, and 2,600 of them are signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has cost $70 million so far in federal money, plus
in-kind services and equipment, like video security, from state and
local workers. Rogers tailored a change in federal law allowing the
Army Corps of Engineers, long identified with massive river-control
programs, to pursue subtler backwoods needs here. The corps has
created wetland lagoons to treat sewage from mountain hollows and
introduced trash-skimming boats and barriers on lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The program has proved popular despite roiling old habits, with
tens of thousands of volunteers and students wading into the dumps
and even discreetly informing on neighbors still using straight
pipes and indulging in ``holler tipping.'' Breathitt County
provided a measure of the excitement with a $5 bounty for each
appliance reclaimed from a dump or creek. In three days, residents
had amassed a mountain of more than 5,000 rusted hulks for
recycling, and the county had to float a loan to keep it growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, this was all a point of shame,'' Rogers said of the
blight on his beloved eastern Kentucky, one of Appalachia's
longer-suffering but gritty regions. ``To me, the most amazing
thing is what Pride is doing to local politics: every candidate is
suddenly running on platforms of cleaning up their county.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The political effects have resonated beyond the 40-county
region. A new state law denies hookups for electricity to any new
home that relies on straight-pipe sanitation. A central court,
outside the region in Lexington, was designed to avoid having local
juries judge and punish their sloppy neighbors. It has been
ordering the worst polluters to pay $1,000 fines and haul out four
tons of trash per violation as community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People dump everything down the hollers _ a wooden leg, dead
house pets,'' Bickford said. ``We even caught a guy on one of our
cameras shooting his dog.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new cleanup zeal, a special legislative session next
winter will take up Gov. Paul Patton's omnibus sanitation proposal,
which would provide for the first mandatory statewide garbage
pickup in Kentucky, an old coal-and-timber state not previously
rated as strong on environmentalism. Twenty-three of the state's
120 counties have made garbage collection mandatory in recent
years, 18 of them in the Pride region.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says the volunteers and the students avidly testing water
quality and hauling trash provide the ultimate riposte to the old
offensive cliches about Appalachian folk _ notions that, visitors
easily see, do not apply in the face of the high-tech ``Silicon
Holler'' budding near Hazard. ``The old stereotype of the mountain
people was a creation of time and the press,'' Rogers said. ``But
now I defy any other region to match what our people are doing to
make their place better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bickford, a retired Army general who ran the global fuel supply
lines for the military services, returned home to Harlan County
after 30 years of world travel and was appalled by how pervasively
the ``throwaway society'' had marred the glory of Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people we still got the natural beauty, but why aren't
the tourists here?'' he asks. ``I remind them our trash is not
unique and tourists aren't going to pay to come and view it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Whitley County, Steve Schwartz packs a pistol and roams in a
truck that proclaims ``environmental officer,'' as watchful as an
old revenue agent. He writes trash citations that can bring fines
of $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were disturbed by all this at first, but they gradually
began reporting neighbors when they saw things improving,'' said
Schwartz, as he confronted a man named Lester about a straight pipe
leading to a drainage ditch from his rundown trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Closely watching Lester and the Law was Judy Brimm, the local
Pride volunteer. ``In the past, the straight-pipe problem simply
wasn't discussed by anyone,'' she said. ``But the more I roamed
around, the more irritated I got at what I saw. We tracked 63 dumps
in the county and have cleaned up 38. But I found another 12.''
</P>
<P>
   She is grateful for the peer pressure that has sprung up over
the dumps and straight pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain people are very proud,'' Bickford said. ``We may
still have a lot of Bubbas and Billy Bobs here, but I've seen a lot
of Bubbas and Billy Bobs in New York City, too. All very good
people, once they see a problem and get after it.''

ADVERTISING: PIZZA PEDDLERS STEP UP AD CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's pizza peddlers, stung by a recent sluggishness in
sales, are stepping up their already frenetic advertising,
marketing and promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pizza business is so intensely competitive these
days that decisions made in the courtroom seem to loom just as
large as those made in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer has been soft for pizza,'' said Cheryl Bachelder,
executive vice president for marketing and product development at
Domino's Pizza in Ann Arbor, Mich., owned by Bain Capital and
senior managers. The reasons range from unseasonable weather in
many parts of the country to consumers deciding to eat more meals
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The category has been a little slow in the last few months,''
said Randy Gier, chief marketing officer at Pizza Hut in Dallas,
the market leader that is part of Tricon Global Restaurants. ``We
expected it to be a little stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   To stimulate interest in their doughy, cheesy concoctions,
Domino's, which is No. 2, and Pizza Hut are running dueling
campaigns centered on television commercials appearing during the
NBC coverage of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's is expanding a campaign focused on product attributes
that features ``Andy,'' a naughty puppetlike character.
</P>
<P>
   The creature, designed by Henson Productions, which created the
Muppets, ``is a way to educate people about what we call our
`zealous pizza-making process,''' said Donny Deutsch, chairman and
chief executive at DeutschDeutsch Inc. in New York, Domino's
agency. The campaign's theme is: ``Bad Andy. Good pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Pizza Hut plans to spend $40 million on a multimedia
campaign to introduce its latest pizza creation, called the
Insider. Insider will debut formally on Sunday after a weeklong
teaser campaign that asks, ``What is Pizza Hut trying to hide?''
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut also figured in a decision late Tuesday by a federal
appeals court, which overturned much of a ruling by a lower court
that would have required Papa John's International _ the No. 4
pizza purveyor, just behind Little Caesars _ to stop using its
longtime slogan ``Better ingredients, better pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the most recent in a two-year battle pitting
Pizza Hut against Papa John's, which has aggressively tweaked Pizza
Hut in campaigns featuring John Schnatter, the founder and chief
executive of Papa John's. That tactic has often helped to increase
sales for a company fighting a far larger competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the lawyers poring over the ruling,'' said Gier,
adding that Pizza Hut was considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Pizza Hut is more interested in making news through
products rather than legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the pizza category over the last 10 years,
what sparks sales is new products,'' said Charlie Miesmer, vice
chairman at the principal Pizza Hut agency, BBDO New York, part of
the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. ``If people can
experience the basic taste of a pizza in a new way, they consider
it cool and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Insider _ a stacked, thin-crust offering to be promoted as a
``pizza inside a pizza'' _ joins recent additions to the Pizza Hut
menu like the Edge, introduced in 1997, and revamped in April, and
the Big New Yorker, brought out last year. Executives at Pizza Hut
undoubtedly hope the Insider fares better at the cash register than
the 1999 movie of the same name did at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people are less interested in pizza,'' Gier
said. ``It's just that no one in the category has done anything
that has hit the hot button.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with BBDO New York, the agencies developing the Insider
campaign are TLP in Dallas, an Omnicom sibling, for print, and BBDO
Houston, for radio. The TV spots from BBDO New York show the
Insider being assembled and offer exaggerated vignettes of getting
more inside something than expected: An elephant is stuffed into a
telephone booth and four sumo wrestlers are squeezed inside a
photo-taking booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a serious product,'' Miesmer said. ``We need novel
devices, something that would get the average 16-year-old to look
up and pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   At Domino's, Andy's antics are also intended to be humorous, as
the character is shown hindering attempts by Domino's employees to
prepare and deliver hot, fresh pies.
</P>
<P>
   Andy is ``not mean or evil,'' Bachelder said. ``He does things
that maybe a little boy would do,'' like trying to make pizzas by
duplicating a photograph in a copier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy is a mischievous foil to the people who work at our
stores,'' she added, ``which gives us a way to reveal who we are
and what we do for the customer without pounding our own chests.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision involving Papa John's was closely watched because
it dealt with a chest-pounding ad concept known as puffery, or
vague claims of superiority that many advertisers have
traditionally used in campaigns. Pizza Hut executives insisted the
slogan was misleading and harmful to their business and sued Papa
John's in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the slogan, used along with certain ads about pizza sauce
and dough, ``conveyed objectifiable and misleading facts,'' the
appeals court ruled, the slogan was not misleading by itself. As a
result, the lower court's ruling was set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Papa John's, based in Louisville, Ky., considered itself
``vindicated by'' the appeals court decision, Syl Sosnowski, vice
president for marketing, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering why the Domino's character was named Andy,
Deutsch had this explanation: ``If we did `Bad Morty. Good pizza,'
I don't know if it would have worked.''

U.S. TURNS UP THE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Nell Fortner said there was no reason to
panic. After all, she knows her team better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is help them understand what needs to be
done,'' said the U.S. women's Olympic basketball coach, ``then they
go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner communicated a need for more defensive pressure and the
U.S. clamped down on Russia to overcame a 47-44 halftime deficit
and record an 88-77 victory over a quality opponent Wednesday in
pool play at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of experience on this team,'' Fortner said.
``And that goes a long way in a tight game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans limited the Russians to 37.5-percent shooting in
the second half after giving up a startling 59.3 percent in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out and pressured the ball,'' reserve guard Katie Smith
said. ``We wanted to make them uncomfortable handling the ball and
we wanted to keep them from seeing people to make open passes to.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield provided timely firepower,
scoring eight points, six on 3-pointers, during a 10-1 run that
gave the U.S. a 68-58 lead with 9:30 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, a WNBA all-star team, are 3-0 after dispatching the
Russians and are likely to finish unbeaten in Pool B.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking them one at a time,'' Smith said, ``but we know
we need five more'' to win the gold medal expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   Center Lisa Leslie led the U.S. with 18 points and nine
rebounds. Sheryl Swoopes and Yolanda Griffith each scored 16
points. Griffith led all rebounders with 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing wrong with our offense the first half,''
said Leslie, the Los Angeles Sparks standout. ``But giving up 47 is
too many.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Americans are used to getting everyone's best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People play their best against us,'' she said. ``People back
out and hit threes we've never even seen them try against other
teams. The Russians definitely played their `A' game. They forced
us to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup point guard Dawn Staley said depth of talent is a factor
in the current U.S. dominance in women's basketball; the Americans
are 39-2 over the past year and haven't lost a game since March 18
at Brazil _ 14 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so many weapons at both ends of the floor,'' Staley
said. ``The Russians are a good team, but they have to beat all 12
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is better than the (gold-medal-winning) '96
team because we have more depth than '96.''
</P>
<P>
   The big but quickness-challenged Russians led by as many as
eight points (33-25) in the first half, but they were living off
the 3-pointer (4 for 7 from long range), and they couldn't keep up
the shooting accuracy once the Yanks got in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Arkhipova, a 5-9 point guard, led Russia with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., with lightweights New Zealand and Poland up next, is
unlikely to be challenged again until the knockout round, and
perhaps not until the Sept. 29 semifinals, when it probably will
face Australia or Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Olympics, every team is good,'' Fortner said, a
bit disingenuously. ``We never expect an easy game.''

 &HT;    Hyman surprised over win in 200-meter butterfly
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Oh, my God! Misty Hyman stole the show. With a swim
that stunned and shocked even her, the United States' Hyman upset
Australia's Madame Butterfly, Susie O'Neill, in front of her home
crowd on Wednesday. Hyman's win in the 200-meter butterfly also
managed to upstage the night's premier event, Pieter van den
Hoogenband's win in the best-ever men's 100 meter freestyle field,
with the elements of surprise and pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman must have repeated that phrase about five times as she
looked up at the Olympic board. Her race could have been on the
undercard Wednesday, if swimming had such a thing. It was
interesting mostly to Australia because it shaped up as another
coronation for O'Neill, who entered as the world record holder and
defending OIympic champion in the event.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's butterfly isn't as quick as that of sprinter Inge de
Bruijn's, who was busy Wednesday setting a world record in the
semifinals of the 100 freestyle. But O'Neill is relentless at the
longer distance. She keeps grinding away until her opponents'
muscles are awash in a sea of burning lactic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman made the turn at 150 meters ahead of O'Neill. She'd been
in that same situation before in less important races against
lesser swimmers only to fade from physical and mental fatigue. She
thought about that as she touched the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those doubts creep in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the doubts didn't steal in, they kicked down her front
door. In May, with the Olympics just months away, she was ready to
quit the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people believed in me and wouldn't let me throw in
the towel,'' Hyman said. As she came down the stretch a lot of
people wondered when the piano was going to fall on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do this. I can finish this,'' Hyman told herself. She
was trying to swim her race and not pay attention to O'Neill or
Petria Thomas, who won the Olympic silver in 1996. When she hit the
wall, she looked up at the board. She looked again. And again. In
the next lane, teammate Kaitlin Sandeno, who finished sixth, kept
telling her she won. Finally, Hyman started screaming with joy and
disbelief. She was a lot happier than the Australian fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson also silenced the crowd by anchoring the U.S.
women's 800 freestyle relay team to a gold medal. It was Thompson's
record seventh gold, all in relays, and the Americans wouldn't have
won it without her. After O'Neill gave the Australians a lead on
the first leg, the United States played catch-up until Thompson
pulled it out and the team celebrated the win and an Olympic
record.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also would have set an Olympic record in the 100
freestyle semifinals with a 54.40-second swim, but de Bruijn set a
world standard of 53.77 seconds and must have left Thompson
wondering what she had to do to win a single individual gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am feeling great every time I go out there. I'm really
feeling strong,'' a smiling de Bruijn said. ``I am just getting out
there and having fun. I'm not a nervous wreck any more.''
</P>
<P>
   MUST-SEE EVENT
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Domenico Fioravanti must be feeling pretty good as well.
He picked up his second gold here, winning the 200 breaststroke
after capturing the 100 version earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 freestyle, however, was the event everyone wanted to
see. For almost a decade, the prestigious race has been owned by
Russian Alexander Popov.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, talented and driven, Popov first won the Olympic 100
freestyle title in 1992, beating out the United States' superstar
from the 1988 Olympics, Matt Biondi. When Popov repeated at that
distance in Atlanta, he became the first since Johnny Weissmuller
in the 1920s to accomplish that feat. In Sydney, he was attempting
to become the first male to win the same individual event in three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Popov not only has talent, he has a presence. The mere sight of
him is enough to psyche out most swimmers. In Atlanta he seemed to
unnerve U.S. hope Gary Hall Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband would seem immune to that kind of pressure.
He's so laid-back that he reportedly can fall asleep just about
anywhere, even while listening to Pearl Jam on a CD player. Plus,
he came in knowing he could beat Popov, because he'd done it
before. A little more than a year ago at the European
championships, he stunned him twice. He had a huge performance at
that meet, winning six gold medals, although it didn't get much
play in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old van den Hoogenband isn't a genetic freak. He's 6
feet 3 inches, about the height of your average Dutch TV cameraman,
and is actually shorter than Popov. As an 18-year-old, he finished
fourth in the 100 and 200 freestyles in the Atlanta Olympics. This
past year he curtailed his medical studies to concentrate on the
Olympics. Late in December he even came to San Antonio for the U.S.
Open meet because it was contested in a 50-meter pool, even though
he had to jet back and swim in the European short course
championships the next week.
</P>
<P>
   All his work paid off. Although he didn't set yet another world
record, he took the gold. Popov settled for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world. I've already got plenty of
medals,'' Popov said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall continued his remarkable comeback with a bronze as Michael
Klim, a world record holder at this distance earlier in the week,
was shut out, finishing fourth. Van den Hoogenband's ascent has
been so remarkable that many are wondering how he's become the
world's best swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't accuse someone of taking drugs just because they
swim fast,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Longhorn Neil Walker, who finished fifth in that
talent-laden final, added, ``He's probably on the most powerful
drug in the world, hard work. I thought I worked hard, but it
didn't come through.''
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. swimmer who has been hitting on all cylinders is Lenny
Krazelburg, who's calmer now that he already has a gold in the 100
backstroke. He was on cruise control in the semifinals of the 200
backstroke when he set an Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come so far, I can't let down,'' the immigrant from
Russia said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. teen-ager Aaron Peirsol was second and said, ``I beat him a
few months ago so I know he can be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno thought the whole U.S. team would be inspired by Hyman's
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``People you don't think can be beaten can be beaten. Anything
can happen,'' Sandeno said.

CHENEY ATTACKS CLINTON'S DEALINGS WITH IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Using the same language that some critics
used against him and former President Bush after the Persian Gulf
War nearly 10 years ago, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of letting Saddam
Hussein ``slip off the hook'' by avoiding weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of time there, in the aftermath of the Gulf war,
we had a very robust inspection regime under way,'' Cheney said.
``We had people in there all the time, checking out, making certain
that he wasn't going back trying to rebuild his biological and
chemical capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``we've seen a situation develop in which he's
kicked out all the inspectors and this administration appears to be
helpless to do anything about it. We're at the point where I think
we have not seen the kind of aggressive, effective leadership that
President Bush provided with respect to the coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the charge at a campaign stop in Lancaster, Calif.,
that began with a teary recollection of the day the ground war
began in the Persian Gulf. His words were reminiscent of critics of
the Bush administration, who said it let Saddam off the hook by
ending the war while Saddam was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the accusation against President Clinton in response
to a question from the audience after he had delivered a speech on
the need for increasing the military's research and development
budget. The campaign chose Lancaster for the speech because it is
in the middle of California's Antelope Valley, a hub of the
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding himself with former pilots and astronauts _
including Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and Col. Gordon
Fullerton, a retired space shuttle commander _ Cheney declared,
``These individuals had the right stuff, but they also had the
right support.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking at a solar cell factory here, he criticized
aspects of the U.S. mission in Somalia, saying that the troops did
not get all the necessary equipment and that the objective was at
times ``fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   In past appearances, Cheney has been questioned on why the Bush
administration did not continue the Gulf war until Saddam was
driven from power. He has answered that the object was to drive
Iraq out of Kuwait, not to depose Saddam, and that the
international coalition would have been pulled apart if the United
States had continued.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Iraq have long tussled over arms
inspections, and in late 1998, the United States and Britain
conducted four nights of airstrikes to punish Hussein's government
for its refusal to cooperate with inspectors. Since then, the
administration has grown increasingly reluctant to consider force.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week that the
United States would not use force to make Iraq allow inspections to
resume.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf war was on people's minds from the beginning of the
day. Cheney was introduced here, as he often is, by his wife,
Lynne, who enjoys telling anecdotes about him along the campaign
trail. Her voice began to quaver as she spoke about the morning
after the ground war in the Gulf began and recounted a quiet trip
she and her husband made to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I'm getting teary just thinking about this,'' Mrs.
Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who removed his glasses and wiped his eyes before
speaking, said, ``Lynne, we're going to have to work on that
introduction some.''

UCLA TO WHISPER OVER DUCKS NOISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's so quiet at UCLA's practices this week, you
can hear a football drop. To prepare for Saturday's game against
Oregon at rowdy, sold-out Autzen Stadium, the Bruins are getting
strangely silent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hauling giant speakers out to the practice field,
they bring out the whisper drill. It calls for the quarterback to
whisper the play to the center, who whispers it to the guards, who
keep passing it down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those coaches who believes that you need to put
a lot of music and loud noise out there,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said. ``I've been in places like that and you come off the field
with a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the other approach. It makes guys concentrate and focus
on trying to hear and seeing the ball snapped and all those things.
Therefore, we can continue to coach them. When there's so much
noise, you can't coach.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Snap for Bennett: Drew Bennett, who started UCLA's first two
games at quarterback last season before losing the job and
switching to receiver, was back under center against Michigan for
two plays. On the first one, the Bruins jumped offside and on the
second, Bennett kept the ball on the option for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous when I went in there, but when I came off the
field, I thought, `Wow, that was fun,' '' Bennett said. ``It's
different going in there for one play. It's a lot less stressful.
You're not reading defenses or setting things up for another play.
It's just go in there and do this and you're done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No gain, plenty of pain: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher's high
left-ankle sprain, suffered during fall camp, cost him his starting
job and neither of the other tackles, Anthony Fletcher and Rodney
Leisle, has made Kocher's absence noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher, not at full strength but not injured enough to sit, has
been limited to about 20 plays per game. He's also realizing that
it might just be the way life is.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeShaun (Foster) and Danny (Farmer) had it last year and
bothered them the whole year,'' Kocher said. ``It's probably going
to bug me the whole year, so I just have to go out and play through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wrightster stuff: Fifty of Oregon's 101 players are from
California, but only one is from the San Fernando Valley: former
Sylmar High tight end George Wrightster, who is second string and
has yet to catch a pass.
</P>
<P>
   __ A Really Big Show: ESPN will be doing its ``Game Day'' show
Saturday from Eugene, Ore., just the second time it's been
broadcast from the West Coast. The other time was two years ago at
the Rose Bowl when UCLA beat Oregon in overtime.

 &HT;    Cleveland high schoolers get lift from Lieberman
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Kristen Convery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSVILLE HEIGHTS, Ohio _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman found the
diversity Democrats like to brag about in a high school gym here
Wednesday and made sure the 1,000 hand-clapping, pom-pom waving
fans knew that he was their political soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been such a thrill . . . To see the diversity, the
breadth and depth of the American family,'' said Democrat
Lieberman, the first Jew nominated for vice president by a major
party.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was made up about equally of blacks and whites and
included a sizeable number of Jewish men wearing yarmulkes on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman came to this Cleveland suburb, a Democratic
stronghold, after campaigning earlier in the day in Columbus, a
more politically fickle city, where he promoted the patients' bill
of rights proposed by him and his political boss, Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also was the special guest at fund-raisers in both
cities that were expected to raise a total of $600,000 for the
Democratic National Committee, Democratic party sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of candidates into Ohio continues today when
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush visits a Cleveland
factory to tout his plan for reforming Social Security. It will
mark the 16th day a presidential or vice presidential candidate has
been in Ohio since this summer's political convention. Bush's wife,
Laura, a librarian, is scheduled to be in Columbus today to read to
students at an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides as well as public opinion polls now show the Ohio
race close _ a point Lieberman reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neck and neck race in Ohio. Our opponents never thought
it would be that close but it is,'' said Lieberman. ``We're going
to win Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, ``that's it folks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to put too much pressure on you, but the future
of America rests on your shoulders,'' Lieberman, 58, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, Lieberman campaigned at the Ohio State University
Medical Center where he visited the maternity ward and met with a
small group of doctors, nurses and patients to talk about the
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government does not act, the public is not going to be
protected and will have no real choices,'' said Lieberman. Under
the Gore-Lieberman plan, patients would choose which specialists to
see and doctors and nurses _ not insurance companies _ could choose
what drugs to prescribe, tests to run and labs to use for tests.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman appeared to woo crowds in both cities, Ohio
Republican party spokesman Gary Abernathy said that Bush, the Texas
governor, is having a ``great week'' and will outdo the Democrats
in his appearance today.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman clearly was a hit here, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lovely,'' said Ella McGruder, a retiree who declined to
give her age. ``Al Gore couldn't have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn McKay, 32, of nearby Shaker Heights, said she liked
Lieberman's pledge to provide tax breaks for child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pumped,'' she said.

LOS ANGELES AGREES TO LONG-SOUGHT CURBS ON POLICE CONDUCT
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bowing to the inevitable, Los Angeles city
officials have agreed to accept a federal court agreement that
would require a series of long-sought changes in police management
and training, to head off a threatened civil rights lawsuit over
what the Justice Department has called a systemic pattern of
abusive conduct by officers.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted 10-2 on Tuesday to accept a binding
federal consent decree, after Mayor Richard J. Riordan rescinded
his threat of a veto and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks reluctantly
dropped his opposition. Riordan won office in 1993 on a pledge to
expand the police department and succeeded in doing so, only to
find himself over the last year facing the threatened lawsuit, plus
a separate local investigation into police corruption and
evidence-tampering that amounts to the worst such scandal in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which has not yet been given final approval by
the Justice Department and a federal court, would require the
department to collect data on the race of people stopped by
officers in an effort to determine the extent of racial profiling,
install a computerized system to track complaints and disciplinary
actions against officers, strengthen the civilian board of
commissioners that oversees the police and create a special
department unit to investigate shootings and use of force by
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just terrific as a first step to police reform,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the
University of Southern California and the author of a recent report
for the police union that had recommended similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   The question of police conduct has been a major civic and
political issue here at least since the videotaped beating of the
motorist Rodney King in 1991 and a subsequent inquiry by Warren
Christopher, which recommended broad changes in police management.
Some changes have been delayed ever since, and one goal of the
threatened lawsuit, which federal officials announced in May, has
been to force such changes now.

   CLASH ON ENERGY POLICY
</P>
<P>
   Winter is coming, and so, it seems, is a battle between the
presidential campaigns over energy policy. Vice President Al Gore,
a frequent critic of ``big oil,'' told Fox News Wednesday that he
would give ``a major policy speech'' Thursday on what to do about
the soaring price of home heating oil. Gov. George W. Bush, the
former oil man, pounced on that issue Wednesday, critizing
President Clinton and Gore for lacking an energy policy and
pointing out that the surge in oil prices had occurred in their
administration. ``I'm just asking what the man's solution is,''
Bush said of Gore in an interview on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   THE GREEN PARTY: NADER CARVING NICHE
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader opened a three-day swing through several closely
contested Midwestern states Wednesday, drawing enthusiastic crowds
and serving notice anew that while he remained near the bottom in
the polls, in a tight race he could be the spoiler. In Milwaukee,
Nader, who has been criticized by some liberals for playing down
race issues, warned a group of mostly black and Hispanic community
leaders that the greatest threat to minority communities was ``the
concentration of corporate power.'' In an address at the University
of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, he called for cutting the military
budget to finance social programs. ``They say the growing economy
is a tide that lifts all boats,'' he declared. ``But this is a tide
that lifts all yachts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATES: CASTING FOR THE DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   The casting of the onstage roles in the 2000 debates is now
complete. The Commission on Presidential Debates says that the CNN
anchor Bernard Shaw will be the moderator of the vice presidential
debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 5. Shaw, who has
been with CNN since its founding in 1980, has served over the years
as a questioner or moderator in a number of primary and general
election debates, his most memorable appearance being in the second
commission debate of 1988, when he asked the Democratic nominee,
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, whether he would support the
death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered. Dukakis' placid
response to the disconcerting question became an issue itself in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS: WHERE BRADLEY IS NOW
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who has been out of the political
limelight since losing to Al Gore in the Democratic primaries, has
taken a position as a board member and adviser to the chief
executive of a new company called UPromise Inc. The Boston-based
firm is trying to create a financial product that will allow people
to amass tax-free savings accounts for college by purchasing goods
from certain vendors. ``Obviously this is to make money,'' Bradley
said. ``But they also want to change the world.'' Besides his work
with UPromise, Bradley is pursuing other job opportunities, too,
though he declines to discuss them. He also has written a new
political book that will be released next week, entitled ``The
Journey From Here.'' It offers his reflections on the issues he
tried to raise in his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   THE STATES: MILLIONAIRE IN SENATE RACE
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cantwell, an Internet millionaire who is using part of her
wealth to underwrite a bid for the U.S. Senate, won the Democratic
primary in Washington state on Tuesday and will go up against the
veteran Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, in November. After
pouring $5 million into her primary campaign, Cantwell, who served
a single term in the House in the early 1990s, easily bested state
Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn. Gorton, who is seeking a
fourth Senate term, faced little competition in Tuesday's
Republican primary. But his popularity has slipped in recent years
in the state and he is considered one of the more vulnerable
Republican senators this year.
</P>
<P>
   THE TRAVEL LOG
</P>
<P>
   A number of new national polls indicate the presidential race
may be tightening again. But George W. Bush and Al Gore were a
continent apart Wednesday when it came to campaigning, with Bush
working Pennsylvania and Gore in California. The stats for the day:

SPORTS COLUMN: LOOK WHO'S ON DISPLAY IN BROOKLYN  

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the years Joe DiMaggio reigned as New York's best
baseball player, if not as all of baseball's best player, some
often wondered how many more home runs he would have hit if he
played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in cozy Ebbets Field instead of in
Yankee Stadium, even more cavernous then than now. When that
question was being debated one day, a New York Journal-American
baseball writer named Garry Schumacher shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiMaggio could never play in Brooklyn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' one of Schumacher's listeners asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's too perfect,'' Schumacher replied.
</P>
<P>
   Too perfect. Too elegant. Too stylish. At least for the borough
that in those years embraced its Dodgers as ``dem bums'' long
before the Boys of Summer team departed for Los Angeles after the
1957 season. But too perfect or not, Joe DiMaggio, in a way, is now
playing in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Forty items of DiMaggio's memorabilia _ one of his Yankee
uniform shirts, an oil portrait, his Hall of Fame induction plaque,
autographed photos, bats and baseballs _ are on display at Xaverian
High School in Bay Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Some items will be auctioned at the Joe DiMaggio Award Dinner on
Jan. 24 at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan, with the proceeds
going to the DiMaggio Scholarship Fund at Xaverian; other items
will remain at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the West Side Highway being changed to the Joe
DiMaggio Highway shortly after his death early last year,'' said
Sal Ferrera, the Xaverian president, ``our memorabilia is the only
official connection to Joe DiMaggio in the New York area.''
</P>
<P>
   But why Brooklyn? Why Xaverian High School?
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's weakness was health and education,'' Morris Engelberg,
the lawyer for the DiMaggio estate, was saying from his Hollywood,
Fla., office. ``Marilyn Monroe was his love, but children were his
weakness. In 1997 Joe's foot doctor, Rock Positano, a Xaverian
alumnus, brought him to the school to meet the championship
baseball team the night before the school honored Joe with its
first Concordia Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Xaverian's 1,300 boys, about 800 are involved in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought Xaverian was where some of Joe's memorabilia
belonged,'' Engelberg said. ``Everything there was in my office,
personally signed by Joe. The 1951 Yankee uniform shirt is unusual
because it's signed on the back. Joe seldom did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once told me, `I don't sign uniforms on the back because I
never liked to have my picture taken from the back.' But he signed
that shirt on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe knew that about 60 percent of the boys at Xaverian are of
Italian heritage,'' Engelberg added. ``Joe liked that. He would
have wanted to have his memorabilia there.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg and Positano grew up in the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn, where Yankee fans were few and far between. But DiMaggio
was an Italian icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends were Italian,'' Engelberg said. ``I remember
their fathers let them root for the Dodgers but one said, `When
DiMaggio is up, you root for him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it has to be wondered how many in Brooklyn were rooting
for him with two out in the ninth inning of the fourth game of the
1941 World Series at Ebbets Field, when Mickey Owen let the
right-hander Hugh Casey's third strike get past him and Tommy
Henrich hurried to first base. If the Dodgers held onto their 4-3
lead, they would square the Series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the next batter, DiMaggio, singled sharply to left. Charlie
Keller's two-run double put the Yankees ahead, 5-4. Joe Gordon's
two-run double completed the Yankees' 7-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in Brooklyn, so the story goes, a deflated Dodger
fan tossed his dog out an open window in his upstairs apartment.
The next day, the Yankees finished up the Series.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1947 Series against the Dodgers, DiMaggio thought he had
hit a home run in the sixth game until little Al Gionfriddo raced
to the 415-foot sign in front of the left-field bullpen in Yankee
Stadium and caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual display of frustration, DiMaggio kicked the dirt
near second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also won that Series, in seven games, then won the
1949 Series with the Dodgers in five games. In those three World
Series against the Dodgers, Joe DiMaggio hit three homers and drove
in eight runs, but batted only .263, .231 and .111.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to help the Yankees win, and enough to remain too
perfect. &QL;

CHENEY ATTACKS CLINTON'S DEALINGS WITH IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Using the same language that some critics
used against him and former President Bush after the Persian Gulf
War nearly 10 years ago, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of letting Saddam
Hussein ``slip off the hook'' by avoiding weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of time there, in the aftermath of the Gulf war,
we had a very robust inspection regime under way,'' Cheney said.
``We had people in there all the time, checking out, making certain
that he wasn't going back trying to rebuild his biological and
chemical capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``we've seen a situation develop in which he's
kicked out all the inspectors and this administration appears to be
helpless to do anything about it. We're at the point where I think
we have not seen the kind of aggressive, effective leadership that
President Bush provided with respect to the coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the charge at a campaign stop in Lancaster, Calif.,
that began with a teary recollection of the day the ground war
began in the Persian Gulf. His words were reminiscent of critics of
the Bush administration, who said it let Saddam off the hook by
ending the war while Saddam was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the accusation against President Clinton in response
to a question from the audience after he had delivered a speech on
the need for increasing the military's research and development
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In past appearances, Cheney has been questioned on why the Bush
administration did not continue the Gulf war until Saddam was
driven from power. He has answered that the object was to drive
Iraq out of Kuwait, not to depose Saddam, and that the
international coalition would have been pulled apart if the United
States had continued.

AGENCY FINDS ECONOMIC RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES ACROSS U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

 By KENNETH CHANG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While California suffers the most economic harm from
earthquakes, cities in other parts of the country like Seattle, New
York, Salt Lake City and St. Louis are also at risk of heavy damage
and should be doing more to prevent such harm, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency conducted the study, its first nationwide projection
of earthquake losses in monetary terms, to guide disaster planners
and to show that earthquakes can be as economically devastating as
hurricanes and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   To make the point, agency researchers reviewed when and how
often earthquakes occur, and the value and condition of buildings
in 1994, the latest comprehensive figures available. Then they
projected the number and strength of earthquakes over hundreds of
years _ a long enough span to account for rare, powerful tremors in
places like the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those computer models, they calculated that earthquakes
would cause an average of $4.4 billion in damage and lost income a
year in the United States, comparable to the losses from
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the condition and value of buildings is
likely to change greatly in the future, the study's authors said it
would give disaster planners a baseline for understanding how much
economic risk their communities face in the case of these rare but
catastrophic earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitude 7 earthquakes, for example, hit Charleston, S.C., in
1886, and off the Atlantic coast of Canada in 1929. A quake that
size hitting an East Coast city today would probably cause tens of
billions of dollars in damage, much more than if it hit a
better-prepared West Coast city.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast buildings are generally older and not designed to
withstand shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthquake risk is here, and here to stay,'' said Brian Cowan,
a senior policy adviser at the agency who worked on the study.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans similar studies to predict hurricane and flood
damage. When those studies are released in the next two to three
years, local officials will be better able to decide which
disasters they should prepare for, said Dr. Stuart Nishenko, senior
seismologist at the agency who was the study's project officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start making preparations now instead of waiting for
the next disaster to hit and then doing it after the fact,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large number of people living in earthquake-prone
regions, the West Coast sustains the greatest losses, the study
said, with California alone absorbing almost three-quarters of the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's model does not predict losses in any given year but
instead provides a comparison of damage to various cities over
centuries. In the projection, Los Angeles suffers the highest loss
of any metropolitan area, reaching an average of $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage to the New York City area, averaged over the next
2,500 years, would be only 5 percent of that confronting Los
Angeles. Even so, that is the most of any metropolitan area outside
of the West Coast, and 11th overall.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates include only damage to buildings and not damage to
bridges, roads or other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City area, most years there are no earthquakes
and no damage. But three moderate-size tremors, about magnitude 5,
have struck nearby in the last 300 years, and a quake that size
today would probably cause several billion dollars of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sizeable earthquakes have struck New York City, including one on
Aug. 10, 1884, that damaged windows, chimneys and parapets, though
no one was killed.

SENATE COMMITTEES EXAMINE AWARDING OF $40 MILLION IN PENSION
CONTRACTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Mo.)  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top executive of the federal agency that guarantees pensions
improperly steered $40 million worth of contracts to a
minority-owned company, congressional investigators are set to
testify Thursday morning before a joint meeting of two Senate
committees. The allegations, they said, are being forwarded to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the executive's boss, David Strauss, executive director of
the agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., said his own
inquiries found nothing even mildly inappropriate. He said the
targets of the investigation _ Bennie L. Hagans Jr. and Myrna
Cooks, who owns the company that won the contracts _ are victims of
racists who have fed misleading information to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   All the key players on the issue are white except for the two
people under suspicion, both of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa, who is
chairman of a committee on aging, and Christopher Bond of Missouri,
who is chairman of a small-business committee, have been examining
the operation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which takes
over failed pension plans and pays benefits to retirees in the
plans. Their inquiry includes not just the contracts at issue but
whether the agency's computers are secure and the sometimes
yearslong delays in telling workers how much they will get when
they turn 65.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said Wednesday night that he was troubled by the findings
of the congressional investigators about the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter that the Department of Justice will review
seriously and then take appropriate action on the allegations that
contracts worth $40 million were steered during Mr. Strauss'
watch,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that other witnesses would detail how the agency
fails to supervise private contractors, who have replaced
government employees in many positions at the pension agency. ``One
of our witnesses says this agency created an `unbelievable mess'
for his mother,'' he said. ``I'd borrow his words and say this
agency is an unbelievable mess. Contractors do most of the work,
yet nobody looks over their shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Strauss has been saying privately, often
with great anger, that he believes Hagans and Cooks are the victims
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 million of contracts were awarded beginning in 1997 to
the Integrated Management Resources Group, even though it was not
the low bidder. The company was created early that year by Cooks.
She had been an executive of another company, Office Specialists
Inc., which at the time had the contract with Hagans' office to
administer some failed pension plans, including those of Pan
American World Airways, which failed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks was not the low bidder, but she won the contract partly on
the recommendation of Hagans, who oversees the pension corporation
division that pays out benefits to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Hast, the assistant comptroller general for special
investigations, is expected to testify that Hagans showed
favoritism and created the appearance of impropriety in helping
Cooks win the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller general has no authority over the pension
agency, but its investigators were brought in to assist the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, at the
request of the two senators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talking to a banker who was considering a $1
million loan that Cooks needed to start her business, Hagans also
spoke to employees of Office Specialists who were being solicited
by Cooks to work for her firm.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify as a bidder, under federal contracting rules, Cooks
did not need to have people already on her payroll, but she did
need to submit resumes to establish that she could provide
experienced staff if she was awarded a contract. At the time, she
was the only employee of her company, which operated out of the
basement of her Maryland home.
</P>
<P>
   Hast is expected to detail how Hagans came to the aid of Cooks
when she was trying to recruit co-workers to join her firm, taking
a trip to Atlanta, where the Pan Am pensions are administered, in
July 1997 and speaking to the workers.
</P>
<P>
   When Cooks came in as the high bidder, a committee was appointed
by Hagans to review the bids. One of the three people on that
committee was Wilmer Graham, who works directly under Hagans and
lives next door to Cooks. Graham's evaluation was not a significant
part of the decision to award the contract to Cooks, Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans, in an interview Wednesday, said he did nothing wrong and
that the Senate hearings were ``an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooks' lawyer, David W. Kuhnsman, said his client and her
company had acted properly ``but they have been getting harassed
for three years'' because she is black.

TALIBAN OPEN A CAMPAIGN TO GAIN STATUS AT THE U.N.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Four years after taking control of most of
Afghanistan, the Islamic Taliban movement sent a high-level
delegation to New York this week to lobby for the country's seat in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to challenge the United Nations on their reason for
not recognizing us,'' the team leader, Deputy Foreign Minister
Abdur Rahman Zahid, said in an interview. ``How can they recognize
that band of thugs sitting beyond our borders?''
</P>
<P>
   Zahid, taking the Taliban on the diplomatic offensive for the
first time, was referring to the mujahedeen, a loose coalition of
mostly exiled holy warriors whom the United States once supported
in their war against the Soviet Union. For the last few weeks, in a
succession of speeches and meetings affecting Afghanistan here, the
mujahedeen have been the sole representatives of a country they no
longer rule.
</P>
<P>
   The mujahedeen alliance controls less than 10 percent of
Afghanistan. Its president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, is in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the recent summit meeting here, the Taliban have had
no opportunity to speak officially, even though they have been
excoriated from the General Assembly podium for supporting
terrorism, exporting opium and abusing human rights, especially
those of women.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban government _ largely isolated at the behest of Iran,
Russia and the United States, if for different reasons _ is
recognized by three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, on Monday repeated
Clinton administration demands that the Taliban agree to a
broad-based democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   Zahid, who is meeting U.N. officials and other diplomats,
counters that Taliban officials now let women work in health
services, the Interior Ministry, at airports and for certain U.N.
agencies. But he said demands for elections were unrealistic in a
country destroyed by two decades of war, a drought and almost no
foreign aid.

   SEC SETTLES FRAUD CASE WITH 15-YEAR-OLD STUDENT
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a 15-year-old
high school student of orchestrating a scheme to increase the
prices of nine obscure, low-price stocks he had bought by sending
numerous upbeat messages to investing chat rooms on the Internet,
earning almost $273,000 in illegal gains.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, from Cedar Grove, N.J., settled with the SEC by
agreeing to pay back the money he made plus interest, for a total
of $285,000. Regulators said he was the first minor to be sued by
the SEC.  &QL;

   Sprint said that its core operation would fail to meet analysts'

the core unit would grow at its slowest rate since the company
issued a tracking stock for its wireless division, Sprint PCS,
almost two years ago. As for the wireless unit, the company said it
would add about 800,000 subscribers this quarter, about 100,000
fewer than many analysts had expected. Investors dumped shares of
the tracking stock, sending them down $7.81, to $33. Shares of
Sprint's main stock fell $1.50, to $26.81.  &QL;

TUIASOSOPO DROPPING OUT OF HEISMAN HUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That Washington is ranked eighth and 3-0 is a bit of a surprise.
That the Huskies have done it at times in spite of quarterback
Marques Tuiasosopo is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies were going to have a national-championship
season, it was thought they would have to ride Tuiasosopo's arm and
legs for their success. Instead, he has been less than ordinary in
key moments and is dashing his Heisman Trophy hopes even as the
Huskies flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Proof lies in Tuiasosopo's five interceptions _ the most among
Pac-10 quarterbacks _ and three touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   He is seventh in the Pac-10's quarterback-rating system,
trailing a group that features Stanford's Randy Fasani, Washington
State's Jason Gesser and UCLA's Ryan McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be in the spot we are because I haven't
had a good, quality day in terms of efficiency,'' said Tuiasosopo.
``Maybe (I need to be) more cautious with the ball in terms of
being more sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo had two interceptions in the final five minutes of
the first half against Colorado, with one returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much football as I've played and the experiences I've had,
those are things I shouldn't do,'' Tuiasosopo said. ``I'm
tremendously frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late for Tuiasosopo to salvage his Heisman hopes,
if he can turn his season around starting next week against Oregon.
He is eighth on CNN/SI's Heisman Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's athletic department has not yet decided if it will
begin sending out postcards trumpeting Tuiasosopo as a Heisman
candidate.

   __ Michigan's mad: Coach Lloyd Carr called Big Ten commissioner
Jim Delany to complain about two third-quarter calls in the UCLA
game that went against the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ruled defensive back Julius Curry out of bounds to
nullify an interception, although replays indicated he was in.
Also, a catch by UCLA receiver Freddie Mitchell was ruled legal,
although Carr said he came from out of bounds to make the
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since I've been a head coach, I called Jim
Delany,'' Carr said. ``I am infuriated at those two calls along
that sideline over there. I'm not going to say any more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping cool: Stanford freshman quarterback Chris Lewis
calmly led the Cardinal to a touchdown drive in the final two
minutes to upset Texas, throwing three touchdown passes against the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went in, I just tried to think, `OK, I'm just back at
(Long Beach) Poly, Friday-night lights.' I was thinking about my
sister (Robyn, a member of Stanford's volleyball team) sitting in
the stands. She never gets rattled. She would have done a better
job than me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Player of the week: Nobody played a better game than Cal
punter Nick Harris in the Bears' 17-15 loss to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, considered one of the nation's top punters, had nine of
his 12 punts downed inside the 15-yard line, including spots at the
3, 4, 2, 9, 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick was unbelievable,'' Cal coach Tom Holmoe said. ``Watching
the film, I'm in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Upon further review: The controversial winning touchdown
catch Florida's Jabar Gaffney made against Tennessee ``probably''
would have been ruled an incompletion if it hadn't occurred in the
end zone, SEC supervisor of officials Bobby Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fast as it seemed to have happened, probably if I were
guessing, it would have been an incompletion in the field of
play,'' Gaston said. ``But it's different in the end zone because
all you have to do is establish player possession for an instant of
a second. That's all it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Southern feud: South Carolina coach Lou Holtz and Clemson
coach Tommy Bowden are taking some nasty verbal jabs at each other.
Most recently, Bowden suggested Holtz owes some of his success to
former South Carolina head coach and current Clemson assistant Brad
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate Brad Scott recruiting these players; we had them
last year,too,'' said Holtz, whose team went 0-11 in 1999. ``I
think I would give Brad a great deal of credit just as I'm sure
Tommy would be the first to jump up and give (former Clemson coach)
Tommy West a lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   __ He's a Nutt: Arkansas coach Houston Nutt was labeled a
``used-car salesman'' by a Boise State athlete who played for Nutt
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do respect the guy, but he's a used-car salesman,'' Boise
defensive lineman Bradly Phillips said before losing to the
Razorbacks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could sell a used car, Nutt responded: ``You betcha
and I'd be good at it. You're doggone right. And I sell 'em a good
car, too.''

Ewing's 15-year career with the Knicks ended Wednesday night as New
York sent him to the Seattle SuperSonics in a four-team, 12-player
trade also involving the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns. The
Knicks sent Ewing to Seattle and received Glen Rice from the Lakers
and Luc Longley from the Suns. Among the other major players moving

Some 40 counties of eastern Kentucky, intent on scrubbing forth a
new national image, have banded together to root out the countless
festering garbage dumps and the pipes that dump raw sewage into
creeks and ditches, features that long have broadcast a stereotype
of backwoods fecklessness in Appalachia. The eastern Kentucky
effort, called Pride (Personal Responsibility in a Desirable
Environment), an alliance of federal, state and volunteer workers,
has quietly caught on, with 1,996 dumps mapped and targeted by
searchers so far and 377 of them eliminated. One of the countless
``holler dumps'' that long have pocked the beauty of Appalachia in

   (NYT31) DAYTON, Ohio -- Sept. 20, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-MILITARY --
Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam. George W. Bush
joined the Texas National Guard and didn't. As many people in
uniform see it, however, Gore was an Army journalist and served an
abbreviated tour in Southeast Asia. Bush, on the other hand,
trained as a fighter pilot and flew F-4's, even if he never went to
war. Eight years after President Clinton's lack of a service record
and advocacy of gays in the military roiled his relations with the
Pentagon, Gore's service seems to have done little to help him with
at least one bloc of voters: people in uniform. The retired
generals, who rose to prominence during the Persian Gulf war, J.
Norman Schwarzkopf, left, and Colin Powell, right, gave Bush strong
endorsements as the next commander in chief earlier this month.

   (NYT31) DAYTON, Ohio -- Sept. 20, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-MILITARY --
Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam. George W. Bush
joined the Texas National Guard and didn't. As many people in
uniform see it, however, Gore was an Army journalist and served an
abbreviated tour in Southeast Asia. Bush, on the other hand,
trained as a fighter pilot and flew F-4's, even if he never went to
war. Eight years after President Clinton's lack of a service record
and advocacy of gays in the military roiled his relations with the
Pentagon, Gore's service seems to have done little to help him with
at least one bloc of voters: people in uniform. The retired
generals, who rose to prominence during the Persian Gulf war, J.
Norman Schwarzkopf, left, and Colin Powell, right, gave Bush strong
endorsements as the next commander in chief earlier this month.

GERMAN CONCERN REPORTED CLOSE TO ACQUIRING THAMES WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In what is expected to spur further consolidation among
European utilities, RWE AG, a German energy and environmental
concern, is nearing an agreement to acquire Thames Water PLC of
Britain for 4.3 billion pounds, or about $6 billion, people close
to the discussions said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   RWE, which is about to complete a merger with German rival VEW,
has said it would use its 30 billion-euro war chest, or about $25.5
billion, to expand throughout Europe. In addition to energy and
environmental activities, RWE runs waste management facilities and
water utilities in 120 countries, although it currently has no
operations in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Water has been eliminating jobs in Britain and expanding
abroad _ most recently buying New Jersey utility E'Town Corp. for
about $1 billion _ after British regulators slashed water prices by
12 percent this year. Prices over the next four years will be
allowed to rise in line with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible RWE deal for Thames pushed up the British
company's share price by 26 percent Wednesday to 1,153 pence or
about $16.14. RWE shares fell 3.9 percent to 39.5 euros or about
$33.58.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Water's sheer size in Britain, where it has about 12
million customers, would make it attractive to a foreign player
looking to gain a foothold, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good deal,'' said Verity Mitchell, an analyst with HSBC
Securities, who rates Thames shares a buy. ``Thames fills a gap in
RWE's existing armory.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be all cash, could be announced
as soon as Monday. In addition to equity, RWE would assume 2.4
billion pounds of Thames Water's debt, the people close to the
negotiations said. At a 13 percent premium to Thames Water's asset
value of 3.8 billion pounds, the current offer is fair, several
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Water issued a statement Wednesday confirming that it was
in ``advanced discussions'' with an unnamed bidder, but a spokesman
declined to comment further. Executives from RWE declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The British company is expected to be the first of several
utilities in the country to be snapped up by foreign buyers, since
British regulators have said that any benefits from mergers between
British utilities must be passed to consumers, rather than to
shareholders.

Environment), an alliance of federal, state and volunteer workers,

   (NYT31) DAYTON, Ohio -- Sept. 20, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-MILITARY --
Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam. George W. Bush
joined the Texas National Guard and didn't. As many people in
uniform see it, however, Gore was an Army journalist and served an
abbreviated tour in Southeast Asia. Bush, on the other hand,
trained as a fighter pilot and flew F-4's, even if he never went to
war. Eight years after President Clinton's lack of a service record
and advocacy of gays in the military roiled his relations with the
Pentagon, Gore's service seems to have done little to help him with
at least one bloc of voters: people in uniform. The retired
generals, who rose to prominence during the Persian Gulf war, J.
Norman Schwarzkopf, left, and Colin Powell, right, gave Bush strong
endorsements as the next commander in chief earlier this month.

   (NYT31) DAYTON, Ohio -- Sept. 20, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-MILITARY --
Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam. George W. Bush
joined the Texas National Guard and didn't. As many people in
uniform see it, however, Gore was an Army journalist and served an
abbreviated tour in Southeast Asia. Bush, on the other hand,
trained as a fighter pilot and flew F-4's, even if he never went to
war. Eight years after President Clinton's lack of a service record
and advocacy of gays in the military roiled his relations with the
Pentagon, Gore's service seems to have done little to help him with
at least one bloc of voters: people in uniform. The retired
generals, who rose to prominence during the Persian Gulf war, J.
Norman Schwarzkopf, left, and Colin Powell, right, gave Bush strong
endorsements as the next commander in chief earlier this month.

 SPACE: NETWORK TV's COMMERCIAL FRONTIER  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, when NBC signed a deal to hold a televised contest to
send a civilian into outer space aboard a Russian-built rocket, the
television networks seemed to have pushed their hunger for new
forms of reality programming literally to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be more to come. The networks are continuing to
make deals for programs that involve everything from a scavenger
hunt around the world to a competition to escape from a
high-technology prison.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing captures the bizarre, competitive atmosphere and
altered playing field in television as much as a series of
program-pitch meetings this week in which executives at three
networks actually pondered an offer to start a new form of space
race, network-style, going against the NBC space show with one of
their own _ with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what the networks were told would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   A company with ties to NASA, Dreamtime Holdings Inc., proposed
at meetings Monday with CBS, ABC, and Fox a show that would use
NASA facilities at the Johnson Space Center in Texas to train 20
contestants hoping to be selected to spend a week aboard the new
International Space Station, executives at all three networks said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamtime, a multimedia company based in Moffett Field, Calif.,
that has contracted with NASA for a number of media projects,
including digitizing the agency's photo and film archives and
placing high-definition Web cameras inside the space station, was
offering the show to the networks in conjunction with the prominent
Hollywood talent agency, Endeavor. A third party, an independent
producer of documentaries called Highway Films, was also involved
in the talks, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was not represented at the pitch meetings with the networks
and it would seem improbable that given the liability problems and
potential public relations backlash the agency would approve such a
move. Asked Wednesday if such approval would ever be given, a
spokesman for the agency, Robert Jacobs, said only: ``NASA has not
seen a proposal for such a show. The agency has to see a proposal
before it makes any commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamtime's chief executive, Bill Foster, who attended the pitch
meetings, would not discuss the nature of the talks. In a telephone
interview Tuesday, he said his company acts only within the
boundaries of its contract with NASA. In a statement Wednesday,
Foster said Dreamtime is ``pursuing opportunities to generate
greater excitement, awareness and understanding about space.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs said that any deal involving the use of facilities at
the Johnson center or the habitation quarters on board the space
station would require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The show being pitched to the three networks was similar to the
one that NBC committed to two weeks ago, except that it would be
U.S.-based as opposed to Moscow-based, and produced in cooperation
with a U.S. governmental agency, not with MirCorp, an independent
company set up to exploit commercial possibilities of the aging
Russian space station, Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at all of the networks involved said they had been
told that NASA would be participating in the program. Sandy
Grushow, the chairman of Fox Entertainment, said: ``We were told
NASA was involved. If they're producing this thing through NASA,
that's the powerful attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior ABC program executive, who requested anonymity, said,
``They told us this had a stamp of endorsement from NASA.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsed or not, a deal for the show has not yet developed at
any network. One network senior executive said, ``I'm skeptical
that either of these space shows will get off the ground.'' He
cited questions about liability exposure for the network.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Burnett, the producer behind the Mir show at NBC, and
the man who turned ``Survivor'' into the television hit of the year
for CBS, remains confident that he will make his show for NBC.
``I'm laughing at the idea of NASA reacting to me,'' Burnett said
of the prospect of a competing show. ``Talk is cheap. I can
actually do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if some skepticism surrounds the space idea, skepticism
about reality shows is not widespread inside the network
entertainment divisions. They continue to buy reality formats, in
search of the next show that might capture the imagination of
American viewers the way ``Survivor'' did on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks not only remain enthusiastic about the reality
genre, but the next iterations are all about one-upping the
others,'' said Ben Silverman, the head of international packaging
for the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman noted that the shows have mainly been imported from
Europe, ``and there shows like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' and
``Survivor'' are several years old. The Europeans are already onto
the next wave.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those shows, which ABC is enthusiastic about, is
``Jailbreak,'' in which a group of contestants try to be the first
one to break out of a high-technology prison.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Boot Camp'' will follow a group of volunteer recruits
through the rigors of military training in pursuit of cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Longer range, Fox's syndication division is interested in a show
called ``The Big Diet,'' which follows the travails of a group of
people trying to lose the most weight for a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   And ABC has a show called ``Life on Mars,'' which will put a
group of people into a house approximating living conditions on
Mars. It may not be a space shot, but ABC executives said they were
seeking expert advice from NASA on that production.

TWO FIRMS OFFER COMPROMISE ON SEC AUDIT RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major accounting firms broke rank with other firms Wednesday
and offered a compromise proposal to impose significant
restrictions on the consulting work that accountants can do for
their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, by Ernst &AMP; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, does
not go nearly as far as one that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had put forth, but it would represent a victory for
Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, who seems determined to enact new
rules this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Levitt said the new proposal
``represents a very constructive approach that the commission will
seriously consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an SEC hearing, James J. Schiro, the chief executive
of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the new proposal ``would meet the
commission's objectives'' while allowing auditing firms to
``provide the services we anticipate our clients will require in
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Schiro said he had been ``extremely
encouraged'' by the willingness of the SEC staff to talk and
entertain the possibility of compromises. Levitt praised the two
firms for working with the commission staff and said he hoped that
other firms would be willing to join in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Laskaway, the chairman of Ernst &AMP; Young, said the
proposal would ``address most of the issues of concern'' to the
commission while assuring that auditors could do a good job.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise proposal would bar auditors from performing some
_ but not all _ internal auditing functions for companies that they
audit. It would also restrict how much work audit firms could do in
developing management information systems for audit clients. In
general, they could not develop systems that were important in
compiling a company's financial reports. The SEC is concerned that
auditors not be in a position of auditing work done by their
colleagues, fearing that the auditors would be reluctant to
criticize such systems.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms had supported the SEC's initiative but had
criticized some parts of it. Others in the accounting industry had
been hopeful that PricewaterhouseCoopers, in particular, would end
up fighting the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   James Copeland, the chief executive of Deloitte &AMP; Touche and one
of the strongest critics of the SEC action, testified against the
original proposal Wednesday, warning that it would reduce the
quality of audits by limiting the knowledge and expertise of
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would study the new proposal, but added that any
proposal ``that makes it more difficult for us to access and
maintain technology expertise in the age of technology can't be a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which
has also opposed the SEC rule, said that if the commission decided
it liked the new proposal, it should put it out for a formal
comment period. Such a period would assure that no action could be
taken until next year, after a new president would have an
opportunity to appoint a replacement for Levitt.

   LIMIT REMOVED ON STEELMAKER SHARES

   Hoping to increase the declining share price of the Pohang Iron
and Steel Co., the world's largest steelmaker, the South Korean
government will eliminate the 30 percent foreign stock ownership
and 3 percent individual share-holding limit in the company this
month instead of next year, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and

   The Bank of England acknowledged that its Monetary Policy
Committee had been narrowly divided this month on holding the
benchmark interest rate at 6 percent. The bank said committee
members voted 5-4 for the second successive month to leave rates
unchanged. The closeness of the ballot suggested that the committee
could be close to a rate increase if inflation is fueled by the
sterling's weakness and high oil prices. The prospect helped to
strengthen the pound to $1.4124 from $1.4016 and to 59.92 pence
against the euro from 60.38 pence.

   LAURA ASHLEY REPORTS A PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   After years of losses that brought it to the brink of
insolvency, Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, the British chain best known
for floral prints, said it returned to a first-half profit
following a shift toward home furnishings. The company, which sold
off its money-losing business in the United States last year, said
first-half net income rose to 1.1 million pounds, or $1.54 million,
compared with a loss of 7.2 million pounds one year earlier. Home
furnishings accounted for 60 percent of its (PS)118 million sales.

   OIL COMPANY SOLD

   Russia sold a small oil company, Onako, for $1.1 billion, more

since President Vladimir V. Putin was elected. The success of the
competitive auction indicated the new government is serious about
improving the country's business climate. The buyer was Evro-Tek, a

Russia's most aggressive oil companies.  &QL;

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: THE WHITEWATER VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and businesslike statement, the independent counsel
Robert Ray said on Wednesday that the six-year investigation into
Whitewater had produced ``insufficient'' evidence to justify
criminal charges against President and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But
while the statement came as a great relief to the White House,
Ray's terse legal judgment does not excuse the White House's long
record of obfuscation in the Whitewater matter, including its
clumsy meddling with official inquiries and its failure to produce
relevant records in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   After tidying up some loose ends, Ray will turn his full report
over to the three-judge panel that oversees his office. It should
then be released so that the public can draw its own conclusions.
In the meantime, Ray is to be commended for resisting any
temptation to convey his private thoughts about these tangled
events or otherwise politicize his conclusions in the final weeks
of Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a report on the so-called Travelgate case,
involving the firing of seven White House employees, Ray likewise
found no ground for prosecution. But he had been openly critical of
Mrs. Clinton's sworn statements that she had nothing to do with the
dismissals. Mrs. Clinton can probably be thankful that Ray avoided
similar commentary in this case. The flat tone of Wednesday's
statement is a plus for her, and is unlikely to affect her growing
lead over Rick Lazio, her Republican challenger, as reflected in
the latest New York Times/CBS poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons themselves are largely responsible for the late
delivery of Ray's statement. From the day that questions were first
raised about their relationship to Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas
savings and loan that went bust at a cost of more than $70 million
to the American taxpayers, they and their political confederates in
the White House and the executive branch went to puzzling lengths
to hobble legitimate investigations. Instead of candidly laying out
the facts of the matter, the Clinton apparatus instead stonewalled
the investigators and defamed the Clintons' critics. All this gave
rise to suspicions that the Clintons had something to hide, and
prolonged the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said his office had investigated at least seven separate
criminal allegations involving the Clintons, including the
mysterious matter of the Rose Law Firm billing records, which
detailed Mrs. Clinton's legal work on behalf of the failing savings
and loan. In each case, he found that there was insufficient
evidence to prove that the Clintons were involved in any crime
related to Madison Guaranty or other aspects of Whitewater, or that
they had committed perjury or otherwise obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in advance of the full report, there are obvious lessons to
be learned. One is that full disclosure from the outset would have
been much the wiser course for the Clintons. Another is that the
public is poorly served when senior executive branch officials try
to control legitimate inquiries into matters involving the
president. In that regard, Congress' decision to allow the
independent counsel act to lapse has left the job of investigating
executive misbehavior to the Justice Department _ an agency, as
recent experience shows, that is ill suited to pursue misdeeds
elsewhere in the executive branch. Congress will need to devise
some sort of independent mechanism to deal with investigations of
potential criminal conduct by the nation's senior federal
officials.

 &HT;    Huge storm screams through Ohio
 &HT;    By J. Frazier Smith and Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio _ At least one person was killed and scores injured
after a late-summer storm several witnesses are calling a tornado
hit several churches, leveled a grocery store, smacked a Wal-Mart
and roughed up homes in Xenia and headed north.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which hit with little warning, spawned confusion all
night as rescue personnel, law enforcement, public officials and
citizens tried to get a handle on what happened about 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one fatality, I've got one trapped, I've got the
fairgrounds torn all to pieces,'' Xenia Twp. Assistant Fire Chief
Richard Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor declared a state of emergency at 10:15 p.m. Only
residents were allowed into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Xenia Twp. fire personnel were unable to rescue a person trapped
in a car at the fairgrounds, hit by a fallen tree.
</P>
<P>
   There were people arriving at the fairgrounds to prepare for
this weekend's Old Timer Days, which begins Friday. Several barns
were damaged or destroyed and tractors on display were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hollingsworth, 42, who was living in Xenia at the time of
the deadly 1974 tornado that killed 33 people, said he was
convinced Wednesday night's storm was a tornado, and that all he
remembers is that the wind was lifting his truck and trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost Groceryland, at least four churches, we've closed
off the city. We're only letting residents move around but we're
asking that they stay in their homes to stay safe,'' Xenia Mayor
John Saraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin King said he was setting up a craft booth for the Old
Fashion Days Festival in the goat barn when he saw what he
described as a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and another guy went in and grabbed a post and hung on for
dear life,'' King said. He and the other man escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hull said he was at Nick's Restaurant eating dinner when
the storm hit. He returned home to find ``half my house gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 26 people were taken to Miami Valley Hospital, where
several of the injured were taken and lined up along hallways,
waiting to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that raced east-northeast was estimated to be two
miles wide, stretching north of Xenia, according to National
Weather Service officials in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front packed with instability and low-level moisture
clashed with a system from the Plains states in front of the cold
front that is due to visit the area today, Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's storm packed 58-mph winds that were only 3,000
to 4,000 feet above the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service issued a severe thunderstorm warning about
6:42 p.m., when meteorologists were getting reports of winds of
more than 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were getting reports of wind gusts as high as 63 mph in
northwest Dayton and a 58-mph gust in downtown Dayton,'' Hickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was widespread.
</P>
<P>
   No fatalities were reported and there were only minor injuries,
officials said. Firefighters along with police forces in both
communities, were assessing the damage and helping residents.

LIEBERMAN IS CRITICIZED ON VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSVILLE HEIGHTS, Ohio _ William Bennett, who has often
joined forces with Sen. Joseph Lieberman in assailing violence and
vulgarity in popular culture, sharply attacked Lieberman on
Wednesday, accusing him of retreating from that cause.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, denied
the accusation, arguing that he and Vice President Al Gore had been
tougher on the entertainment industry than their Republican
opponents, and he suggested that Bennett's remarks were motivated
by his support for Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between two men who called each other friends
stemmed largely from a fund-raiser on Monday night in Beverly
Hills, Calif., attended by Gore, Lieberman and several
entertainment executives and stars. At that event, Lieberman muted
his criticism of the industry, a week after he and Gore had
proposed new regulation of its marketing of violent and sexual
material to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Lieberman
said Monday night. ``It's true from time to time we will have been,
will be critics, or noodges, but I promise you this: We will never
never put the government in the position of telling you by law,
through law, what to make. We will nudge you, but we will never
become censors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bennett released a statement saying: ``I am deeply
disappointed by Senator Lieberman's recent comments to members of
the entertainment industry. Senator Lieberman so softly voiced his
criticisms about the products of that industry that they were
barely audible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the conservative moralist who was secretary of
education under President Ronald Reagan and drug policy director
for President George Bush, said, ``I did not realize that when Joe
Lieberman and I were denouncing the filth, sewage and mindless
bloodletting of the popular entertainment industry, calling it what
it is _ degrading and dehumanizing _ we were just being `noodges.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was ``disappointed'' by Bennett's comments, Mr.
Lieberman said, ``I wonder whether this is a sign of a campaign
that's faltering or kind of anxiously trying to figure out how to
regain the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bennett, Jeff Kwitkowski, said there was nothing
partisan about the criticism, insisting, ``We're not playing sides
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Federal Trade Commission reported that the
entertainment industry routinely marketed adult material to
children. Gore and Lieberman proposed that if the industry did not
change its practices within six months, the commission should
impose regulations on the marketing of movies, video games and
music, and that a new law to that effect should be passed, if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Al Gore and I, after the FTC report, made the
toughest statement,'' Lieberman said on Wednesday. ``Where was the
Bush-Cheney ticket on the FTC report? They expressed concern, but
there was no teeth to anything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that Gore and Lieberman have been
hypercritical, criticizing the industry while raising millions of
dollars from it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, Lieberman replied directly to
that accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of leadership,'' he said, is ``to be willing to stand up
to your friends and supporters and say, `we think you're wrong on
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the day when I see George Bush and Dick
Cheney stand up to their friends in the oil industry,'' he added,
``their supporters in the oil industry, and tell them they think
they can do better than they are now for American consumers and the
American economy, or to stand up to the tobacco industry or the
NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he softened his remarks on Monday night, Lieberman has
been a steadfast critic of some elements of the entertainment
industry. In testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Commerce
Committee, he warned of ``the culture of carnage surrounding our
children,'' who, he said, had been focused on by the entertainment
media with ``a toxic mix turning some of them into killers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has also stressed that while he hoped to cajole and
embarrass the industry into changing what it produced, he did not
advocate government regulation of content but only of marketing
practices, a point he also made before this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Bennett said, ``I'm saddened that my friend
Joe Lieberman's powerful, direct criticisms became sotto voce when
he was among many of those whose work he had previously
criticized.''

LAZIO STEPS UP CHALLENGE TO BAN SOFT MONEY IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: see related NY-SENATE-POLL) 
By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD with CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio, trying to put Hillary Rodham
Clinton on the defensive over her campaign finance practices,
declared on Wednesday that he had obtained pledges from 14
political groups to stay out of the New York Senate race if Clinton
renounces soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio pointed out that Clinton had demanded agreements from
these groups, which had vowed to defeat her, before she would stop
raising soft money, which can be donated in unlimited amounts. Now,
Lazio contended in a speech here, she had no choice but to abide by
her promise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that she was now more willing to discuss an
agreement banning soft money from the contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the two campaigns quickly fell into squabbling over the
details, and could not even agree on the terms of a meeting. At the
same time, the chairman of the Republican State Committee, William
D. Powers, indicated through a spokesman that he would not abide by
any agreement prohibiting spending in the race by committees and
groups outside the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides seized on Powers' position as evidence of their
belief that Lazio's allies would not abandon their efforts to
defeat her.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, showed up
at Clinton's headquarters in Manhattan, saying he wanted to
negotiate an agreement immediately. His counterpart on the Clinton
campaign, Bill de Blasio, met him at the doorway of the
headquarters and told Dal Col that he would be happy to talk on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Posing for the cameras, their aides urging them on, the two men
then argued for several minutes over whether reporters should be
allowed into such a meeting. Dal Col said they should, saying that
the public had a right to know the views of the two campaigns. De
Blasio suggested that allowing reporters in would turn the meeting
into a circus.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation capped several weeks of wrangling between the
two campaigns over the issue of soft money, the largely unregulated
contributions raised by political committees. Soft money is not
supposed to be used to help candidates, but in recent years, the
parties have spent it in ways _ typically commercials _ that are
clearly an effort to assist their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns have also fought over spending by advocacy groups
independent of the parties, particularly conservative ones that are
committed to defeating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, at a conference here organized by a statewide
journalists' association, released 14 letters from independent
groups that promised not to raise or spend soft money on his behalf
as long as Clinton did the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, ladies and gentlemen, is now a test of character for
Mrs. Clinton,'' Lazio said, repeating a persistent theme from the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested the letters from the groups this month as a
condition of her abiding by a challenge she issued in May for the
candidates to abstain from such money, which advocates of campaign
finance reform say taints politics with shadowy contributors
seeking to buy influence.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who has used the campaign finance reform issue to
question Clinton's trustworthiness, said his offer stood for 72
hours, but vowed not to open soft money accounts. Unlike Lazio,
Clinton has raised several million dollars in soft money. Neither
the state Conservative Party, which is running a soft money ad
critical of Clinton, nor the state Republican Party, which has also
run critical soft money ads, were listed in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who spoke an hour after Lazio at the meeting,
said she was willing to sign an agreement pending a close review of
the letters. In response to a question on whether she was now
willing to give up soft money, she replied, ``I am prepared to do
that, and I'm very encouraged by what I heard.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has released the letters while facing questions about his
tactics in the debate last week in which he approached Clinton's
lectern and gestured for her to sign a pledge banning soft money.
On Wednesday, Lazio explained why he decided to press the issue.
``I think there are a lot of things polls do not pick up,'' he
said. ``Campaign finance reform is a proxy issue for people's
belief in the political system, that people are being trustworthy
and truthful.''

ANALYSIS: POLITICAL ADS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertising war over prescription drugs escalated this week:
The Republican National Committee broadcast a biting new commercial
in 17 states, and the Gore campaign quickly responded.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCERS: Cold Harbor Films for the Republicans, The Campaign
Co. for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The Republican advertisement features a notebook
that is ostensibly comparing the Bush and Gore prescription drug
plans. Under the Gore column, are words like, ``Charges Seniors
$600 Big Government Access Fee Annually.'' Under the Bush column,
words appear like, ``Seniors Choose Coverage.'' The advertisement
summarizes all its charges against Gore, then cuts to the
Democratic candidate himself in a television set, while the words
appear, ``Gore's Rx Plan? PrescriptionForDisaster.com.'' As the
advertisement ends, Gore is speaking with the sound turned off, but
he appears to be saying, ``For you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic advertisement opens with the picture of a
Washington Post analysis of a Bush television commercial, saying it
``misrepresents'' Gore's policy on prescription drugs. It then cuts
to images of the elderly with Gore, and with health care providers,
while the words ``The Facts'' appear on the screen, buttressing
what the narrator says. ``Al Gore covers all seniors through
Medicare, not an HMO,'' one screen says. The advertisement also
shows Bush, then cuts to elderly people talking to what is
apparently intended to be an HMO bureaucrat. The words on the
screen: ``Bush forces seniors to go to HMOs and insurance
companies. ... They have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICAN AD: Narrator: ``On prescription medicines,
compare: Al Gore will charge seniors a new $600-a-year government
access fee. George Bush opposes Gore's $600 fee. Gore's plan: When
seniors turn 64, they must join a drug HMO selected by Washington
or they are on their own. Bush's plan: Seniors choose, and it
covers all catastrophic health care costs. Gore's plan doesn't and
has a government HMO and a $600 fee. A prescription for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GORE AD: Narrator: ``Newspapers say George Bush's
prescription drug ad misrepresents the facts. In fact, Al Gore's
plan covers all seniors through Medicare, not an HMO. Under Gore,
seniors choose their own doctor and doctors decide what drugs to
prescribe. George Bush forces seniors to go to HMOs and insurance
companies for prescription drugs. They have no choice. And Bush
leaves millions of middle-class seniors with no coverage. Al Gore _
the only prescription plan that gives all seniors coverage and
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICAN AD: The ``government access fee'' the Bush
campaign talks about is the estimated premium for a year's worth of
prescription drug coverage in the year 2009 _ eight years after the
Gore plan takes effect. The premium in the first year is $25 a
month, or $300 a year. It is impossible to compare it with Bush's,
because his plan makes few commitments on premiums, deductibles or
copayments. But Democratic analysts assert that the cost to
beneficiaries under Bush's proposal would be significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that people are ``forced,'' under the Gore plan, to
join a ``government HMO'' is misleading. The Gore plan is
voluntary; the elderly are free to get their prescription drug
coverage through retiree plans, through HMOs, through Medicare or
to waive coverage altogether. The new drug benefit would be
provided through the Medicare program. The ``government HMO'' is
apparently the pharmaceutical benefit managers, essentially
middlemen who administer these benefits in the private sector and
would also do so for Medicare. The Bush plan, many analysts say,
would actually rely more heavily on HMOs and other private health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   THE GORE AD: This is essentially a defensive advertisement,
responding to the charges of the Republicans. But it also makes a
few charges of its own _ that the Bush plan would force seniors to
go to HMOs and insurance companies for drug coverage. While the
Bush plan would encourage more involvement by private health plans
in Medicare, Bush has said that people could stay in the
traditional government program and still have the ability to get
drug coverage; the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs
Medicare, would be required to offer a ``high option'' plan that
includes drugs, although the details are not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that the Bush plan would leave behind ``millions of
middle-class seniors'' is partly based on the fact that the initial
thrust of his program would involve aid to the states to help
low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   The Republican advertisement is appealing to two powerful fears:
The fear of ``big government'' intruding into private health care
decisions, and the fear of HMOs doing the same thing. The ``big
government'' argument is a traditional line of attack against
Democrats, although, of course, Medicare is, itself, a big
government program and a very popular one. The attack against ``Big
Government HMOs'' in the Gore plan may be a simple attempt at
inoculation. Bush's plan envisions a greater role by HMOs and other
private plans in Medicare, and Republicans have been bracing for a
Democratic assault against it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are offering themselves as guardians of
Medicare, portraying the Republicans as bent on privatizing the
system. With a month and a half to go to Election Day, the
advertising debate is already reminiscent of the last two big
health policy struggles __ over Medicare restructuring in 1995-96,
and over national health insurance in 1993-94.

GRANT, SHAQ TO BE REUNITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The summer of the Los Angeles Lakers'
discontent is finally, mercifully about to end with the best result
they could have hoped for: a trade that ships out unhappy Glen Rice
and brings back a desperately needed starting power forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, New York Knicks and Seattle Sonics _ with help from
the Phoenix Suns _ have revived the blockbuster trade that will
send Rice to New York, future Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing to
Seattle and Horace Grant to the Lakers, sources told the Daily News
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several details were being worked out, but the trade _
potentially the largest in NBA history _ could be finalized by this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty close,'' an NBA source with knowledge of the deal
said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, Knicks and Sonics have, of course, traveled this
road before. Several incarnations of this trade have already been
proposed and rejected over the last two months. But the pieces
finally fell into place once the Suns got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix would send Luc Longley to the Knicks, who demanded a
viable post player in any deal involving Ewing. Longley would give
the Knicks insurance while they attempt to pry Dikembe Mutombo from
Atlanta. The Suns would get rid of Longley's bloated contract,
which had four years and $24 million remaining.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers _ stymied in countless attempts to land a
starting power forward _ would get Seattle's Grant, a 6-10 veteran
who won three championships in Chicago under Lakers coach Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle would also send center Greg Foster to the Lakers,
filling their other glaring need _ a stand-in for Shaquille O'Neal,
who played a career-high 40 minutes a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, the Lakers would unload seldom-used Travis
Knight, who takes the last four years and $15 million of his
contract to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several minor players and draft picks would also change hands to
make the deal work under the NBA's complex salary-cap rules, and
the Lakers will probably end up with another player or two.
Generally speaking, each team involved must acquire roughly the
same amount of salary it trades away _ in this case, $14 million
apiece, the value of Ewing's salary this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had threatened to sign a one-year deal with the Chicago
Bulls, leaving the Lakers empty-handed. But at age 33, Rice was
determined to get a long-term contract, and for that he needed the
Lakers to orchestrate a sign-and-trade. The Lakers never ceased
efforts to find Rice a new home, provided they could swap him for
frontcourt help.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will sign Rice to a multiyear deal, starting in the
$8 million range, then trade him to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a mildly humorous sideshow, the Bulls planned a press
conference Wednesday to announce their signing of Rice _ then,
realizing they had been used as leverage, issued a terse statement
later in the day saying they were no longer interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute glitch _ and this has been a glitch-filled
summer _ the Lakers will have satisfied all of their offseason
goals. They rid themselves of Rice, who never found a comfortable
role after arriving in a March 1999 trade for Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell; and they acquired two big bodies to take take some of the
rebounding and defensive load off of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   They now boast a potentially formidable starting lineup: league
MVP O'Neal at center, former All-Star Grant at power foward,
All-Star Kobe Bryant at small forward and a backcourt of Ron Harper
and Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Grant should mesh perfectly with the Lakers. He
played five seasons under Jackson with the Bulls, is proficient in
the triangle offense, a prolific rebounder and defensive-minded.
Grant also played two seasons alongside O'Neal with the Orlando
Magic. The two are good friends and O'Neal has openly lobbied
management to acquire Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has averaged 12.1 points and 8.6 rebounds in a 13-year
career. He averaged 8.1 points and 7.8 rebounds last season, his
only season in Seattle, while often playing out of position at
center.
</P>
<P>
   The budget-minded Lakers also like Grant's contract: he's due a
manageable $5.95 million and is a free agent at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has two years and $3.5 million remaining on his contract.
The well-traveled center, who played four seasons with Utah before
joining Seattle last year, has averaged 4.1 points and 2.6 rebounds
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The trade comes just 13 days before the Lakers open training
camp and ends a long and particularly frustrating offseason. They
failed in numerous prior attempts to deal Rice for, among others,
Christian Laettner, Toni Kukoc, Anthony Mason and P.J. Brown. They
tried to sign free agents Kendall Gill and John Amaechi but were
turned down by both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they faced the prospect of having Rice walk away as a
free agent, leaving them nothing to show for Jones, one of the top
shooting guards in the league, and Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks, the trade paves the way for a second deal that
will land them another of the league's top centers. With Ewing's
salary off the books and Rice aboard, New York plans to package
either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston with Marcus Camby in a
trade for the Hawks' Mutombo, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ewing, the Sonics finally have a formidable, if aging, post
player to complement All-NBA guard Gary Payton.

COCA-COLA OFFICE IN SPAIN RAIDED IN INQUIRY INTO BUSINESS
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an early morning raid Wednesday, the Spanish authorities
seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola and its bottlers,
investigating complaints that the companies had used illegal
business tactics to keep rival soft drinks off the country's
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on complaints filed last year by PepsiCo and La Casera, a
Spanish beverage company, officials from the Ministry of Economy
appeared without warning at Coke's corporate offices in Madrid,
where they spent several hours looking through records pertaining
to the company's competitive practices. Investigators also
confiscated documents from three independent companies that bottle
and distribute Coke across Spain, responding to complaints that
they, too, had pressed stores and restaurants not to carry other
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking for evidence that might substantiate
competitors' contentions that Coke either required supermarkets and
other businesses to promote and sell its drinks exclusively or
offered them cash incentives and unusual discounts to do so. In
June, Coke lost a lawsuit brought in Texas by nine Royal Crown
bottlers accusing the company of engaging in similar practices,
resulting in a $15.6 million judgment against Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has been investigated by antitrust authorities across the
globe. Inquiries are under way in more than 10 countries, mostly in
Europe, and raids have become commonplace enough that Coke
officials in Spain described them Wednesday as ``established
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a pattern here,'' said Ben Deutsch, a Coke
spokesman. ``We believe through our experience in other countries
that our competitors are more interested in these legal procedures
than developing marketing programs that meet consumers' needs.''

   NEW YORK _ After a summer's worth of trying and one
embarrassingly public botched trade, the New York Knicks have
finally parted with Patrick Ewing, the cornerstone of the franchise
for the past 15 years. A complicated four-team, 12-player deal that
was largely orchestrated by the Knicks and Ewing's agent, David
Falk, will send the future Hall of Fame center to the Seattle
SuperSonics, general manager Scott Layden announced Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to nearly a full roster of players, the Knicks
will receive Glen Rice, the sharp shooting Los Angeles Lakers
forward whom they have long coveted, Lakers backup center Travis
Knight and Phoenix Suns center Luc Longley. In addition, they will
receive guard Vernon Maxwell, forwards Lazaro Borrell and Vladimir
Stepania, a first-round draft pick and two second-round picks in
2001 from Seattle and the Lakers' first-round pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the trade has the Knicks sending Chris Dudley, their
backup center, and a first-round pick in 2001 to Phoenix, and the
Lakers receiving Horace Grant, Greg Foster, Emanual Davis and Chuck
Person from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The historic deal was Layden's first significant move with the
Knicks, and the implication is that Ewing, who desperately wanted
out of New York, forced his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that he was looking for a change and when he
requested a trade, we respected his request,'' Layden said in a
statement. ``It was important in doing so, however, that we had the
ability to add value, and with Glen and his all-star credentials,
as well as two veteran big men and draft picks, we believe we have
done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a three-time all-star, has averaged 20.2 points per game
over his 11-year career and is third on the league's all-time list
of 3-pointers made. The Lakers signed him to a multiyear contract
worth approximately $10 million a year before trading him to the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the trade is evidence of the insuperable gap
that had developed between Ewing and the Knicks. Ewing, who for 15
years had toiled admirably, if fruitlessly, for an NBA
championship, is not likely to win his elusive title with the
Sonics, who have the superior Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers to
conquer. Nor is he likely to receive the two-year contract
extension he reportedly wanted the Knicks to give him.
</P>
<P>
   And the Knicks realize that this is not a good deal for them
either. If they do not pull off a subsequent trade, one that would
land them a frontline power forward or center, they will enter
training camp having dropped several notches. Longley, a
7-foot-2-inch veteran who won three championships with Michael
Jordan's Chicago Bulls, is mediocre at best. He averaged just 6.3
points, 4.5 rebounds and 19.7 minutes as the Suns' starter last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the Knicks do not follow with another more attractive
move, their starting lineup could look something like this: Longley
at center; Larry Johnson and Latrell Sprewell at the forwards; and
Allan Houston and Charlie Ward at the guards. Rice apparently would
come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine Rice being happy in that role because
he complained about his lack of involvement in the Los Angeles
offense during the Lakers' march to the championship in June.
Despite starting and averaging 15.9 points and earning his first
NBA title, Rice was unhappy as the club's third offensive option
behind Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's complaints, plus the fact that the Knicks hardly need
another all-star swingman to go along with Latrell Sprewell and
Allan Houston, has fueled speculation that they will make a second
trade with the Atlanta Hawks involving one of their stars. The most
prominent theory is that the Knicks will send Houston and perhaps
Marcus Camby to the Hawks for all-star center Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   But one Eastern Conference official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Wednesday he understood that the Knicks would trade
Sprewell instead of Houston to Atlanta. Both the Knicks and the
Hawks have denied that such a trade is in motion, and, in a
statement, coach Jeff Van Gundy said he looks forward to playing
the three perimeter stars together. ``Glen Rice has had a
tremendous career and we are happy to have him,'' Van Gundy said.
``We look forward to Allan, Latrell and Glen forming a very dynamic
perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony between Ewing and the Knicks reportedly began
earlier this summer when the club refused to grant him a two-year
contract extension. Layden said last month that the two parties had
never discussed an extension and that Ewing and the Knicks would
work together to find a trade that benefited both the player and
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to Ewing and the Knicks said that Ewing was
uncomfortable as the third star behind Sprewell and Houston and
that he had grown tired of being blamed for the Knicks' inability
to win a championship. The gulf between Ewing and New York's media
and fans was never more apparent than last month, when it was first
announced that he would be traded to Seattle in the foiled
four-team, 13-player deal. After he was criticized heavily by the
media and fans, it seemed nearly impossible for Ewing to return for
the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Ewing will forever be a New York Knick in the minds of
everyone associated with this franchise _ his contributions to this
team have been unparalleled,'' Layden said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This trade is a spinoff of that earlier deal that also involved
the Knicks, Sonics and Lakers and collapsed when the Detroit
Pistons pulled out at the last moment. That trade, which was
supposed to take place on Aug. 22, also would have sent Ewing to
Seattle, but the Knicks would have received Seattle's Vin Baker and
Rice in return.
</P>
<P>
   After that fell apart, the Knicks, along with Ewing and Falk,
worked feverishly to put together another trade. After exploring a
possible Ewing-for-Juwan Howard trade with the Washington Wizards,
the Knicks rekindled talks with Seattle and Los Angeles two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions began with the Sonics and Lakers proposing a
three-team deal in which the Knicks would receive Rice and Knight,
Seattle would get Ewing and the Lakers would get Grant. The Knicks
would not accept the deal as it was proposed, and immediately began
searching for a fourth team that would enable them to secure a more
established big man.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rice was a key part of the deal, any semblance of the
first proposed trade seemed dead as recently as Wednesday
afternoon. In recent days, it had been reported that Rice, a free
agent, would sign a one-year, $7.5 million contract with the
Chicago Bulls, which would put an end to all of the complicated
deals in which he and Ewing were a part. But in an unexpected move,
the Bulls released a brief statement saying they were no longer
interested in signing Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hallam, Chicago's senior director of media services, said
that one of Rice's representatives contacted the Bulls in the
afternoon to say that he would not sign with the club and would
instead pursue other options.

THE YANKS KEEP LOOSE BUT ALSO KEEP LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ If their latest September slump is causing any of the
Yankees to fret, it is impossible to ascertain. A few of them sung
along to the clubhouse stereo before Wednesday night's game _ to
the tune of the old television show ``Good Times'' _ while others
gawked at the most recent shipment of maple bats.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed before their pregame workout while Charlie
Wonsowicz, a batting-practice pitcher, uncannily imitated some of
the players. Tense? Hardly. A few losses in September? Been there,
done that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees went out and got hammered by Toronto again, 7-2,
their sixth loss in seven games, a stretch in which they have been
outscored by 57-18. The Blue Jays ripped David Cone (4-13) for all
their runs in the first four innings. Although their lead over the
Blue Jays in the American League East is still a solid five and a
half games, with 12 games to play, the Yankees are, at the very
least, complicating their path through the playoffs with all of
these defeats. Their magic number for clinching is seven.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, the Yankees were closing on the Chicago White
Sox for the best record in the league, a distinction that merits
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But the Yankees
(85-65) are four games behind the White Sox (89-61), pending
Chicago's game with Detroit Wednesday night, and probably won't
catch them, and now Seattle (86-66) is only one game behind the
Yankees in the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre called a meeting after Tuesday's debacle and
chastised the players for their poor effort. He probably wasn't
upset with the effort Wednesday night; the Yankees lost because
Cone was terrible, in his second start since coming back from a
dislocated shoulder, and the Yankees' offense is in a rut.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez is hitless in his last 21 at-bats,
and his average is down to .258. Third baseman Scott Brosius does
not have an RBI in his last nine games. Center fielder Bernie
Williams, nagged for the better part of a month by injury, has one
homer since Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees mustered nine hits against the Jays Wednesday night,
but rather than building rallies, they broke them down. Chuck
Knoblauch was thrown out stealing in the first inning after drawing
a leadoff walk. They had first and second and nobody out in the
sixth and Martinez bounced into a double play. Brosius hit into a
double play in the seventh. They had two on and no out in the
eighth and couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   But the deficit was very deep by then because of Cone's
ineffectiveness. He missed only one start after injuring his
nonthrowing shoulder, but Cone's stuff is not as good as it was
before the dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Cone let the leadoff batter reach base in three of the four
innings he started. Shannon Stewart doubled to start the first and
was hit by a pitch to open the third, and Cone walked Tony Batista
to lead off the fourth, with the Yankees trailing, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   After Darrin Fletcher singled to advance Batista to third base,
Dwight Gooden began stretching in the bullpen, and the coach Tony
Cloninger rose from his seat and stood by the bullpen phone,
waiting for it to ring _ and it did, after Mickey Morandini singled
home Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Alex Gonzalez bounced a line drive over the
wall in left-center field, and Cone was removed. His final line:
three and two-thirds innings, six hits, seven runs. Only Torre
knows how he feels about having to pick between Cone and a couple
of rookie left-handers when he fills out his playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got 13 days here to go,'' said catcher Jorge
Posada before the game. ``If the playoffs started today, we'd be
ready. We know how to play there, and when it comes down to the
playoffs it's all about the team winning, and I think we know how
to do that.''

OIL AT $37.20; DEMAND, DIPLOMACY AND POLITICS INTENSE
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of crude oil climbed again on Wednesday amid
increasing concern about the impact of the rising price on the
world's economy.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for October
delivery jumped as high as $37.80 a barrel but gave back some of
its gains late in the day, ending up 69 cents at a 10-year high of
$37.20. Wednesday was the last day for the October futures
contract, a day on which trading is often volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The price of heating oil for October delivery ended at $1.0179 a
gallon, down 0.12 cent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil for November delivery rose 23 cents, to $35.23 a barrel. It
becomes the current, or spot, contract on Thursday. The immediate
demand for oil has been strong _ so much so that the price of the
near-term futures contract has been higher than the price for
delivery in later months. If that kind of demand does not change,
the price of the November contract can be expected to soon catch up
with that of the expired October contract.
</P>
<P>
   The low level of supplies, both for crude oil and distillate,
which are used to make home heating oil, is pushing the price
higher right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is expected to decide in a few days
whether to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a step rarely taken and one of a few developments that
could put downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is expected to add to the growing
political debate over oil prices when he makes a campaign speech on
Thursday outlining his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The high price of oil will also be an important topic at a
gathering this weekend of finance ministers of the International
Monetary Fund in Prague. These discussions could put more pressure
on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase
production.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute reported after the close of
trading on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by just over
two million barrels last week, to 286.6 million barrels. That is
22.2 million barrels, or 7.2 percent, below the level of a year
ago. And while distillate inventories rose 1.25 million barrels,
they are still 19.4 percent below last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Wednesday that he needed ``a few more
days'' before deciding whether to release oil from the
571-million-barrel petroleum reserve. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
who has been pushing the administration to open the oil reserve,
spoke on Wednesday with Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers
and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the meeting, in which he assessed the
outlook for releasing oil, Schumer said: ``Those who were for it
are more strongly for it, and those who were against it are now
believing that it should be done. They didn't tell me this, but for
the first time, I believe that odds are greater than 50-50'' that
oil will be released from the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France
called for a meeting of members of the OPEC countries, the 15
nations of the European Union and the United States. He said France
would propose the meeting in Prague this weekend in conjunction
with the IMF meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, after a speech at Johns Hopkins University, declined to
say whether he wanted to release oil from the petroleum reserve or
whether he supported France's proposal. But he did say that oil
would be a topic this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously watching developments in the oil market very
closely,'' he told reporters. The price of oil, he said, ``is one
factor bearing on the global economic outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   But Summers added, ``I share the overall judgment of the IMF
that the global economy is healthy and in many ways healthier than
it has been in some number of years.''
