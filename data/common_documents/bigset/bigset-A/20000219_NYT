Astros seek more than Central title
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Now it becomes as much mental as physical.
It's not just the doing, but the believing.
</P>
<P>
   Expectation is, after all, the burden that has brought so many
contenders to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Astros have backed themselves into a corner with
three consecutive National League Central titles, we will see how
well they cope with one of the more difficult aspects of the game _
success.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, three division titles in a row raises the bar, and three
straight times of flaming out in the first round of the playoffs
brings an entirely different kind of atmosphere to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tension,'' said Larry Dierker, the jangly, loose-jointed
manager who looks anything but tight standing behind the clubhouse
under a bright Florida sun in his new brick-red cap, white T-shirt
and a pair of baggy black shorts that are long enough to make him
look like a middle-aged NBA wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly pitchers and catchers who will hold their first
workouts this morning, and for a short while the sound of baseballs
popping into leather gloves will have its usual therapeutic effect
after another winter's chill. But in a few days the regulars will
be here, and that's when you'll be able to feel the hum of tension
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Not that easy
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody on our team underestimates how difficult
it is just to get into the playoffs three years in a row, what it
means to be able to go the distance, survive the ups and downs of a
season and come out on top each time,'' Dierker said. ``Maybe the
fans do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from April through September and there are so
many things that can go wrong, so many challenges. It's an
achievement, it really is, to have been able to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, we know it's not good enough anymore. Not
for our fans and not for us. The idea is to get into the playoffs
and then to go on, and that's where you definitely feel the raised
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   It's there, no question about it. It hangs in the air even on
the earliest days of spring training, and it is almost tangible, an
animal that stalks around the clubhouse growling its presence.
</P>
<P>
   As if losing three straight times in the playoffs weren't enough
of a burden, the Astros will be moving into a new home at Enron
Field, where everything from the tickets to parking to the hot dogs
will be more expensive. And you can be sure that added cost will
carry a price of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the talk on the street, on the radio shows,'' Dierker
said. ``Since we're moving into a new ballpark, a lot of people
expect that there's so much more money to spend on the team. You
say you have to work within a budget, and it doesn't compute to
some. All they know is you've won before, and now you should win
more, go farther.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 miles away from Osceola County Stadium down Highway 192
_ the schlockiest street in America _ the Atlanta Braves have their
camp at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex and their own set of
different expectations and disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Roll with the changes
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say our goal as an organization is to get to where
the Braves are in the National League,'' Dierker said. ``They come
into each season with the full expectation that they should win
their division and they should get to the World Series, and they
usually do. But how many times have they won it all? Once? That's
their disappointment. Yet they come back each year and never seem
to lose their edge. They don't dwell on the past. They look ahead,
and they take care of business again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge facing the Astros, not looking back too
long at their failures in the postseason and not looking too far
ahead at another shot at October redemption. They are a different
team this season. Mike Hampton and Carl Everett are gone, and
Octavio Dotel and Roger Cedeno must show they can take their place.
Derek Bell is gone, and Moises Alou comes back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can afford to stand still and keep bringing
the same team back,'' Dierker said. ``If you do and still come up
short, you run the risk of being stagnant, and one day you find you
have to change it all. That's what happened to us in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I'd say look at the Braves. Over the years they've let
go of (Charlie) Leibrandt, (Denny) Neagle, (David) Justice, (Jeff)
Blauser, (Fred) McGriff, (Mark) Lemke and more. They identify the
guys who are the best players, keep the core and move on. It sends
a message. It says you always have to perform. It makes for a
creative tension. They expect to win. That's where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Full of great expectations and all of the pitfalls that come
with them.

NETS HOLD ON TO BEAT HEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Kendall Gill, his eyes wide open and his
thoughts racing, could not believe his good fortune. He had just
missed the rim completely on a heavily contested, somewhat
ill-advised layup and given the Miami Heat a chance to tie the game
with less than one minute left to play.
</P>
<P>
   But before he could get down on himself, he saw Tim Hardaway,
Miami's star point guard, driving into the lane against Stephon
Marbury. Gill, a student of basketball theft, knew a steal was
imminent. He was stunned at how easy Hardaway made it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy just put the ball where I could get it,'' Gill said. ``I
don't know why the guys put the ball where I can get it or try to
even drive into me. I want to be like Deion Sanders. I don't even
want them to run offense towards me. Sometimes they do and they're
successful, but most of the time I try and make them pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill made the Heat and its exasperated coach, Pat Riley, pay
severely Friday night. The New Jersey Nets forward knocked the ball
away from Hardaway and into the hands of Kerry Kittles, who then
fed Gill for a breakaway dunk that gave the Nets a four-point lead
with 46.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Though three Miami timeouts followed, Gill's steal and slam
essentially ended the game, as the Nets closed out the Heat for a
91-84 victory before 16,494 appreciative fans at Continental Arena.
It was the Nets' second victory in as many meetings with the
Atlantic Division-leading Heat, and their third straight victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very satisfying win,'' said Nets coach Don Casey, whose
team broke a two-game losing streak to improve to 20-31. ``We held
the lead. We just hope this can become a constant.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Riley, the former New York Knicks coach known for
putting his players through grueling practices, kept his cool on
the sidelines. But beneath his chic appearance, he was seething.
The Heat, now just one-half game ahead of the Knicks with a 31-19
record, lost to the woeful Chicago Bulls on Thursday. Four of
Miami's losses have come to the Bulls and Nets, who have just 31
victories between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, we held Chicago to 36 percent shooting,'' Riley
said. ``Tonight, the Nets shot 38 percent and we lose. Right now,
our offense is stuck in the mud. Turnovers are the difference.
Turnovers and free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, which led by 22-12 midway through the first quarter,
but trailed, 50-41, at halftime and 70-63 heading into the fourth
quarter, committed 24 turnovers against the Nets and made just 11
of 17 free throws. Hardaway, who led Miami with 18 points, had six
turnovers, including three in the last 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, ranked seventh in the league in steals, made five steals
to go with his 18 points and five rebounds. His defense, which
keyed the first-half surge that gave the Nets control of the game,
is a big reason Riley covets his services.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, believing that Gill can successfully guard the Knicks'
Allan Houston in the playoffs, has tried to trade for him, but
Miami is not offering players who are enticing enough to the Nets.
Gill is in the last year of a contract that pays him $5.6 million
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Never lacking optimism, the Nets believe Friday night's victory
proves that they are indeed a playoff team, one that can beat
anyone in the Eastern Conference. The key Friday night was their
defense, which made 12 steals, and their heart, which enabled them
to overcome being outshot _ Miami hit 47 percent of its attempts _
and outrebounded dramatically (51-35).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of collapsing after building a lead, the Nets
persevered. Miami opened the fourth with a 12-2 run to go ahead by
75-72, but the Nets refused to wilt, as they had done against
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Washington, Seattle and numerous other
teams. Marbury, who played poorly throughout the first three
quarters, was huge in the fourth, hitting 5 of 6 free throws to
score nine of his 18 points. He hit two straight free throws to
give the Nets the lead for good, 82-80, then followed with a nifty
running jumper to push the lead to four with 1 minute 25 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn, who led the Nets with 19 points and 11 rebounds,
played one of his most aggressive games of the season. He attacked
the basket powerfully rather than attempting soft finger rolls, and
though many of his shots did not fall, he drew fouls and hit 7 of 9
free throws. Van Horn's sudden toughness also helped slow down
Alonzo Mourning, who until Friday night had been a Nets killer of
late. Mourning had averaged 26 points, 15 rebounds and six blocks
in his last four games against the Nets, but Friday night, with the
rookie Evan Eschmeyer and Jim McIlvaine pounding on him, he had
just 15 points, 11 rebounds and three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong, quick guy,'' said Eschmeyer, who had five
points, five rebounds and a block in 12 minutes. ``You just have to
go out there and not back down. If you back down and you're scared
a little bit, he's going to kick your butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Nets did the kicking. &QL;

Wagner to play it safe with elbow
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Billy Wagner was back in that spot again, the
same one he occupied in 1996 when he was told to move his
belongings to the minor-league clubhouse despite an eye-opening
performance in the big-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Wagner was somewhat let down, especially
considering several veterans told him they thought he belonged on
the big-league club. But general manager Gerry Hunsicker's cautious
approach with prospects called for a little more minor-league
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pitcher Doug Drabek, who lockered near Wagner at the
time, put his hand on the young lefthander's knee and said: ``Don't
pout and don't whine. Bust your butt, and you'll be right back.''
</P>
<P>
   By midseason, Drabek looked like a prophet. Wagner joined the
Astros down the stretch in 1996, inherited the closer's role and
saved nine games, ending all thoughts of being a starter, the role
in which he flourished during his minor-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Four years and 101 saves later, Wagner was able to sit in that
same spot with a grin and an inner confidence that only comes with
a sense of belonging. The one-pitch wonder of 1996 will enter the
2000 season as the most feared closer in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to face him; I mean nobody,'' Astros catcher Tony
Eusebio said. ``Before, they knew they were going to get that
fastball, and they still could barely hit it. Now, he's got that
slider. Now, he's even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, 28, has a tough act to follow if he intends to top his
1999 season. He was 4-1 last year with a 1.57 ERA and 39 saves,
earning him the Rolaids Fireman of the Year award in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed runs in only seven of his 66 appearances, including
just one run after July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are filthy numbers,'' Astros reliever Trever Miller
said. ``God gave him a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift, of course, is Wagner's left arm, a lightning bolt
waiting to strike. Toward the end of last season, the electricity
in Wagner's left arm began to flicker, and it flamed out in the
final game of the Astros' Division Series loss to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker ordered Wagner to warm up in the
bullpen in anticipation of facing lefthanded slugger Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw three pitches in the bullpen, and I had to quit,''
Wagner said. ``It just didn't feel right. Who knows what would have
happened? Just holding the ball hurt. I never felt anything like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's strained elbow most likely would have prevented him
from pitching any more in the playoffs had the Astros advanced, and
the effects of recovery will linger into spring training. Although
Wagner will not be on a special program, he is not expected to see
as much game action as in past exhibition seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to baby him,'' Hunsicker said. ``He'll go
through the same routine as everyone else. We just may not be as
aggressive with him once the games start. We're going to keep an
eye on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner believes he needs only about five or six innings of work
this spring to be ready for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good thing about closers,'' Hunsicker said. ``It
doesn't take them much work to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will have to force Wagner to be cautious. He realizes his
value to the team and is mindful of the fact his health is a key
ingredient to the Astros' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt pretty good over the past couple days, but I'm still
going to take it real slow,'' Wagner said. ``It's something I'm
going to have to watch. I'm going to play it right. I won't overdo
it. I'm not going to be throwing two days in a row or doing
anything foolish like that. The point is to be ready by opening
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the Astros open the season at Pittsburgh's Three
Rivers Stadium, where Wagner first noticed the pain in his elbow.
He wasn't able to close out the game, costing himself a chance at
the extra save that would have netted him 40 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner is hardly one to fret over the one that got away. He
was too busy enjoying the best season of his career. In addition to
making the All-Star team for the first time, Wagner broke his own
major-league record for strikeouts per nine innings with 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about strikeouts until (setup man) Jay Powell
and those guys in the bullpen start talking about it,'' said
Wagner, who consistently throws 97 mph. ``When it's all said and
done, the numbers will speak for themselves, so I really don't pay
too much attention to them. To me, the real joy is just being in
the big leagues.''

 ARTIE AIDALA, 91, JUDGE AT FIRST ALI-FRAZIER BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Artie Aidala, a New York boxing judge for almost four
decades who was at ringside for the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier
``fight of the century'' in 1971, died Tuesday at his home in
Brooklyn. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   From the early 1940s until the late 1970s, Aidala was a familiar
presence at championship bouts at Madison Square Garden and Yankee
Stadium, as well as at the almost-nightly cards in long-gone fight
clubs. In judging bouts, he would rest his elbows on the ring apron
and put his fingers in his ears to block out the crowd noise, lest
his judgment be clouded by fan reaction to a punch that did not
land.
</P>
<P>
   Among the title bouts he judged were Rocky Marciano's unanimous
decision over Ezzard Charles in Marciano's heavyweight title
defense at Yankee Stadium in June 1954 and the Ali-Frazier fight at
Madison Square Garden in March 1971, a battle of unbeaten fighters
in which Frazier retained his heavyweight title on a unanimous
decision. Aidala scored it nine rounds to six.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano would not have retired undefeated if Aidala's view had
prevailed in Marciano's nontitle bout with Roland LaStarza in March
1950. Marciano won a 10-round split decision, with Aidala having
scored the fight for LaStarza. Some time afterward, as Aidala's
son, Louis, recalled it, Marciano encountered Aidala at a function
and quipped, ``Artie, you're lucky I never caught you in a back
alley.'' When the two boxers fought in a title bout in September
1953, Marciano knocked out LaStarza in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   Aidala grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the youngest of
11 children of Sicilian immigrants. He sold newspapers as a
youngster, then boxed in community programs for newsboys.
</P>
<P>
   Aidala's duties as a fight judge and occasionally as a referee
were his part-time jobs. He was a full-time photographer for The
New York Herald Tribune and later for The New York Daily Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Louis, of Brooklyn, Aidala is survived
by a daughter, Lorraine Ambrosio, of Syosset, N.Y., and four
grandchildren.

PATHOGENS CARRIED BY MUDDY BOOTS SUSPECTED IN
AMPHIBIAN  EXTINCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surprising new suspect was implicated Friday in
the hunt for what's causing global destruction of frogs,
salamanders and other amphibians: dirty boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say take only pictures and leave only footprints, but it
turns out those footprints may well be deadly,'' said Elizabeth
Davidson, a biologist at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   She was part of a panel of amphibian experts Friday at the
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, which continues through Tuesday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   One waterborne virus that commonly infects amphibians can
survive out of water for at least a week, studies have shown. A
fungus may also be causing health problems for some amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   If these pathogens can travel in mud caked on boots, it's
possible that scientists and ecotourists who seek out the most
pristine places on the planet may unwittingly be hastening the
demise of rare species _ the very animals the scientists are
struggling to save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about that,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why she and other scientists have taken to washing their
shoes thoroughly in bleach after every trip into the field. The
experts are recommending that recreational hikers do the same,
particularly those encountering hard-to-reach streams and ponds. A
10 percent solution of ordinary household bleach is thought to do
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no place on Earth seems to be immune to amphibian
destruction, often on a scale far beyond known population swings in
nature. Dozens of species are now thought to be extinct since mass
die-offs that were first noted in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Many possible factors have been identified besides pathogens,
including DNA damage from ozone depletion, climate changes,
parasites, habitat loss and introduction of exotic predators. Most
experts now suspect the problem is caused by an interaction of
several factors, perhaps changing the host's biology to make
animals more susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Blustein of Oregon State University is looking at the
possibility that some species lack a natural defense against
ultraviolet radiation, making them vulnerable where ozone is
depleted. Studies have shown sharp declines in fog cover even in
the depths of rain forests, possibly the result of global,
human-induced climate change.
</P>
<P>
   A complete answer to the puzzle seems to be a long way off.
Unfortunately, there may not be many amphibians left _ other than
perhaps the common bullfrog, which seems to thrive wherever it has
been introduced _ by the time science has the solution.
</P>
<P>
   So even if dirty boots _ and other sources of possible
contamination _ turn out to be a false alarm, scientists reason
that they have to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're all scared of,'' said Marvalee Wake, the
head of the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of
California at Berkeley, who was in the audience at Friday's
session. ``It's truly a crisis.''

FEINSTEIN NOT LETTING UP, BUT SHE CAN BREATHE EASIER THIS
TIME  AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARK SIMON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne
Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be
opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and
virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been biding her time during the primary campaign,
confidently preparing to take on Rep. Tom Campbell, the presumptive
Republican nominee, in November.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be as good as it gets in politics, but this is as
good as it has ever been for Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know me,'' she told the Chronicle during an interview
last weekend. ``We take the public trust very seriously, and I
think people believe, by and large, that I've honored my
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from 10 years ago, when Feinstein, now 67, was
running for governor and was booed at a state Democratic convention
for declaring her support for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was the outsider then, running for the nomination
against Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who had the support of
virtually every major state Democrat. She won the primary and lost
narrowly to Republican Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she ran for the Senate. She defeated John
Seymour, Wilson's hand-picked successor, and got more votes than
any Senate candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, because she was finishing Wilson's incomplete term,
Feinstein was on the ballot again, running for re-election against
Republican Rep. Michael Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington spent $30 million attacking Feinstein and came within
163,000 votes of defeating her.
</P>
<P>
   But today she holds a commanding lead in the polls: 5 to 1 over
Campbell in the most recent Field Poll, more than 2 to 1 over all
Republican opponents combined. Her support cuts across party lines,
cuts across ethnic and gender lines and runs the gamut of the
political spectrum. ``She's perceived as carrying herself with
dignity and grace, as a senator who's knowledgeable, on the job,
paying attention to what's going on,'' said pollster Mervin Field.
</P>
<P>
   A centrist who snubs the outer edges of political ideology,
Feinstein ``has not done or said anything that turns the California
public off,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Feinstein even seized the middle ground during the
impeachment controversy, expressing outrage at President Clinton's
personal conduct while maintaining support for his policies.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``the perfect position,'' said Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dianne has always appealed to the same middle everybody talked
about Clinton appealing to,'' said veteran Democratic strategist
Darry Sragow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took people a long time to figure that out because she was
the mayor of San Francisco, and they assumed she had to be a
liberal. She's always been a centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, she has benefited from the public perception that
Clinton's centrist policies have been effective in spurring the
nation's economic boom, and that she has been a consistent
supporter of legislation to drive down the federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   She also has benefited from one major centrist move by Clinton _
turning gun control into a tough-on-crime position, which Feinstein
has embraced as a central issue to her legislative career.
</P>
<P>
   She is at her most passionate when decrying the ``trickle-down
of guns to children'' and the ``nation awash in guns,'' and vowing
to push through yet more legislation that will regulate the sale
and distribution of handguns and assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity in California is one reason she is frequently
mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore,
should he win the Democratic presidential nomination. She would be
permitted to run for both vice president and senator on the same
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has endorsed Gore, but she declined to comment on the
possibility of running with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to it. If it were to happen, I'd
certainly think about it,'' she said. Feinstein also recalled that
she was mentioned in the same way in 1984, when then-Democratic
nominee Walter Mondale selected New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as
his vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Feinstein is sitting on a campaign treasury of more
than $2.6 million. She also has in place a veteran team of campaign
advisers, many of whom have been with her through all her campaigns
of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Her only opposition in the Democratic primary is Emeryville
attorney Michael Schmier, who admits he has no money with which to
mount a challenge against Feinstein. He is running largely to
protest the dwindling number of appellate cases that are published
for public review.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's time has been spent preparing for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her campaign spent nearly $900,000 on an intense
telemarketing campaign, signing up small donors in the $5 to $10
range who also will commit to doing volunteer work when it comes
time to turn out voters at the end of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the telemarketing effort has
raised more than $1.1 million in small donations and has generated
a list of more than 125,000 people who will serve as a grassroots
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to figure out if we're going to go on TV in
the primary. We haven't made that decision,'' said Kuwata.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein campaign officials say they want to see what kind of
advertising Campbell airs. He is expected to begin a statewide TV
advertising effort late this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell began his campaign with a call for replacing the income
tax with a national sales tax and allowing local governments to
initiate programs to provide free drugs to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   His unconventional proposals mystified Feinstein and her top
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of a strange candidate,'' said Feinstein media
consultant Bill Carrick. ``I don't take him for granted, but I
think the campaign will play itself out in less than traditional
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be much to the evident relief of Feinstein, who still
has unpleasant memories of the the race against Huffington, who ran
ads on television all but two weeks of the 11-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington's blitz began in January, when he bought a full
minute of TV prime time during the telecast of the Winter Olympics
and attacked Feinstein for her vote supporting the Clinton
administration's budget deficit reduction package.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was watching at home, and ``my gut went, `Oooohhh,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how her gut reacted when she saw that Campbell began this
campaign with a call for a national sales tax and a drug giveaway,
Feinstein said, ``My gut relaxed.''

BROWNE'S NICE WEEKEND CUT SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Olin Browne considers the PGA Tour's West Coast
swing to be the highlight of his season, and one can only imagine
how much more he would enjoy it if he could stick around for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who didn't play golf until he reached Occidental College
at age 19, has had moderate success during his six full years on
the tour but missed his third consecutive cut Friday at the Nissan
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Browne birdied No. 9, his final hole of the day, to get back to
even par for the tournament but fell one shot short of the cut.
Browne, who shot a 1-under 70 on Thursday, birdied No. 1 and No. 5
but bogeyed No. 3 and nearly came apart soon after as he finished
on the front side.
</P>
<P>
   Bogeys on No. 7 and No. 8 put him at 1-over for the tournament,
and even the birdie on No. 9 could not save his week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing out here,'' said Browne, 40, who won the
Colonial last year and the Greater Hartford Open in 1998. ``This
course is great, and that's another reason why I'm a little steamed
at myself right now, because I could have played better.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne finished 51st on the tour's money list last year, and is
47th this year because of a strong start. He tied for 21st at the
Mercedes and tied for 34th at the Sony, both in Hawaii, and tied
for 16th at the Bob Hope Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks were not as kind. Browne failed to break par
in five rounds at Phoenix and Pebble Beach, and although he shot a
1-under 69 on Thursday, Browne left Southern California rather
displeased with his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same story now for a few weeks,'' Browne said.
``Great shots, but no putter. I had that problem both days out
here, and the good shots don't mean much if you can't make the
putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as playing in Southern California, how much better
can you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Ace in the hole: Craig Stadler recorded the first hole-in-one of
the tournament when he aced the 175-yard No. 6 with a 7-iron.
</P>
<P>
   The shot likely allowed Stadler to stick around for the weekend.
The former USC All-American and 1996 Nissan champion shot a 1-over
72 in the first round. The ace put him at 3-under for the second
round, but he played the next 11 holes at par.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-4 No. 18, Stadler laid up with his second shot and
missed an eight-foot putt for par to finish at 1-under through two
rounds. Stadler displayed strong iron play throughout the second
round but became frustrated after missing birdie putts from six
feet or less on No. 9 and No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the future?: Two familiar faces made climbs at Riviera
on Friday, as Fred Couples and Corey Pavin, each two-time
tournament winners, put themselves in position for another possible
weekend run.
</P>
<P>
   Pavin, champion in 1994 and 1995 and a former star at UCLA, shot
a 6-under 65 on Friday to reach 4-under, five shots back of leaders
Bob Tway and Greg Chalmers.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who won in 1990 and 1992, followed up Thursday's 1-over
72 with a 66 to tie him with Pavin. Pavin and Couples finished
first and second in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera was not as kind to all its previous heroes. Couples,
Pavin, Stadler, Ernie Els (2-under) and Billy Mayfair (1-under)
made the cut, but Chip Beck (1988, 2-over), Mark Calcavecchia
(1989, 1-over), Nick Faldo (1997, 2-over) and Ted Schulz (1991,
3-over) all fell short, as did 1977 champion Tom Purtzer (2-over),
who will turn 50 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Movers and shankers: Brandel Chamblee matched Pavin for the
biggest move of the day by shooting a 6-under 65 after Thursday's
round of even par. Neal Lancaster, tied for third at 5-under after
the first round, missed the cut by three strokes after bogeying
Nos. 2, 5, 7, 12, 13 and 15 to finish the second round with an
8-over 79.

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began his quest
for the presidency in a blaze of promises and good intentions,
carrying an emphatically articulated vision of the new image he
planned to establish for the Republican party and the new voters he
intended to woo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said as he began a
nine-month trek to this critical juncture, and he repeated that
mantra each and every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sang another melodious tune, too: that his campaign would
hit an indefatigably upbeat, positive note and lift people's
spirits, always making them proud. Party elders beamed, because
here, at long last, was a vibrant, youthful Republican presidential
candidate who could court voters across a wide range of the
political spectrum and match any Democrat in the sensitivity wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the trail took a twist here in South Carolina, a state that
has long smiled on traditional Republicans, and in the final weeks
leading up to Saturday's fiercely contested primary, Bush
frequently seemed harsh, combative and as deeply invested in the
status quo of Republican politics as his father or Bob Dole, the
party's nominees from the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sen. John McCain of Arizona humbled Bush with a
19-point victory in New Hampshire, Bush has been on the attack,
hammering away at McCain's record day after day, in news
conferences and radio and television commercials. And through much
of the time, McCain unleashed several blistering attacks of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simultaneously pursued a well-trod path of political
caution, announcing unequivocally that he would shore up the
conservative Republican base in South Carolina on the same day
earlier this month that he visited Bob Jones University, a
Christian school with a controversial and well-known policy
prohibiting interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the last few days, Bush intermittently portrayed the
election here as a contest between the Republicans who favored him
and the independents and Democrats who wanted to throw a wrench
into the process by siding with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cunning method for turning out the Republican vote, but
it cast Democrats as enemies and provided a vivid reminder that
somewhere along the way, McCain had commandeered the perception of
being the Republican able to sow support in unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, Bush's strategy will yield him a victory
here. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, a reporter edged up to this
question, but Bush confidently dismissed any concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the beginnings of a long marathon,'' Bush said.
``We'll find out who can attract votes of independents and
Democrats in the long run,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, asked about McCain's stated desire to reinvent
the Republican party, Bush said, ``Reinvent it? I want to lead it
to victory. I want to be the person we nominate.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, what happened to Bush in South Carolina was
the inevitable and unremarkable product of an extraordinarily tight
race. Like any candidate in a vigorous fight, he reached out to his
most reliable supporters, and he took on his opponent as directly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He and his advisers rejected the notion that their engagement of
McCain has been negative, saying that Bush simply responded to what
they viewed to as lines of argument by McCain that were unwarranted
and extreme. They cited, in particular, two television commercials
in which McCain compared Bush's trustworthiness to that of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt compelled to defend his integrity,'' said Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush did not abandon the oratory he had used to date,
and he frequently touted accomplishments and ideals that were not
necessarily tailored to conservative voters' strongest interests.
</P>
<P>
   He almost never talked about the importance of improving
education without noting the particular strides that he said
Hispanic and black students in Texas had made.
</P>
<P>
   He answered every question he received about illegal
immigration, a source of intense vexation for many South
Carolinians, by reminding voters that many Mexicans streamed into
the United States simply to seek a better life for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande,'' he said during
perhaps a dozen question-and-answer sessions with voters here over
the last two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But that compassionate message was frequently eclipsed in the
public eye by seemingly contradictory signals that Bush might not
be willing to press his case to the point where it cost him any
votes on the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was not simply that Bush repeatedly declined to express
either approval of disapproval of the flying of the Confederate
battle flag over the South Carolina state capitol, even when Tim
Russert, interviewing him Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
challenged him by saying: ``Lead!''
</P>
<P>
   It was that Bush met fresh questions about the flag with a
stern, displeased expression. And his answers seldom included pleas
for racial tolerance and healing.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Bob Jones University fell into a similar category,
and it drew intense attention from news organizations that has yet
to let up.
</P>
<P>
   When it predictably came up at the Republican debate on Tuesday,
Bush argued that he had denounced the dating policy, making it
sound as if he had done so in his remarks at the school. In truth,
that stand was taken at a subsequent news conference miles away
from Bob Jones University, and only after a reporter questioned him
intently.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference this week, Bush answered a question about
whether his appearance at the university would hurt him in a
general election by saying that both his father, George Bush, and
Ronald Reagan had visited the school without electoral
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Republican of the future leaned on logic and
examples from the past.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the case in some of his final appeals to
Republicans on the last day before the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow,'' he told an audience in Clinton this morning,
``South Carolina can send a strong message of what our party stands
for.''
</P>
<P>
   His next words boiled that position down to two core thoughts,
neither of which spoke to his initial rallying cry of compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A limited government,'' Bush promised, ``and lower taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pledges drew vigorous applause. Then again, they would
have elicited the same reaction 10 or 20 years ago.

SIMPLE THEMES OF DUTY, HONOR CARRYING MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG MACEACHERN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Rabbi Hesh Epstein, director of South Carolina's
larg est Jewish education program and assistant rabbi at Beth Sha
lom Synagogue, is puzzling over just what it is about this fellow,
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, you see, hundreds of members of his temple are clap
ping and cheering and foot-stomping _ under a big tent right here
in the parking lot of Beth Shalom _ in a display of almost
religious fervor curiously similar to the revivalist habits of
certain other South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   As we speak behind the tent, McCain has shifted into full cul
ture-meld mode inside. Bounding before this audience _ which
certainly understands stand-up, Catskills-quality comic schtick far
better than he does _ Mc Cain is laying out one-liners one after
the other. And he's killing 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we sold the movie rights to my book. My kids wanted
to know who would play me in the movie. I wanted Tom Cruise. They
wanted Danny De Vito.''
</P>
<P>
   Big roar. He's knocking them dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving the people exactly what they want to hear, which
is accountability,'' says Rabbi Ep stein, referring not to the
schtick, but to the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community here, which is basically Democratic,
basically thinks he may be worth crossing over for.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is this so?
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years of following presi dential primaries, I have seen
rogues and rebels come roaring from nowhere to surprise their
party's Anointed Ones in this or that small-state primary. I have
seen angry, bellowing firebrands whipping up voter fury and tap
ping into this or that simmering discontent du jour.
</P>
<P>
   They've run the ideological gamut from populist conserva tives
like Pat Buchanan to liberal socialists like Jesse Jackson. But
every one of them has invariably been branded with the same iron,
bent into an ``L'' for ``Loser.'' And that is where this particular
hell-raising reformer parts com pany with all the others.
</P>
<P>
   If the Arizona senator wins Saturday here in South Carolina _
and his prospects at this moment are no worse than those of this
season's Anointed One, George W. Bush _ the chances become very
good he will be the Republican nominee for presi dent. And if he
wins the nomina tion, polls today are saying he will whip Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about this fellow, John McCain? Wrong question.
</P>
<P>
   What has made this the most simmering-hot presidential show down
in decades is not so much about this white-haired former fighter
jock who so seriously irks so many of the leaders of his own party
and state.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually quite simple: John McCain embodies commitment to
duty and honor and all of the sometimes infuriatingly manly _ yes,
manly _ qualities of which Bill Clinton is the living antithe sis.
That is why he has super charged this contest.
</P>
<P>
   The issues? Bah. Sometimes I suspect McCain cobbled together his
campaign finance-reform package and his bottom-up tax relief plan
strictly to tick off the party hierarchy. And guess what? It
worked. They're all so mad about this busted Bush corona tion they
could spit, as South Carolinians say.
</P>
<P>
   No, the right question to ask about why this seemingly impos
sible event may occur is this: What is it about American voters
that is making them need this fellow now?
</P>
<P>
   This is a particularly difficult question for many Arizonans to
answer. We know too much about John McCain. Or think we do.
</P>
<P>
   We know intimately the squab bles between McCain and Ari zona
GOP leaders. We know about his rift with former protege Grant Woods
and about his links to the empathy-challenged likes of Fife
Symington. We know about his heavy-handed use of power and about
his temper. Oh heav ens, do we know about the tem per. We know
about the national media and about how far, far different their
cozy view of Mc Cain would be if only they knew the guy like we do.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is the rest of America does not, and never will,
care about those matters.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an illustration of how America is coming to view John
McCain and why that view actu ally may propel him toward the
presidency:
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, which holds its primary election next Tuesday, the
same day Arizona does, there is a woman in her mid-70s who came to
this country from Can ada over 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Having held onto her green card and lived as a resident alien
all those years, she has never voted for anyone in her life. But in
January, she became an Amer ican citizen at long last, and
immediately registered to vote. Guess who she's bound and deter
mined to cast the first vote of her life for?
</P>
<P>
   You go, Mom. You go.

CAMPBELL HOPES TO CAPITALIZE ON INDEPENDENCE IN UPHILL RACE
FOR  SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARK SIMON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has taken Tom Campbell eight years to get to this point _ a
near-lock on the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first run for the Senate in 1992, Campbell has worked
hard to promote his distinct mixture of conservative and moderate
politics and to quell the antipathy of GOP conservatives, who once
actively spurned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1992 and 2000, I've done a lot to try to learn about
my state, be a better representative and be in a position where I
can win,'' Campbell said in an interview with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preserved my moderate positions on social issues, and the
open primary creates a chance for a person like me to win the
Republican nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he has been aided in no small degree by Democrat
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, his likely opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Her formidable incumbency discouraged many high-profile
Republicans from running against her _ and left Campbell facing two
lesser-known primary opponents, who trail him substantially in
money and in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   He also stands to benefit from the open primary, which he
strongly supported three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who think I did that for my own purposes,'' he
said. ``(But) that is not the case. It is true that I was concerned
that both parties were dominated by their more extreme wings, and
that is remedied by the open primary.''
</P>
<P>
   His quest for the Senate began eight years ago. After two terms
in the House of Representatives representing the mid-Peninsula,
Campbell sought the Republican nomination, losing the primary to TV
commentator Bruce Herschensohn by 60,176 votes _ little more than 2
percent of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Herschensohn and entertainer Sonny Bono cuffed
Campbell about, dismissing him as a liberal in conservative's
clothing for his support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the state Senate in 1993 and then returned to
Congress in a 1995 special election for a South Bay congressional
seat directly south of the one he won in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he was laying the groundwork for another run for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was the leading backer of the open primary
initiative, the law that now allows voters to cast ballots across
party lines in all primary elections except the presidential.
</P>
<P>
   With the open primary, Campbell said he is free to define
himself as a unifying force in the party _ a true independent with
a maverick style and a record as a fiscal conservative and social
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown his independence by voting to censure then-Speaker
Newt Gingrich, a vote that cost him in his caucus, and to impeach
President Clinton, a vote that angered many of his South Bay
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said his approach to government is philosophically
rooted in the Republican sentiment that the least government is the
best government.
</P>
<P>
   He said that is why he kicked off his campaign by calling for a
national sales tax to replace the income tax _ a sales tax that
would be levied on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   That's also why he has called for allowing local governments to
adopt programs in which drug addicts would be given free drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about spending a dime of federal money,''
Campbell said. ``I'm talking about getting somebody into treatment
is more likely if they're coming in for treatment. Should the
federal government stop a city or a county that wants to try this?
No,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   That he is willing to talk frankly about such matters is a
measure of his independence and his political honesty, Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My record shows I do not run from difficult decisions or try
to take the easy way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which put Campbell where he is today _ well ahead of two
GOP primary opponents who are casting about for a way to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn and Riverside state Sen.
Ray Haynes have made Campbell the issue in the campaign, each
arguing that he is not a true Republican, nor a true conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said Campbell ``goes out of his way to slap the
conservatives in the party'' by taking pro-tax, pro-abortion
positions and by backing the open primary initiative that diluted
conservative influence within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks the party ought to be going in a different
direction. He certainly doesn't work with conservatives,'' Haynes
said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Haynes nor Horn has been able to raise money to
compete with Campbell _ he has a 6-to-1 fund-raising lead over Horn
and a 10-to-1 lead over Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes recently took the extraordinary step of sending an e-mail
to 30,000 supporters, begging them to send him money. A subsequent
e-mail said his backers had responded, but not well enough.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional conservative sources of money ``are just
quiet,'' Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, a successful rancher, put $300,000 of his own money into
his campaign, but he has spent little of it.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said it may be that the conservative leadership is
willing to let Campbell take his shot and lose the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of being blamed for losing elections. Let them
lose one,'' Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Campbell has spent most of the primary
contemplating how to scale the mountainous lead Feinstein has in
public opinion polls, which show her ahead by a margin of nearly 5
to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has just begun a statewide media advertising buy in all
of the major TV markets. The goal is to build up his name
recognition. Campaign officials are convinced that much of
Feinstein's lead is based on her wider recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can close against Sen. Feinstein substantially simply by
increasing my name identification,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   And should lightning strike and Feinstein be selected the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, Campbell would be running
against an incumbent seeking two offices at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help because she would essentially be running for an
office in which she did not wish to serve. That would be difficult
... (and) I would be in a better position to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he fails to catch Feinstein and loses the Senate
race, Campbell's eight years of spadework leave him well positioned
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   With the dearth of GOP statewide officeholders, Campbell could
finish a losing Senate race with a statewide fund-raising base and
voter recognition that could put him in a top-tier position to
challenge Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer when she is up for
re-election in 2004.

 SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY TO SET TONE  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Democrats and independents in this deeply
conservative state have a remarkable opportunity Saturday to shape
_ if not decide _ the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Saturday's South Carolina primary, polls show
Texas Gov. George W. Bush holding a 2-to-1 advantage among South
Carolina Republicans. But Arizona Sen. John McCain enjoys an even
larger advantage over Bush among Democrats and independents, who
are free to vote in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one is quite certain who will show up to vote,
pollsters give Bush a narrow advantage overall. The outcome hinges
on the size of the turnout and the mix of Republicans, Democrats
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win tomorrow _ I believe that,'' Bush said as he
began a day of rallies in the state's conservative northwest
corner. ``These people who are getting nervous now are going to
regret getting nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized his conservative credentials, his strong
stance against abortion and his record of reforming schools,
welfare, the courts, &LR;  and the juvenile justice system in Texas.
Aware of McCain's appeal as a party maverick, Bush has adopted the
motto: &LR;  ``A Reformer with Results.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, has pushed his populist message of standing
up to special interests and returning government to the people,
emphasizing his conservative voting record and military background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to turnout,'' McCain said on the resort
island of Hilton Head. ``With the exception of a few brave people,
every establishment figure in our party is opposing me. I'm honored
by the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 37 delegates are at stake in South Carolina, which has
fewer registered voters than the Bay Area. Nevertheless, the
outcome is critical to the political futures of both Bush and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Were McCain to win, he would suddenly become the GOP
front-runner. A victory in South Carolina would give him enormous
momentum going into Tuesday's primaries in Michigan and his home
state of Arizona, where polls show him leading.
</P>
<P>
   Victories in those states _ following his 18-point triumph over
Bush in New Hampshire _ would destroy the aura of invincibility
that has surrounded the Texas governor's campaign for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, my friends,'' McCain said at a Veterans of
Foreign Wars rally in Spartanburg. ``If we win here, I don't see
how we can really be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an assertion shared by many outside his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush loses South Carolina, with all the money and
everything he put in here, I think he's through _ done with,'' said
former Democratic National Committee chairman Don Fowler, who
teaches a class on Southern politics at the University of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a Bush victory would help him right the
course of a campaign that was thrown off kilter by his New
Hampshire defeat. Bush has poured millions of dollars into
television and radio commercials, and he has thousands of
volunteers and rank-and-file party members helping him to get out
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win here,'' Bush predicted on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' ``Now, you mark my words. You can write it down
on your pad of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   His financial and organizational support dwarfs McCain's. Though
Bush has spent $50 million, he still has $20 million _ more than
twice what McCain has _ going into the March 7 primary battles in
California, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for independent votes has been a key to McCain's
strategy from the beginning. In New Hampshire, McCain edged Bush
among Republicans, &LR;  but crushed him among independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his supporters have voiced concerns over the influence
of outsiders in determining the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hear some concern among Republicans that it's going to be
the Democrats who determine the outcome of the election here,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made no apologies for appealing to non-Republicans,
saying it is a crucial component of his ability to not only win the
GOP nomination, &LR;  but also the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call the Democrats, call the independents,'' he exulted before
a crowd in Aiken this week. ``Call the libertarians, call the
vegetarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials predict a turnout between 300,000 and
400,000, far larger than the 276,000 voters who cast ballots in the
1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are reports of record numbers of absentee
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, both candidates will be off to Michigan, which
holds its primary Tuesday. McCain's ``Straight Talk Express,'' the
customized bus that carries the candidate and a mob of reporters,
is already headed for Michigan, where it will spend two days before
being dispatched to California.

COLUMN: GET-RICH SHOWS LEAVE WOMEN HOLDING THE REMOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS to ``Jeopardy!'' in 6th graf) 
 (mk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We already have the first winner in the Who Wants to Be a
Millionairess Contest, which was announced only last week in this
space. Readers were asked to redress the gender problem on ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ 90 percent of the contestants are
male _ by devising a female-friendly game show.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, of course, is Fox television, which triumphed in the
Nielsen ratings on Tuesday with ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' The program was denounced for presenting an
offensively sexist stereotype of women, but for some reason it was
watched by more women (10 million) than men (7 million). The next
day so many women applied to be contestants that the Web site
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, this show may not be for everyone. There
are probably some women in America unwilling to run off and marry a
rich man sight unseen (just as there are even some guys unwilling
to marry someone after seeing her in a bathing suit). Some women
could be especially reluctant to play if they thought their current
husbands would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   So the contest continues for another get-rich-quick game, and it
may be a good idea to learn a lesson from Fox's success. The lesson
is that the enlightened new era of complete sexual equality is not
yet here.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been heeded by the ``Millionaire'' producers, who
have tried to be fair by giving men and women the same computerized
tests by telephone. But this equality seems to be unfair to women,
as I heard from an array of would-be contestants like Andrea Carla
Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first game show I haven't been able to get on,''
said Michaels, a San Francisco trivia buff who has been on
``Jeopardy!,'' ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' and other shows. She
phones in daily to take the ``Millionaire'' test, but she's been
stymied by the qualifying questions.
</P>
<P>
   Each question requires that four things be put in order. You may
have to arrange four European countries from west to east. Or, to
use an example encountered by Michaels, you may have to list the
following four movies in chronological order: ``Thin Red Line,''
``Green Card,'' ``Yellow Submarine' and ``Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemingly nonsexist, right?'' Michaels said. ``I've seen all
of them, can name the stars, who directed them, can speak at length
about Andie McDowell's studio apartment in New York complete with a
rooftop greenhouse, or how Isabella Rossellini was with David Lynch
at the time, so why did he leave her so naked out there, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``But tell you which came first, `Blue Velvet' or `Green Card'?
Zero idea. That is a very male way to think about a film. Women
could do fine with the straight trivia questions that are actually
on the show, but most of us can't get through the qualifying
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint resonated with Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist
at Rutgers University who surveyed male-female brain differences in
her 1999 book, ``The First Sex: The Natural Talents of Women and
How They Are Changing the World.'' The ordering question requires
what Fisher calls step thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both men and women practice step thinking, but men do more of
it,'' she said. ``They're more likely to compartmentalize, get rid
of extraneous data and proceed in a straightforward path. They make
faster decisions because they consider fewer variables. Women tend
to collect more data and assemble it into more complex patterns _
what I call web thinking. They're better at generalizing and
synthesizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' could be fairer if it dispensed with the
ordering questions, especially the geographical ones, which play to
men's spatial skills. But the program, like other trivia game
shows, would still probably appeal to more men than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight trivia questions seem boring to a lot of women
because they're so simple,'' said James M. Dabbs, a psychologist at
Georgia State University who has studied testosterone's role in
focusing men on simple, competitive tasks. ``Men needed to focus on
one thing when they were fighting each other for mates. They
evolved for fast, energetic, explosive action, panache, and short
lives. Women evolved for enduring relationships and the long
haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's marriage competition might have been gloriously moronic
and tasteless, but it was still more complex than a trivia game.
Courtship is more complicated than geography. The challenge is to
find a still more intricate game. Our researchers hope to
field-test, perhaps in the spring, a prototype that does not
require anyone to wear a bathing suit or marry a motivational
speaker.

 Founder of cookie company visits Kansas City to promote literacy  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Wally Amos, the founder of Famous Amos
Cookies, visited students of Knotts Elementary School in Kansas
City on Friday promoting another kind of goody _ literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Amos, the national spokesman for Literacy Volunteers of America,
spoke with students and read to them early in the day, then talked
to parents Friday evening about becoming actively involved in their
children's education and activities.
</P>
<P>
   Amos read to the children from the books The Giving Tree by Shel
Silverstein, The Crayon Box That Talked by Shane DeRolf, Wilma
Unlimited: How Wilma Rudolph Became the World's Fastest Woman by
Kathleen Krull, and That's Good! That's Bad! by Margery Cuyler.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked to the students about how important they are as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal mission has been to help build self-esteem, to let
children know how special and important they are and that anything
is possible,'' Amos said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said he emphasizes the same message to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to love themselves,'' he said. ``If a parent has
low self-esteem, that can spread to their child.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos said he also encourages parents to read to their children
every day, even if only for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he will talk about overcoming adversity at a 1 p.m.
workshop at Unity Temple on the Country Club Plaza. The workshop is
open to the public. There is no cost, but donations will be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Amos is widely credited for his entrepreneurial spirit and for
being a positive role model to others. He has become a popular
motivational speaker, sharing his message of self-respect and
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   With the financial backing of friends such as Bill Cosby and
Helen Reddy, Amos started his cookie business 25 years ago on
Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood after leaving the entertainment
industry, where he was a theatrical agent.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the entertainment business a ``feast or famine''
environment, Amos opted for a more stable one. Turning a weekend
cookie-baking hobby into a business, Amos saw cookie sales hit $10
million in 10 years. But, like many small companies that experience
rapid growth, Famous Amos went through serious growing pains in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After the company changed hands several times, Amos left in
1989. He rejoined the company last year as the brand's
spokesperson, hired by Keebler, which purchased Famous Amos in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Amos will be involved in promoting events and
activities to celebrate Famous Amos Cookies' 25th anniversary as
well as continuing to promote family literacy and dropout
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   He is working with KCPT, Channel 19, to develop a show called
``Read Aloud With Wally Amos.''
</P>
<P>
   Funding for preproduction work, which will include the
development of two half-hour pilot episodes, has been provided by
the Kauffman Foundation.

IRRATIONAL WORLD OF THE MARKET TODAY  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two events this week illustrated how far
afield the stock market has wandered from real-world value.
</P>
<P>
   When Wal-Mart reported a 23 percent surge in net income for its
fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31, the company's stock
slipped more than a point Tuesday on concerns about the retailing
giant's ability to sustain such heady gains.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the results even surpassed analysts'
expectations. As Wall Street ruminated further on Wal-Mart's
prospects, investors continued to hammer the stock. In three
trading sessions, Wal-Mart's stock price lost nine points, or more
than 15 percent. It was a case of no good deed going unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Could such a thing happen in a rational world? Wal-Mart is a
magnificently profitable Dow Jones industrial average blue-chipper.
It has rewritten the book on retailing and set the standard by
which all others in its industry are measured. Its outlook is good
from both domestic and international perspectives. Then, wham!
Doubts about its ability to top spectacular fourth-quarter growth
numbers translate into a mindless trashing of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   This unfortunate turn of fortune for Wal-Mart was especially
scary given what was happening in the loss-ridden New Economy
high-tech Wonderland of dot-com mania. The technology-laden Nasdaq
was going its merry way to a another record high in Thursday's
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old Economy, meanwhile, Wal-Mart was just one instance of
bad things happening to good companies. Thursday's close saw the
Dow Jones industrial average at 10,515. This meant the venerable
indicator remained in what Wall Street considers a correction mode
because it was still down more than 10 percent from its record high
of 11,723.
</P>
<P>
   The absurdity of what's occurring was underscored Thursday when
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan went to Capitol Hill to
brief Congress on the central bank's view of the economy. As
Greenspan's testimony was being aired on CNBC, the screen's
accompanying stock market indicators provided a live report on Wall
Street's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dow industrials slumped and the Nasdaq indicator pushed
higher, the message was clear: The Fed's apparent intention to keep
raising interest rates until it sees slower economic growth will
cause the real-world economy to sink under the weight of
increasingly expensive borrowed capital. As it does, real-world
companies such as Wal-Mart will be challenged to sustain the sort
of supercharged profit growth that justifies higher stock
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com Wonderland, however, isn't burdened by any such
real-world value considerations. It doesn't depend all that heavily
on borrowed capital to sustain its money-losing operations.
Although its enterprises often chew up equity capital at a
prodigious pace, there are always enough venturesome believers to
finance money-losing expansions.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a time, no doubt, when real-world problems affect
even the dot-com phenomenon. It won't come, though, until a
Fed-induced liquidity crunch creates severe shortages of all types
of investment capital.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in what happens at capital-crunch time need
only bone up on the demise of Japan's economy since 1990.

NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER MAKES DEMANDS ON BEHALF OF PRISONER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Nobel Peace Prize winner is voicing three
demands on behalf of American Indian prisoner Leonard Peltier:
clemency, a congressional hearing and prompt attention to his
failing health.
</P>
<P>
   Rigoberta Menchu Tum, who won the Nobel for her human-rights
work in Guatemala, had visited Peltier on Friday at the U.S.
Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan., where he is in his 24th year of
serving two life sentences for the murders of two FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that she felt a moral debt to Peltier, Tum spoke of links
between indigenous people in Guatemala and Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found the correct key, path or door to free him
yet, but I really believe we are going to be able to free Leonard
Peltier,'' she said in a press conference at the Bruce R. Watkins
Cultural Heritage Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tum and other human-rights advocates met with U.S. Justice
Department officials this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pressing for executive clemency, they want medical
attention for Peltier's jaw, which has been painfully stuck open
half an inch, the long-term effect of tetanus he contracted as a
child. His food is blended so he can eat without chewing, said Gina
Chiala of the Lawrence-based Leonard Peltier Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tum's Guatemala City foundation works to fight injustices
suffered by indigenous people worldwide. Until recently, the
foundation has largely been a voice against injustices, but it had
not done many formal investigations, Tum said. That focus is
changing, she said, and Peltier's case will be one her group will
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Peltier has many supporters worldwide who believe he was
unfairly convicted in a government attempt to avenge the deaths of
the agents and deflect criticism of FBI interference in the
sovereign lands of the reservation where the murders occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has not been served here,'' Tum said. ``What has been
served here is revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Tum expressed frustration Peltier's case has languished for more
than two decades in the United States, but she also spoke to the
necessity for patience when trying to find the truth when the
rights of indigenous people are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, years after the 34-year civil war in her country
ended, a U.N. truth commission substantiated what many believed _
the CIA-backed Guatemalan Army had committed 93 percent of the
atrocities there, mostly against Mayans.

CARGO JET IN CRASH HAD OTHER FORCED LANDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Emery Worldwide Airlines cargo jet that crashed
killing three crew members in Sacramento this week had emergency
engine shutdowns twice in the past three years, according to
federal aviation safety reports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of the aircraft's earlier mechanical problems came
to light as investigators continued to comb for clues where the
Emery DC-8 plunged to earth Wednesday near Mather Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, part of the Federal Aviation Administration's
Incident Data System, show that in May 1997, the No. 1 engine of
Emery DC-8 N8079U ``flamed out'' during a night flight out of
Ontario Airport in Southern California, forcing the plane to make
an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured in the incident, but no cause was ever found
for the sudden failure.
</P>
<P>
   In another episode in February 1996, the DC-8 was flying from
Los Angeles to Montgomery, Ala., when it was forced to make an
emergency landing in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FAA report, an engine-fire warning alarm went
off, and the crew was forced to shut down the No. 2 engine. After
discharging two fire extinguishers, the alarm continued.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane landed, the system tested normal. According to
the FAA, the fire alarm had failed a test three days before the
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Wednesday night's accident is still under
investigation, and it will take months to determine precisely what
caused the DC-8 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the accident were pilot Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin,
N.Y.; co-pilot, George Land, 35, of Placerville; and flight
engineer Russell Hicks, a 38-year-old Sparks, Nev., resident.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, investigators from the National Transportation Safety
Board, the agency conducting the probe, said they have made a
preliminary examination of the aircraft's voice recorder and are
having an exact transcript prepared in Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
   They also said they have taken aerial photographs that
reconstructed the path of the doomed plane, recovered a wingtip
lost when the plane clipped the awning of a two-story building
before crashing into a car lot, and determined that the tail of the
plane did not strike the ground on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of the accident, the possibility was raised that
the crash had been caused by a shift in the cargo inside the
aircraft, making it impossible to control.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, safety board officials said a possible cargo shift
remains a focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're carefully examining the wreckage, to look at any devices
used to tie the cargo down to the deck,'' said George Black of the
National Transportation Safety Board during a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator in charge, Greg Fieth, said some of the parts
have already been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found some bear clamps (devices used to secure cargo),
found various parts of the floor, but we haven't found the entire
deck and total number of clamps.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery's cargo-handling methods have come under considerable
criticism in the past few years. The Air Line Pilots Association,
which is engaged in contentious negotiations with the $2.4 billion
freight carrier over the association's first contract, has written
the FAA repeatedly to suggest that the company loads its aircraft
unsafely.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday's crash, however, the union has declined comment
on Emery or its practices, saying making any public statements
would be inappropriate because the union is a party to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Sacci, a spokesman for Emery in Redwood City, said the
company is prohibited from commenting on the crash or any FAA
inspections while the investigation is under way. But he
categorically denied a widely publicized statement by a former
Emery pilot, Steven Weinstein, alleging that the airline had been
grounded on numerous occasions because of problems with cargo
stowage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA has never, ever grounded an Emery aircraft for any
reason at any time in our 54-year history,'' Sacci said. ``We
absolutely deny his statement.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's briefing, Black said he was aware of the union's
allegations and the National Transportation Safety Board is looking
into them _ with a degree of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of opinions on how things are operated,'' he
said. ``I think it's significant that that's coming from a union.
They have one set of interests, and the other parties have other
concerns. So we have to weigh all of that and validate it before we
can reach any sort of a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of the FAA's database system shows that there have been
34 serious incidents or accidents involving Emery Worldwide
Airlines aircraft in the past 12 years, but none of the previous
occurrences caused fatalities and none involved shifting cargo or
improperly secured materials aboard planes.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the incidents were attributed to errors by air crew
or ground personnel; four were related to other causes, and 15
resulted from mechanical failures ranging from blown tires to a
loss of hydraulic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the mechanical problems may be tied to maintenance
practices. In one 1998 case, for example, while preparing for
takeoff from Cox International Airport in Dayton, Ohio, another
Emery DC-8's main cargo door opened for reasons that have never
been explained. Despite the problem, the aircraft took off before
FAA investigators were able to inspect the door and related
systems.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane was lifting off, the tower told the crew that their
cargo door was open. When the plane made an emergency landing, the
cargo door slammed into the fuselage and the crew had to wrestle
with the landing gear in order to control it.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the accident, Emery officials blamed the
aircraft's crew for failing to follow procedures on takeoff, while
the crew said the cargo door and its emergency light malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The type of aircraft in this week's crash, the DC-8, has been
involved in relatively few accidents. A review of the safety
board's safety database shows only 10 DC-8 accidents have occurred
since 1996. Despite the small number of crashes, several have been
deadly. A total of 11 people died in two of the incidents, and four
others received minor injuries in another.
</P>
<P>
   One of the DC-8 accidents involved an Emery aircraft, but nobody
was injured in the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's aviation incident data system shows only three
accidents in the past dozen years caused by shifting cargo in
commercial flights, but the FAA's records may be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   When a Fine Airlines DC-8 carrying cargo crashed near Miami in
1997, the safety board issued a report that severely criticized the
carrier for slipshod practices in stowing and securing cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Three flight crew members, a security guard and a motorist died
in that crash. The safety board specifically cited Fine for
allowing the aircraft to be loaded in such a way that it could not
be controlled by the crew.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, the safety board conducted an intensive
review of Fine Air's operations and found ``problems ... in the
area of weight and balance control, to include ground handling,
weighing of cargo, security of cargo on pallets, accuracy of
individual pallet weights and condition of pallets and nets used to
restrain cargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that its findings were ``an indication of a
systemic problem at Fine Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Fine Airlines DC-8 crash is not included in the FAA
incident data system.

PROPOSAL WOULD OFFER `NEW URBANISM' IN KANSAS CITY'S NORTHLAND  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The largest housing plan proposed in Kansas
City in more than a half-century was filed at City Hall this week,
offering a rare opportunity for the suburbs to replicate cozy
old-style neighborhoods like Brookside.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, encompassing roughly 2.5 square miles near Hodge Park
in the Northland, embraces features from a bygone era that are
becoming trendy again around the country: front porches, back
alleys, town squares and apartments on top of shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll make this section of the Northland a very unique place,
something Johnson County has not been able to offer,'' said Kansas
City Councilman Ed Ford, from the Northland.
</P>
<P>
   The project is called the Shoal Creek Valley, and it's being
proposed by a group affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints in Utah. It covers 1,700 acres from Northeast
76th to Northeast 96th streets, between Interstates 435 and 35.
</P>
<P>
   The group on Thursday filed a master plan that divides the
acreage into 10 districts, including a business park, townhouses
geared to retirees and more typical suburban-style housing around a
golf course. About a quarter of the project is devoted to old-style
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In size and scope, the project is so unusual that the group also
worked with city planners to create an entirely new zoning
classification, covering ``master planned communities.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is all built in the next 20 to 30 years, Shoal Creek
Valley could be home to 15,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   It represents the region's first large-scale attempt at
so-called ``new urbanism'' or neotraditional development, which
offers homes and shops in a close-knit village setting that
promotes walking as much as driving. The trend is aimed at
Americans who, according to a growing legion of studies, are
dissatisfied with their suburban neighborhoods' sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the church-affiliated development group is willing to take
its experiment only as far as the marketplace will accept it. If
neotraditional home-building has a hard time selling, developers
can switch to more commonplace cul-de-sac subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet whether the market is going to say this is a
good thing,'' said Mark Staples, manager of the Shoal Creek Valley
Development Co., which is buying the land from a Mormon
Church-owned affiliate. ``We believe the demand is deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want alleys and detached garages, this is one of the
few places to go. If they don't want it, then the plan is flexible
enough to do what's typically been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoal Creek Valley, generally east and south of Hodge Park, is
one of the largest blocks of land under one ownership in the
region. As such, it bedeviled Kansas City planners for years.
</P>
<P>
   As the pace of development surged throughout the Northland
during the 1990s, subdivisions surrounded and leapfrogged over the
Mormons' land. At one point, a delegation of city leaders even
visited Utah to spur some action.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the church's real estate officials were ready to
act, city planners had a master plan.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS is Kansas City's master land-use plan, adopted in 1997,
that advocates clustering homes, shops and offices close together
instead of in autonomous zones that are common in suburban areas.
One part of FOCUS' Northland Plan, for instance, calls for ``a
compact development pattern, structured around vibrant, mixed-use
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was basically the inspiration for Shoal Creek Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this to develop for a long time,'' said Vicki
Noteis, the city's planning director. ``It's a great example of the
FOCUS plan. This shows there is another way to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can overstate the significance of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoal Creek Valley is believed to be the largest
residential-commercial project undertaken in Kansas City since J.C.
Nichols started the Country Club district, encompassing the Country
Club Plaza and Brookside, in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The new project also is one of the largest attempts at
neotraditionalism in a major city.
</P>
<P>
   There are just 14 such developments being planned or constructed
that exceed 1,700 acres, according to the Congress for the New
Urbanism, a San Francisco group that tracks these projects. And
only two others are planned within the limits of a big city _
Orlando, Fla., and Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an excellent project, one that really combines
the new technology of housing but goes back to the more traditional
Brooksidelike model,'' Mayor Kay Barnes said. ``I think it is going
to be a tremendous project.''
</P>
<P>
   The development group's inch-thick plan provides a map showing
the project's possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   At the far north, off the northeast corner of Hodge Park,
there's a typical suburban subdivision, complete with winding
streets. And across Shoal Creek Parkway, there are large-lot,
high-priced homes around a 200-acre golf course. These subdivisions
emulate the suburban style already built near the park.
</P>
<P>
   South of Missouri 152, though, the new development takes on its
neotraditional character.
</P>
<P>
   East of Shoal Creek Parkway, there's a district called The
Village. Streets are laid out in a grid, and developers talk about
narrower lots, homes with front porches, maybe even detached
garages with apartments on top.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood shops nearby aren't laid out in a strip but
clustered across the street from another park.
</P>
<P>
   West of Shoal Creek Parkway is where space is set aside for a
corporate center, a business park and a town square, labeled The
Commons. This is where a public library and community center could
bookend a Plazalike, low-rise shopping and office district, where
the buildings would be adjacent to the streets instead of set back
with parking lots in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people really want are relationships _ of usable open
space, or the possibility of their child walking to school, of
their grandfather as he gets older having the possibility of living
in their neighborhood,'' said site planner Donald Brandes Jr. of
Denver. ``This is something greater than a single-use subdivision.
We're going to connect you to a greater community.''
</P>
<P>
   The city approval process is expected to take months. After
that, the next steps are for the development group to begin putting
in some main thoroughfares and find builders willing to tackle the
old-fashioned concepts. And that's something City Manager Bob
Collins is eager to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested to see how the building community will respond
to this,'' Collins said. ``Some of them are going to have to change
the way they build.''

CHANGE COMING SLOWLY TO TRADITION-BOUND SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The freeways through South Carolina would be
indistinguishable from anywhere else were it not for the Church of
Christ-sponsored signs from God and the billboards for Maurice's
Gourmet Piggie Park Bar-B-Q.
<P>
   The trees are bare from winter, McDonald's are omnipresent and,
but for the lack of snow, the view from the bubble of the campaign
bus is much the same as it was in Iowa or New Hampshire, the last
two proving grounds in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the political terrain is fundamentally different in this
state, where the Civil War began, where abortion is regarded by
many as murder and where the political spectrum ranges from fiscal
conservative to religious conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in South Carolina, locals like to boast, is a blood
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, the lieutenant governor gunned down the editor of the
State newspaper in broad daylight on Main Street. The prosecutor,
who could not find a jury that would convict him, was a fellow
named Thurmond, whose son Strom has been elected to public office _
as state senator, governor and U.S. senator _ in every election
since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is South Carolina. Change and reform is not our motto,''
said Michael Graham, a Republican consultant who claims to have
come from a rural town where he spent his ``formative years running
from large hairy people named `Bubba,' many of them women.''
</P>
<P>
   But the image of South Carolina as a backwater state is
outdated. Sumatra coffee and Grgich Hills chardonnay are easily
found in the capital city of Columbia. Cotton and tobacco are no
longer king, long ago replaced by manufacturing and tourism as the
state's top businesses.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina attracted $42 billion in capital investment
during the 1990s, evidenced by the newly constructed office parks
and warehouses toward the west, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge
mountains. Toward the seacoast, the arrival of thousands of
retirees has driven up real estate costs in Charleston and resort
towns such as Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are changing,'' said Don Fowler, who teaches a course
on Southern politics at the University of South Carolina and until
last year was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said he recently received an invitation to a gay/lesbian
political event, which ``you just wouldn't have seen 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of television, the growing black vote and the
rising number of outsiders have made South Carolina less distinct
from the rest of the nation, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stereotype of South Carolina persists for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag, the emblem of a cause lost 135 years ago
and a symbol of hatred and racism to many, still flies atop the
statehouse. Bob Jones University, the state's largest liberal arts
college, bans interracial dating and only started allowing blacks
in 1971. The Citadel, a state-financed military school, began
admitting women just four years ago and only after pressure from
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Those traditions are strong enough that Texas Gov. George W.
Bush made a visit to Bob Jones University his first South Carolina
campaign stop after the New Hampshire primary two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And no Republican candidate has dared to challenge the flying of
the Confederate flag, which was raised in the early 1960s above the
statehouse to protest the federal government's insistence on ending
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other state would be fighting this flag issue but one of
these deep south States?'' asked Fowler, adding with a smile that
Democrats will be able to exploit it in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican position on the flag ``is like giving us a nice,
warm cream puff on a silver platter,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The national media's focus on race has bred resentment from
South Carolinians who feel they are being unfairly maligned. The
race question is more complicated than the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pait, like a majority of South Carolinians, believes
the Confederate flag should come down from the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive to many blacks,'' said Pait, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Pait, an administrator at Bob Jones University, also says that
the school's ban on interracial dating is an appropriate safeguard
against the blending of God-created races.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did that to keep us from coming together,'' Pait said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say this until I'm blue in the face, and no one
believes us, but this policy is not based on racism or hate.''
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, the stop at Bob Jones is sure to haunt
Bush if he wins the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that no one from South Carolina told him not to go
there says something about this state,'' said Graham, who believes
that the behavior of national politicians pandering to the
conservative vote in South Carolina dooms them in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to be president, lose South Carolina,''
Graham advised.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Atwater, the late guitar-playing Republican operative famous
for his scorched-earth brand of politics, helped turn his native
South Carolina into a must-win state along the GOP primary trail.
Since the Palmetto State primary in 1980, no Republican has won the
nomination without first winning here.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who writes a weekly political column, describes the
state's GOP as having three factions: the Old Guard (``fiscal
conservatives who will have a drink''), the Right Guard
(``Evangelicals'') and the Off Guard (``anti-establishment kooks,
who think the Confederate flag is important.'')
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated the words of a Palmetto State senator from the
mid-1860s: ``South Carolina _ too small to be a republic, too large
to be an insane asylum.''

CHALMERS, TWAY LEAD NISSAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when it seemed the second round of the Nissan
Open would be remarkable mostly for the quality of the PGA Tour's
minor-league system, another late stretch run broke out Friday
afternoon at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tway reeled off consecutive birdies on holes 12, 13 and 14,
Australian Greg Chalmers nearly matched that with three birdies
from holes 10 through 13, and both slipped past Thursday
stretch-runner and first-round leader J.P. Hayes (134) to share the
midway lead at 9-under-par 133.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be my favorite or top 2 or 3 of the courses we play.
You have to do everything well, and I think that's why people enjoy
coming here,'' said Tway, who played as if he enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   He totaled five birdies and a bogey in a round of 67 that tied
for the third-best score of the day behind a 65 that moved Brandel
Chamblee to within three strokes of the lead at 136.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers, nicknamed Snake _ as in snake charmer, he said _
shared the second-best score of the day at 66, turning in a
bogeyless round that included five birdies and went a long way
toward his goal of trying to face more tournament heat this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been wanting to put myself under pressure,'' said the
26-year-old Perth native, who was the Australasian Tour rookie of
the year in 1995. ``It's just something I have to do to better my
game. It's something I need to go through to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers will get his shot at the pressure in today's final
pairing, joining 1986 PGA champion Tway and Hayes, whose
methodical, in-control shotmaking in the first two rounds has
produced 24-for-30 accuracy in fairways hit and only slightly less
success shooting at greens.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes hit 16 greens Thursday and ``16 fringes'' Friday, when he
recorded 17 pars and a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sticking it really good,'' said Hayes, who doesn't
call this the best he has played but likes the way he is thinking
on the course:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to hit a shot I'm not comfortable with, so I'm
giving myself a lot of opportunities for pars. And when I see a
situation I'm comfortable with, I have birdie opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   He, Chalmers and Tway wound up with top billing on a cut day
that produced some surprising casualties including John Cook, Peter
Jacobsen, Brad Faxon, Mark O'Meara and Justin Leonard, plus Shigeki
Maruyama, who tied for second in last week's Buick Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Other top names survived the cut of 1-under 141 but finished at
least five strokes off the lead, notably Tiger Woods, David Duval,
Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh and Fred Couples, all at 138.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who shot 1-under-par 70, called it, ``Just one of those
deals, you know. I hit the ball all right today, didn't hit it that
great. But the whole group, we didn't make any putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Area golfers Craig Stadler and Duffy Waldorf advanced in
dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler finished right on the cut line, thanks to a hole-in-one
on the 157-yard, par-3 sixth hole. Valencia's Waldorf, a former
UCLA star, made good on a downhill, 10-foot par putt on his final
hole to qualify for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The late charges of Tway and Chalmers overshadowed some strong
shooting by more than a half-dozen Nike Tour (now buy.com Tour)
refugees, led by Hayes, now a PGA Tour member for six straight
years but still mindful of the attacking style of play he learned
in that league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really learn how to shoot low,'' Hayes said. ``because the
courses lend themselves to lower scores and the cut is 55 (instead
of 70, as on the PGA Tour). I think that's what players are
learning to do more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hayes was joined in the leaderboard top-10 at various
times by Nike alums Tom Scherrer, Bradley Hughes, Tommy Armour III,
Brad Elder, Stewart Cink, Kevin Sutherland and brothers Jeff and
Robin Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer and Hughes emerged the best of that bunch, sharing
fourth place at 135, 1998 Nissan Open challenger Armour was in a
pack of six at 136, and Cink, Elder and Sutherland finished in an
11-man bunch at 137, four strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the leaderboard at one point and it seemed
like nine out of 10 guys were (former Nike players),'' Scherrer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer, who will be close to the heat himself today, teeing
off in the next-to-last group, may be well-qualified for the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he was the overlooked third man in the Phoenix
Open showdown between Justin Leonard and eventual winner Phil
Mickelson _ a hometown-favorite Arizona State alumnus who was
supported by a deafening crowd of 165,000.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer, who came within a missed putt of winning in
regulation, said the pressure of that day prepared him for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of the forgotten guy,'' said Scherrer of that
overwhelming experience, ``but if I can play well in that arena I
can handle anything, no matter where I play anywhere in the
world.''

ROBBER CRIED OUT FOR HELP, WITNESS SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Hollywood bank robber Emil Matasareanu cried out for help
three times as he lay handcuffed, writhing in a pool of blood as
police chatted casually, a woman who witnessed the scene testified
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dora J. Lubensky said Matasareanu's increasingly loud tirade of
curses and pleas included a demand that police ``shoot me in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Help me' three times - he was shouting more all the
time,'' Lubensky told the U.S. District Court jury, which is
considering whether police allowed Matasareanu to bleed to death
Feb. 28, 1997. ``He looked uncomfortable and kept moving and the
officer tapped him with his foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu lay in the street for about an hour and died of 29
gunshot wounds before paramedics arrived. Lubensky, 69, said she
witnessed it all from her house, about 30 feet away, in the 11800
block of Archwood Street.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said it was too dangerous to send an ambulance for
Matasareanu out of fears that his body might be rigged with
explosives or that other robbers might be on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lubensky, 20 minutes after the hulking robber was
shot down about 10 a.m., the officers guarding him appeared relaxed
and remained that way past 10:45 a.m. when Matasareanu stopped
moving, leading Lubensky and another witness to assume he had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were walking around casually, talking to each other -
just talking and looking for shells,'' Lubensky said. ``He was
bleeding heavily and no one gave him any attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubensky's testimony came after Dr. Marshall Morgan, emergency
medical center director at the University of California, Los
Angeles, Medical Center, said Matasareanu could have been saved if
he had had received medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bleeding was not tremendously rapid,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two now-retired officers and a former police chief are being
sued, along with the city, by attorney Stephen Yagman on behalf of
Matasareanu's children, Alexander, 4, and Emil Jr., 8.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman's federal civil rights suit accuses former officers James
Vojteck and John Futrell of allowing Matasareanu to bleed to death
in an act of ``street justice'' after the gunman robbed a Bank of
America on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and, with an accomplice, wounded
17 people with machine gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks damages against the city and former police
Chief Daryl Gates, who is accused of encouraging such alleged
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   From her front room, Lubensky said she could see Matasareanu
fire his final burst of machine gun fire at police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped shooting, fell to his knees, lowered his arms and
brought them back up again and started shooting again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she said, he fell to his knees and raised both arms
to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, motorist William Marr, who was wounded in the
head when Matasareanu commandeered his car on Archwood Street, came
to her porch, Lubensky said, prompting her to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:07 a.m., an ambulance arrived and treated Marr, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting about 10:10 a.m., she stood outside her house for
almost an hour, focusing almost exclusively on the robber and his
movements to see if he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking, moving his head and body; he was shouting
obscenities,'' followed by, ``Shoot me in the head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lubensky said she could not hear what police said in response.
</P>
<P>
   Lubensky said she went inside her house briefly on two
occasions, each time returning to see if Matasareanu was still
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu was officially pronounced dead at 11:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they plan to call a medical expert who
will refute Morgan's conclusions that the wounds were survivable.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan testified Friday that he had no expertise to judge how
police handled the crime scene after the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning by Futrell's attorney, Bradley Gage,
Morgan said he did not believe Futrell, who was assigned to guard
Matasareanu, did anything to cause the robber's death.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also said he did not believe Futrell prevented others
from giving him medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In his estimation, Morgan said it might have taken up to 45
minutes from the time paramedics were dispatched to help
Matasareanu to the time they could have brought him to a hospital.
They would probably arrive on scene within 10 minutes to begin
life-saving care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Matasareanu had a heart condition, it was not severe
enough to be a contributing factor in his death, Morgan said.

FINANCIAL ADVISERS SAY, TAKE LUMP SUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're feeling lucky. California's lotto jackpot is so big that
just thinking about winning an estimated $60 million brings on a
cold sweat. You're thinking, What would I do with all that cash?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you've got two options even before your numbers come up:
taking the cash up front or opting for the payout.
</P>
<P>
   So winning tonight's expected jackpot would net you about $30
million in a lump sum payment or 26 annual payments with the first
totaling $1.5 million and the second totaling $3 million, before
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of area financial planners said the decision is
relatively simple: Take the money up front and exercise some
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better to take the lump sum payment and invest
your winnings with the help of a financial planner,'' said Robert
Detterman, a certified financial planner with Bo-Gin Financial Inc.
in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ernst, a financial consultant with Sun America Securities
in Woodland Hills, also recommended taking the lump sum payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the advantage of the interest on the lump sum working
for you, instead of the interest working for the government,'' he
said. ``In the long run, you will come out ahead if you take the
lump sum.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth D. Gross agreed, saying the winner should invest the
money and receive a higher return than if he or she took 26
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (California Lottery officials) invest the lump sum in
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds, at about 5 percent interest,''
said Gross, a certified financial planner with Strategic Financial
in Thousand Oaks. ``You can average more than that on your own in a
conservative mutual fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking this approach on your own could turn that lump sum into
tens of millions of dollars over 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Gross said, when a lot of people come into a
large sum of money for the first time, it seems like all the money
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling how fast a million dollars can be spent,''
on the new house, fancy sports car, family and friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I'm the big winner, I'm taking the lump sum,'' said
Gross.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Minas, spokeswoman for the California Lottery Commission,
said the number of ticket buyers now choosing the cash up front
option has risen from 44 percent two years ago to 66 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   However, one analyst says annual payments could be a smarter
investment, depending on your knowledge and maturity when it comes
to money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a client who is financially immature, I will suggest
they take the annual payments,'' said Brent W. Kessell, a certified
financial planner with Santa Monica-based Abacus Wealth Management
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they spend every dollar for two or five or 10 years, there
is still money coming in to build a nest egg,'' he said. ``Also,
there is less emotional risk with annual payments.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to win tonight's lotto jackpot, the best
advice might be to seek professional advice before you begin
spending your millions.

PODEIN'S HAT TRICK KEYS AVALANCHE'S VICTORY OVER THE RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sagging New York Rangers needed a victory at
Madison Square Garden Friday night. Trailing by a goal after two
periods, they would probably have settled for a tie. But try as
they might, the Rangers could not find a way to beat Colorado
goalie Patrick Roy in the final period, and they wound up losing to
the Avalanche, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado's Shjon Podein completed his first hat trick with
just 2 minutes 37 seconds to play, he put the finishing touch on a
game that kept the Rangers sagging, if not staggering.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 games left in the regular season, the Rangers are eighth
in the Eastern Conference standings, but their hold on the final
playoff berth is slipping. Friday night's loss left them 0-3-1 in
their last four games, 1-4-1 in the six games since Brian Leetch
returned to the lineup and 3-7-2 since they won 9 of 10 games in 21
days last month.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-game experiment with Adam Graves at center, coach
John Muckler reverted to using the lines that had powered the
Rangers through a January spurt before the team sputtered this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Connection line of center Petr Nedved and wings Jan
Hlavac and Radek Dvorak remained. Graves skated at left wing with
Mike York at center and Theo Fleury at right wing. Alexandre Daigle
returned to the third line after being a healthy scratch Wednesday
night in Florida. And Tim Taylor centered the fourth line between
Eric Lacroix and Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were looking for production from a line other than
the Czech line, which had scored six of the Rangers' last nine
goals before Friday night. When the Rangers were winning 9 of 10
games from Jan. 5 to Jan. 25, including a span of seven straight
victories, all four lines were scoring. Lately, they had become a
one-line team.
</P>
<P>
   Not Friday night. Through two periods, the Czech line did not
register a shot on goal. Graves, meanwhile, celebrated his return
to left wing with his first goal since Feb. 2. It came 7 minutes 28
seconds into first period.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Graves' 18th, tying him with Nedved and York for
the team lead. It came on a deflection of a pass from York, who was
motoring down the right wing. Graves deflected the puck through the
legs of Roy.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not last long, however. Podein scored the first of
his three goals at 10:00 of the first period. The goal snapped a
13-game scoring drought for Podein, who was able to capitalize on a
mistake by Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Daigle has been on the ice lately, it seems, the
other team has scored. Before Podein scored, Daigle skated past a
loose puck in the neutral zone and failed to set up a 2-on-1 break.
Instead, the puck went back into the Rangers' zone, and when Daigle
and John MacLean fought each other for the puck, it eventually was
gathered by Podein, whose shot from the slot beat Mike Richter on
the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury had a chance to give the Rangers the lead again at the
end of the first period. Graves hooked Peter Forsberg off the puck
at center ice on a Colorado power play, setting Fleury up for a
short-handed breakaway. When these teams met in Denver on Nov. 5,
Fleury beat Roy on a breakaway, steamrollering the goaltender in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Fleury chose to pull up just off the goal mouth.
Fleury, who is in one of the worst slumps of his career, faked Roy
by moving the puck quickly from his forehand to his backhand
repeatedly before finally trying a forehand shot. Roy stopped it
with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury ended up smashing his stick at the other end of the ice
at the end of the period in what has become his customary response
to his bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Avalanche that took a 2-1 lead at 10:33 of
the second period on Podein's second goal of the game and eighth
this season. The play unfolded from a strong cycle by Podein's
line.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Aaron Miller jumped to the play to retrieve a puck
along the right boards. Podein took control of the puck behind the
Rangers' net, circled clockwise to just off the right post, and let
loose a wraparound shot that deflected off Richter and into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was held in check for most of the first two periods,
Nedved did draw a hooking penalty on Chris Drury at 11:37 of the
second to set up the Rangers' tying goal. It came from Kevin
Hatcher, who wristed a shot from the top of the slot through heavy
traffic and off the right post for his fourth goal. It came at
13:34 of the period, with just three seconds left in the power
play. And it evened the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Podein's line struck again at 17:58. He and Dave Reid broke
in on Richter on a 2-on-1 with Stephane Quintal back. Reid wanted
to pass to Podein to give him a chance at a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   But Quintal played the pass. So Reid scored on a backhander to
give Colorado a 3-2 lead. &QL;

 EDITORIAL: NEW LOOKS AT THE DEATH PENALTY  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America is at last beginning to grapple honestly with the
profound flaws of the death penalty system. Late last month, Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, became the first governor in
a death penalty state to declare a moratorium on executions, citing
well-founded concerns about his state's ``shameful record of
convicting innocent people and putting them on death row.'' That
has now been followed by moves in Congress and the executive branch
to review death penalty policies from a national perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin has urged President Clinton
to suspend all federal executions pending a review of death penalty
procedures similar to the one Ryan has initiated in Illinois.
Problems of inadequate legal representation, lack of access to DNA
testing, police misconduct, racial bias and even simple errors are
not unique to Illinois, Feingold noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has also initiated its own review to
determine whether the federal death penalty system unfairly
discriminates against racial minorities. At his news conference
this week, Clinton praised the death penalty moratorium in
Illinois, but indicated he thought a federal moratorium was
unnecessary. Feingold has urged him to reconsider. Given his
lame-duck status, the president can afford to call a halt without
worrying about being falsely labeled soft on crime. Moreover, the
fact that a Republican governor was first to announce a moratorium
should minimize any concern about Vice President Al Gore being so
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Congress need not wait for the administration to act. Last week
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., introduced legislation to address ``the
growing national crisis'' in how capital punishment is
administered. This promising measure, the Innocence Protection Act
of 2000, stops short of abolishing the death penalty, the course we
hope the nation will eventually follow. But key provisions would
lessen the chance of unfairness and deadly error by making DNA
testing available to both state and federal inmates, and by setting
national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are appointed
for capital defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Without such protections, there is a grave possibility of
judicial error. Nationally, 612 people have been executed since the
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. During the
same period, 81 people in 21 states have been found innocent and
released from death row _ some within hours of being executed. That
suggests that many who were executed might also have been innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the states nor the courts are providing adequate
protection against awful miscarriages of justice. In Texas, the
nation's leader in executions, courts have upheld death sentences
in cases where defense lawyers slept during big portions of the
trial. Lately, Congress and the Supreme Court have exacerbated the
danger of mistaken executions by curtailing appeal and habeas
corpus rights. They have also ignored the festering problem of
inadequate legal representation that caused the American Bar
Association to call for a death penalty moratorium three years ago.
Even death penalty supporters have to be troubled by a system shown
to have a high risk of executing the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Correction
</P>
<P>
   An editorial on Wednesday misidentified the South Carolina city
where Tuesday's Republican debate took place. It was Columbia, not
Charleston.

VIOLENT WRECKS CHALLENGE RACING'S SAFETY STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
 SAFETY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Texas Motor Speedway general manager Eddie Gossage
was not there the day Bobby Allison's car nearly cleared a catch
fence at the Talladega Superspeedway in May 1987. But he does have
a piece of memorabilia from that event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working for Bobby Allison at the time, and I got his
helmet from that race in my office,'' Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Allison's wreck returned yesterday after a wild, fiery
crash involving Geoffrey Bodine and 10 other trucks at the Daytona
International Speedway during the Daytona 250 NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series race.
</P>
<P>
   In a wreck that was eerily similar to Allison's, Bodine suffered
several broken bones, and nine fans were injured from flying
debris. The race was delayed nearly 21/2 hours while crews repaired
a 50-foot stretch of damaged catch fence.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecks like this are not unusual at Daytona and Talladega in
Winston Cup or Busch Grand National competition, but some were
concerned because the wreck occurred near fans along the
frontstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to a couple of things,'' Gossage said.
``The fence did its job. The truck did its job, and the safety
standards in place really performed excellent. \RThe fence\S did
what it was exactly designed to do, to keep the race truck, in this
instance, on the racetrack side of the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine's truck careened off the concrete wall in the tri oval,
or frontstretch section, of the 2.5-mile banked superspeedway and
flipped several times, catching fire. The wreck damaged a 150-foot
section of Daytona's 13-foot, wire mesh catch fence, with steel
poles snapping out of the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Four fans were treated at the infield care center and released.
Five others were transported to Halifax Medical Center, where three
were treated and released. Two spectators were undergoing surgery
last night _ one with a fractured left arm and another with a
facial laceration.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time at a major race in less than two years
where spectators were injured. And fan safety has been on the minds
of motorsports officials since two incidents in open-wheel racing
in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Truck circuit is scheduled to make a stop at TMS on June 9,
and the Winston Cup circuit makes its yearly stop April 2. Gossage
said he does not expect NASCAR to implement any changes to its
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't relate this accident \Ryesterday\S to the Michigan
and Charlotte accidents,'' Gossage said. ``I think it will be
analyzed and overanalyzed, and you have to be real careful
separating what is proper and what is not proper. You need to learn
from every single accident that takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Six spectators were killed and several were injured by flying
debris at a Championship Auto Racing Teams event in Michigan in
July 1998 and an Indy Racing League event at Lowe's Motor Speedway
in Concord, N.C. in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the incident at Lowe's Motor Speedway, all
Speedway Motorsports Inc. tracks, including TMS, that hosted IRL
events raised their catch fences to 20 feet with a 6-foot overhang.
But Daytona's fences were not raised because the track does not run
open-wheel events.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Allison's wreck, restrictor plates were mandated
for Winston Cup events at Daytona and Talladega. The trucks did not
have restrictor plates, like Winston Cup and Busch, but were still
reaching speeds close to 190 mph. At Texas Motor Speedway, the
trucks reached speeds near 180 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Until yesterday, no fan had been injured at a NASCAR race since
Allison's wreck, when a woman lost an eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with an inherently dangerous business ...
speed,'' Gossage said. ``It is not necessarily unique that an
accident like this happened. It was a pretty horrifying accident.
But Geoff Bodine drove Winston Cup cars without restrictor plates
and is a former Daytona 500 winner. We are not talking about a guy
who has questionable experience and skill.'' nn

IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL IS CHARGED AS SPY FOR CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS grafs 4 and 13 with Cuban response.) 
 (HLW) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was charged in
federal court on Friday with spying for the Cuban government, after
federal officials say he was caught in an elaborate sting passing
on what he thought was classified information about a Cuban's plan
to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mariano M. Faget, (pronounced fah-HAY) who was born in
Havana and left Cuba in his teens, is a senior official in the
Miami field office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Faget, who is 54, was arrested here late Thursday. The immigration
service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say they caught him
last week passing along to an otherwise unidentified ``Cuban-born
New York businessman'' false information they had fed him about a
Cuban intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was charged with violations of the Espionage Act and lying
to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Interests Section in Washington, in a statement,
denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Private individuals have been convicted of spying for Cuba, but
federal officials said they knew of no prior instance of an arrest
of American government official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for 24 years,'' said Terry Nelson, an FBI
spokesman, ``and I can't recall ever arresting a government
official _ especially an official with such access to immigrant
records.''
</P>
<P>
   As section chief for adjudications and the third-ranking officer
in the Miami office, Faget had access to classified files and the
authority to treat applications for political asylum. Thus he was
in a position to tell Havana of the plans of Cuban nationals to
defect and subject them to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing and officials said they did not
know of defections Faget might have blocked. ``It's too early to
tell if he did any damage, or what kind of damage he did,'' said
Carlos Zaldivar, a lawyer in the Miami office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who was scheduled to retire in March, made a telephone
call, recorded by the FBI, on Feb. 14 to the New York businessman,
then visiting Beijing. In the call, Faget said he had nothing new
to report about the Cuban spy.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the charges against Faget, Joe
Franklin, a agent for the FBI in Miami, wrote: ``The businessman
concluded the call by asking Faget, `You're still not leaving until
next month, right?' Faget answered, `Until next month. Yes. We have
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest is likely to stir the pot of Cuban-American
relations, already boiling because of the custody battle over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived his mother's drowning when
she fled Cuba with him in November. Elian's relatives here are
fighting in court for custody against the wishes of his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out about this, I laughed,'' said Jose Basulto,
president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that
supports the relatives. ``I'm sure there are many more spies out
there, hundreds, even thousands. This should really come in handy
for Elian's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement , the Cuban Interests Section called the
allega- tions ``a colossal and false slander,'' and said, ``We are
sure that it is no coincidence that these false accusa- tions are
surfacing during a critical moment for the return of little Elian
to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases are unrelated and investigation of Faget began more
than a year ago, the officials said. Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman
for the immigration service, said Faget ``has never been involved
in the Elian Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here and in a court affidavit, immigration
and FBI officials and U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott described a
year of investigating Faget after suspicions were raised by a
routine investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investigators say, they observed Faget meeting with a
Cuban intelligence officer for 90 minutes at Pitchers Bar at the
Miami Marriott Hotel and with a second officer for two hours in a
secluded area of the lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Miami. Faget
never disclosed the meetings to his superiors, the investigators
reported. He also was not authorized to meet the agents on
immigration service business, but the government did not report
whether the men discussed immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty on all the charges, he faces at least 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. Faget, who is being held in the
Federal Detention Center here, could not be reached for comment,
and no one answered the phone at his home. A woman at the office of
his lawyer, Joel Kaplan, said Kaplan was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Faget spent 34 years with the immigration service, climbing the
ranks from an entry level clerical job. In 1971, official records
show, he married Pitty Sanchez, who is also called Maria and is 52.
To all appearances, they live modestly in a white, two-story tract
house in the Amaretto subdivision in Kendall, southwest of Miami.
They bought the house in July 1998 for $134,000 and took a mortgage
of $107,000.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday, a green Hyundai sedan was parked in the
driveway, and The Miami Herald had not been retrieved from the
lawn. Children skating in the cul-de-sac said they often saw a man
and woman coming and going but that the couple exchanged no more
than the occasional greeting.

EDITORIAL: A REBUKE FOR MUGABE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 19:
</P>
<P>
   When Zimbabwe achieved independence from white minority rule in
1980 in what had been Rhodesia, its newly elected leader, Robert
Mugabe, held out the promise of transforming a state that was not
only racist but brutally authoritarian. Many hoped he could make
Zimbabwe a model for what was then still an apartheid-ruled South
Africa, on its southern border. The former guerrilla leader made
progress in dismantling the legacies of racism, but he maintained
the machinery of authoritarianism that he inherited from Rhodesia's
last white leader, Ian Smith, including sweeping emergency powers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two decades since independence, and Mugabe has long
since grown accustomed to autocratic power. He presides now over a
corrupt, sclerotic and repressive state that is rapidly driving
Zimbabwe into economic ruin. But Mugabe's disappointing dominance
of Zimbabwean politics is now under attack by his countrymen. This
week they convincingly defeated a constitutional referendum that
would have strengthened his executive powers and allowed him to
confiscate white-owned land without compensation. The vote was both
a stinging rebuke to Mugabe's leadership and a victory for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling opposition Movement for Democratic Change is led
by trade-union activists, church leaders and domestic human rights
organizations. It cuts across racial, ethnic and class divisions.
It had abundant ammunition with which to attack Mugabe's
leadership: fuel shortages, 60 percent inflation, more than 50
percent unemployment in urban areas and pervasive corruption. His
costly military intervention in Congo is deeply unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum did not signal the demise of Mugabe's government.
It still enjoys extensive powers of patronage and coercion, as well
as a monopoly on broadcast media. But Mugabe now faces the prospect
of elections for Parliament in April in which his dominant ZANU-PF
party will probably encounter its toughest challenge since
independence. He is expected to seek a fifth five-year term as
president in 2002. He has reason to cling to power. In today's
climate of prosecutions against former heads of state, he could
face criminal liability, both at home and abroad, for abuses
committed by his security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous decline of Zimbabwe's economy and fears of
political turmoil could undermine the hard-won stability of its
closest neighbors and trading partners, notably Mozambique and
South Africa. The United States and other democracies can help by
using their influence to discourage Mugabe from manipulating the
democratic process. This week he sounded a conciliatory note and
promised to ``respect the will of the people.'' Perhaps he has
gotten the message that his countrymen have lost patience with his
autocratic rule.

SECOND EMPLOYEE LINKED TO GIFT-GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS and TED MILLER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A second employee of Seattle businessman Barry
Henthorn's telecommunications company has been connected to an NCAA
investigation into favors and gifts provided to Michigan basketball
player Jamal Crawford, sources told the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Charles McLennan, who works out of Henthorn's
Innovative Communications Technologies offices on Sixth Avenue,
refused to comment when asked by the P-I about his role in
delivering a 1988 Mercedes to Crawford at Michigan late last year.
</P>
<P>
   When Crawford tried to register the car on campus, university
authorities launched an inquiry into who provided the car and
discovered Crawford's relationship with Hen-thorn. McLennan's name
surfaced this week when a source with business connections to
Henthorn told the P-I that McLennan had talked about delivering the
car, valued at about $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is investigating Henthorn, who provided cash, jewelry
and cars to Crawford, starting when Crawford was at Rainier Beach
High School. On Thursday, the NCAA interviewed Henthorn's former
administrative assistant, Darcienne LeRoue, about three loans she
cosigned with Crawford at Hen-thorn's request.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, totaling $10,097, were used to buy a 1985 Chevy
Blazer, gold jewelry and provide cash to Crawford. LeRoue is suing
Henthorn in King County District Court contending she wasn't fully
reimbursed for the loans and that Henthorn coerced her into signing
them to conceal his identity from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA investigation will have to consider whether the actions
of Henthorn and his employees violated Crawford's status as an
amateur or if Henthorn was acting as an agent. The NCAA also could
rule that Henthorn was acting only as a quasi-guardian for the
freshman basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn previously told the P-I he is confident he will be
vindicated, and maintains he has no interest in becoming an agent
for Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   However, McLennan's actions, which fall outside of his duties as
an employee of ICT, further show that Henthorn employees acted in
the interest of Crawford on multiple occasions.
</P>
<P>
   When first contacted Thursday by the P-I, McLennan refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask me questions all you want. I'm not going to answer
them,'' he said. ``You're going to print what you want anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The P-I later called McLennan at the ICT offices and tried to
ask him about the delivery of the Mercedes, but he did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan, who also represents Henthorn's cellular phone service,
was known to have attended Crawford's basketball games and
practices when the player was at Rainier Beach, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   After finding out about the Mercedes, Michigan suspended
Crawford for one game and reported the car to the NCAA. The NCAA
added five games to the suspension and ordered Crawford to return
the car and repay Hen-thorn about $15,000. It then launched a new
probe in Seattle because of the P-I's discovery of the loans and
Henthorn's ``Academic Assistance Foundation,'' a non-profit
organization apparently set up to help Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's suspension is due to expire Thursday. If the NCAA
hasn't completed its investigation by then, the university will
have to determine whether to allow him to play that night against
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn has repeatedly denied the foundation had begun
operation, even though the P-I obtained documents, including a
scholarship acceptance agreement, that used the foundation's name.
Henthorn called the brochure a ``mock-up'' and wouldn't comment on
the acceptance agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford has told Michigan officials that, with the permission
of his mother, he lived in Hen-thorn's Edmonds home in high school.
Before the revelations about the loans and foundation, university
officials tried to show that Henthorn was essentially Crawford's
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn has asserted throughout that his only motivations were
to help Crawford graduate high school and attend college.

KINGS BEAT RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There were eight inches of snow on the ground and even
tougher sledding inside Joe Louis Arena, but nothing is
intimidating the Los Angeles Kings right now.
</P>
<P>
   Their quest for a playoff spot was fortified Friday night by
defeating Detroit 3-2 for their fifth straight victory and beating
the mighty Red Wings for the second time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a surprise blowout before the All-Star break,
but this game had all the trappings of postseason hockey, the kind
the Kings will see if they can bottle this momentum for the final
25 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in many playoff games, but I knew I was in one
tonight,'' defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. ``They came at us
physically and with all the skill of a two-time Stanley Cup
champion. But we don't back down anymore. We know we can play with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit got the sellout crowd of 19,983 going when it tied the
game midway through the second period, but Luc Robitaille scored
the Kings' third goal less than two minutes into the third. It was
his 30th of the year and his sixth game-winner in the team's last
nine victories.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray tried to taper his enthusiasm for beating his
idol Scotty Bowman by reminding everyone that the Kings play the
Buffalo Sabres tonight in the third game of their longest trip of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But even Murray, who is battling the flu, had to crack a smile
before boarding the team bus, saying, ``I hope they are enjoying
this, this was an exciting game against a great team on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings also entered the game with four consecutive
victories and were intent on letting muscleman Darren McCarty pound
on the Kings all night. But like their win against Chicago on
Wednesday, the Kings took the hits and kept on skating.
</P>
<P>
   They got caught early, allowing a power-play goal by Steve
Yzerman in a five-on-three situation with Norstrom and Rob Blake
off the ice. But they took just two penalties in the final two
periods, two less than McCarty had in the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again the maturity showed down the stretch,'' said Bob Corkum,
who won several critical faceoffs in the final minutes. ``They were
taking it to us, trying to intimidate us. But with Steph in net and
a solid defense, that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (28-22-7) had won their last four with goaltender
Jamie Storr but decided to go with Stephane Fiset, who hadn't
started since his shaky Feb. 8 loss to the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset admitted he was queasy before the game and nervous with
six minutes left when Yzerman, the Red Wings' leading scorer, bore
down on the Kings net. Yzerman saw an opening between Fiset's legs,
``but I closed my pads in time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after they scored first, I relaxed because our defense
has been so good,'' said Fiset, who stopped 33 of 35 shots.
``Detroit didn't get any second shots and that is all a goalie can
asked for. This team played great in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 1-0 after one period, the Kings scored twice during a
54-second stretch early in the second. Ian Laperriere, among the
league leaders in penalty minutes (155), took his linebacker's
approach by beating Chris Osgood before crashing into the Red
Wings' net.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Bryan Smolinski fed Glen Murray in the slot and
Murray beat Osgood for his 20th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outshot the Kings and held them to 0 for 7 on the power
play. But they also lost Sergei Fedorov early in the third period
when he suffered a sprained left knee and bruised right hand
crashing into the boards with Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights it's the Red Wings doing the hitting, but they were
so frustrated by the end, Brendan Shanahan received a misconduct
penalty for yelling at the referees after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep this up,'' Robitaille said. ``We know we
can get where we want to go.''

LAKERS GAMER

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It should have been enough that Shaquille O'Neal
carried the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday with the usual array of
dunks, rebounds and swats. But against the scrappy, frenzied
Orlando Magic, it took another, extraordinary dimension of O'Neal's
repertoire to steal a game here.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it took an extraordinary steal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were down by two with 17.4 seconds to go, and a loss
looming as the Magic had possession. Then O'Neal skipped in front
of Ron Mercer's inbounds pass at midcourt, slapped the ball away
from Michael Doleac, chased it down and threw down a one-handed jam
at the other end to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was near pandemonium on the Laker bench, and total shock for
the Magic, who never recovered from the jolt. O'Neal scored seven
points in the extra period as the Lakers pulled out a 107-99
victory, their sixth ina row.
</P>
<P>
   How giddy was O'Neal? Enough to give himself a new nickname for
the 10th time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My new name,'' he said, ``is `The Big Felon,' because of my
stealing ability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was almost out of reach, and I knew that they were
going to try to throw it to Doleac. He stepped out, and I just
stepped in front of him. And luckily I got it, tapped it and ran it
down. ... It was a sweet moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also had 39 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, three
blocks and another impressive free-throw performance _ 9 for 13,
including 3 for 4 in the fourth quarter and a 3-point play in
overtime. (His streak is now 41 of 54 _ 75.9 percent _ over four
games.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was The Steal that saved the Lakers (40-11) on a night
when no one could stop Magic guard Darrell Armstrong (24 points)
and no one could find Kobe Bryant (season-low 11 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' Bryant said of O'Neal's steal. ``I didn't
expect it _ what the hell is he doing? ... That's the first time
I've ever seen a7-footer hop in the passing lane. ...He got the
steal pretty quickly, which really caught me off-guard, then when
he was chasing the ball, like the first two steps, it looked like
he was in slow-mo.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of O'Neal and a rejuvenated Glen Rice (26
points), the Lakers built as much as an 11-point lead and were up
86-81 with 1:32 remaining in regulation after Robert Horry hit a
20-footer.
</P>
<P>
   But a Mercer tip-in and a Pat Garrity 3-pointer tied the game
with 45 seconds left, and the LakUfrI1e

MARTIN STARTING TO FIND THE GOING A BIT SMOOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casey Martin doesn't think he ever will be viewed
simply as just a member of the PGA Tour, but the spotlight has
dimmed on the Guy With the Cart.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's second round of the Nissan Open at Riviera
Country Club, there were no photographers or television cameras
chronicling his every move as they did at January's Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic. Martin was allowed to play golf with no
distractions, and his solid, 3-under-par 68 left him only six shots
off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention has definitely died down, which it should,'' he
said. ``I'm not the story right now. It should be the guys who are
playing. Hopefully, I'll get in contention and get a little
attention that way. But right now, there's no reason for me to be
getting stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was !ital!the!off! story at the start of the season. He
had had won the right to ride a cart during tour events because a
circulatory condition in his right leg _ Klippel-Trenauny-Webber
Syndrome _ makes it painful to walk. The PGA Tour appealed the
decision, and a court ruling is expected within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He has played in three events, missing the cut twice. He has
only $6,400 in earnings for his tie for 69th at the Phoenix Open in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hit the ball beautifully Friday and missed only one
fairway his first hole of the day but inconsistent putting
continued to be his nemesis. He missed three birdies inside 10 feet
and two attempts for par inside eight feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hitting a lot of good shots,'' he said. ``I'm just
not making a lot of putts ... I haven't been this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are looking up, on and off the course. Martin is
expected to join Terry Jastro's staff of Jack Nicklaus Productions,
which produces events like the Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge, Diners
Club Matches and Shell's Wonderful World of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   He also made his share of putts Friday, with birdies from four
feet on the fifth hole, eight feet on nine, five feet on No. 13 and
a curling, downhill 15-footer on the 451-yard 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Martin even showed his impressive length off the tee by driving
just off the green on the 315-yard 10th hole. He chipped to within
two feet and made it for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is feeling more refreshed after deciding to skip last
week's event in San Diego and is more confident in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better now, a little bit,'' he said. ``I needed a
break. I'm playing the next two weeks (Tucson and Doral), and that
would have been six in a row, and that's not reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was the earlier media spotlight, he said, despite
expecting the worst and getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is getting out here and getting adjusted to that,''
he said. ``I knew it and I was prepared for it, so it wasn't a
shock. If my life had to be like that every day like down in Palm
Springs, that would be tough. I couldn't keep playing with as much
attention as I had the first couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to be totally where I'm looked at as a normal
guy, but hopefully more so I can just get out here and play well
... feel like I'm capable. I think the cart thing will fade a
little bit, but not totally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared for it to never totally go away.''

DUCKS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks insist it's too early
to label any game a must-win, but Friday's game against the San
Jose Sharks was as close as it gets at this point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the Ducks do? They play one of their most
unsatisfying ties in years, blowing two leads and settling for a
4-4 tie before 16,868 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Salei nearly became the unlikely hero when he scored at
12:16 of the third period to give the Ducks a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim, desperately trying to stay close in the Western
Conference playoff race, couldn't hold that lead as San Jose tied
the game with 2:22 left when Niklas Sundstrom knocked in a rebound
that Ducks goalie Guy Hebert couldn't control.
</P>
<P>
   A victory had seemed certain when the Ducks took a 3-1 lead into
the third period against a Sharks team that was 0-18-1 when
trailing after 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But things suddenly got silent at the Pond when Tony Granato set
up young defenseman Scott Hannan for his first NHL goal at 2:28 of
the period to cut the Ducks' lead to 3-2. There was more silence at
5:16 when Vincent Damphousse, from behind the goal line, banked a
shot off Hebert's pads to tie the game 3-3. The goal was
Damphousse's first in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose came into the game with a 6-12-3-5 record in its last
21 games and the the Ducks seemed to smell blood from the
beginning, even though it took them over 26 minutes to break
through.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had five power plays and outshoot the Sharks 14-2 in the
first period, but they had nothing to show for it until Matt Cullen
scored on an inside-out move at 6:08 to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead
on their 19th shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen was knocked down at the San Jose blue line but swept the
puck to Ted Donato, who got it to Kip Miller. Miller then set
Cullen up with a mini-breakaway and the Anaheim center scored his
career-high 12th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made it 2-0 on their 21st shot, just nine seconds
after Ronnie Stern took San Jose's sixth minor penalty of the game.
Oleg Tverdovsky made a perfect shot-pass and Teemu Selanne,
positioned at the left post, tipped home his 24th goal of the year
at 6:38.
</P>
<P>
   The goal extended Selanne's point-scoring streak to 13 games and
it marked the 10th consecutive game that the Ducks have scored on
the power play, one short of the franchise record.

MAVERICKS QUICK TO STAND UP FOR RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks knew the Dennis Rodman questions were
forthcoming, so they braced themselves accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Mavericks won 10 times in their previous 13 games
before Rodman arrived on the scene. Yes, the Mavericks are 0-2 with
Rodman in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Mavericks beat up the Detroit Pistons _ 106-97
without a suspended Rodman _ the questions were bound to pop up and
hit them with the same impact as a Rodman headbutt.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, as if it was rehearsed, the Mavericks players
repeatedly said they're a much better team with Rodman on the
court. Over and over, they defended owner Mark Cuban's decision to
give The Worm one last turn in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And they all say it's just going to take some time before Rodman
become the smooth operator he is expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to integrate a guy into a team, and after two games
decide that he's hurt our team,'' guard Steve Nash said. ``I think
that's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis eventually is going to be very good for us. It's just a
situation where it's a coincidence \Rthat the Mavericks are winning
without Rodman\S, and nothing should be made more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Cedric Ceballos said he saw some situations during the
Pistons' game where Rodman would have been a factor on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got some key rebounds when they got offensive rebounds,
and he probably would have taken care of that,'' Ceballos said.
``But he's here to help us out, and he's definitely going to help
us out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scrambled and did some things to help us win the
\RDetroit\S ballgame, and scored in the fourth quarter. It was the
same situation in those other two games; we just didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Erick Strickland said he expected the question of the team
being better off without Rodman to crop up as soon as the Mavericks
beat the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of figured that probably was going to happen,''
Strickland said. ``But we can't worry about that. We just have to
go out and try to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was at practice yesterday after serving a one-game
suspension for not leaving the court in a timely fashion after he
was kicked out of Tuesday's game against Milwaukee. And he was
talking about talk show host Jay Leno, who is keeping a tab on how
many days it takes before Rodman has an ``incident'' on or off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay is a very good friend,'' Rodman said. ``He's always tried
to keep me out there. Just the other day he called me and asked me
to come on the show. So I might go on his show next week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jay Leno Show'' is taped Monday through Friday. Monday the
Mavericks are scheduled to play in Indiana and arrive home early
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Mavericks are scheduled to practice for Thursday's
game against Utah, and they also have a home game a week from today
against Denver. So, if Rodman plans to travel to California, next
week, that might be a tricky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Mavericks knew what they were getting when they
signed the power forward/actor/wrestler/promoter, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what he brought to our team,'' All-Star guard Michael
Finley said. ``Without him \R against Detroit\S everybody had to
take it up a notch _ from rebounding, to outscraping them and doing
all of the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played over 40 games without him, and it's tough for any
player who didn't play for a year,'' forward Dirk Nowitzki said.
``He just has to learn our system and learn our games, how we
shoot, when we shoot, where we shoot and where the rebounds go. I
think if he does that he'll fit in great.''

STARS MISS CHANCE TO HURT COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For most of this season, the Stars chased the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed them by this much or that much in the Pacific
Division until finally catching them before the All-Star break,
starting to pull away after it, and then had a chance to really
take control with a victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, losing 4-3 instead. Instead of jumping to a
six-point lead , the Stars' advantage in the division dwindled to
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would've been a real shot to them,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``But again we always find a way to make it
interesting coming down the stretch. It's going to be one of those
fights to the bitter end to try to salvage points and stay right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating part was the Stars had them. The Coyotes were on
the ropes after Modano scored the game-tying goal at 9:52 of the
third period. His was the third goal, which had ensured them
victory in 43 consecutive games until last night.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes winger Dallas Drake made sureit didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Drake unleashed a quick shot that slipped between Ed Belfour's
elbow and stomach with 2:55 remaining in the game. Belfour allowed
four goals on 20 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it wasn't one of my better performances,'' said
Belfour, who hasn't had too many bad ones this season. ``We just
broke down a little defensively. I didn't come up with the saves I
normally do. I put pressure on myself to make those saves, and I
didn't make them tonight. So I guess I'll have to take the blame
for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a little of the blame should also go to the rest of the
defense. Not even the return of captain Derian Hatcher could save
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he felt slow in his first game back after being
sidelined for nine weeks with a lacerated calf muscle. When asked
what the hardest part was after being gone so long, though, Hatcher
didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said they deserved a better fate. He
figured the Stars had three breakdowns all night and the Coyotes
got three goals out of them. The Stars allowed the Coyotes one
solid scoring chance in the third period and they capitalized on
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were playing desperate. Truth be told, they were
desperate. Their 2-0 loss to the Stars right before the All-Star
break was gnawing at a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came into our barn and they schooled us on how to play
defense,'' Coyotes winger Shane Doan said. ``Tonight, we came here
and knew we had to get some points.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan scored the first of his two goals at 8:26 of the first
period. Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor answered at 9:33. Drake
scored at 17:29 of the first period, but Stars rookie Roman
Lyashenko answered at 6:47 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were then able to kill 6:32 of Coyotes' power plays,
including 1:26 of a 5-on-3. They did. But 33 seconds after the last
kill, Doan scored for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Four times, the Coyotes took leads. Three times, the Stars tied
it.
</P>
<P>
   The final Stars goal _ that tied the game at 3-all _ was a
beauty, displaying the type of player Modano has been for the past
month. Lyashenko sent him a pass just as he was crossing the blue
line. Modano danced past Coyotes defenseman Todd Gill, zeroing in
on goalie Sean Burke, who shadowed Modano, following him to the
near post. Modano, however, simply threaded the puck inside the
other one at 9:52 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars looked to have everything going for them except for
the one thing the Coyotes had been carrying since the All-Star
break _ fear.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes didn't really talk about it but the unspoken filled
the room before the game. They knew if didn't win, they were in
trouble in the race for first place in the Pacific and the much
more favorable seed that comes along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said. ``You know a
six-point deficit with only 25, 26 games left, against this team is
tough. This is going to make it rather interesting.'' nn

TO STARS, IT'S DEJA BOO, AS COYOTES SCORE LATE FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 SIDEBAR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas Drake couldn't explain his team's second dose of
late-game heroics against the NHL's premier defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   But his goal with less than three minutes to play helped the
Phoenix Coyotes defeat the Stars at Reunion Arena for the second
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great pass by \RJeremy Roenick\S,'' Drake said after
the 4-3 victory. ``I just tried to shoot it high.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, zipping the puck between Ed Belfour's glove and face
mask. Drake robbed the Stars of the momentum they had captured when
Mike Modano tied the score at 3-3 at the 9:52 mark. Roenick said
the Coyotes felt comfortable with the game tied, but emerged from
Modano's goal as the more aggressive offensive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never sit back against this team; you never feel
comfortable against them,'' Roenick said. ``They play hard, and
they have a lot of power. We had to make sure we just kept at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final period wore on and overtime looked to be on the
way, Roenick won possession of the puck along the boards in the
Stars' zone. He sent a centering pass to Drake, who was positioned
low in the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pass from the corner into the slot, a quick shot,''
goalie Ed Belfour said. ``It went in between my elbow and my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The game winner sent grim reminders of the previous time the
Coyotes swept into town and stole two points with two goals late in
third period for a 3-2 victory Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just adds to our overall frustration against them knowing
that we've had opportunities to close them out and finish the game
and come from behind, and kind of take momentum away and take the
game away,'' Modano said. ``Those late goals are kind of
back-breakers. It's something that can really give teams a lot of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes fended off a possible six-point deficit and cut the
Stars' division to lead to two points. They finished with 20 shots
on goal and only six in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Just 23 seconds prior to Drake's game winner, Belfour made a
save on a Shane Doan backhand, keeping him from a attaining a hat
trick after scoring goals in the first and second periods. But the
Coyotes weren't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept working, kept working and we had a never-say-die
attitude,'' Roenick said. ``We knew we played a sound game all the
way through, and Dallas just made a fantastic shot. They beat us
twice in our building, and we've beaten them twice in their
building. We just went for it.'' nn

LONGER COURSES ARE SHORTSIGHTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The short of it is, long doesn't play well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, longer holes are the fashion these days, and as your
average distance golfer is learning anew, it's hard to buck
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   If Riviera Country Club officials determine their course has
dried up enough that they anticipate greater roll today, they are
set to unveil longer tees at a pair of holes in the third round of
the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   This comes under the heading of moderizing older, traditional
courses. Some have referred to it as ``Tiger Proofing,'' as if the
extra yards would bring Tiger Woods and his group of long-ball
hitters back to the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is becoming a power game,'' said Tom Scherrer. ``You look
at the Top Ten guys in the world, they're athletes. They're strong
_ Greg Norman, Nick Price, Tiger, Ernie (Els), (Nick) Faldo. There
are fit guys. There aren't too many big bellies.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is, golfers are bigger and stronger. The equipment is
better. They drive the ball longer than in past generations.
</P>
<P>
   So established courses from Riviera to Torrey Pines to Augusta
have all taken to making some of their holes longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any sport, you can look at it over the last 20 years, and
the athletes are getting bigger and stronger,'' said Corey Pavin.
``Yet they haven't changed the size of a tennis court. They haven't
changed the size of a basketball court. They haven't changed the
size of a football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why go changing a golf course? There are other ways to do
it on the golf course. Making a course long just to make it long,
under the guise of making it harder, is really going the wrong
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many golfers favor the longer holes, most maintain the
ultimate result is the exact opposite of the desired goal.
</P>
<P>
   Head golf pro Todd Yoshitake said Riviera plans to add 38 yards
to the 418-yard, par-4 ninth hole, and 50 yards to the 413-yard,
par-4 12th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several golfers say a long-ball hitter like Woods can still
hit a 300-yard tee shot and use a more accurate, lower club for his
second shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lengthening the golf courses ends up backfiring,'' said Mark
Brooks. ``It actually takes more people out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the bashers who keep rising to the top.
That's kind of unfortunate. To me, that's not the skill factor the
game was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think our trend has gotten to where the bashers have a
distinct advantage. The game is played in the air, you don't play
the ball on the ground anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, who ranked 38th in driving distance on the PGA tour
last year with a 278-yard average, is in favor of courses growing
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to bomb your tee shot, so it favors the longer
hitter,'' Els said. ``I don't think Fred Funk is too excited about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8 Funk was first in driving accuracy last season ...
but tied for 137th in distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think lengthening the course is the easiest way of
making it tougher, but it isn't,'' Price said. ``It just plays
right into the hands of the long hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dead against making courses longer. I think it's very
short-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the two current longer holes, Yoshitake said Riviera will
continue to update its course next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to protect the architecturl design of the original
George Thomas course from 1926,'' Yoshitake said. ``We're trying to
take it back to its original design and shot value he wanted.
Determine the intent of the hole, and then incorporate that back
into the modern course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to give anyone a playing advantage. We want a
design the whole field can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pavin, Brooks and others maintain the greens at nine and 12
don't lend themselves to receiving a long iron shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at this course and you have no idea who's going
to win here,'' Pavin said. ``It could be anybody. And that to me,
is the sign of a great golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for lengthening a golf course just to lengthen it. I
know they want to get a U.S. Open here, but I think there are other
ways to make a course harder to play than lengthening the golf
course. All you have to do is grow a little rough and narrow the
fairways a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying they're trying to `Tiger-proof' courses by
making them longer. All that does is make them easier for guys who
hit them long.''

NORTHRIDGE ROLLS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. _ Hey, how about it. A strategy that worked
perfectly. Not too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to go in the paint and score. Pick up fouls. Then
go back in again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team didn't fail
against Montana State on Friday night, pummeling the Bobcats 86-62
in front of 3,522 at Worthington Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a term for our guys, sometimes we go to the `E.W.O.
Offense,'which is the easy way out,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell
said. ``We tend to go away from being strong and aggressive
(inside) and we want to shoot a bunch of jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to come in and establish the inside game. To work
hard. To make (the Bobcats) have to defend us on the inside, and
hopefully covert some of that and put pressure on them on the other
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge did that, getting a combined 38 points from forwards
Jeff Parris, who had a team-leading 17, Hewitt Rolle (12) and Andre
Larry (nine).
</P>
<P>
   Northridge broke a two-game losing streak and improved to 7-5 in
the Big Sky Conference, 15-8 overall. CSUN also doesn't have any
regular-season road games left, and it is 9-0 at home this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, physically and in the standings, we needed a win
bad,'' said Parris, who was aggressive but under control; he didn't
foul out for the first time in three games. ``All the other games
(on the losing streak) we were making stupid mistakes. In past
games, those negative things affected us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. CSUN never allowed Montana State (12-14, 4-9) a
chance to breathe. The reeling Bobcats, who have lost five in a
row, suffered through their worst loss against CSUN in the series'
14-game history that spans 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to us how many we win by,'' Braswell said.
``Our goal is that we just play well, that we play hard with a lot
of good energy. That we play together, unselfish and we play smart.
We haven't always done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging signs were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN shot 56 percent its best percentage from the floor since a
sizzling 68 percent performance at Idaho State on Jan. 8. The
Matadors had 25 assists and only 15 turnovers, while forcing the
Bobcats into 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge wasn't this dominant since a 76-57 win at Sacramento
State on Jan. 27. At one point, CSUN led MSU 80-52.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, (this game) gives us confidence,'' said Rolle, who
tied for the team lead in rebounds, with six. ``Confidence to go
home and do what we have to do. We needed this.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, already flying high with a 16-point halftime lead (42-26),
made four of its first five shots to open the second half and led
50-26 with a little over 18 minutes left. The Matadors didn't score
their 50th point in Thursday night's overtime loss at Montana until
the 5:55 mark of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State helped CSUN build a big lead with awful shooting;
the Bobcats made only three of their first 14 shots and the
Matadors led 27-7 only 11 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for MSU. Junior forward Jason Lazosky, tied for the
team lead in scoring, picked up his third foul with 5:14 left in
the half. Twenty-four seconds later, Larry slammed home an
alley-oop pass from Markus Carr and Northridge led 35-15.
</P>
<P>
   Lazosky, who averages 14.6 points per game, got his fourth foul
less than a minute into the second half and finished with five
points in just 15 minutes.

LESSONS COME IN MANY FORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You follow Tiger Woods around Riviera Country Club
for the same reason you never missed Nolan Ryan when he came to
town and you never miss Mark McGwire. And it's not to watch a
four-hit shutout or a smartly executed hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   You come to witness a chapter in history.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, at Riviera's 13th hole, Ryan's no-hitter was
broken up and McGwire's fly ball died at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his gallery, packed five-deep along the narrow yellow
ropes, sensed he was gathering momentum after an early birdie,
Woods came apart on the fourth hole of a day that had begun at the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to that,'' a young man beside the green said
after Woods, forced to scramble, left a chip on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, you can relate to every bad shot they hit,'' his son
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Woods ran his chip _ an attempt to save par _ 6 feet past the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Louis,'' the dad said, rapping his boy on the top of his
Yankees cap, ``when he hits a bad shot he doesn't throw his club
and roll around on the ground.'' Touche!
</P>
<P>
   Woods missed the uphill bogey putt to the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The !ital!one!off! hole we see,'' the mom of the family
groaned, ``and he gets a double bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no 59 Friday. No dramatic charge to the lead of
the Nissan Open, either. No perfect game, no home run over the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   That double-bogey 6 left Woods six strokes off the lead around
lunchtime. Later birdies on the first and eighth holes gave him a
1-under-par 70 for the day and a 4-under total of 138. He'll begin
the weekend in a tie for 24th, five strokes behind co-leaders Bob
Tway and Greg Chalmers.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell, he was talking about all the makeable puts that
slid past the hole or lipped out, talking about trying to ``get
myself in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, especially by the standards of a player who's
won six of his past seven tournaments, he is in the tournament.
Look at the names on top of him on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   The top six _ Tway, Chalmers, J.P. Hayes, Jeff Freeman, Tom
Scherrer and Bradley Hughes _ have eight PGA Tour victories in
their careers; Tway accounts for seven of those. Tiger has 17.
</P>
<P>
   None of the leaders has won a tournament since Hayes in the
rain-shortened Buick Classic at Westchester Country Club in New
York in 1998. Tiger has won 10 since then.
</P>
<P>
   He might blow past them all by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to be breathing on them right now.
</P>
<P>
   That double-bogey wrecked the day _ for Tiger and most of the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th is one of Riviera's more treacherous holes because of
the gully to the left of the fairway. But that's not what got Tiger
in trouble. His iron from the tee stopped in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   His 9-iron approach shot drifted into the gallery to the right
of the green and came to rest under somebody's backpack. He
insisted he didn't try to be too fine when he chipped to the
smallest part of the green and came up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a good lie at all (in the rough),'' Woods said,
``one of those lies where it could have come out soft like it did
or it could have come out jumpy and hot and go over the other side.
I just tried to play a nice little one up there, somewhere on the
green ... I definitely wasn't trying to get cute at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At less than his best, Tiger is worth watching anyway, if only
to chart the perfectly focused athlete's response to blown
opportunities. Missed birdie putts produced, variously, a putter
flip at the 12th green, an exasperated spread of the arms at the
14th, a jab at the ground at the sixth, a putter flip back over his
head at the seventh, and an indeciferable mumble at the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After each disappointment, though, he'd stare back up the
fairway, into a space free of fans and photographers, and gather
his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really frustrated with the putts not going in,''
Woods said. ``The only thing getting on my nerves is the ball not
going in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Tiger trivia: The double bogey was his first of 2000, his
worst hole since a triple bogey in November during the World Golf
Championships in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   More Tiger trivia: He !ital!won!off! that tournament in Spain.

KINGS BLOWOUT DROPS SONICS FROM FOURTH TO SEVENTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ At one point this season, the Sonics seemed
offended they weren't scheduled more for national television.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly how you change the minds of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their rare appearances on TNT this season, the Sonics
continued a trend of recent weeks: They played poorly after a big
victory, this time in a 118-85 pasting by the up-and-coming
Sacramento Kings Friday night in ARCO Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics weren't in tune to the fast-breaking Kings, lacking
enough energy and shooting touch to avoid having a two-game winning
streak severed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In front of people around the country, to come out and play
like this is a shame,'' Sonics guard Brent Barry said. ``The
upsetting thing is we talked about being the more focused team and
not having these lapses. ... To come down here and not be
competitive leaves a bad taste in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the national exposure, the game was important because
Seattle entered the game just a game ahead of Sacramento for the
fourth seed in the Western Conference playoff standings. The loss
dropped the Sonics to seventh in the West.
</P>
<P>
   These teams could meet in the first round of the playoffs, and
the difference between the fourth and fifth seeds could come down
to which team wins the season series.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento has beaten Seattle twice this season. The teams have
two games remaining on the schedule, one each at home, and the
Sonics need to win both games to make tie-breaker rules relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem Friday was containing Sacramento's 3-point
shooters. Another issue for the Sonics was matching the Kings'
bench power _ the Kings' reserves outscored the Sonics, 56-22.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shot just 35 percent for the game and turned the ball
over 18 times, makingthe Kings look dominant in every facet of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about us missing shots,'' Sonics forward Vin
Baker said. ``I'm worried about us playing defense this late in the
season ... especially with us trying to position ourselves for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help matters that Sonics point guard Gary Payton
followed his best offensive game as a pro with one of his worst. He
made just four of 19 shots, a performance compounded by a weak eye
from beyond the 3-point stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Payton missed six of seven 3-pointers and finished with 13
points in 41 minutes. His futile shooting came two days after he
lit up KeyArena for a career-high 41 against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect our Superman to carry the load every night,''
Barry said. ``We've got to have other guys contribute. Gary can't
win every game. But I'll be damned if he doesn't try.''
</P>
<P>
   With Payton struggling, Baker and Barry stepped up. Barry scored
a team-high 21 points and Baker added 19 points and eight rebounds.
However, the Sonics had little else offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing shots is one thing. Playing defense is another,''
Sonics center Horace Grant said. ``If you don't play defense and
you miss shots, you're going to get blown out every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hardly looked as though they had suffered a tough loss
at Utah the night before. Sacramento was high octane while the
Sonics, who hadn't played since Tuesday, seemed to run on fumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought they were going to be fatigued because they
played Utah,'' Grant said. ``They wanted the game more than we did.
I mean, they aren't known as a great defensive team, but we made
them look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed just 29-23 after the first quarter, but let
the game slip away in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 31-28, the Sonics were outscored 31-16 the rest of the
period. Sacramento made its 62-44 halftime lead hold up by beating
the Sonics in transition and forcing turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics made one minor run, scoring the first 10 points in
the third quarter to cut the Kings' 18-point lead to 62-54 with
9:03 left. But Chris Webber stopped the outburst with a 19-foot
jumper in front of the Sonics' bench.
</P>
<P>
   Webber then tipped in his own miss after a Sonics turnover, and
the Kings pounced again. Sacramento raced to an 82-61 lead just
before the end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson's 3-pointer with 3:14 left in the fourth buried
the Sonics under a 101-79 deficit. Sacramento's biggest lead was 34
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lousy game,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
``Give them credit, but we didn't do what we had to do to hang
around.''

CHANGE COMING SLOWLY TO TRADITION-BOUND SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (REMOVES information about flag in 15th graf) &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The freeways through South Carolina would be
indistinguishable from anywhere else were it not for the Church of
Christ-sponsored signs from God and the billboards for Maurice's
Gourmet Piggie Park Bar-B-Q.
</P>
<P>
   The trees are bare from winter, McDonald's are omnipresent and,
but for the lack of snow, the view from the bubble of the campaign
bus is much the same as it was in Iowa or New Hampshire, the last
two proving grounds in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the political terrain is fundamentally different in this
state where the Civil War began, where abortion is regarded by many
as murder and where the political spectrum ranges from fiscal
conservative to religious conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in South Carolina, locals like to boast, is a blood
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, the lieutenant governor gunned down the editor of the
State newspaper in broad daylight on Main Street. The prosecutor,
who could not find a jury that would convict, was a fellow named
Thurmond, whose son Strom has been elected to public office _ as
state senator, governor and U.S. senator _ in every election since
1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is South Carolina. `Change and reform' is not our
motto,'' said Michael Graham, a Republican consultant who claims to
have come from a rural town where he spent his ``formative years
running from large hairy people named `Bubba,' many of them
women.''
</P>
<P>
   But the image of South Carolina as a backwater state is
outdated. Sumatra coffee and Grgich Hills chardonnay are easily
found in the capital Columbia. Cotton and tobacco are no longer
king, long ago replaced by manufacturing and tourism as the state's
top businesses.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GOP19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  South Carolina attracted $42 billion in capital investment during
the 1990s, evidenced by newly constructed office parks and
warehouses toward the west, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge
mountains. Toward the coast, the arrival of thousands of retirees
has driven up real estate costs in Charleston and resort towns such
as Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are changing,'' said Don Fowler, who teaches a course
on Southern politics at the University of South Carolina and until
last year was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said he recently received an invitation to a gay/lesbian
political event, which ``you just wouldn't have seen 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of television, the growing black vote and the
rising number of outsiders have made South Carolina less distinct
from the rest of the nation, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stereotype of South Carolina persists for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag, the emblem of a cause lost 135 years ago
and a symbol of hatred and racism to many, still flies atop the
statehouse. Bob Jones University, the state's largest liberal arts
college, bans interracial dating and only started allowing blacks
in 1971. The Citadel, a state-financed military school, began
admitting women just four years ago and only after pressure from
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Those traditions are strong enough that Texas Gov. George W.
Bush made a visit to Bob Jones University his first South Carolina
campaign stop after the New Hampshire primary two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And no Republican candidate has dared to challenge the flying of
the Confederate flag, which was raised in 1961 to mark the
centennial of the beginning of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other state would be fighting this flag issue but one of
these deep south States?'' asked Fowler, adding with a smile that
Democrats will be able to exploit it in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of GOP19 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Republican position on the flag ``is like giving us a nice,
warm cream puff on a silver platter,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The national media's focus on race has bred resentment from
South Carolinians who feel they are being maligned. The race
question is more complicated than the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pait, like a majority of South Carolinians, believes
the Confederate flag should come down from the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive to many blacks,'' said Pait, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Pait, an administrator at Bob Jones University, also says that
the school's ban on interracial dating is an appropriate safeguard
against the blending of God-created races.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did that to keep us from coming together,'' Pait said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say this until I'm blue in the face, and no one
believes us, but this policy is not based on racism or hate.''
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, the stop at Bob Jones is sure to haunt
Bush if he wins the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that no one from South Carolina told him not to go
there says something about this state,'' said Graham, who believes
that the behavior of national politicians pandering to the
conservative vote in South Carlina dooms them in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to be president, lose South Carolina,''
Graham advised.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Atwater, the late guitar-playing Republican operative famous
for his scorched-earth politics, helped turn his native South
Carolina into a must-win state along the GOP primary trail. Since
the Palmetto State primary in 1980, no Republican has won the
nomination without first winning here.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who writes a weekly political column, describes the
state's GOP as having three factions: the Old Guard (``fiscal
conservatives who will have a drink''), the Right Guard
(``Evangelicals'') and the Off Guard (``anti-establishment kooks
who think the Confederate flag is important.'')
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated the words of a Palmetto State senator from the
mid-1860s: ``South Carolina _ too small to be a republic, too large
to be an insane asylum.''

DUCKS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks insist it's too early
to label any game a must-win, but Friday's game versus the San Jose
Sharks was as close as it gets at this point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Win and the Ducks pull within three points of both San Jose and
Edmonton as they desperately try to stay in the thick of the
Western Conference playoff race. Lose and they fall seven back of
the Sharks and remain five back of the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the Ducks do? They play one of their most
unsatisfying ties in years, blowing two third-period leads and
settling for a 4-4 draw before 16,868 at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about running in place. Instead of picking up two points on
the Sharks and Oilers, they settle for just one to pull within four
of the eighth-place Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim made all of the flashy plays, scoring on a great
individual moves, but the Sharks did the dirty work banging home
three ugly goals on only six shots in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had learned something,'' said Teemu Selanne.
``Going to the third period ahead 3-1 ... you can't do what we did.
It's a pretty sad story. We have to learn how to play with the lead
in our building ... what are you going to do, you just have to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks held the Sharks without a shot for 12 minutes to start
as well as a 12-minute span in the second. They outshot San Jose
21-4 over the first 30 minutes and 36-20 in the game, but the
Sharks salvage a tie when Niklas Sundstrom scored with 2:22 left in
regulation. Sundstrom's third goal in his last 31 games, followed
Vincent Damphousse's first in 24 games at 5:16 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a heck of a game and it's unfortunate that two
mistakes end up in our net,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg, who
did his best to put a happy face on the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was may be the best game we've played in 2-3 weeks,'' he
said. ``We have to take the good things. If we look at the big
picture, we should be confident.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big picture didn't look so bright to the players, who
let a valuable point slip through their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of positives,'' said Ted Donato. ``But at this
time of the season it's all about the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Ruslan Salei nearly became a unlikely hero when he
scored at 12:16 of the third period to give the Ducks a 4-3 lead,
but Anaheim couldn't hold that lead either, as San Jose tied the
game with 2:22 left when Sundstrom knocked in rebound that Ducks
goalie Guy Hebert couldn't control.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, coming off a sub-par performance against Calgary on
Wednesday had another rough night, especially when Damphousse's
shot from behind the goal line bounced off his glove and into the
net to tie the game 3-3 at 5:16.
</P>
<P>
   A victory had seemed certain when the Ducks took a 3-1 lead into
the third period against a Sharks team that was 0-18-1 when
trailing after 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But things suddenly got silent at The Pond when Tony Granato,
who assisted on all three goals in the final period set up young
defenseman Scott Hannan for his first NHL goal at 2:28 of the
period to cut the Ducks' lead to 3-2. The silence was even more
deafening when Damphousse scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad goal, you should never score from there,'' said
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose came into the game with a 6-12-3-5 record in its last
21 games and the the Ducks seemed to smell blood from the
beginning, even though it took them over 26 minutes to break
through a wall otherwise known as Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had five power plays and outshoot the Sharks 14-2 in the
first period, but they had nothing to show for it until Matt Cullen
made the San Jose goalie look human with an inside-out move at 6:08
to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead on their 19th shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made it 2-0 on their 21st shot, just nine seconds
after Ronnie Stern took San Jose's sixth minor penalty of the game.
Oleg Tverdovsky made a perfect shot-pass and Teemu Selanne,
positioned at the left post tipped home his 24th goal of the year
at 6:38.
</P>
<P>
   The goal extended Selanne's point-scoring streak to 13 games and
it marked the 10th consecutive game that the Ducks have scored on
the power play, one short of the franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were totally dominating the Sharks, but San Jose took
advantage of a rookie mistake by defenseman Vitaly Vishnevsky to
pull within a goal at 15:33. Vishnevsky cross-checked Damphousse to
give the Sharks a two-man advantage for 1:30. Four seconds after
the two-man advantage expired Owen Nolan banged home his 36th goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks regained the momentum and appeared to have put the
game away at 17:18 when Kip Miller left a drop-pass for Tverdovsky,
who scored his second highlight-reel goal in as many games.
Tverdovsky drove to the net, went from forehand to backhand, faking
Shields out of position and tucking in his ninth goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The trend for the period was set early when Shields was tested
twice on the Ducks' first power play. He passed both exams with
flying colors, stopping Steve Rucchin's goal-mouth deflection and
Paul Kariya's point-blank follow up just over a minute into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' first shot _ a 120-foot one-hopper by Gary Suter _
wasn't recorded until there was 7:42 left in the period. By that
time the Cullen had missed the net on a two-on-one feed from
Selanne, Miller's wraparound bid was turned aside by Shields and
Selanne was stopped from the right circle on a Anaheim power play.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and the Sharks continued their escape act in the second
half of the period. Rookie defenseman Brad Stuart made a great play
to block Miller's pass on a three-on-one Anaheim break. Shields
then made sure the teams went to the dressing rooms tied by
stopping Kariya and Fredrik Olausson on power play chances in the
final minutes of the opening period.

   The Federal Reserve and Labor Department offered proof that the
economic expansion continues. The Fed reported that industrial
production rose 1 percent last month, nearly twice as much as
expected. The Labor Department reported that producer prices were
unchanged for January, and actually fell if food and energy prices
were excluded. Output up, prices down: it's economic nirvana. But
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned that interest rates might
have to rise to keep inflation in check.

   A Drippy Nuclear Plant
</P>
<P>
   A leaky pipe inside a steam generator at the Indian Point 2
nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., may have released a puff of
radioactive gas into the atmosphere. The plant's owner,
Consolidated Edison, said there had been signs of leaks weeks
before, but said that radiation levels near the plant were
one-fifth ``the exposure you currently get just from walking in a
park, standing on a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The leak could doom the 26-year-old plant 35 miles north of New
York City, which Con Ed wants to sell. Experts said that when a
nuclear plant's generators start to go, the problems are often too
costly to be worth fixing.

   The Nominees Are . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar nominations were announced, so the business of trying
to divine the collective consciousness of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a dark suburban comedy, got eight
nominations, the most of any picture. But there are no sure-fire
winners this year. The academy seemed to teeter between nominating
oddball or unlikely choices like ``Being John Malkovich'' (three
nominations) and ``The Sixth Sense'' (six nominations) and
traditional, high-minded Oscar bait like ``The Insider'' and ``The
Cider House Rules'' (seven nominations each). Award night is at Los
Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on March 26.

   Welcome to the Onetime Fire Wall State
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Saturday's South Carolina primary, a
Reuters/Zogby poll of Republicans, Democrats and independents
showed Gov. George W. Bush with 42.7 percent and Sen. John McCain
with 42 percent. And this was supposed to have been Bush's fire
wall state _ the one he would win in a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's been a nasty firefight, the sort that Lee Atwater,
that son of bare-knuckle Palmetto politics, would have loved.
</P>
<P>
   After the dull ``No, you first'' courtliness of New Hampshire,
South Carolina brought the invigorating ugliness of ``push
polling,'' in which Bush campaign callers, posing as unbiased
pollsters, did their best to trash McCain.
</P>
<P>
   This primary also highlighted the increasingly independent South
Carolina electorate. Transplanted business people, part of the
state's growing connection to the global economy, upwardly mobile
suburbanites and retirees on the coast have made politics here more
cosmopolitan and less predictable. The big question all week was
how many Democrats and independents might weigh in on McCain's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right remains influential, but uncertainly so.
Both these traits could be seen in Gary L. Bauer's endorsement of
McCain. On the one hand, McCain was assumed to benefit; on the
other hand, no one was sure how much; and on the third hand, it was
duly noted that Bauer had endorsed a candidate who hasn't pledged
to outlaw abortion or to hew to other issues dear to the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   All the energy and anxiety engendered by this fluctuating
environment were on display last week in a shrill televised debate
ineffectually moderated by Larry King. The spectacle of a McCain
smiling a tight smile to mask his famous anger and an agitated Bush
sputtering in indignation _ both far less articulate than Keyes _
was compelling enough to make one forget that a couple of testy
Democrats, with no primary until next month, were also campaigning
somewhere or another.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Bush, who has already spent a mind-boggling $52
million, will soon have to ask his backers for more money.

   The Man Who Created the Kid In Us All
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the comic strip ``Peanuts,''
died Saturday night, Feb. 12, just hours before his last comic ran.
He was 77. The strip was 50.
</P>
<P>
   From the day the strip was first published, Oct. 2, 1950, the
lives of the comic and its creator were entwined. Schulz once said,
``This is my excuse for existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the humor of ``Peanuts'' was gentle, it was dark, too.
``All the loves in the strip are unrequited,'' Schulz once said,
``all the baseball games are lost, all the test scores are D
minuses; the Great Pumpkin never comes; and the football is always
pulled away.''
</P>
<P>
   What accounted for the pull of ``Peanuts''? Umberto Eco, the
novelist and semiotician, who wrote the introduction to the first
``Peanuts'' book translated into Italian, thought it captured
modern neurosis. Schulz's wife, Jeannie, said the characters were
parts of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Schulz said, he woke up in the middle of the night
thinking about Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus and exclaimed:
``Good grief! Who are all these little people? Must I live with
them for the rest of my life?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was yes.

   A Series of Tornadoes Rip Through Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Residents of southwest Georgia awoke to the sound of wind and
snapping pines, and most had little chance to escape the deadliest
tornadoes to strike the state in more than 50 years. The twisters
killed 18 people, injured more than 100 and destroyed 258 houses,
causing an estimated $20 million in property losses.

   Arms and the IRA
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who shut down the government
of Northern Ireland , continued to keep it shut over disagreements
on how the Irish Republican Army should disarm its arsenal of
weapons, despite demands from Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, that the
government be restored. Adams' demands were met by counter demands
from Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble that the IRA first return to disarmament
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine Again
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in 10 months, students from Columbine High
School were shot to death. The bodies of two sophomores, Nicholas
Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were found behind a counter
in a Littleton, Colo., sandwich shop, just blocks from the school
where two students killed 13 people, and then themselves, last
April. Authorities, who said little about the latest shootings,
interviewed scores of people in the area, hoping to learn whether
robbery or something else was the motive.

   Indonesian Investigation
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week verbal standoff, Indonesia's President
Abdurrahman Wahid removed Wiranto, his most prominent general, from
his cabinet pending the outcome of an investigation of his
involvement in atrocities in East Timor. Despite fears of violence
or a military coup, the general went quietly, accepting his
suspension with a smile and stating his obedience to civilian
authority.

   Another World
</P>
<P>
   The universe is expanding at an increasing rate, and the reason
may be a force from another universe. Dr. Andreas Albrecht, a
cosmologist at the University of California in Davis, and his
colleague, Constantinos Skordis, have published a paper showing
that a ubiquitous energy named quintessence could inflate the known
universe like a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintessence is a very ghostly thing,'' said Nima
Arkani-Hamed, who with his colleagues has presented evidence of how
it might function within the 10 dimensions predicted by superstring
theory, which suggests that all matter is made from small vibrating
strings.

   The Lonelier Crowd
</P>
<P>
   Americans are forsaking face-to-face relationships in favor of
Web surfing and e-mail, according to a nationwide survey by the
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society. The survey, which
is based on 4,113 telephone interviews, suggests that the Web is
also cutting into time once spent watching television and reading
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet defenders responded that the Web enabled people
separated by time or space to stay in close contact and gave new
independence to the aged and infirm. Still, said the study's
principal investigator, Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist,
``When you spend your time on the Internet, you never hear a human
voice and you never get a hug.''

   The People's Choice
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has held office since
1980, was given a humiliating vote of no confidence when voters
rejected his proposed new constitution. With the economy in a
shambles, citizens, urban ones in particular, showed no inclination
to strengthen the man many blame for soaring inflation, rising
unemployment and a litany of other ills. A new opposition party
smells blood, and parliamentary elections in April promise to be
interesting.

   The Federal Reserve and Labor Department offered proof that the
economic expansion continues. The Fed reported that industrial
production rose 1 percent last month, nearly twice as much as
expected. The Labor Department reported that producer prices were
unchanged for January, and actually fell if food and energy prices
were excluded. Output up, prices down: it's economic nirvana. But
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned that interest rates might
have to rise to keep inflation in check.

   A Drippy Nuclear Plant
</P>
<P>
   A leaky pipe inside a steam generator at the Indian Point 2
nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., may have released a puff of
radioactive gas into the atmosphere. The plant's owner,
Consolidated Edison, said there had been signs of leaks weeks
before, but said that radiation levels near the plant were
one-fifth ``the exposure you currently get just from walking in a
park, standing on a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The leak could doom the 26-year-old plant 35 miles north of New
York City, which Con Ed wants to sell. Experts said that when a
nuclear plant's generators start to go, the problems are often too
costly to be worth fixing.

   The Oscar nominations were announced, so the business of trying

Picture Arts and Sciences has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a dark suburban comedy, got eight
nominations, the most of any picture. But there are no sure-fire
winners this year. The academy seemed to teeter between nominating
oddball or unlikely choices like ``Being John Malkovich'' (three
nominations) and ``The Sixth Sense'' (six nominations) and
traditional, high-minded Oscar bait like ``The Insider'' and ``The
Cider House Rules'' (seven nominations each). Award night is at Los

   ROME _ To illustrate an article about a recent conference on
breast cancer prevention, Il Messaggero, the daily newspaper,
splashed across its front page a picture of a sultry nude starlet,
Sabrina Ferilli, reclining on a hammock, touching her breast and
wearing a come-hither look that does not seem directed at an
oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   The color photograph, taken from one of Italy's best-selling
nude calendars, did not offend many readers, not even Dr. Aurelio
Picciocchi, chief of surgery at the Catholic Hospital of the Sacred
Heart in Rome, and a speaker at the conference. ``Oh, that's just
journalism,'' he said cheerfully. ``But I can assure that, alas, no
nude starlets attended the conference. That I would have noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   European countries generally are more relaxed about nudity than
the United States, particularly nudity in newspapers and
advertising. While English and German newspapers tidily tend to
restrict their naked starlets to the entertainment pages, however,
their Italian counterparts regularly blend nudity or startling
graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft porn and
hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring distinctions is an Italian art form, after all, even
literally. ``It was Leonardo da Vinci who invented the painting
technique of sfumato, smudging the edges of a line for greater
effect,'' said Paolo Fabbri, a professor of semiotics at the
University of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   That ethical _ and perhaps aesthetic _ dexterity may help
explain the Italian reaction to Benetton's notorious Death Row ad
campaign. Many admired the shock value of the ads that have become
the trademark of the fashion retailer, but few seemed concerned
that the photographer Oliviero Toscani and his colleagues may have
misrepresented themselves as journalists to the prison authorities
and death row inmates they photographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the ads very strong and courageous,'' Paolo Graldi,
editor in chief of Il Messaggero, said. When asked about the ethics
of the campaign, he replied, ``Well, I am not familiar with the
deontology of the professional guidelines that were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, Graldi saw nothing questionable in
using a nude pinup to report on breast cancer awareness. ``The
picture is both reassuring and suggestive,'' he explained. ``It
shows women that they should not be afraid to touch their breasts.
Breasts are beautiful, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers and magazines routinely feature naked women,
and the newsmagazine Panorama broke new ground in 1997 when it
illustrated a story on privacy with a nude cover photograph of the
former Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli, now 78, diving into the sea
from his yacht.
</P>
<P>
   But nudity isn't the only thing that sells newspapers in Italy.
So do movies. Just as articles on bank robberies often feature a
spaghetti-western still of Clint Eastwood, reports on child
prostitution are almost always accompanied by a still of Jodie
Foster in ``Taxi Driver.'' Adult prostitution is illustrated with
shots from ``Pretty Woman.'' A recent Il Messaggero article on
research on tar-blocking filters in cigarettes was printed
alongside the image of Sharon Stone in ``Basic Instinct,'' lighting
a cigarette in the film's famous interrogation scene.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine tend to inspire the most imaginative
graphics. A report on Dr. Severino Antinori, a fertility specialist
who has been conducting experiments using mouse sperm to combat
male infertility, was illustrated with a drawing of the cartoon
mouse Topo Gigio.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbri noted that for centuries Italian reality, with its cozy
accommodations between church, state, politics, business and even
organized crime has itself presented a blurry picture to the world.
For example, in his 1994 election campaign, former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, a center-right politician and a media tycoon,
flooded his own airwaves with political ads and also made many
appearances on his networks' most popular variety shows, which only
his opponents viewed as an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the center-left government of Massimo D'Alema passed
a law strictly limiting the use of political ads on television, and
introducing equal-time rules that infuriated Berlusconi, who has
never conceded that owning the three largest private television
networks conflicted with his political duties.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fact and fiction can be legislated back into their
proper domains in Italy remains to be seen, but Fabbri warned that
the smudging of distinctions between reality, art, journalism and
advertising was not a cultural throwback but a sign of things to
come. ``Unfortunately, this phenomenon is very postmodern,'' he
said. ``The degeneration of values and modes of communication lie
in the future of all societies and not just Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said he believed that Toscani's effort to blend
commerce and political statement has so far backfired. ``He is a
victim of his own confusions,'' he said. ``He is pretending to do
journalism, but people read it as fiction. When they see these
beautifully lit, colored images, most people don't even realize
they are seeing real faces of death row inmates, or it has no
importance _ they see it as another skillful publicity campaign, a
movie poster, not reality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   America's nine-year economic expansion is now the longest in
history. Companies everywhere are thriving and sharing this
prosperity with workers clamoring for raises. So paychecks must be
ballooning, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Pay should be climbing faster and faster as the unemployment
rate falls and companies raise wages to lure new workers or to
retain the ones they have. But wage increases, instead of getting
bigger, are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   What a puzzle that is for policy-makers. Anticipating faster
wage increases, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest
rates to slow the economy, a strategy that will continue, Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested in congressional testimony
last week. A slower economy, the thinking goes, reduces the demand
for workers, taking pressure off employers to raise wages. Less
pressure to lift wages means less pressure to raise prices to cover
the higher labor costs. A major source of inflation is thus
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, wage growth is slowing even without higher
interest rates. When economists first spotted the smaller raises in
government statistics last summer, they thought it was a fluke. But
now all the numbers for 1999 are in hand, and there is no mistake.
Nearly everyone who earned $26 an hour or less _ 90 percent of the
work force _ found that their pay last year, adjusted for
inflation, rose by far smaller amounts than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mystery,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the
University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. ``The usual
preconditions for wage pressure have existed for some time, but the
behavior that we expected, based on behavior in the past,
particularly in the 1960s, has not been forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage growth had accelerated rather smartly in 1997 and 1998 as
the economy boomed. But the expansion was even stronger last year,
with even lower unemployment, and yet wage growth perversely slowed
down. That happened whether the pay was for flipping hamburgers or
designing machines and whether the measure was wages or a broader
category that also includes bonuses and cashed-in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Only people earning north of $65,000 _ fewer than 10 percent of
all workers _ found their incomes growing faster last year after
adjustment for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard, economists are reaching for explanations. High
on the list is job insecurity. Despite rising public confidence in
the economy, many workers still remember the layoffs and
downsizings of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with full employment, workers may be more timid than in
earlier periods of full employment, when unions were also
stronger,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have settled on annual raises of about 3 percent in
the last few years. That was double the inflation rate in 1998.
Inflation was a bit higher in 1999, however, so real wage growth _
adjusted for inflation _ slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   But if inflation rose last year, why did workers settle for the
same 3 percent when a falling unemployment rate (it's now 4
percent) increased their bargaining power? Demographics may play a
role, some economists say. The work force is aging as baby-boomers
move into their 50s and older workers are not as aggressive about
raises. ``If you are turned down, you are not going to get another
job so easily,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the job-mix thesis. Manufacturers have shed
350,000 jobs in the past two years, and lower-paying service jobs
have replaced them. The 1996 minimum wage law also played a role,
helping to push up wages at the low end in 1997 and 1998, says Alan
B. Krueger, a Princeton labor economist. The effect wore off last
year, however. And immigrants flooding into the work force have
also held back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, business itself has become more reluctant to raise
wages, invoking global competition as a reason and demonstrating a
readiness to move operations to lower-wage regions in the United
States or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many economists insist that wage pressure will increase
soon. ``We definitely expect hourly compensation to pick up this
year,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers.

<P>
   America's nine-year economic expansion is now the longest in
history. Companies everywhere are thriving and sharing this
prosperity with workers clamoring for raises. So paychecks must be
ballooning, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Pay should be climbing faster and faster as the unemployment
rate falls and companies raise wages to lure new workers or to
retain the ones they have. But wage increases, instead of getting
bigger, are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   What a puzzle that is for policy-makers. Anticipating faster
wage increases, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest
rates to slow the economy, a strategy that will continue, Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested in congressional testimony
last week. A slower economy, the thinking goes, reduces the demand
for workers, taking pressure off employers to raise wages. Less
pressure to lift wages means less pressure to raise prices to cover
the higher labor costs. A major source of inflation is thus
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, wage growth is slowing even without higher
interest rates. When economists first spotted the smaller raises in
government statistics last summer, they thought it was a fluke. But
now all the numbers for 1999 are in hand, and there is no mistake.
Nearly everyone who earned $26 an hour or less _ 90 percent of the
work force _ found that their pay last year, adjusted for
inflation, rose by far smaller amounts than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mystery,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the
University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. ``The usual
preconditions for wage pressure have existed for some time, but the
behavior that we expected, based on behavior in the past,
particularly in the 1960s, has not been forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage growth had accelerated rather smartly in 1997 and 1998 as
the economy boomed. But the expansion was even stronger last year,
with even lower unemployment, and yet wage growth perversely slowed
down. That happened whether the pay was for flipping hamburgers or
designing machines and whether the measure was wages or a broader
category that also includes bonuses and cashed-in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Only people earning north of $65,000 _ fewer than 10 percent of
all workers _ found their incomes growing faster last year after
adjustment for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard, economists are reaching for explanations. High
on the list is job insecurity. Despite rising public confidence in
the economy, many workers still remember the layoffs and
downsizings of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with full employment, workers may be more timid than in
earlier periods of full employment, when unions were also
stronger,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have settled on annual raises of about 3 percent in
the last few years. That was double the inflation rate in 1998.
Inflation was a bit higher in 1999, however, so real wage growth _
adjusted for inflation _ slowed down.

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Kosovska Mitrovica is the divided town
in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins. In the last
three weeks, long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north of
the Ibar River and Albanians to the south have burst into violence
that international peacekeepers have only slowly managed to control
_ after they, too, became targets.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica, as the town is more familiarly known, is a mess, but
the reasons go deeper than any tactical mistake by civilian or
military authorities. Mitrovica marks the effective political and
ethnic partition of Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace
looks so far away, even eight months after NATO took control of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that so much was left unresolved when
NATO troops arrived. The troops were on the ground, but their
governments squabbled over how Kosovo would be run, over how it
would be financed and even over the ideals that would shape the new
protectorate: Would it be a safe harbor for Albanians, heading
toward independence, or a multiethnic, autonomous province that
would stay in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   With much in the air, facts on the ground tended to define
everything. And those facts included the persistence of organized
Albanian revenge to drive out the Serbs; the Serb flight out of the
province or into small ethnic enclaves; the emergence of Mitrovica
as the largest Serbian enclave, the real border between Serbian and
Albanian control; and the presence of French troops, who are
historically sympathetic to the Serbs, in charge of Mitrovica and
northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitrovica was some form of wake-up call, it rang long ago. In
November, senior U.N. and Western officials said Mitrovica was
unstable and marked the effective partition of Kosovo, proof that
the NATO-led peacekeeping troops known as KFOR had not extended
their authority throughout the province. They said Mitrovica's
division would allow Serbia to destabilize Kosovo, served as a
touchstone for organized Albanian rage and risked formalizing an
ethnic separation similar to Bosnia's.
</P>
<P>
   In December, senior U.S. officials talked of the urgent need to
get more police in, to break the ethnic barrier and to
internationalize the KFOR unit. Soon KFOR would be seen as the
enemy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But the warnings were not heeded and the good intentions proved
impossible to carry out, given the haphazardly built U.N.
administration of Kosovo, the national pride of the KFOR members
and the failure of the victors to provide the money and trained
personnel to win the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began at the beginning. The war with Serbia lasted
longer than Western officials thought it would and then,
paradoxically, it ended sooner than they had imagined it could.
Washington and NATO were not, at first, prepared to fight the war.
Then the winners were not ready to rule Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an administration that has had little chance
of securing noble but contradictory goals of a multiethnic, stable,
secure, democratic, self-governing but not-quite-independent
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter debate about who should rule Kosovo, the United
Nations was extremely slow to set up shop. Worse, the very
countries that fought to make this protectorate possible still have
not provided the trained police and funding they promised.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of KFOR troops to occupy Kosovo in June, but
policing it was among their last priorities. They were interested
first in their own protection, making sure all Milosevic's troops
and security forces left on schedule. They were worried, second,
about attacks on themselves by angry, armed Serb civilians. They
were enraptured by the reception they received from grateful ethnic
Albanians who had lived through murder, rape and expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not prepared for any discussion of Albanian
revenge organized by the Kosovo Liberation Army. The protection of
Serb civilians and holy places was not high on KFOR's list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior U.N. officials suggested that Gen. Mike Jackson of
Britain, KFOR's first commander, judged that if fewer Serbs stayed,
Kosovo would be easier to secure. KFOR did nothing to stop the
exodus of Serbs _ not even to look for possible war criminals among
them. The general attitude was captured in a British headline:
``Serbs you right.''
</P>
<P>
   So when early violence broke out in Mitrovica between Serbs who
had seized the areas north of the Ibar River and Albanians to the
south, outnumbered French troops stopped their own advance and held
the bridges, sealing the town's division.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and the French commanders did nothing to break the
stalemate, and the ethnic separation became nearly complete this
month when at least 1,000 ethnic Albanians were driven from
northern Mitrovica. Now the remaining Albanian families in the
north have KFOR guards, just like the few Serbs left in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians are furious because KFOR has not given them
freedom of movement. They fear they will never control the area in
and around the Trepca mine complex; both sides believe this is the
richest part of Kosovo, the heart of any future state, and the
Serbs intend to hold it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who grew up in the 1950s and '60s, mesmerized by the
predictions in Life magazine or The Saturday Evening Post of
exploring the solar system and establishing colonies on the Moon
and Mars, it might have been a little depressing to gaze half a
century ahead to what counts as a big space story in the year 2000:
the visit of an unmanned craft _ with not even a dog or a monkey
inside _ to a lifeless asteroid barely beyond Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The simple probe called the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous met
up with Eros, a 21-mile-long, potato-shaped space rock named, for
some reason, after the Greek god of love, on Valentine's Day.
Adding to the sappy coincidences, the craft's camera spotted a
confluence of shadows on the asteroid that looked like a big heart
_ ``a valentine from Eros,'' mission director Robert Farquhar
called it.
</P>
<P>
   But as mundane as the voyage may have seemed, there was no need
to strain for a good sound bite. Any success, of course, would be
encouraging after last year's disappointing near misses by the Mars
Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. There was much more, though,
to NASA's accomplishment. In a day when a steady stream of exotic
scientific speculations overwhelms the public imagination _ tiny
superstrings vibrating in a 10-dimensional universe, invisible
parallel worlds, wormholes tunneling through space and time _ a
comfortable satisfaction can be taken from a modest technological
triumph like NEAR.
</P>
<P>
   The closest most people will get to science's more ethereal
wonders is through animations on TV science shows or planetarium
megascreens. At the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, which opened this
weekend, visitors can take a visual tour of the galaxy and beyond,
finally plunging through a black hole, emerging unscathed onto West
81st Street.
</P>
<P>
   With so many things about the universe that can only be
simulated or imagined, there was something wonderfully direct about
the four-year asteroid mission that reached its destination last
week. The NASA scientists reminded us that for all we don't know
about the universe, when it comes to the basics, earthlings have it
down cold: Put the equations for the trajectory to an asteroid into
a computer, plot a three-year course, whip the spacecraft around
the Earth to give it a gravity boost _ and when you miss your tiny
target the first time, follow it for another year around the Sun
before carefully moving in for final contact.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Earth Time, NEAR came within
striking distance (203 miles) of Eros. It fired its thrusters for
57 seconds, slowing itself just enough (about 30 feet a second) to
be gently pulled, as planned, into the asteroid's field of gravity.

<P>
   For those who grew up in the 1950s and '60s, mesmerized by the
predictions in Life magazine or The Saturday Evening Post of
exploring the solar system and establishing colonies on the Moon
and Mars, it might have been a little depressing to gaze half a
century ahead to what counts as a big space story in the year 2000:
the visit of an unmanned craft _ with not even a dog or a monkey
inside _ to a lifeless asteroid barely beyond Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The simple probe called the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous met
up with Eros, a 21-mile-long, potato-shaped space rock named, for
some reason, after the Greek god of love, on Valentine's Day.
Adding to the sappy coincidences, the craft's camera spotted a
confluence of shadows on the asteroid that looked like a big heart
_ ``a valentine from Eros,'' mission director Robert Farquhar
called it.
</P>
<P>
   But as mundane as the voyage may have seemed, there was no need
to strain for a good sound bite. Any success, of course, would be
encouraging after last year's disappointing near misses by the Mars
Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. There was much more, though,
to NASA's accomplishment. In a day when a steady stream of exotic
scientific speculations overwhelms the public imagination _ tiny
superstrings vibrating in a 10-dimensional universe, invisible
parallel worlds, wormholes tunneling through space and time _ a
comfortable satisfaction can be taken from a modest technological
triumph like NEAR.
</P>
<P>
   The closest most people will get to science's more ethereal
wonders is through animations on TV science shows or planetarium
megascreens. At the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, which opened this
weekend, visitors can take a visual tour of the galaxy and beyond,
finally plunging through a black hole, emerging unscathed onto West
81st Street.
</P>
<P>
   With so many things about the universe that can only be
simulated or imagined, there was something wonderfully direct about
the four-year asteroid mission that reached its destination last
week. The NASA scientists reminded us that for all we don't know
about the universe, when it comes to the basics, earthlings have it
down cold: Put the equations for the trajectory to an asteroid into
a computer, plot a three-year course, whip the spacecraft around
the Earth to give it a gravity boost _ and when you miss your tiny
target the first time, follow it for another year around the Sun
before carefully moving in for final contact.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Earth Time, NEAR came within
striking distance (203 miles) of Eros. It fired its thrusters for
57 seconds, slowing itself just enough (about 30 feet a second) to
be gently pulled, as planned, into the asteroid's field of gravity.
There it became the first artificial satellite to orbit one of
these flying rocks. All this precise maneuvering took place 160
million miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With their digital observer in place, the scientists began
downloading photos of the barren terrain, posting them one by one

the formation of the solar system.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PUTIN-PROFILE (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ After half a year as
prime minister and a month as acting president, Vladimir Putin
remains largely unknown. But what is known _ his career in the KGB,
his tough suppression of Chechnya, his ascetic habits _ point in
many ways to an updated version of the Yuri Andropov model. By
Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Chechen guerrillas shot down a
Russian military helicopter on Friday in mountains near southern
Chechnya's Argun gorge, killing 15, Russian government and Chechen
rebel sources said Saturday. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   WESTBANK-BEES (Tulkarm, West Bank) _ There is a quiet cult of
the bee in the land of milk and honey, and beekeepers, be they
Israeli or Palestinian, are the high priests of the hive. It was
only a matter of time, then, before the bees of the Holy Land
became ensnared in the tangled web of the peace efforts. By Deborah
Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-SCANDAL (Tokyo) _ When a popular news magazine reported
this week that the secretary to the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi,
had improperly acquired stock in a telecommunications company that
later skyrocketed in value, the political opposition smelled blood
and attacked. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-POLITICS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Two years into his
five-year term as president, Kim Dae Jung is locked in a
surprisingly ugly fight for his political life. By Howard W.
French.
</P>
<P>
   HONG-KONG-XINHUA (Hong Kong) _ On Thursday, the New China News
Agency threw its annual spring festival reception. Always a must
for Hong Kong's elite, this year's party had an added attraction.
For the first time in half a century here, China's state news
agency, known as Xinhua, was no longer operating under cover. By
Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-MAID-ABUSE (Bangkok, Thailand) _ Almost every day now
in Malaysia, people are reading newspaper accounts of foreign
domestic helpers who have been abused by their employers. The
revelations of these secret crimes have horrified a society that
sees itself as kind, hospitable and soft-spoken. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-DEVELOPING-NATIONS (Bangkok, Thailand) _ A U.N. conference
on developing nations concluded Saturday with expressions of good
will but no real narrowing of the differences that split a meeting
of the World Trade Organization in Seattle in December. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ELECTION (Tehran, Iran) _ Early results from Iran's
elections indicated Saturday that the country's reform-minded
president, Mohammad Khatami, may have a solid majority behind him
in the parliament to make good on his promises of creating a more
liberal society after 21 years of rule by puritanical Islamic
clerics. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-VALLEY-POOR (San Jose, Calif.) _ With all the new money
floating around, the most expensive housing market in the country
and the densest concentration of investment capital in the world,
there is no other place in the country that offers a starker
example of the growing gap between the rich and poor. By Evelyn
Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-TAX-DODGES (Undated) _ With incomes rising sharply,
particularly among the wealthy, Americans are paying a lot more in
federal taxes than they did before the economic expansion of the
last decade. Not so, American corporations. Their profits are
growing even faster than Americans' incomes, yet the taxes they pay
have begun to fall. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   GENE-CONFLICTS (Undated) _ With the biomedical revolution in
full swing, academic scientists who lack industry ties have become
as rare as giant pandas in the wild. But as Congress begins to
investigate lapses in federal oversight of gene therapy
experiments, lawmakers, bioethics experts and federal regulators
say they are troubled that so many researchers have a financial
stake in companies testing their discoveries _ companies whose
fortunes, along with those of the scientist, can rise and fall on a
single product. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   CATS-CLOSING (New York) _ After almost 18 years, $380 million in
sales and untold gallons of makeup, ``Cats,'' the longest-running
production in Broadway history, will close on June 25. By Jesse
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   DC-DEATH-PENALTY (Washington) _ Federal prosecutors are pressing
for the death penalty against a man charged with murdering three
employees at a Starbucks coffee shop here in July 1997, clearing
the way for the city's first death penalty case in nearly 30 years.
By John Files.
</P>
<P>
   IDAHO-MEMORIAL (Boise, Idaho) _ Greg Carr's native Idaho is a
state well-known for its spectacular wild beauty. But, he said, it
also has a reputation as a haven for racists, an unfortunate
distinction generated by white-supremacist groups that congregate
in northern Idaho and exacerbated by the fact that it is one of the
least ethnically diverse states in the nation. So Carr, the former
chairman of Prodigy Inc., last year issued a ``challenge grant'' to
the people of Idaho to raise money for a human-rights memorial that
might represent a step toward counteracting the image. By Sam Howe
Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   SOJOURNER-STATUE (Northampton, Mass.) _ Seven years into a
project to honor the rights advocate Sojourner Truth with a bronze
statue, organizers are finding themselves in the middle of a
dispute over fairness.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-OVERSIGHT (Los Angeles) _ In a vote seen as a crucial test
of the city's commitment to change and oversight of the city's
police force, the Los Angeles Police Commission has ruled that an
officer's shooting of a mentally ill homeless woman last year
violated department policy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MICH-REPUBS (Lansing, Mich.) _ After battering each other for
two and a half weeks in South Carolina, Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain will crisscross Michigan for the next two days
campaigning for the big state's primary on Tuesday. Worried by
polls showing the race too close to predict, Gov. John Engler of
Michigan, an early supporter of Bush's, has organized one of the
largest political mobilizations ever in the state. By Keith
Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-LABOR (Undated) _ The leaders of the AFL-CIO said this
weekend that they would continue pushing union members to campaign
all-out for Vice President Al Gore even though he has reiterated
his support for President Clinton's trade deal with China. By
Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS _ NAACP opposes compromise on flag; More
turmoil for Reform Party; Cheese Heads in North Carolina? By B.
Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>

   In addition, several political stories dealing with the
Republican primary in South Carolina will move later in the day or

<P>
   Last week a Stanford University study, hotly debated, concluded
that Internet use increases social isolation. But other experts
detect maybe a more significant hallmark of the Internet age: not
individual loneliness, but mass boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bored despite living in remarkable times,'' concludes a
recent annual survey of consumer attitudes by the market research
concern Yankelovich Partners, which notes that last year 71 percent
of roughly 2,500 respondents yearned for more novelty in their
lives, up from 67 percent just a year earlier. The study calls the
paradox the ``boredom boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as a drug user develops a tolerance and needs larger
doses to achieve the same effect, so too have we developed a
tolerance to amazing events,'' the survey notes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the Internet, the collapse of communism, the
dawn of a new millennium, prosperity, bungee-jumping weddings and a
couple of lesbians having babies with David Crosby's sperm leave
you stifling yawns, join the crowd. Let's get an ennui update from
the Internet and academe.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Overload and Boredom: Essays on the
Quality of Life in the Information Society'' (Greenwood Press,
1986), the sociologist Orrin E. Klapp sought to explain ``how a
society could become boring in spite _ indeed because _ of huge
loads of information'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This is a high-input society. It seems that not a minute may be
wasted in consuming commodities and communicating with as many
people as possible. But in a Babel of signals, we must listen to a
great deal of chatter to hear one bit of information we really
want. We discover that information can become noiselike when it is
irrelevant or interferes with desired signals, so tending to defeat
meaning. . . . By taking in too much noise, a person becomes
cluttered, not integrated. The result for our information society
is that we suffer a lag in which the slow horse of meaning is
unable to keep up with the fast horse of mere information.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And so we grow bored. But boredom isn't all
bad. In ``Boredom and the Religious Imagination'' (University Press
of Virginia, 1999) Michael L. Raposa, a religion professor at
Lehigh University, argues that it can be a catalyst to religious
insight: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that there is a great deal to be learned from the
experience of boredom (much of it religiously edifying) and that
thinking about that experience can be interesting, even enjoyable
(at least for some persons, in certain circumstances). What most
intrigued my students about the topic was the ambiguity of boredom,
its surprisingly complex nature. My being bored with someone or
something can represent a trivial matter or a matter of great
consequence. My disinterest can signify either a moral failure or
the presence of virtue. . . . I can be bored, at least for a time,
with something that I continue to care deeply about; even love
cannot banish boredom altogether.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Melancholy and Society'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992), Wolf Lepenies, a German scholar, quotes
Kierkegaard's ``Either/Or'' on boredom's creative force: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored
because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered
the world, and increased in proportion to the increase of
population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored
together; then the population of the world increased, and the
people were bored en masse. To divert themselves they conceived the
idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens. This
idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a
terrible proof of how boredom gained the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And of course boredom is nothing new. In
``Boredom: The Literary History of a State of Mind'' (University of
Chicago Press, 1995), Patricia Meyer Spacks, an English professor
at the University of Virginia, traces its legacy as a literary
theme from Samuel Johnson to present-day writers like Saul Bellow:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The history of boredom in its cultural constructions matters
partly because boredom itself now appears to matter so much. If
boredom can provide plausible justification for acts of violence or
self-destruction, if the desire to forestall it sells fountain pens
and trips around the world, if fiction writers assume it as the
substratum of experience . . . if all of the above are true, it
would seem that boredom has assumed broad explanatory power in a
society widely felt to be baffling. . . . Its 20th century
magnification absorbs ever more material into the maw of the
meaningless and provides ever more material for the imaginative
writer.

<P>
   Last week a Stanford University study, hotly debated, concluded
that Internet use increases social isolation. But other experts
detect maybe a more significant hallmark of the Internet age: not
individual loneliness, but mass boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bored despite living in remarkable times,'' concludes a
recent annual survey of consumer attitudes by the market research
concern Yankelovich Partners, which notes that last year 71 percent
of roughly 2,500 respondents yearned for more novelty in their
lives, up from 67 percent just a year earlier. The study calls the
paradox the ``boredom boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as a drug user develops a tolerance and needs larger
doses to achieve the same effect, so too have we developed a
tolerance to amazing events,'' the survey notes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the Internet, the collapse of communism, the
dawn of a new millennium, prosperity, bungee-jumping weddings and a
couple of lesbians having babies with David Crosby's sperm leave
you stifling yawns, join the crowd. Let's get an ennui update from
the Internet and academe.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Overload and Boredom: Essays on the
Quality of Life in the Information Society'' (Greenwood Press,
1986), the sociologist Orrin E. Klapp sought to explain ``how a
society could become boring in spite _ indeed because _ of huge
loads of information'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This is a high-input society. It seems that not a minute may be
wasted in consuming commodities and communicating with as many
people as possible. But in a Babel of signals, we must listen to a
great deal of chatter to hear one bit of information we really
want. We discover that information can become noiselike when it is
irrelevant or interferes with desired signals, so tending to defeat
meaning. . . . By taking in too much noise, a person becomes
cluttered, not integrated. The result for our information society
is that we suffer a lag in which the slow horse of meaning is
unable to keep up with the fast horse of mere information.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And so we grow bored. But boredom isn't all
bad. In ``Boredom and the Religious Imagination'' (University Press
of Virginia, 1999) Michael L. Raposa, a religion professor at
Lehigh University, argues that it can be a catalyst to religious
insight: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that there is a great deal to be learned from the
experience of boredom (much of it religiously edifying) and that
thinking about that experience can be interesting, even enjoyable
(at least for some persons, in certain circumstances). What most
intrigued my students about the topic was the ambiguity of boredom,
its surprisingly complex nature. My being bored with someone or
something can represent a trivial matter or a matter of great
consequence. My disinterest can signify either a moral failure or
the presence of virtue. . . . I can be bored, at least for a time,
with something that I continue to care deeply about; even love
cannot banish boredom altogether.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Melancholy and Society'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992), Wolf Lepenies, a German scholar, quotes
Kierkegaard's ``Either/Or'' on boredom's creative force: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored
because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered
the world, and increased in proportion to the increase of
population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored
together; then the population of the world increased, and the
people were bored en masse. To divert themselves they conceived the
idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens. This
idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a
terrible proof of how boredom gained the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And of course boredom is nothing new. In
``Boredom: The Literary History of a State of Mind'' (University of
Chicago Press, 1995), Patricia Meyer Spacks, an English professor
at the University of Virginia, traces its legacy as a literary
theme from Samuel Johnson to present-day writers like Saul Bellow:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The history of boredom in its cultural constructions matters
partly because boredom itself now appears to matter so much. If
boredom can provide plausible justification for acts of violence or
self-destruction, if the desire to forestall it sells fountain pens
and trips around the world, if fiction writers assume it as the
substratum of experience . . . if all of the above are true, it
would seem that boredom has assumed broad explanatory power in a
society widely felt to be baffling. . . . Its 20th century
magnification absorbs ever more material into the maw of the
meaningless and provides ever more material for the imaginative
writer.

Internet now provides a rich lode of expressions of boredom. A

(www.boringinstitute.com) in turn provides a link to that of the

</P>
<P>
   Bored dogs are frequently destructive, frequently urinate and
defecate in the house, but are not anxious. A bored dog will slowly
chew something, or several things, move objects around the house,
eat or drink excessively, and sometimes even create ``lick
granulomas,'' generally on or above the paws. . . . With boredom,
you need to crate your dog, or confine him in a dog-proof area.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But boredom is a prerequisite to attaining
heightened levels of perception, argues an unsigned, online article
on psychic development (found at
www.newvision-psychic.com/magazine/698/notdoing.html). It says that
``to be bored is to be on the verge of being startled awake.''
Here's how: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sit on the ground outside and be bored.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to wait a while for true boredom to settle in. You
have to sit long enough for your mind to recognize that running
through its lists and endless chatter won't cause you to
automatically re-engage in typical activities. Just sit there.
Don't catalog all the things you see, or run through the list of
tasks you want to accomplish that day. Just sit and watch, without
interpreting.
</P>
<P>
   As you are sitting there you are probably starting to feel
foolish. Children may waste their time not doing much of anything,
but adults have things to do. More social patterning. Ignore it.
You are not trying to squash that response _ being able to
recognize social norms and act within them is important. Instead,
you are temporarily ignoring the reflex to follow habit. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Next, you might notice a little fear arising. Examine that fear
for a bit. What do you think might happen to you, sitting here on
the ground doing nothing? The answer: I don't know. And that's the
frightening part. Once you are truly bored, you are stepping into
the unknown. You don't know what thoughts will occur to you, what
your eye may notice, or how will feel. You are stepping beyond the
comfort of habitual patterns of perception.
</P>
<P>
   You are starting to itch.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe deeply, from the diaphragm, and relax. Gently resist the
reflex to jump up and get busy with something , or even to continue
sitting there busying your mind with unnecessary thoughts. Just
sit, relax and watch. No rush, no hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations! You can now begin to be truly bored.

   ``It's not fair that you didn't get to ask me all those
questions, and I didn't get put on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Multimillionaire Rick Rockwell, ne Richard Balkey, last week
on the hit Fox TV special ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the groom felt the show was imbalanced. The would-be brides
answered all the questions; he answered none.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the folks at Fox: In the spirit of equal time, you need
a sequel with the bridal contestants doing the asking!
</P>
<P>
   After all, the program didn't let on that Rockwell, a real
estate developer and motivational speaker worth $8 million, is also
a former B-movie actor and comedian. Or that in 1982 he told jokes
for 30 hours, making the Guinness Book of World Records for
``longest continuous comedy routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. With on-air revelations like these, ratings
would soar. Plus you should face up to the fact that it's not
single women without rich husbands who are desperate. Networks
without Regis Philbin are the desperate ones. Just imagine: ``Who
Wants to Be a Gold-Digger? Part II: The Bride Strikes Back'' . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: So. Are you really a multimillionaire? How much
of your net worth is liquid? Or is this only, like, on paper?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm heavily invested in high technology right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Aren't you concerned that high-tech is
overvalued?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I also own a lot of small-cap stocks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Hmm. You're not one of those suitors who thinks
the Russell 2000 Index is going to surge?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'm hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Oh, dear. I usually drop those after the second
date. OK. If you were to invest in an Asian country right now,
would it be A) Japan, B) China, C) Singapore, or D) none of the
above?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: C.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Good. How long do you think it would take you to
evaluate my investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (surprised) You have an investment portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Of course I do! I'm an experienced gold-digger!
(consulting teal index cards) Next question: I understand you're a
success object. You have a second home and a decent wardrobe. I
gather you're an attractive guy, though I can only see the back of
your head silhouetted in the purple shadows in your ``Wizard of
Oz'' booth. So the girls and I have been trying to figure out, um,
what your problem is. Why you can't find a wife. So, why are you
here?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I resent that. You're here, too!
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I told you, I'm a fortune-hunter. And my best
friend Marcia is always making fun of me for liking men who give me
presents, so she sent my picture in as a little joke. (To camera)
Marcia, if you're watching now, you're dead meat. (To
multimillionaire) What's your excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (miserable) See, I'm a motivational speaker
and by the time I get to a date I'm so burned out from talking I
have nothing left to say. Women find me boring. (He bursts into
tears.)
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Oh, God, you're the crying type too. No wonder
you're not married.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: You're not either!
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: That's because I'm picky.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (incredulous) If you're picky, how can you let
the Fox network choose for you?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I find the Fox Network to be very selective!
Have you seen those boys on ``Party of Five''? Besides, I don't
have the resources to do the kind of background check they did.
They screened you for diseases and past marriages and Swiss bank
accounts and criminal records and _ Fox accomplished in two weeks
what would take an average woman two years!
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I hadn't thought of it like that.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I hear before you became a real estate investor,
you did stand-up comedy in clubs. This whole thing could be a
publicity stunt for you. Would you promise me you'll never do
stand-up again? And you'll never mention me in a comic monologue?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What about if I get invited to do, like,
Letterman?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I promise. Though, damn, you'd make great
material.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: How would you justify your purchase of me to our
children?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I mean, when our neighbor pops this tape in the
VCR and little Billy asks you, Daddy, did you really buy Mommy on
TV?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'll say we had a very special romance.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Can I get more light on him, please?
Technicians! And can we see a little more flesh? Did you bring a
bathing suit?
</P>
<P>
   (MULTIMILLIONAIRE is stripped and put on display. REGIS PHILBIN
appears.)
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You've used up your ``50/50'' and your ``Ask the
Audience.'' You can either marry him or call your ``Lifeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I'd like to call Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Marcia is on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: (blubbering) I am so sorry. I'll never send your picture
anywhere again.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I forgive you.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But he might buy me some stuff. And the diamond
is really pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: So what? He's a former comic, he can't talk on dates,
and his portfolio isn't diversified! Look, you should totally meet
this other guy I was telling you about.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: I need your final answer.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: (still on phone) What's this other guy like?
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Well, he doesn't have money, but you would love his abs.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But I'd get to keep the car.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: You are a mercenary freak. (Marcia hangs up.)
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: OK, Reeg. I do.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You do. That's your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Yes. It's my final . . . (bursts into tears) No!
Why do I always meet losers? Even on national TV! Pre-screened,
creatively frustrated, incapable-of-making-small-talk losers?
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Maybe you should be a contestant on our next show: ``Who
Wants to Go on a Long Vacation by Herself?''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Would I get to keep the car?

   Aspiring bride: Oh, God, you're the crying type too. No wonder
you're not married.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: You're not either!
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: That's because I'm picky.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: (incredulous) If you're picky, how can you let
the Fox network choose for you?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I find the Fox Network to be very selective!
Have you seen those boys on ``Party of Five''? Besides, I don't
have the resources to do the kind of background check they did.
They screened you for diseases and past marriages and Swiss bank
accounts and criminal records and _ Fox accomplished in two weeks
what would take an average woman two years!
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I hadn't thought of it like that.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I hear before you became a real estate investor,
you did stand-up comedy in clubs. This whole thing could be a
publicity stunt for you. Would you promise me you'll never do
stand-up again? And you'll never mention me in a comic monologue?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What about if I get invited to do, like,
Letterman?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I promise. Though, damn, you'd make great
material.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: How would you justify your purchase of me to our
children?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I mean, when our neighbor pops this tape in the
VCR and little Billy asks you, Daddy, did you really buy Mommy on
TV?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire: I'll say we had a very special romance.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Can I get more light on him, please?
Technicians! And can we see a little more flesh? Did you bring a
bathing suit?
</P>
<P>
   (MULTIMILLIONAIRE is stripped and put on display. REGIS PHILBIN
appears.)
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You've used up your ``50/50'' and your ``Ask the
Audience.'' You can either marry him or call your ``Lifeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I'd like to call Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Marcia is on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: (blubbering) I am so sorry. I'll never send your picture
anywhere again.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: I forgive you.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But he might buy me some stuff. And the diamond
is really pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: So what? He's a former comic, he can't talk on dates,
and his portfolio isn't diversified! Look, you should totally meet
this other guy I was telling you about.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: I need your final answer.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: (still on phone) What's this other guy like?
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: Well, he doesn't have money, but you would love his abs.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: But I'd get to keep the car.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia: You are a mercenary freak. (Marcia hangs up.)
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: OK, Reeg. I do.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: You do. That's your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Yes. It's my final . . . (bursts into tears) No!
Why do I always meet losers? Even on national TV! Pre-screened,
creatively frustrated, incapable-of-making-small-talk losers?
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Maybe you should be a contestant on our next show: ``Who
Wants to Go on a Long Vacation by Herself?''
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring bride: Would I get to keep the car?

   CORPORATE-TAX-DODGES (Undated) _ With incomes rising sharply,
particularly among the wealthy, Americans are paying a lot more in
federal taxes than they did before the economic expansion of the
last decade. Not so, American corporations. Their profits are
growing even faster than Americans' incomes, yet the taxes they pay
have begun to fall. By David Cay Johnston.

   PUTIN-PROFILE (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ After half a year as
prime minister and a month as acting president, Vladimir Putin
remains largely unknown. But what is known _ his career in the KGB,
his tough suppression of Chechnya, his ascetic habits _ points in
many ways to an updated version of the Yuri Andropov model. By

campaigning for the big state's primary on Tuesday. Worried by

   Like many Americans so repelled by ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' that they watched it in astonishing numbers,
Scott Shuger, a columnist for Slate, came away with questions. He
wrote: ``How is this show, with its explicit cash and property
prizes for the woman, not prostitution?''
</P>
<P>
   The question may have been rhetorical, of course. No one said
anything about a sexual quid-pro-quo on the Fox special aired from
Las Vegas last week, and it ended in a wedding ceremony minutes
after Rick Rockwell, described as a real estate investor and
motivational speaker, chose Darva Conger, a nurse, from a field of
50 women who competed to marry a man they had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrangement struck some as akin to prostitution or
soliciting prostitution, both crimes under Nevada statutes. After
all, a woman was promising sex to a stranger in expectation of some
of his assets, and prostitution is defined by law as ``engaging in
sexual conduct for a fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the crime of pandering, in which a third party
``induces, persuades, encourages, inveigles, entices or compels a
person to engage in prostitution.'' Fox did inveigle, and it
offered the winner an Isuzu Trooper and a $35,000 diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas authorities are not on the case. ``I don't watch
television,'' said J. Charles Thompson, the deputy district
attorney, although he said the show sounded like something his wife
had mentioned because her beautician was talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the marriage would nullify a possible prostitution
charge, he replied: ``It's often the case that people have sex and
then get married, but you can do it the other way. We don't mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like something that's going to be big on our
list to prosecute,'' Thompson continued. His office's top
priorities are murder, robbery and rape, he said, though there is
the occasional prostitution arrest. ``If you're hanging on a street
corner with your thumb out saying you'll do certain things for 20
bucks,'' he said, ``we have vice cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve George, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office, said of Fox's contest, ``They're not selling sex,'' though
he quickly added, ``It may be an end product.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox assured viewers that the entire production was legal. And it
arranged for all 50 contestants to sign a prenuptial agreement
protecting Rockwell's assets, just in case things don't work out.

<P>
   There are those who may think it is something out of an Edward
Albee play, or maybe ``The Newlywed Game'' meets Jerry Springer.
But for the couple tired of flowers, chocolates and renting Nora
Ephron films, it could just be another way to celebrate their love.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Ohio State University are placing volunteer
married couples in a hospital room for two 24-hour sessions,
inflicting small wounds and then encouraging the couple to chat
about anything from in-laws to their sex lives. Then they take
regular samples of blood, saliva and sometimes fluid from the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems like ``get the guests'' _ the venomous game in
Albee's ``Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' _ taken to new
extremes, serious science is going on. The exercise is one of a
series of studies at the university that are taking a look at how
emotions affect healing, for better or worse. And the results may
help change how surgery patients are treated, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment and related research are taken so seriously that
the National Institutes of Health recently gave grants totaling $18
million to studies at Ohio State's Institute for Behavioral
Medicine Research.
</P>
<P>
   The couple behind the studies, Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a
psychiatrist, and her husband, Dr. Ronald Glaser, an immunologist,
are in the growing field of psychoneuroimmunology, which explores
mind-body issues as they relate to health. Already they have found
strong evidence that stress can not only make it harder to recover
from illness, but also make a person more susceptible to it.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing about the Glasers' experiment that seems to
interest people the most is not the science, but simply how the
volunteers feel. And they seem especially interested in those
little wounds given at the outset of each session, which include
blisters administered on the forearm with a small suction device
called a chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds terrible, I know, when you hear about it,'' said Dr.
Kiecolt-Glaser, who said she and her husband had both been
``chambered'' several times. ``But it's not. It's like someone
gently pinching your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguing is not that bad, either, she said, adding that the
goal was not to provoke 24 hours of disharmony. The couples, who
are paid $1,800 and must consider themselves happily married, are
asked to discuss a contentious issue (identified in earlier
discussions) for only a half hour during the second session. During
the first session, they are asked to talk about more neutral
aspects of their relationship, like how they met (although this,
too, can lead to conflict). Over the next 24 hours, researchers
draw fluids to check for levels of hormones like cortisol, which
indicates stress, as well as healing agents like leukocytes. Later,
they correlate their findings with a videotape taken of the entire
session to see when the stress points were.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the researchers have studied wound healing in other
people considered to be under stress, among them medical students
and people who care for Alzheimer's patients, and found that their
healing mechanisms were impaired. But in those cases, they had to
settle for people who reported being under stress. Bound by ethics,
the researchers could not design experiments in which human
subjects, unlike animal studies, were placed under deliberate
psychological pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Then some years ago, the Ohio scientists, drawn by the stress
that naturally occurs in relationships and the ability to measure
it physically in a lab setting, thought of using married couples.
``We wanted to take a real-life situation that was filled with a
lot of emotion and a lot of history,'' said Dr. William B.
Malarkey, an internist who is involved in the studies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the married couples were not given wounds, but simply
studied to see how their immune and other biological systems were
affected as they argued. The latest experiment is the first in
which the volunteers are given either blisters or small wounds
called punch-biopsies. The researchers hope to study about 100
couples, which could take several years.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser said the findings could help convince hospitals that
reducing stress can improve patient care and even shorten their
stays, which would lower costs. Although much has already been
written about the dangers of stress, he said he wanted to establish
clearly the connection between it and wound healing. ``The medical
community is a very conservative community,'' he said, ``and it
takes a while to convince people.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the same federal courthouse where Kenneth
Starr's grand jury met, Maria Hsia, an obscure California
immigration consultant, sits silently at the defense table dressed
in a neat yellow sweater set and black skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is the only figure embroiled in the 1996 Democratic
fund-raising scandal to face a full trial so far. Other party
fund-raisers, like John Huang and Yah Lin Trie, have pleaded guilty
to charges growing out of the scandal, and Pauline Kanchanalak,
another fairly obscure figure, is awaiting trial. But no senior
Democratic National Committee officials were ever charged. In a
much criticized decision, Attorney General Janet Reno decided
against appointing an independent counsel to investigate the fund
raising of either President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So, after four years of congressional hearings and federal
criminal investigation, it could all boil down to Hsia. In an
interesting piece of legal symmetry, Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque,
also represented Julie Hiatt Steele, a tangential figure in the
Monica Lewinsky investigation, who was the only person to face
criminal charges in the White House sex and lies scandal. (After a
jury deadlocked, Steele was not convicted).
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with engaging in an illicit scheme to reimburse
Democratic contributors, including donations connected to the
now-infamous luncheon held at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif., which was attended by Gore. Hsia has pleaded not
guilty. The vice president has said he had no knowledge of the
$55,000 in illicit contributions to the Democratic Party collected
from donors at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   But the temple fund-raiser shadows Gore, particularly as he
campaigns for the March 7 primary in California. Sen. John McCain
has savagely mocked Gore's varying statements about the event
(initially the vice president denied knowing it was a fund-raiser).
On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley has warned that
the fund-raising scandal is an unremovable stain on Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom last week, it was clear the Hsia trial could
provide Republicans with fodder for attack ads against Gore. Among
the exhibits was a videotape of Gore making his entrance at the Hsi
Lai temple on April 29, 1996, and then giving a speech surrounded
by enthusiastic worshippers in robes. The judge presiding over the
case noted that members of Congress, presumably Republicans, had
already called for copies, while Luque argued against releasing the
tape. ``My concern is that I can just see it played because the
vice president is campaigning on March 7 in California,'' she said.
(On Friday, the judge decided to keep the tape under wraps until a
verdict is reached.)
</P>
<P>
   There are no media throngs filling the grass and concrete area
in front of the courthouse known as ``the beach'' during the Monica
Lewinsky spectacle. The Hsia case involves far less sensational
testimony, including complicated federal election laws, party
allocation formulas and four-year-old allegations of fund-raising
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the Gore campaign would like it to remain. But the
video isn't the only trial exhibit that could cause Gore problems.
Luque also introduced into evidence a color photograph of Hsia and
a broadly smiling Gore, with longer and much bushier hair, during a
trip they made to Taiwan in 1989. It was during that trip, arranged
by Hsia and Huang, that Gore first met the temple's leader,
Venerable Master Hsing Yun.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia is charged with providing Huang and others with checks
signed by monks, nuns and other straw donors who were reimbursed
for their donations by the temple and other illegal sources.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee witness last week was Huang, who testified that he
knew nothing of the reimbursement. Huang occasionally shot a sad
glance toward Hsia, who was once his good friend and political
comrade. In the late 1980s, they helped organize the Pacific
Leadership Council in order to gain more clout for Asian-Americans
in California. To achieve that goal, Huang explained, they started
raising money for Democratic Senate candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's testimony certainly exposed some of the dark side of
fund-raising. He made it clear that both he and Hsia were under
intense pressure from the party to bring in money. He said that
fund-raising events featuring Gore were expected to generate
$200,000 and that the temple event had fallen far short of that
amount. He said he called Hsia after the luncheon and urged her to
help him reach his goal of taking at least $100,000 back to
Washington with him. He said he knew this meant she would return to
the temple for more money and when he met her there later, she
handed him an envelope with checks totaling $100,000. Among the
checks were those from the monks and nuns who were later illegally
reimbursed by the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,
said the party was unaware of the reimbursement scheme or of any
illegal fund raising by Huang, who pleaded guilty to a single
conspiracy charge last August. The committee returned all the money
raised at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said he needed dignitaries from Washington to draw donors
to events in California. He had wanted Gore to attend two events, a
fund-raising luncheon at a Los Angeles restaurant and a visit to
the temple that would not involve soliciting donations. But Huang
was told Gore would only have time for one stop, and so the two
events were collapsed into one. ``Everything was on a tight
schedule,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his testimony was helpful to Gore and Hsia. The
fact that the two events were hurriedly combined and the temple
visit was not originally scheduled as a fund-raiser may help
explain why the vice president at first described it as a
``community outreach'' luncheon. And Luque said that Gore did not
give a fund-raising speech at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's trial has renewed criticism from Asian-American political
activists that relatively small fry like Huang and Hsia have been
singled out for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hsia has had kind words for Gore. In an interview last year,
she said: ``I've met dozens of politicians. The others come saying,
`Money, money.' By comparison, he is a more genuine person.''

<P>
   The first one rattled the doorknob at 3 a.m. Wednesday morning,
trying to see if the door was open. The next came by an hour later,
then one at 8 a.m., another at 10:30 and yet another at noon. At 1
p.m. a particularly determined intruder arrived, trying entrances
that most people would not even think about. The final attempt of
the day came at 3 p.m., but like all the rest, it was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The fortress these thieves were trying to enter? A simple home
computer, hooked up to the Internet with the cable modem service
(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The owner happens to be a computer security expert, who wants to
remain anonymous so hackers will not see his system as a
tantalizing challenge. He knows about the attacks because his
computer has a fire wall, which keeps intruders out and tells him
when they have come by. Yet he was nonplussed by the number of
attacks on that single day last week. ``I think it's fairly
typical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree. ``It's called doorknob rattling,'' said Steven
Bellovin, a researcher in Internet security at AT&AMP;T Laboratories in
Florham Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are under constant random attacks from hackers around
the world who are looking for open doors, or ports, enabling them
to sneak in. For many hackers, the goal is simply to enter someone
else's computer. Others, like those who launched the recent attacks
on commercial Web sites, are criminals who quietly entered other
people's computers and planted programs that they later triggered
en masse, tying up Amazon.com., Buy.com, eBay, CNN.com and other
sites. But it is a strange sort of crime, since the owners of the
invaded computers probably were unaware of the foray, computer
security experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users who are connected through telephone lines are of
less interest to intruders because they are assigned a different
address each time they dial in. Thieves who do break in have a hard
time succeeding at it again.
</P>
<P>
   But people who are always connected to the Internet through
cable services offered by (at)Home or Road Runner or the high-speed
DSL lines provided by telephone companies are a different story. So
are companies and universities that hook everyone up via their own
high-speed networks. The advantage is that these systems are 10 to
hundreds of times faster than using an ordinary telephone line. The
disadvantage is that your computer's address is usually fixed and
easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addresses used by (at)Home are public, they're well
known,'' said Bellovin. ``It's very easy to scan all the addresses
for (at)Home and see which ones might be hooked up to cables and on
all the time and which ones might have certain open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for other commercial cable companies as well as
university computers. ``A lot of universities have networks that go
to every dorm room,'' he added. ``It is very easy to scan the
address space and find the open servers and go in.''
</P>
<P>
   How often you see doorknob rattlers come by may depend on how
good you are at detecting them. Some computer experts say they see
attacks on a regular basis. Bellovin, who also uses (at)Home, says
his system averages two attempted break-ins a day. Ira Winston,
director of computing at the University of Pennsylvania, said he
detects an attack at least once a day on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Smith, a computer science professor and expert on
network security at the University of Pennsylvania, protects his
computer by closing and locking all of its doors. That makes it
more difficult to use, but he doesn't care. ``I'm paranoid about
security,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Other owners set up fire walls that act as electronic stockades.
But most people who are at risk do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a target-rich environment,'' Bellovin said, borrowing a
phrase from the military. Computer factories may ship their PCs
with their doors unlocked, and many users are blissfully unaware of
the cruising doorknob rattlers, which include not just the
teen-ager next door, Smith said, but foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Today the trend is toward high-speed cable connections and DSL
lines and toward personal computers connected by networks, said
William Arbaugh, a computer security consultant in Baltimore who
worked at the National Security Agency. The stage is set for
break-ins, he said. And while there are countermeasures, nothing is
100 percent secure.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague at the NSA, he said, ``used to say that the only
safe computer was one buried in a safe in the ground with a marine
guard and the power turned off.''

   As Rice Krispie Treats sailed over John McCain's head _ lobbed
by a reporter passing out snacks on the campaign bus _ the senator
was asked how he had changed over the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the real truth?'' McCain began, and
everyone else stopped talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; have &LR;  changed a little bit, to try to be more considerate
of people who ask me questions _ not the media, but in town hall
meetings. Sometimes I'd get offended if somebody stood up and said,
`You're a crook.' I used to flash back at them,'' he said, raising
the subject of his own soft spot, the temper critics have raised as
an issue in the race. ``But I've learned to treat people with
respect, even when they're there hammering you. I've gotten a
thicker skin.'' Asked why, after 17 years of give and take in
Congress, that hadn't happened before, he said, ``Lack of maturity,
maybe?'' and laughed along with his audience.

   McCain's almost unheard of willingness to evolve in public and
his eagerness to admit to past mistakes, both in his personal life
and on policy, have helped set him apart and define him as a
different kind of candidate. He does a whole riff on the stupidity
of his vote against making Martin Luther King's birthday a national
holiday and returns again and again to the subject of how he blew
his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And however it turns out, this particular experiment in
authenticity has opened a debate about why most politicians and
their handlers consider consistency so important when candidates,
just like other people, do change their minds occasionally. Or have
their minds changed for them, once they get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Estrich, who ran Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential
campaign, said the impulse to appear consistent above almost all
else is a fearful response but not altogether unwarranted. ``The
concern is that if you admit any weakness, it will be exploited,''
she said. ``But the lesson of this year is that the best possible
political strategy is to seem authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of `Gotcha!' is no fun,'' Estrich said, when the
candidate himself keeps reminding us where he's gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton moment is a
time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong, and how he's
changed, may hold particular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls suggest that voters, for whatever reason, do consider
McCain more believable than the other candidates. The latest New
York Times/CBS News poll found last week that 49 percent of those
surveyed think he says what he really believes most of the time,
compared to 42 percent who think that of Bill Bradley, 31 percent
of Vice President Al Gore and 30 percent of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 percent think McCain says what he thinks people want to
hear, compared to 38 percent who think the same of Bradley, and 61
percent who say that about both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hardly the first American politician to score points
with a nicely done apology. But Alan J. Lichtman, chairman of the
history department at American University, who specializes in
presidential politics, said McCain has wielded the mea culpa in new
way. It works particularly well for him, Lichtman said, because
``the McCain model fits with the whole image he's trying to
establish as different, willing to buck his party, speak his mind,
and as part of that, be like all of us and say, `I've made
mistakes, I'm admitting the mistakes and I'm moving on.' It's so
effective it's hard to see how you even get nailed on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet where in politics is the line between intellectual growth
and pandering? And how do voters know when the candidate is sincere
_ or when his evolution is complete?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a change, people deserve to know why,'' said
Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's daughter and an adviser to his
campaign. ``This election process is really a little like a job
interview. As a voter, I'm hiring someone to do a job for me, and I
want to know what they're going to do and what their approach is. I
personally wouldn't place a lot of value on complete rigidity
through 20-plus years of public service, but the valid question is,
is this person going to change their position again?''
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, McCain's competitors seem to adhere to the
more traditional view that it's a lot more important to be seen as
consistent than as capable of learning from missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists that he has always _ ``always, always, always,'' he
said in a recent interview _ fully supported abortion rights. But
in the 1980s, as a member of the House, Gore's votes got an 84
approval percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee,
according to the group's executive director, David O'Steen. ``I've
been in meetings with him,'' O'Steen said, ``and he put himself
forward as opposing abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrich said, ``Nobody cares 20 years ago what he said about
abortion, and there would have been no issue at all'' if he hadn't
given them the honesty issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush somehow maintains that there is no discrepancy between his
stated belief that abortions should be available in cases of rape,
incest or to save the life of the mother and his statement that the
GOP platform should not be changed to include these exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever indicating that he's moved an inch, Bush today
takes credit for protecting patients against managed care abuses,
even though he vetoed such legislation in 1995 and, after voicing
serious reservations, enabled an HMO liability law to take effect
without his signature in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems to have combined the worst of both models _ mostly
sticking to the ``never let them see you evolve'' philosophy, but
then publicly switching to support ethanol subsidies, a move that
is hard to explain as anything other than an epiphany inspired by a
desire to win the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some see McCain's openness as just another strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says all the time, `I was wrong on that vote,''' said Ralph
Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader who is advising Bush.
His own candidate is not likely to follow suit: ``There's a point
where flexibility can begin to look like waffling, and voters want
consistency,'' Reed said. ``McCain has learned the value of winning
an argument by conceding the point, but that works better in the
cloakroom than in a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it does seem like a decent strategy, several
political consultants said that what McCain is attempting is not
likely to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell whether it will play in November,
though I personally find it refreshing, like a shower after seven
and a half years of Clinton,'' said Scott Reed, Bob Dole's former
campaign manager. ``But even if McCain, through a unique history
and background, seems to be able to get away with it, you can't
carbon copy it with other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself does not necessarily recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost doesn't matter if it's a good idea or not,'' he said
in an interview. ``It's just the only way I could do it.''

   As Rice Krispie Treats sailed over John McCain's head _ lobbed
by a reporter passing out snacks on the campaign bus _ the senator
was asked how he had changed over the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know the real truth?'' McCain began, and
everyone else stopped talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; have &LR;  changed a little bit, to try to be more considerate
of people who ask me questions _ not the media, but in town hall
meetings. Sometimes I'd get offended if somebody stood up and said,
`You're a crook.' I used to flash back at them,'' he said, raising
the subject of his own soft spot, the temper critics have raised as
an issue in the race. ``But I've learned to treat people with
respect, even when they're there hammering you. I've gotten a
thicker skin.'' Asked why, after 17 years of give and take in
Congress, that hadn't happened before, he said, ``Lack of maturity,
maybe?'' and laughed along with his audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's almost unheard of willingness to evolve in public and
his eagerness to admit to past mistakes, both in his personal life

   NABATIYE, Lebanon _ A group of hard-eyed men from Hezbollah, the
Party of God, were driving an American correspondent down a narrow
road outside this village in southern Lebanon last week when the
visitor pointed through the open car window toward an Israeli
fortification high on a rocky hill to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Something on the hill was glinting in the blinding sunshine. It
was probably an Israeli soldier's binoculars, and the reaction of
the Hezbollah fighters was quick and angry. ``In the name of Allah,
don't point!'' the driver said, turning the car and racing back
toward the village. ``If you point, the Israelis will think you're
aiming at them, and they'll hit us with their 155-millimeters.''
</P>
<P>
   The reproach was a hard lesson, but it was nothing compared with
the cold fury of the Hezbollah men a little later while driving
past billboards showing the supreme icons of Hezbollah's brand of
Shiite Muslim fundamentalism _ Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, and his successor as the Islamic
Republic's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Blundering again, the reporter asked where were the images of
Iran's president, Mohammed Khatami, an Islamic reformer whose calls
for greater democracy and human rights have electrified his country
and crystalized the battle between reformers and conservatives that
culminated in the Iranian parliamentary election held Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This time the driver slowed, looked back at his questioner with
something approaching contempt, then fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   Among militant Shiites in Lebanon, apparently, Khatami is a
nonperson, somebody who merits only scowls. Later, much the same
reaction was evident in Hezbollah's heavily guarded sanctuaries in
the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah leaders are
preparing to face up to their own day of reckoning. That will be
the moment in July when Israeli troops complete their promised
withdrawal from Lebanon and leave Hezbollah to make a historic
choice between the militant Islamic policies of its past and
mounting pressure for more pragmatism _ particularly if Lebanon's
neighbor and protector Syria resumes seeking peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of holding high the banner of Islamic
fundamentalism, the conservative mullahs of Iran and their
counterparts in the leadership of Lebanon's Hezbollah have arrived,
more or less simultaneously, at their respective political
Rubicons, the point at which their cause will either adjust or
wither. Partly this is a matter of coincidence, of political
timetables in Iran and Lebanon that have their separate logics. But
there are common factors, too, as there have been since the first
stirrings of Shiite clerical insurgency in the two countries more
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching any broad conclusions about the tide of affairs in the
Islamic world is fraught with hazard, considering that there are
more than 50 Muslim nations, comprising more than a billion people,
vastly different cultures in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and
a deep theological and political schism between the world's 800
million Sunni Muslims and 200 million Shiites. But some trends are
too compelling to ignore; the events now unfolding in Iran and
Lebanon, suggesting a broader movement toward political realism in
the Shiite world, are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Sunni-Shiite schism, tracing back to the dynastic
rupture that followed the death of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed in
632 A.D., it would take an intrepid chronicler to suggest that
something still broader may be stirring across all of Islam _ a
slow, even crab-like move away from the militancy that seemed like
a rising tide at the onset of the 1990s. After all, Osama Bin
Laden, the heir to a Saudi Arabian fortune who is the world's
most-wanted terrorist leader, is still at large in Afghanistan,
with cells of armed supporters spread widely through the Middle
East, North Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of Islamic militancy continue to lurk, on the
fringes of power or underground, in dozens of countries _
Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Algeria among them. Some experts
think the world has yet to see the high tide of Sunni
fundamentalism, an equivalent of the Shiite revolution in Iran in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, what seems inescapable is that the men who
kick-started the wave of Islamic militancy in the modern world, the
Shiite clerics of Iran and Lebanon, have their backs to the wall,
even if few hard-line mullahs in either country seem ready to fly
the white flag just yet.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Iran, where huge numbers of voters turned out for
parliamentary elections last week, the results will take days to
compile and it is possible that reformers, divided among themselves
and deprived of some of their best candidates by pre-election
screeners loyal to Khamenei, may have to settle for something less
than outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lebanon, a surface appraisal would suggest that
Hezbollah, after 15 years of battling Israeli troops, is on the
verge of its brightest moment yet, the unilateral Israeli pullout
promised by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lebanon, as in Iran, the longer-run trends seem to lie
against the militants. With Israel's troops gone, the Islamic group
will be deprived of its most powerful card, and Lebanon's 3.5
million people will be left to weigh whether they want to give the
group more political power than it already has with its minority
bloc in the Lebanese parliament. Every sign says that they do not.
In recent times, Hezbollah has even been rewriting history,
pretending it had nothing to do with the brutal terrorism it
sponsored in the 1980s, and playing down its commitment to an
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Iran, the long run seems to strongly favor the
pragmatists, if only because of demographics. The young constitute
a great bulge in Iran's population _ people under 25 who are too
young to remember the revolution or to have fought against Iraq or
to do anything today but chafe at the social restrictions Khomeini
imposed as the price of liberation from the rule of Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi. Those young are a formidable, and growing, base of
support for the forces of reform.
</P>
<P>
   If the pragmatic trends hold, it will be an ironic comeuppance
for the Shiite fundamentalists, who once viewed the Iran-Lebanon
axis as the basis for building an eventual Islamic superstate. Only
in Lebanon, it seems, do many people remember that it was here, in
the 1960s, that Musa al-Sadr, an Iranian-born Shiite cleric,
pioneered the populist form of Shiite political awakening that
found its ultimate expression in the Islamic revolution in Iran.
Revered by Shiite moderates and revolutionaries alike, he
disappeared on a trip to Libya in 1978, the apparent victim of a
plot by the Libyan leader Moammar el-Gadhafi, a Sunni Muslim who,
most Lebanese Shiites suppose, did not favor the rise of Shiite
fundamentalist power in the heart of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months after Sadr's luggage turned up off a
Tripoli-Rome flight without Sadr, Khomeini was on a flight from
Paris to Tehran, where he declared the Islamic state that turned
Iran upside down. Within a few years, the militant Lebanese Shiites
who felt orphaned by Sadr's disappearance were empowered again when
Khomeini sent 5,000 Iranian revolutionary guards to Lebanon's Bekaa
valley, where they armed, trained and indoctrinated the Hezbollah
force that went to war against Israel.

state that, according to the militants, was the millennarian
promise vouchsafed them by the Prophet.

 NABATIYE: just yet.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Iran, where huge numbers of voters turned out for
parliamentary elections last week, the results will take days to
compile and it is possible that reformers, divided among themselves
and deprived of some of their best candidates by pre-election
screeners loyal to Khamenei, may have to settle for something less
than outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lebanon, a surface appraisal would suggest that
Hezbollah, after 15 years of battling Israeli troops, is on the
verge of its brightest moment yet, the unilateral Israeli pullout
promised by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lebanon, as in Iran, the longer-run trends seem to lie
against the militants. With Israel's troops gone, the Islamic group
will be deprived of its most powerful card, and Lebanon's 3.5
million people will be left to weigh whether they want to give the
group more political power than it already has with its minority
bloc in the Lebanese parliament. Every sign says that they do not.
In recent times, Hezbollah has even been rewriting history,
pretending it had nothing to do with the brutal terrorism it
sponsored in the 1980s, and playing down its commitment to an
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Iran, the long run seems to strongly favor the
pragmatists, if only because of demographics. The young constitute
a great bulge in Iran's population _ people under 25 who are too
young to remember the revolution or to have fought against Iraq or
to do anything today but chafe at the social restrictions Khomeini
imposed as the price of liberation from the rule of Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi. Those young are a formidable, and growing, base of
support for the forces of reform.
</P>
<P>
   If the pragmatic trends hold, it will be an ironic comeuppance
for the Shiite fundamentalists, who once viewed the Iran-Lebanon
axis as the basis for building an eventual Islamic superstate. Only
in Lebanon, it seems, do many people remember that it was here, in
the 1960s, that Musa al-Sadr, an Iranian-born Shiite cleric,
pioneered the populist form of Shiite political awakening that
found its ultimate expression in the Islamic revolution in Iran.
Revered by Shiite moderates and revolutionaries alike, he
disappeared on a trip to Libya in 1978, the apparent victim of a
plot by the Libyan leader Moammar el-Gadhafi, a Sunni Muslim who,
most Lebanese Shiites suppose, did not favor the rise of Shiite
fundamentalist power in the heart of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months after Sadr's luggage turned up off a
Tripoli-Rome flight without Sadr, Khomeini was on a flight from
Paris to Tehran, where he declared the Islamic state that turned
Iran upside down. Within a few years, the militant Lebanese Shiites

Khomeini sent 5,000 Iranian revolutionary guards to Lebanon's Bekaa

betrayal and defeat.

<P>
   The attacks on eBay, Yahoo, Etrade and other big Web sites
earlier this month showed the Internet to be surprisingly
vulnerable to a few laptop-toting cyber-vandals. This is a pressing
public concern, surely, as the nation increasingly comes to rely
for commerce and everyday communication on this chaotic, global
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Clinton met last Tuesday with more than two
dozen representatives of the Internet community, a big role for
government was not on the agenda. The president asked what could or
should the government do. Not a lot, the Internet elite told him.
The group's message: It's an industry issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in that room was asking the government to fix this
problem,'' said Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for
technology at IBM, who attended the meeting in the Cabinet Room of
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering epitomized the main thrust of government policy in
the Internet arena. Government, the theory goes, should offer a
forum and be a cooperative partner, so as to facilitate the rapid
rise of Internet commerce. That stance was set in a July 1997
policy document on e-commerce written by Ira Magaziner, a senior
White House policy adviser at the time. His document extolled the
``breakneck speed of change in the technology'' and stated,
``Government attempts to regulate ((the Internet)) are likely to be
outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The hands-off approach, however, will be challenged more and
more as the Internet moves rapidly into the mainstream. For just as
the Net creates new forms of commerce, it also opens a door to new
forms of crime. And the malicious hackers who recently brought down
the big commercial Web sites by jamming them with a flood of bits _
a tactic known as denial-of-service attacks _ are but one example.
</P>
<P>
   Online con artists are doing a booming business. In a report to
the Justice Department in January, the National Consumers League
warned, ``The Internet has become the new frontier of fraud.'' The
Federal Trade Commission, for example, reports an alarming surge in
consumer complaints of fraud on Internet auction sites, to more
than 10,000 last year from about 100 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet combating such crimes seems to be among the easier Internet
issues to handle. Cracking down will require some new tools, new
skills and new forms of cooperation among federal and state
agencies. The FBI, Justice Department and FTC are increasing their
computer crime and Internet fraud squads. But the issue appears to
be mainly one of enforcement, not the need for new laws or
policies. The problem seems manageable, even familiar in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Other new technologies, from cars to credit cards, have prompted
dire warnings that they would bring a flood of crime. In the early
1900s, the automobile was seen as an ideal means for bank robbers
and murderers to flee before police could catch them. Criminals did
use them, but police got their own cars and motorcycles, cars were
licensed and federal agents were allowed to pursue suspects across
state lines. Later, credit cards were seen as a license for fraud.
And, indeed, credit card fraud exceeds $1 billion a year. But law
enforcement authorities and industry have kept it a manageable cost
of doing business, amounting to roughly 9 cents for every $100 of
goods purchased by credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The thornier policy issues raised by the Internet concern
privacy and antitrust matters. On privacy, the United States has so
far adopted a self-regulatory approach, letting the online industry
set its own policies for collecting personal data on computer users
who visit Web sites _ and for informing users of those policies and
how they can opt out. The FTC is monitoring the industry's efforts,
saying that self-regulation, if effective, is more flexible and
thus preferable to direct government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and other critics say self regulation
gives too much power to Internet companies and too little to
consumers. The danger, they warn, is that increasingly
sophisticated software will soon allow marketers to track a user's
every mouse click and then match that information with demographic
databases to establish online profiles of individuals. Those
profiles could, in theory, be used to determine not only what
online marketing pitches people see, but also potentially what job
and education opportunities people are offered.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says such concerns are overstated. But the FTC
recently began investigating how medical Web sites handle personal
information. And last week, DoubleClick, the Internet's leading
advertising placement company, reported that the FTC was
investigating how the company collected and used personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the profiling technology disturbing _ this notion of
checking on consumer viewing habits without them knowing it _
especially if that information is then merged with other databases
so they can be identified,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the
FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy issue is so sensitive that Robert Litan, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, recommends ``minimalist''
privacy legislation to engender consumer trust and ensure the rapid
development of E-commerce. The effect, he says, would be similar to
legislation in the 1970s limiting a person's liability to $50 if
his credit card is lost and used fraudulently, which eased consumer
worries about credit cards.

   One of the more innovative views of government's role in the
Internet era comes from Lawrence Lessig, an antitrust scholar and
the author of ``Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig argues that the headlong commercialization of the
Internet threatens its decentralization and openness _ the
technological ``architecture,'' as he puts it _ that has made
wide-open innovation, competition and free expression essential
features of the Internet. That core architecture, he explains, is a
network that has open access and public software standards so that
anyone can communicate over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig sees the efforts of cable television operators, who are
beginning to offer high-speed Internet service, to deny competing
Internet services access to their cable network as one such threat
to the openness of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should be pro-active early on to make sure the
architecture of the Internet remains open,'' Lessig said. ``If you
get the architecture right, the regulation takes care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are skeptical of the need for much government
involvement, all the more so of the pre-emptive variety advocated
by Lessig. The answer they offer is to let markets work _ the
Internet being first and foremost an extremely efficient market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there a role for government and that policy must be
informed by the new technology,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``But the fact is the
technology is enabling an enormous amount of new competition and
breaking down barriers. The Internet is off and running, and for
the most part the government should stay out of its way.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 20, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-CHANGING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As candidates cling to
long-held positions or candidly change them, a debate develops
about why politicians and their handlers consider consistency so
important when candidates do, just like other people, change their
minds occasionally. Or have their minds changed for them, once they
get elected. Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton
moment is a time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong,
and how he's changed, may hold particular appeal. By Melinda
Henneberger. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-MILITANTS-REVIEW (Nabatiye, Lebanon) _ Islamic
revolutionary movements show signs of fading as developments in
Iran and Lebanon suggest a trend toward political pragmatism in the
Shiite Muslim world. After 20 years of holding high the banner of
Islamic fundamentalism, Iran's conservative mullahs and Lebanon's
Hezbollah have arrived at a crossroads at which their cause will
either adjust or wither. By John. F. Burns. (Moved in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Computers are under constant random
attacks from hackers looking for open doors _ called ports _
allowing them to sneak in. It's called doorknob rattling. The
hacker attacks on commercial web sites like Amazon and Yahoo
apparently were launched by doorknob rattlers. Users who connect to
the Internet at home, using telephone lines, are of little interest
to the intruders. But people who use cable connections or DSL lines
are a different story. So are companies and universities that hook
everyone up with cable modems. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Combating cybercrimes such
as the recent attacks on major Web sites seems to be among the
easier Internet issues to handle. It will require some new tools,
new skills and new forms of cooperation among government agencies.
But the issue appears to be mainly one of enforcement, not
requiring new laws or new policy. The more thorny policy issues
raised by the Internet are privacy and antitrust, which may require
legislative action. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUDDHISTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore's aides
insist that the Buddhist temple fund-raising episode is old history
and that Gore was cleared of any wrongdoing. Still, they anticipate
a blitz of attack ads showcasing the temple fund-raiser. The raw
footage for such ads was on display in court last week during the
trial of Maria Hsia, a former Democratic fund-raiser. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's nine-year economic
expansion is the longest in history. So wages should be climbing
faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies
raise pay to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But
wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.
Why? By Louis Uchitelle. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-STRESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ohio State University
researchers studying how emotions can help or hinder physical
healing are conducting experiments on volunteer married couples,
asking them to discuss stressful subjects and then inflicting minor
wounds on them and studying how the wounds heal. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   MARRY-MILLIONAIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some possible questions
from a hypothetical sequel to ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-PROSTITUTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Was ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?'' a form of prostitution? Although no one
on the show mentioned sex, the arrangement had certain elements of
prostitution, defined by as ``engaging in sexual conduct for a
fee'' _ or, more accurately, of soliciting prostitution. After all,
a woman was promising sex to a stranger in expectation of some of
his assets. By Lauara Mansnerus.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Legions of popular science fans have
become accustomed to increasingly fantastic revelations. In a day
when a steady stream of exotic scientific speculations overwhelms
the public imagination _ tiny superstrings vibrating in a
10-dimensional universe, invisible parallel worlds, wormholes
tunneling through space and time _ a comfortable satisfaction can
be taken from a modest technological triumph like an unmanned
asteroid probe. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOREDOM-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some experts say the growing use
of the Internet reflects not social isolation and individual
loneliness, but mass boredom. Some excerpts from scholarly writings
on boredom as a cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ In Mitrovica, the
divided town in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins,
long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north and Albanians to
the south have burst into violence. The reasons go deeper than any
tactical mistake made by civilian or military authorities.
Mitrovica marks the effective political and ethnic partition of
Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace looks so far away,
even eight months after NATO took complete control of the province.
By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-NEWSPAPERS-REVIEW (Rome) _ European countries are more
relaxed about nudity than the United States, particularly in
newspapers and advertising. However, while English and German
newspapers tend to restrict their naked starlets to the
entertainment pages, Italian papers regularly blend nudity or
startling graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft
porn and hard news. A look at some of the ethical issues raised by
Italy's unique style of newspaper advertising and journalism. By

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 20, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-CHANGING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As candidates cling to
long-held positions or candidly change them, a debate develops
about why politicians and their handlers consider consistency so
important when candidates do, just like other people, change their
minds occasionally. Or have their minds changed for them, once they
get elected. Several conservative thinkers said the post-Clinton
moment is a time when someone who is willing to say he was wrong,
and how he's changed, may hold particular appeal. By Melinda
Henneberger. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-MILITANTS-REVIEW (Nabatiye, Lebanon) _ Islamic
revolutionary movements show signs of fading as developments in
Iran and Lebanon suggest a trend toward political pragmatism in the
Shiite Muslim world. After 20 years of holding high the banner of
Islamic fundamentalism, Iran's conservative mullahs and Lebanon's
Hezbollah have arrived at a crossroads at which their cause will
either adjust or wither. By John. F. Burns. (Moved in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Computers are under constant random
attacks from hackers looking for open doors _ called ports _
allowing them to sneak in. It's called doorknob rattling. The
hacker attacks on commercial web sites like Amazon and Yahoo
apparently were launched by doorknob rattlers. Users who connect to
the Internet at home, using telephone lines, are of little interest
to the intruders. But people who use cable connections or DSL lines
are a different story. So are companies and universities that hook
everyone up with cable modems. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Combating cybercrimes such
as the recent attacks on major Web sites seems to be among the
easier Internet issues to handle. It will require some new tools,
new skills and new forms of cooperation among government agencies.
But the issue appears to be mainly one of enforcement, not
requiring new laws or new policy. The more thorny policy issues
raised by the Internet are privacy and antitrust, which may require
legislative action. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUDDHISTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore's aides
insist that the Buddhist temple fund-raising episode is old history
and that Gore was cleared of any wrongdoing. Still, they anticipate
a blitz of attack ads showcasing the temple fund-raiser. The raw
footage for such ads was on display in court last week during the
trial of Maria Hsia, a former Democratic fund-raiser. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's nine-year economic
expansion is the longest in history. So wages should be climbing
faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies
raise pay to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But
wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.
Why? By Louis Uchitelle. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-STRESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ohio State University
researchers studying how emotions can help or hinder physical
healing are conducting experiments on volunteer married couples,
asking them to discuss stressful subjects and then inflicting minor
wounds on them and studying how the wounds heal. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   MARRY-MILLIONAIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some possible questions
from a hypothetical sequel to ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-PROSTITUTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Was ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?'' a form of prostitution? Although no one
on the show mentioned sex, the arrangement had certain elements of
prostitution, defined by as ``engaging in sexual conduct for a
fee'' _ or, more accurately, of soliciting prostitution. After all,
a woman was promising sex to a stranger in expectation of some of
his assets. By Lauara Mansnerus.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Legions of popular science fans have
become accustomed to increasingly fantastic revelations. In a day
when a steady stream of exotic scientific speculations overwhelms
the public imagination _ tiny superstrings vibrating in a
10-dimensional universe, invisible parallel worlds, wormholes
tunneling through space and time _ a comfortable satisfaction can
be taken from a modest technological triumph like an unmanned
asteroid probe. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOREDOM-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some experts say the growing use
of the Internet reflects not social isolation and individual
loneliness, but mass boredom. Some excerpts from scholarly writings
on boredom as a cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ In Mitrovica, the
divided town in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins,
long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north and Albanians to
the south have burst into violence. The reasons go deeper than any
tactical mistake made by civilian or military authorities.
Mitrovica marks the effective political and ethnic partition of
Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace looks so far away,
even eight months after NATO took complete control of the province.
By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-NEWSPAPERS-REVIEW (Rome) _ European countries are more
relaxed about nudity than the United States, particularly in
newspapers and advertising. However, while English and German
newspapers tend to restrict their naked starlets to the
entertainment pages, Italian papers regularly blend nudity or
startling graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft
porn and hard news. A look at some of the ethical issues raised by
Italy's unique style of newspaper advertising and journalism. By
Alessandra Stanley.

   BONDS-RAMPART (Los Angeles) _ Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan's plan to float bonds to pay for settlements in the Rampart
scandal is just the latest in a long line of
pay-later-for-debts-now plans that the city has concoted.

ward off the vicious breeds that may take on their pet. Dog fights
are all too common at the park, neighbors and visitors of the dog
park say. Alan Goldman, the owner of ``Joy,'' a Corgie and Lab
mixed dog were both hospitalized after a pit bull attacked the dog
this week. Checking for stats at this dog park and others in city
for number of dog fights and injuries to people. By Lisa Van

DANGERS OF OFF-LEASH DOG PARKS TOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alan Goldman had always looked forward to taking
his corgi-Lab mix, Joy, to frolic in the dog park with other
pooches.
</P>
<P>
   But their fun turned into horror last week when a pit bull mix
twice Joy's size tried to steal her Frisbee, burying his fangs in
her neck. Goldman was badly bitten, too, as he intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog parks are not as safe as people think,'' Goldman said
last week. ``People don't know about the dangers of doggy parks.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly isn't the Westminster Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months at the Sepulveda Basin Off-Leash Dog Park,
the city Recreation and Parks District has logged one call of a
child bitten by a dog, five dog-on-dog attacks and two calls for
owners not taking reasonable control of their pets.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles police said they respond to an average of about
four dogfights per month at the Sepulveda Basin park. And at the
Beverly Oaks Animal Hospital in Sherman Oaks, 20 to 50 dogs are
brought in each year that have been injured by other dogs at some
of the city's five off-leash parks, said the manager of the pet
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, customers bragged they bring their ferocious dogs
to the parks to train them for fighting, said the manager, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get those punks who seek out dog parks. They go to these
parks to field-test the fighting dogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Stone, president of the advisory committee of the Sepulveda
Basin Off-Leash Dog Park, said the problem of ruffians with vicious
dogs has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at one time, that may have been true. Groups of guys
would come and bring pit bulls and fight them. We got that cleaned
up pretty quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These parks have assumed risks. You can get knocked down. You
can get bit. And you can get peed on. Those kind of things
happen,'' Stone said. ``Occasionally, you see a person with an
aggressive dog, and we don't let them stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   And some owners police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bonnell has lived across the street from the Sepulveda
Basin dog park for a decade and has witnessed the fights. Because
of the potential for problems, he keeps Josie Wales, his 2-year-old
mastiff-Lab mix with a mean bark, away from the park - except on a
rainy day when few dogs are around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets dominant if other dogs get around him. He gets mad,''
he said. ``I love animals and I don't like to see dogs fight. But
it happens. It's in their nature.''
</P>
<P>
   It is largely up to the dog owners themselves to make sure their
canines and others are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Rules are posted on signs at the front gate, but not everyone
abides by them, officials said. And no city workers are permanently
stationed at the park, leaving it up to dog owners to police
themselves on the five-acre field that has a fenced-off area for
smaller and more timid dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a dozen volunteers - including Stone herself - are there
to supervise the dogs. But they have no set schedule, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Shorts, acting chief park ranger for the city's
Recreation and Parks Department, said his rangers act immediately
when hearing about a dogfight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's community involvement. They need to report to us ongoing
problems and we will respond to it immediately. We try to monitor
all the facilities the best we can,'' Shorts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is whatever action is taken is usually left up
to the owner's discretion, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners choose to share the vet bill, others go to small
claims court.
</P>
<P>
   Stone recalled one case years back in which Judge Wapner of TV
court fame ruled in favor of three Irish wolfhounds who attacked a
small dog at the Sepulveda Basin park. He determined that the
smaller dog should have been placed in the smaller dog park area.
</P>
<P>
   Even the regular park visitors who report few problems want more
consistent supervision to prevent fights.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a lounge chair under a tree at the park with her pet
beagle, Mollie, snuggled on her lap, Paula Goldstein said she had
seen dogfights as recently as a week earlier. In one of the two
fights, two men started throwing punches, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be somebody here at all times,''
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Stengel of Reseda brings her 5-month-old Catahoula
leopard breed dog to the park every day to ``socialize him,'' even
though her other dog was attacked by a pit bull at the Laurel
Canyon Off-Leash Dog Park a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some dogs make me nervous the whole time I'm here,'' she said
at the Sepulveda Basin park. ``I think there's a lot of machoism
involved here - who's got the tougher and bigger dogs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other dog owners brush off the fights as doggy roughhousing.
Some people indulge in letting their pets run free as they sit in
lounge chairs socializing with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   They exchange recipes, meet dating partners, host canine
birthday parties and arrange play dates for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a little piece of heaven. It's great. Everybody
knows everybody. They need more of these around,'' said Jay Crane,
who travels 1 hours from his Frazier Park home once a month to the
park with his two dogs, including a pit bull mix named Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips and rules to make sure your visit to one of
the city's five off-leash dog parks is safe for you and your dog:
</P>
<P>
   - If your dog is aggressive, don't bring it to the park.
</P>
<P>
   - Report aggressive dogs immediately to rangers at (323)
913-7390.
</P>
<P>
   - Do not bring in female dogs in any stage of heat.
</P>
<P>
   - No dog or human food allowed inside park.
</P>
<P>
   - If dogs get into a fight, avoid sticking your hands between
them. Rather, try to have a person grab each dog by the hind legs
to pull them apart.
</P>
<P>
   - Carry an air horn to distract fighting dogs. When using it,
hold it up in the air, rather than further agitating the dog by
blowing it in the dog's face.
</P>
<P>
   - Place a harness on your dog to more easily lift your animal
away from a fight. Spiked collars can also be placed on the dog to
discourage other dogs from biting in the neck area.
</P>
<P>
   - Keep small and timid dogs in the smaller play area of the
park.
</P>
<P>
   - No more than three dogs allowed per person.
</P>
<P>
   - Dogs under 4 months old are not allowed.

YOUNG OFFENDERS MARCHING TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Inside the white brick classroom adorned with
construction-paper cutouts of gangbangers and athletes, teen-age
boys sit in plastic chairs, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The bald, goateed Steven Angel, a sessions drummer who recorded
songs with legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, removes several
colorful drums from a large bag and begins to pass them around the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gets a drum and brief instructions, then Angel screams,
``Go crazy!''
</P>
<P>
   Like a drag racer at the starting line, rumblings turn to
thunderous pops.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's quiet. The teens laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tap into their emotions,'' Angel said. ``Through
drum therapy, I see them saying, Yeah, this is the way I should
feel. I should feel like a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Drumming has been a popular method for people to bang out their
frustrations, work as a team, or, well, just make some noise.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes this gathering unique is that the participants
are wards of Camp Karl Holton, a juvenile probation camp in a
remote corner of the San Fernando Valley. Organizers and psychology
experts say it is one of the first such programs in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the calming effect it seems to have on these
young people, law enforcement officials are taking a liking to drum
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sessions are a probation officer's dream,'' said L.A.
County Probation Department spokesman Kenneth Kondo. ``When they
are done drumming, we notice a change in attitude. They are not as
aggressive. They aren't as angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In two-hour sessions some Sundays, 15 teen-age boys beat and
whack the drums with plastic mallets until their hands turn raw, or
until they are too tired to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts believe the casual sessions are not doing any
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venting anger doesn't reduce aggression, it increases it,''
said Brad Bushman, a professor of psychology at Iowa State
University who has conducted two studies on the effects of taking
out aggression. ``The best-case scenario of venting anger - through
drum therapy, punching a pillow, hitting a punching bag and yelling
and screaming - is that it doesn't work at all. The worst-case
scenario is that it does more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts and participants have a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer drummer Angel says drum therapy helps bring out the
child in these sometimes hardened juvenile delinquents, many of
whom are serving several months at the camp on various weapons
possession, theft and burglary charges.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent session, 15 teens, wearing brown and tan and
camouflage fatigues, walked single file into an elementary
school-size room. As a probation officer ushered them in, some of
the teens took seats and moved them next to their buddies moves to
which the probation officer objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them to think that they are in control,'' Kondo
said, as the probation officer ordered them into other seats.
</P>
<P>
   The young men complied and simmered into submission, while their
probation officer sat at the back of the room, keenly watching them
while cradling a walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Angel and music program instructor Fletcher Beasley set up a
microphone at the front of the room and began passing out the
small, colorful canvas drums.
</P>
<P>
   As the boys got their drums, some began hitting them. Others
pounded them. Beasley captured their attention.
</P>
<P>
   After introducing a television producer and her cameraman who
were documenting the session for a youth violence series, he said,
``Make as much noise as you want to. There are probably not many
opportunities to make as much noise as you want around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The session began with the primal beating of the drums. Then
Angel led the group through several exercises - one in which he led
a drum solo and they followed, another in which each teen led his
own solo and others followed, and then solos with chanting. At one
point, Angel led them on an anger exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to think of someone who hurt you, or an experience
that recently happened that caused you a lot of anger, and release
the emotion on the drum,'' he said. ``With their eyes closed, they
visualize the person on the drum, and as they hit the drum, the
image starts fading away as the emotion is released. It's much
healthier to release their anger on an inanimate object.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session, a few visibly tired teens could
barely tap their drums, while others had set their drums on the
floor to beat them. One youth was nursing blisters with toilet
paper he had been given. Two youths were ordered to leave the room
early for taunting a boy from a rival gang.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, like Janice Held, a Los Angeles marriage and
family therapist, disagrees with Bushman's theory that venting
anger fuels aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will grant him that there might be some accuracy to that,''
said Held, who participated in a recent session with Angel and
follows his work regularly. ``If you hold things back and then have
a spurt of anger, you probably will not have improved the
situation. However, it's incredibly essential to release energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words that (Angel) uses as part of the drumming
subconsciously build self-esteem at the same time as he's allowing
them to release their energy.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has yet to be seen what long-term effects, if any, the
drumming will have on the teens, 14-year-old Anthony, who was doing
10 months on a gun possession charge, knows one thing's for
certain. ``The thing about beating up the drums,'' he said, ``is
that it can't hit you back.''
</P>
<P>
   A reticent Jose, 15, who said he was serving nine months for
carrying a .38-caliber handgun, was tired after the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go in and go to sleep,'' he said.

CRITICS ASSAIL MAYOR`S PLAN TO ASSERT TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From health care advocates to taxpayer watchdogs, Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan faces stiff opposition to his plan to bond
the city's long-term share of the national tobacco lawsuit for cash
now to settle Los Angeles Police Department scandal cases.
</P>
<P>
   With some $10 billion in bonded city debt, some questioned the
fiscal responsibility of the plan to sell bonds on $300 million due
over 25 years for $100 million in cash up front, and the loss it
represents to the city in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned whether the city should take steps now to bond
the money or wait to see how much will be required after the first
Rampart Division liability cases go to trial, probably next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the full scope of what we will be facing,'' said
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. ``A good point is to look at the
Rodney King case and what happened with that settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   King, whose 1991 beating in Lake View Terrace precipitated the
earlier police scandal, had sued the city for $54 million. In the
end, he received less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a handle on what the real number will be,''
Ridley-Thomas said. ``This could be less or it could be just the
tip of the iceberg of what we will face.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have given a preliminary estimate of losses of up
to $125 million from the cases known so far, involving 99
individuals. But many believe the cost could go much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Former anti-gang Officer Rafael Perez told investigators of the
shootings, beatings, planting of evidence and lying in court
against gang members. An internal review is under way and a report
on the LAPD's operations is scheduled to be released March 1.
</P>
<P>
   One of the concerns voiced over Riordan's proposal to use the
tobacco settlement money is the high cost. For that $300 million
coming to the city over 25 years, it would get around $100 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that's bad policy,'' said Jon Coupal of the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. ``This money should be used
for purposes related to tobacco and health. It strikes me as
horrible public policy to use that money for more public debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The city already has more than $705 million in voter-approved
debt and an additional $1.2 billion that is not voter-approved
debt. It pays $248 million a year to cover the interest payments on
those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city has $7.7 billion in revenue bonds - which
are paid off from fees or other programs, such as sewer, water and
power.
</P>
<P>
   One city analyst, who asked not to be identified, said a
preliminary look at the mayor's proposal raises the issue of the
cost to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city can issue judgment bonds for 5 percent,'' the analyst
said. ``The mayor's plan would cost 6.5 percent in interest. That
point and a half can add up to a lot of money when you're talking
about $300 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez said Riordan is open to other
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is looking for creative ideas,'' Rodriguez said.
``The tobacco money seems like a good idea because it's
uncommitted. The one thing the mayor is concerned about with this
is that the city not cut back any programs or stop new
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the mayor also has proved his ability to cover
shortages from his first days in office when his budgets had to
deal with shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Riordan is going into uncharted
territory with the potential damages from the Rampart corruption
scandal and other demands on the city treasury.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the city is looking at another judgment bond to
cover part of the costs in a $40 million settlement for police
overtime from the 1992 riots.
</P>
<P>
   City Controller Rick Tuttle, whose office was involved in
developing the city's debt policy to keep it below the level of 15
percent of the general fund, said he wants to review the mayor's
proposal more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to have more of a sense of the details, but what we
have to look at is if this is the most effective way to cover the
debt,'' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mayor is getting pressure from the health
community to use the funds for tobacco education purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Reynolds, an heir to the R.J. Reynolds Co. and an ardent
anti-tobacco activist, said he believes the proposal to use the
money for lawsuit settlements is emblematic of similar situations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to speak out and make a very clear case that this is
just politics being played out here,'' Reynolds said. ``We find it
curious that in the settlements nowhere is it required that the
money be used for health or tobacco education programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the demands on the city require the city to have
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of health and education programs that already
are going on from the state, the county and the federal
government,'' Rodriguez said. ``What we have to look at is how to
maintain our services.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich also
criticized Riordan's proposal, pointing out that the city earlier
decided to use the dollars to install curb cuts for handicapped
access at intersections, and for tobacco enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Antonovich said. ``Those funds are to be
used to help those impacted by the Americans with Disabilities Act
and for education and health programs related to the abuse of
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco tax dollars are not a Fort Knox the city of Los
Angeles can use for a nonhealth-related mistake they have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gloria Molina also disagrees with Riordan's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes the tobacco settlement money was intended for
health care and should go for health care,'' said her spokesman,
Miguel Santana. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ It is long past midnight as the No. 22 bus
lumbers down the spine of Silicon Valley carrying 12 passengers
with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The bus rolls past $1 million three-bedroom ranches on
quarter-acre lots, driveways where Range Rovers are the second car,
towns where millionaires are minted every day. The passengers keep
their eyes shut, or on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   They have two hours to catch a bumpy nap before the No. 22, the
only bus route in the valley that runs 24 hours a day, finishes its
26-mile circuit from here to Menlo Park and back. Then they must
get off and wait 10 or 15 minutes before they can climb aboard
again, using their $3 all-day pass for another two-hour run on the
bus known these days, these hours, as ``the rolling hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of them work full time. One is a cashier at a toy store.
Another works at a box factory. Another says he juggles three
part-time jobs. But in the dot-com land of milk and honey, where
the median family income, $82,000, is the highest in the nation
(and an average of 63 people hit the millionaire mark every day),
nontech jobs just do not pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   With all the new money floating around, the most expensive
housing market in the country and the densest concentration of
investment capital in the world, there is no other place in the
country that offers a starker example of the growing gap between
the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Stock option millionaires bid on houses as though they were
buying Van Goghs. A four-bedroom contemporary in Palo Alto, for
example, that was priced at $2.2 million sold for $3.2 million,
while a one-bedroom cottage listed at $495,000 sold for $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more and more working people are becoming
homeless: 34 percent of the homeless population in Santa Clara
County in 1999 estimated at 20,000 had full-time jobs, up from 25
percent in 1995. And those figures fail to count the growing number
of families doubled up in single apartments, or paying $400 a month
to live in a garage or to sleep on a stranger's living room floor.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the minimum-wage earner who is scrambling to
survive here. More teachers, police officers, firefighters,
commissioned salespeople _ all people who make more than $50,000 a
year and would be comfortably middle-class in many other places _
are seeking the services of area homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, ``poor'' means a family of four scraping by
on $53,100 a year or an individual earning less than $37,200, say
federal housing officials. No wonder then, that even some high-tech
workers, those in the entry-level jobs, end up on church soup
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last five years, we have seen a sharp increase in the
number of families and working poor who become homeless almost
exclusively due to the outrageous cost of housing in Silicon
Valley,'' said Jan Bernstein, a spokeswoman for InnVision, a
nonprofit group here that provides 300 shelter beds and serves 850
meals a day to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half the people staying in the shelter are
employed,'' Bernstein said. ``They lose their housing first, then
try to hang onto their job.''
</P>
<P>
   At the richest time in the richest region in the richest nation
in the world, less than 30 percent of the households here can
afford to buy a house. The median price for a house in Silicon
Valley, $410,000, is more than twice that for the rest of the
country. Renting is increasingly out of range for the average
worker as well. Two out of five valley residents cannot afford to
rent the average two-bedroom apartment, which is about $1,700. Even
studios in inferior neighborhoods cost more than $1,000 a month,
and that does not include the three months' rent landlords
typically ask to secure an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   With waiting time for subsidized housing up to several years,
the situation will only get worse, housing officials say. Indeed,
the housing burden is the main reason why more people are leaving
Silicon Valley these days than arriving, according to the state's
Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are not rich in Silicon Valley, getting sick or
laid off or losing a second income means catastrophe. Tammy
Morales, a $15-an-hour dental assistant with two teen-agers and a
6-month-old, discovered that when she and her husband separated two
months ago. The rent on her two-bedroom apartment in Campbell, a
suburb bordering San Jose, is $1,425, impossible to manage on her
salary, with her family's needs. Five days after she missed paying
her rent, she received an eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worked and have never asked for help,'' said
Morales, who had her first child when she was 15. ``But I never
thought I wouldn't be able to afford to live where I've lived all
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment hunting is not going well. Weeks tick on, and all
she has found for the $1,100 a month she can barely afford is a
one-bedroom walk-up in a falling-down building in south San Jose,
the neighborhood she knew growing up as the bad side of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting ridiculous,'' Morales said. ``My friend's father
has a house for rent here. He was asking $1,800, and he is getting
calls from people offering twice that much, without even seeing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales received a one-time $700 check last month from the
Sacred Heart Community Service in San Jose, which offers emergency
housing assistance, meals, job training, counseling, clothes and
other services to help those who are homeless or on the verge of
homelessness. More and more, the Sacred Heart Community Service
helps clients who come from the ranks of people who would be doing
fine in another part of the country, said Barbara Zahner, the
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are earning more than they did 10 years ago,'' Zahner
said, ``but they're spending 80 percent of their income on housing.
Food becomes a discretionary item. We call them the invisible
working poor. Their jobs are not likely to have stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor immigrants who have long made San Jose a portal to the
American dream have fared the worst. Many of the valley's
landscapers, construction workers and fast-food workers are
homeless, according to advocacy organizations that help them. Or,
they live in such terrible conditions _ 26 men to a house, each
paying $400, for example _ that they are arguably as badly off as
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, most people are in service-related jobs _ McDonald's,
gardening, and that kind of thing,'' said the Rev. Steven P. Brown,
the pastor of Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Alviso, a
small community near here. ``They're probably some of the hardest
working people I've seen. But many with two or three jobs are
barely making it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in many cases, he said, immigrant families share houses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Maria Perez, 34, is one of the lucky ones. She came here nine
years ago from rural Mexico thinking she and her husband, a
landscaper, would make lots of money and live in a house with a
yard, as she saw on American television. Instead, for almost eight
years, until she became pregnant with her second child, she and her
husband lived in rooms in other people's apartments. A year and a
half ago, when she gave birth, they moved into an $1,100-a-month
two-bedroom apartment, a bargain by valley standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to my husband, you and me are very lucky,'' said Perez,
who learned English at Sacred Heart Community Service. Now she is a
full-time day care assistant at Sacred Heart, making $300 a week.
``I pay half of it to the baby sitter,'' she said. ``Sometimes my
daughter says, `Mommy, it's not fair. How come people here have
cute houses and we don't? How come other people have cars and we
don't?' I say, `Because we are poor and they are rich, and that's
the way it is here.'''

<P>
   It is hard not to notice the Ferraris and Mercedes all over the
valley these days, and the columned mansions with swimming pools
that take up virtually whole backyards. The homeless passengers
waiting at 2 a.m. the other day for the No. 22 bus spent a good
deal of time chatting all about the haves shoving their wealth in
the faces of the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where all the millionaires and billionaires live,''
said a 63-year-old woman in a cowboy hat who called herself Cowboy
Luna. ``I don't understand how they can't help the people who can't
afford the rent. The people who are on this bus can't afford the
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to a sad-looking young man carrying a backpack. He
had been laid off from his job, Cowboy Luna whispered. To him, she
said: ``Right, the people on this bus just can't afford the rent in
this crazy place?''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``And some of us,'' he said, ``never will.''

PUTIN RETAINS SOVIET DISCIPLINE WHILE STEERING TOWARD REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (A Special Report)  
(Eds: For those wishing to use an abridged version, the first take
can stand as is.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Nine years ago a sea of Russians
celebrating the collapse of a communist-backed coup jammed the
traffic circle outside Moscow's KGB headquarters and stripped away
icons of dictatorship, including a bust and plaque honoring the
late spymaster and Soviet ruler, Yuri Andropov.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, in a little-noticed ceremony at entrance 1A of the
old headquarters, workers put them back _ on the personal order of
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   To Westerners, it seemed a curious tribute: a gesture of respect
from a self-proclaimed democratic reformer to a chief of an
infamous machine of repression. Now that Putin is acting president
and the runaway favorite to win a full term in presidential
elections next month, it is a bit unsettling, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country that believes in a strong hand at the tiller,
there was logic to the affinity. Andropov was not simply a shadowy
terror chief propping up a disintegrating totalitarian state; he
was also a leader who recognized that the Soviet system had to be
reformed _ not to make it democratic and Western, but to make it
great and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   He began with draconian discipline in the streets and a
crackdown on vodka. After half a year as prime minister and a month
as acting president, Putin _ his ambitions, his methods, his
intentions _ remains largely unknown. But what is known _ his
career in the KGB, his tough suppression of Chechnya, his
statements, his ascetic habits _ points in many ways to an updated
version of the Andropov model.
</P>
<P>
   He may have little use for Andropov's Soviet system, and a
greater appreciation for law and order and the value and efficiency
of Western-style business. But he has shown himself a man every bit
as intolerant of Russia's disarray, and as determined to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the Soviet Union break up?'' he asked in a December
interview, then answered himself: ``Because things were allowed to
happen; laxness. And if we continue like this, Russia will fall to
pieces, and it will happen so quickly you and I cannot even
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there will be a real tragedy, much bigger than we are
seeing today in the north Caucasus. Much bigger,'' he said. ``You
can imagine what will follow if we see the Russian Federation fall
apart, a nuclear power. We do not have the right to be lax; we do
not have the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question is what he intends to do about it. Putin
advertises himself as a democrat. He says that a free press is an
essential deterrent to tyranny; that Russia's only dictatorship
should be ``a dictatorship of laws,'' that Russia is committed to
``fundamental political rights and human liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   But his six months in the Kremlin present a far muddier picture.
In prosecuting the war in Chechnya, Putin has proved not just
indifferent but belligerent toward international criticism of
Russian behavior there. His aides have used both financial and
police levers to cow critics of that war in the press, even
fingering some skeptical reporters as potential collaborators with
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently for the purpose of skewering Putin's potential rival,
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, deputies aligned with Putin
struck a power-sharing deal with the Communist Party in the Russian
parliament, shunning democratic forces. The acting president has
talked of fiscal, legal and social reforms, but his presidential
agenda remains vague.
</P>
<P>
   What he has offered are gestures _ like mandatory military
education in schools _ that hint at a streak of nationalism and a
bent for strong, centralized rule.
</P>
<P>
   Putin clearly has an intellectual grasp of democracy and of what
he has called the ``historic futility'' of communism. He is a
veteran of an intelligence service in which, as an agent in East
Germany in the 1980s, he could witness the reality of socialist
economics and Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   But his defining characteristics seem to be a passion for order
and a desire to see Russia rise from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew H. Murray, a former U.S. Senate aide who has worked with
investors here for the last decade, frequently negotiated with
Putin when he worked with foreign businesses. Murray called Putin
very tough, mentally swift, immaculately prepared and ingenious at
navigating Russia's labyrinthine bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a `khozayin,''' a tough taskmaster, Murray said. ``He
knows how the pieces of this society fit together. He knows how to
take care of people. And he knows how to get results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great potential on the part of the West to
misinterpret Putin,'' Murray added. ``You shouldn't mistake a lack
of an economic worldview for a lack of economic purpose. He has a
purpose: to get Russia back on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor Antonov, a retired KGB officer who claims to have worked
with Putin, and carries a tattered snapshot which appears to prove
it, agreed in a long conversation last week that Putin and Andropov
shared some traits. But Westerners seeking a clue to Vladimir
Vladimirovich Putin's style of leadership, he said, might look to a
more familiar ruler, an iron-fisted democrat and abrasive
nationalist of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Vladimir Vladimirovich is most like De Gaulle,''
Antonov said. ``I don't know if that's good or bad. But in my
opinion, he is close to this.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with many of his countrymen, Putin seems almost
monkish. He does not smoke. If he drinks, it is rarely. He seldom
shows anger and does not make snap decisions. He regularly works
16- and 17-hour days. He is a practicing Orthodox Christian _ his
mother secretly arranged for his baptism when he was a baby _ and
actually delivered a Christmas Eve sermon to reporters last month
outside a Moscow church.
</P>
<P>
   He holds not just one diploma _ a distinction shared among
Kremlin predecessors only by Mikhail Gorbachev _ but two: a law
degree from Leningrad State University and a doctorate in economics
from Russia's oldest technical university. He speaks some English
and such impressive German that he can imitate dialects. He holds a
black belt in judo and played handball in high school. He is a
runner, an avocation roughly as common among his predecessors as
break dancing.
</P>
<P>
   When President Boris Yeltsin named Putin chief of the Federal
Security Service, the domestic successor to the KGB, in 1998, he
sought to promote him to general, the rank held by all espionage
chiefs. Putin, who only rose to lieutenant colonel during his own
KGB days, would have none of it, saying he had not earned the rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``His most outstanding trait, I would say, was his fighting
spirit and his strong will to achieve his goals,'' said Pavel
Koshelev, a college classmate and fellow KGB officer who wrote a
recommendation for Putin's application to join the agency. ``In
general, he exercised total control over himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Sobchak, a former mayor of St. Petersburg and, early on,
Putin's mentor, said Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin, who served
the longest as prime minister under Yeltsin, would relax ``by going
to the baths, by going hunting, by heavy drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Putin and his team, the new people who are now coming into
the government, they don't drink or smoke, they don't go hunting,
and if they go to the baths, it's only to wash, and not to get
drunk or be with girls. They're entirely different people _ not
only by age, but by upbringing and behavior.''

</P>
<P>
   In fact, Putin's upbringing was not atypical. He was born Oct.
7, 1952, in St. Petersburg, then Leningrad, the only child of a
factory foreman and his wife who were, it is said, decorated war
veterans. Like countless Russians and the vast bulk of
Leningraders, he spent his first decades in a communal flat, where
he shared a carved-up apartment with two other families.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Putins were not poor. His father's job, at a shop
that made experimental parts for devices conjured up at a
neighboring institute, was highly specialized. It probably paid
well for the time: unlike many Soviet women, Putin's mother did not
work.
</P>
<P>
   Although small for his age _ he remains short and wiry today _
Volodya Putin was enrolled in martial arts classes by his parents.
By the time he entered secondary school No. 281, at age 16, he was
a top-ranked expert at sambo, a Russian combination of judo and
wrestling dating from the 1930s, and able to handle schoolyard
fights, one teacher said, with devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Putin was no academic weakling, either. School
281 was a college-preparatory institution for ninth- and 10th-grade
students _ the Soviet system ended at grade 10. It was the only
school in Russia stressing chemistry, and only students with
near-perfect grades _ straight ``fives,'' with perhaps one four _
could get in.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates were guaranteed a spot in the city's most prestigious
technical university. Putin planned to be a chemist, but it was not
long before he discovered that his true interests lay elsewhere.
The education at an elite school like No. 281 was not ordinary. The
director encouraged teachers to shun lectures and rely on debates
and even arguments to impart their lessons. The school's most
popular instructor, a literature teacher named Mikhail Dimenkov,
peppered his course with samizdat _ banned literature circulated
underground in carbon or handwritten copies. The history teacher,
Tamara Stelmakhova, staged discussions on whether Nikita
Khrushchev's promise to build a true communist state within 20
years was realistic.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Volodya Putin was drawn to humanities and
softer sciences like biology, where he scored steady fives. His
math and chemistry grades fell to threes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to his father about this,'' Putin's biology teacher,
Raisa Polunina, now 68 and retired in a tiny third-floor flat
outside the city, said in an interview. ``He said his son was so
goal-oriented that he already knows what he wants _ and between us,
why should he be expending so much energy on chemistry and math
when he is going to do something else?''
</P>
<P>
   In teachers' and students' memories _ made rosier, perhaps, by
time and his rise to prominence _ Putin was the steadiest and
hardest-working of all: the boy everyone called when the school
radio station broke down, as it often did; the one who made weekly
current events reports to class and, several times, to the entire
school; the sole boy who agreed to dance with girls in an
interschool competition because the honor of No. 281 was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Putin played music by the Beatles and other Western rock bands
on the school radio station. He attended after-school
get-togethers, though he held none in his flat. He was well-liked
by girls, who apparently admired his athleticism and quiet
competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say that we had a lot of time for recreation,''
said Alexander Matveyev, a classmate. ``After high school
graduation, we still would meet sometimes over the weekend at each
other's places. We danced, talked about our life; had a party.
Still,'' he said, ``Putin was a little more adultlike than the rest
of us. It was clear that he was a responsible person who wanted to
make something of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Putin enrolled at Leningrad State University, one of
the more prestigious Soviet institutions, where he majored in civil
law and studied German.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin didn't have much free time at school, and when he did,
he spent it on sport,'' said Koshelev, who first met him there in
1970. ``While he's not a big man, he has fantastic reactions as a
judo and karate expert. He was my instructor at the KGB school for
karate, and he impressed us all with the inner strength he
exuded.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   KGB Career: A Plum Position In a Gentler Time
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Putin was Leningrad's judo champion. A year later, he
graduated with honors from the university. Sobchak, who taught
civil law to Putin and presided over the oral examination for his
diploma, says today that his student acquired not just a solid
education, but an appreciation of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere at the university was free-thinking, democratic
and dissidentlike,'' Sobchak said during a long talk in his St.
Petersburg law office. ``It is not necessary to convince him that
we need to have a market economy, to respect private property and
the rule of law. It's already his professional credo, one he
acquired while he was at the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, like many others, has much to gain by burnishing
Putin's reputation. He lost his bid to become governor of the St.
Petersburg region in 1996, and subsequently was accused of major
corruption _ accusations that drove him into virtual exile in
western Europe until his return to St. Petersburg last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Putin did soak in some un-Soviet customs. But Soviet law
was drenched in ideology, and the law school was considered a
finishing school for future government workers _ not exactly free
thinkers. At the same time, former students say, the faculty was
peppered with older professors with an almost prerevolutionary
attitude toward the law. And the students, many of them children of
the victims of Stalin's repression, were relatively progressive,
interested in _ and allowed to experiment with _ foreign films,
music and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB also trolled the Leningrad law school, looking for
future spies, but it was extremely selective. Of the 100 or more
students in the class of 1975, it picked but one.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Andropov's KGB was anything but free-thinking. Andropov
himself helped crush Hungary's 1956 revolt, ran the agency during
the 1968 suppression of Czechoslovakia's ``Prague Spring,'' and
popularized the Soviet practice of imprisoning dissidents in
psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1970s and 1980s, the KGB _ while still feared and
fearsome _ was no longer the tool of Stalin, sending millions to
their deaths in the gulag. It still had ears everywhere and was
vigilant for any sign of dissidence, but those who knew their place
and their limits could stay out of the KGB's web.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mood in the country,'' said Polunina. ``If you
weren't touched by Stalin's repression, it was like it never
happened. The KGB had become helpers of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, it also was a coveted career choice, a club of elite
Soviets given superior education and a unique chance to sample the
forbidden world _ if only to fight it. And so when recruiters
offered a job in the service in 1975, Putin accepted instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he owned a new car, which he told disbelieving friends he
had won in a lottery. Putin was schooled in espionage in Moscow,
but passed much of the next decade in Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly working in counterintelligence, he joined the
KGB's First Chief Directorate as a foreign intelligence agent,
focusing on Western visitors and, presumably, handling informers
who passed through the region to drop off information or receive
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's superiors were reluctant to send him abroad, Antonov,
his KGB co-worker, said last week, because he was single. But
sometime in the early 1980s, Putin married Lyudmila, a specialist
in English and French some eight years his junior. In 1985, the KGB
sent him to East Germany. He became Adamov, director of a
German-Soviet friendship society in Leipzig, living in a
two-and-a-half-room apartment in Dresden. His office in a two-story
brick villa was across the street from the sprawling Stasi
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's real work is partly a matter of speculation. His KGB
co-worker, Antonov, said that he remained a foreign agent,
traveling frequently to the West to gather information and manage
informers. Others have suggested _ Antonov calls it ``rubbish'' _
that Dresden was an espionage backwater where Putin's main job was
to keep tabs on an East German population growing increasingly
restive under the nation's Stalinist dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the winds were changing. In 1985, Andropov's
protege, Gorbachev, came to power and began his perestroika, and
suddenly communist regimes across Eastern Europe were tottering.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Putin's work in Dresden may have involved
preparation for the collapse. According to some published accounts,
he worked with seven other KGB agents on an operation code-named
``Luch,'' Sunbeam, aimed at creating a network of spies separate
from the one then shared with East Germany's intelligence agency.
The notion was to maintain a stable of agents that could survive a
collapse of East Germany's government.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, however, came swifter than anyone imagined. By
December 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen and East and West Germany
were on their way to being reunited under a democratic government.
Putin has yet to give his own public account of these events.
</P>
<P>
   Antonov, who did not serve in Dresden but claims to have
remained close to Putin through the 1980s, said Putin's principal
reaction to East Germany's collapse was not ideological. He
realized that the walling off of the two Germanys was fated to end.
The major regret, rather, was that the end was quick and chaotic,
and not managed better in the interests of Moscow.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Political Climb: From Mayoral Aide To Kremlin Post
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Leningrad with a bronze medal from his Stasi
co-workers and took up work in the international affairs department
at his old university, a job that was really a cover under which to
continue intelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he heard from Sobchak, who had quit teaching to become the
first mayor of a newly renamed St. Petersburg. Putin became his
external affairs aide, charged with recruiting foreign companies
and promoting business. In a city embracing capitalism, he became
the man to see, in no small part because it quickly became clear
that he got things done.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was deputy mayor, and by Sobchak's description, ``my
most reliable, responsible and hard-working assistant.'' Antonov,
no admirer of Sobchak, said Putin told him that he quit
intelligence work for politics because government work offered a
prospect ``to make something happen'' at a critical period in
history.
</P>
<P>
   In Sobchak's administration, Putin made the law his specialty.
He excelled at unraveling the Gordian knots of Russian bureaucracy
and building an infrastructure _ highways, telecommunications,
hotels _ to support foreign investment. He also became known as an
exacting, workaholic taskmaster who gave underlings one chance _
two, at most _ to reach a goal. He seldom stayed at receptions and
city functions longer than a half-hour, preferring to slip away to
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers said his anteroom was perennially jammed with
callers, usually foreign investors, and that his meetings always
ran beyond schedule. ``Putin is the kind of guy who wants to listen
to everything you have to say,'' said Alexander Kostrykin, an aide
in his office from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His success is hard to measure. St. Petersburg never realized
Sobchak's grand ambitions to become Russia's financial capital;
Putin's plans for a world trade center fell through in 1995;
through much of the 1990s, the city struggled.
</P>
<P>
   But in fairness, Putin started from scratch. and St. Petersburg
today appears prosperous _ in part, some say, because of the
economic foundation he laid. Sobchak and others say Putin had a
major hand in every significant foreign investment in St.
Petersburg in the early 1990s, from Coca-Cola to Credit Lyonnais to
Dresdner Bank to NEC, the Japanese electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Bazhanov, a St. Petersburg banker, first met Putin in
1995 at the Davos international economic forum. When Bazhanov later
asked the city to help find his bank an office, Putin produced _
and promptly asked the bank to sponsor the purchase of $500,000 in
equipment for city hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the American investment adviser, described a 1994
instance in which a Russian government agency sought to seize a $9
million donation by a U.S. charity _ until Putin personally
persuaded the former prime minister, Chernomyrdin, to push
legislation through Russia's parliament thwarting the agency's
plans. Putin extracted his own payment for the favor: a hefty
donation of sterilization equipment to a city medical clinic to
slow the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's very professional; very disciplined,'' Murray said.
``And in the end, you got a result. Usually at the end, you don't
know if someone's looking for a bribe. But that's not Vladimir
Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Odling, a senior analyst at St. Petersburg's Leontieff
Center for Social and Economic Research, said, ``Everyone in
government in Russia has skeletons in his closet. But Putin was one
of the more honest and decent people in the St. Petersburg
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin was literally tossed out of St. Petersburg politics in
1996, when Sobchak lost his political campaign, which Putin shaped.
Alone among top aides, he resigned after the loss. ``Better to be
hanged for loyalty than rewarded for treason,'' he told friends.
</P>
<P>
   He was rewarded anyway, with a Kremlin job some say was arranged
by another reformer from St. Petersburg who is now his deputy
finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin. That job, in 1997, kicked off a
rise in Kremlin politics which, by any definition, has been
meteoric.
</P>
<P>
   Should it continue after the March election, as seems likely,
Russia's De Gaulle may well give the West even greater headaches
than did France's. Putin appears every bit as dry-eyed about the
merits of liberal democracy and one-superpower worlds as he was
about the demise of East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is, like De Gaulle, an authoritarian leader longing
to restore the greatness of the state, has yet to be fully
answered. Putin himself was oblique when he last pondered the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who does not regret the passing of the Soviet Union
doesn't have a heart,'' he said in a recent interview. ``And anyone
who longs for its restoration doesn't have brains.''

FINANCIAL TIES IN BIOMEDICINE GET CLOSE LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. H. Kirk Hammond, a cardiologist at the University of
California in San Diego, never envisioned himself an entrepreneur.
``I'm a blue jeans-wearing, tieless character,'' he said. So when
he invented a gene therapy technique to treat heart disease, he did
what any self-respecting academic scientist does these days: he
started a biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he has one foot in academia and the other in industry. On
campus, he trains doctors and runs a gene therapy lab, financed in
part by his company, Collateral Therapeutics. As its chief
scientist, he has drummed up support for a public offering of
stock, and helped design an experiment of his therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one bright line that Hammond says he will not
cross: He will not treat patients who are enrolled in studies of
his invention. ``I think it would look bad for me to be involved in
any direct way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the biomedical revolution in full swing, academic
scientists who lack industry ties have become as rare as giant
pandas in the wild. But as Congress begins to investigate lapses in
federal oversight of gene therapy experiments, lawmakers, bioethics
experts and federal regulators say they are troubled that so many
researchers have a financial stake in companies testing their
discoveries _ companies whose fortunes, with those of the
scientist, can rise and fall on a single product.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that the lure of profit could color scientific
integrity, prompting researchers to withhold information about
potentially dangerous side effects or push for experiments that
might not be quite safe. Of particular concern are doctors who
enroll and treat patients in clinical studies that are paid for by
the companies they own, a practice that the Food and Drug
Administration says is growing in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities, including the University of California at San
Diego, simply do not allow it. Even if Hammond wanted to test his
own invention, he could not do so and keep his university job. But
the rules are not the same across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, a gene therapy researcher at Cornell
University's Weill Medical College, has treated patients in small
studies paid for by the company he founded, Gen-Vec. So has Dr.
Jeffrey M. Isner, a scientist at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in
Boston. Isner, along with the medical center and two other
partners, founded a company called Vascular Genetics, of which he
owns 20 percent. Both doctors declined to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   But both have drawn the attention of members of the Recombinant
DNA Advisory Committee, the National Institutes of Health panel
that oversees gene therapy research. Crystal was criticized for
asking the panel not to disclose that a heart disease patient had
died of an underlying illness during a gene therapy experiment. And
before the panel learned that most gene therapy researchers were
failing to comply with its guidelines to report patient side
effects, Isner was singled out for failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Macklin, a member of the advisory panel and professor
of bioethics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York,
said she worried that researchers with financial conflicts would
try to keep information about risks a secret for fear it would hurt
investment in their companies. She said she would like the panel to
require doctors who own stock or have other financial interests in
companies to disclose those interests on the consent forms
distributed to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Dr. David Blumenthal, who directs the Institute for
Health Policy at the Massachusetts General Hospital, would ban the
practice outright. ``I'm not comfortable with scientists owning
substantial equity in small firms that are sponsoring their
clinical research,'' Blumenthal said. ``I think it creates a
conflict of interest, and the conflict is particularly difficult to
justify in cases where patients' welfare may be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials are also uncomfortable. Dr. Jesse Goodman, deputy
director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research, said that in a typical clinical trial sponsored by a
large drug company, the company served as a check on the
researcher, ensuring that information about side effects was
properly disclosed and that patients were given clear information
about the benefits and risks. But when the company and the
researcher are one and the same, he said, that check is absent. He
said the FDA was trying to decide whether additional oversight was
needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet the issue of just what is a conflict can get murky. A case
in point is the University of Pennsylvania, where an 18-year-old
patient, Jesse Gelsinger, died in a gene therapy experiment last
fall, sparking the current wave of scrutiny. The principal
investigator of the study was Dr. James Wilson, director of the
university's Institute for Human Gene Therapy. He is also the
founder of a biotechnology company, Genovo, in which both he and
the university hold stock.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is so entangled, said Peter Erichsen, Penn's
general counsel, that the university set up two committees to
oversee it. Wilson cannot sit on Genovo's scientific advisory
board, and his work as a company consultant is unpaid. He may not
participate in clinical studies paid for by the company.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after Gelsinger's death, Wilson said he
agreed with the restrictions. ``I think it gets a little bit
concerning when the person who has responsibility for enrolling
patients is the scientist who is driving'' the research, he said
then. ``I think that's a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   But Genovo contributes one-fifth of the $25 million annual
budget at the gene therapy institute, and in return has exclusive
rights to develop Wilson's discoveries into commercial products. So
while the company did not pay for the study that cost Gelsinger his
life _ it was financed by the National Institutes of Health _
Genovo does have an indirect interest in all of Wilson's work.
Indeed, Wilson was required to disclose his connection to Genovo on
the ``informed consent'' document that explained the study's
benefits and risks to patients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What effect, if any, such relationships have on the outcome of
clinical studies is difficult to evaluate, said Dr. Mildred Cho, a
bioethicist at Stanford University who has studied conflict of
interest policies at the 100 largest research institutions in the
country. ``There is almost never a smoking gun,'' she said. ``You
can't say Jesse Gelsinger died because Jim Wilson had stock in
Genovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is beginning to emerge, however, that industry ties do
color scientific judgment. In a 1996 analysis of 789 articles in
medical journals, Dr. Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of urban and
environmental policy at Tufts University, found that 34 percent of
the authors had a financial interest _ most frequently a patent
pending _ in the subject matter being studied.
</P>
<P>
   In a later study, Krimsky interviewed the authors of articles in
medical journals about calcium channel blockers, commonly
prescribed for high blood pressure and chest pain from angina.
Among those who supported the use of the drugs, 96 percent had a
relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, compared with 60
percent who were neutral toward the drugs and 37 percent who were
critical of them.
</P>
<P>
   No federal regulations govern the specifics of scientists'
relationships to the companies they create. The National Institutes
of Health require universities to set their own policies, but
experts say the rules vary widely. Some researchers can sit on the
scientific advisory boards of their own companies; others must
maintain a greater distance. Some can have only a small investment.
Others can have a significant equity stake. Hammond owns 15 percent
of Collateral Therapeutics. Wilson's equity in Genovo is not
public, but Erichsen, the Penn lawyer, said Wilson and his family
could own no more than 30 percent of the company, and Wilson said
half of his holdings were in a blind trust for his children.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, before the revolution in genetics, academia
was academia and industry was industry, and rarely was there any
overlap. Now, so many university scientists have started their own
companies that deans of medical schools no longer talk about
eliminating conflict of interest; the current buzzword for dealing
with conflicts is ``management.'' The primary management tool,
university officials say, is disclosure. But that means disclosure
to supervisors _ not to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has helped fuel the trend of scientists' starting their
own companies. In 1980, it passed the Bayh-Dole Act, a law designed
to speed up the commercialization of academic discoveries. It
encouraged universities to patent inventions, and then assign the
rights to those patents to private companies that could develop
them into products. Instead of relying on existing companies,
scientists like Hammond began raising venture capital and starting
businesses of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Universities like the Bayh-Dole Act because it generates income
from licensing fees and royalties, and because it gives their best
scientists incentive to stay in academia. Scientists like it
because it helps them carry discoveries from the laboratory to the
bedside, and because they no longer have to leave the prestige of
academia to earn the money available in industry.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it has been quite lucrative. Dr. William Haseltine,
the chief executive of Human Genome Sciences in Rockville, Md.,
founded seven biotech companies while a professor at Harvard
University. ``I don't even know how many millions I've made,''
Haseltine said. But, he insisted, ``the motivation was not
primarily money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation was the joy of conceiving ideas and reducing
them to practical reality to make a difference in people's lives,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Hammond of the University of California at San Diego,
was precisely why he started Collateral Therapeutics. In the late
1980s, he said, he began looking at patients with heart disease
whose bodies had grown new blood vessels to do the work of the
blocked ones. It struck him that there must be a gene that would
promote this beneficial blood vessel growth, and that ``it would be
really nice just to be able to put those genes into patients.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, he said, he had figured out how to do it. ``Back then,
I was completely ignorant of business, and to be honest, quite
alienated by business,'' he said. ``But I had two young daughters
and not a lot of money, a retirement in my future and I had sense
enough to know that what I had discovered was important.''
</P>
<P>
   The patent was filed in 1995, but the university could not get
any companies interested in licensing it. So Hammond met with some
venture capitalists and started Collateral Therapeutics, which
quickly licensed the patent rights. Within months, the company was
working with a German pharmaceutical firm, Schering AG, which began
human tests of Hammond's technique in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even without participating in the clinical trial, the
arrangement has been a delicate balancing act for Hammond. He takes
unpaid leave from his university job when he is traveling on
company business. He accepts payment as a consultant, but his job
as vice president for research is unpaid. Although Collateral
Therapeutics provides research money for his laboratory, he said,
the company does not hold exclusive rights to commercialize his
discoveries, as is the case with Genovo and Wilson at Penn. And
Hammond cannot sell his shares in Collateral while human testing is
under way, he said, because the Securities and Exchange Commission
prohibits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's theoretical money; I can't do anything with it because
I'm an insider,'' he said. ``The university would love me to sell
all of it. They think that makes me less contaminated in some way.
I think that's nonsense.''

MICHIGAN GOVERNOR PRESIDING OVER HUGE EFFORT FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ After battering each other for two and a half
weeks in South Carolina, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
will crisscross Michigan for the next two days campaigning for the
big state's primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by polls showing the race too close to predict, Gov.
John Engler of Michigan, an early supporter of Bush's, has led one
of the largest political mobilizations ever in the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a low-budget operation here and is relying heavily on
media coverage and the Internet to get his message out, in a
showdown that pits the buzz of his popularity against one of the
most formidable political machines left in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Republican owners of small businesses say party officials have
asked to use their offices as phone banks to appeal for Bush
voters. County executives and other local party leaders have been
writing thousands of letters to get out the vote. And Republican
state legislators have been recording radio advertisements for Bush
in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Engler is hoping that his approach to politics still works. He
said the push for votes in this primary exceeded efforts in the
general elections of 1992 and 1996, and was the biggest since his
first campaign for governor, in 1990, when he beat a Democratic
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat chilling, actually, to see the McCain campaign
be so obsessed with their press relations and their media strategy
that it overwhelms all of the old, traditional political campaign
aspects,'' Engler said in an interview at his office here, across
the street from the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials say that 2,000 people have volunteered
over the Internet to help in Michigan, but they have set up only a
handful of phone banks and are hoping that most of the volunteers
will distribute pamphlets, put up signs and make phone calls from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll concede the organization battle,'' said Michael Hudome,
McCain's top adviser on the Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high here for Engler personally and for
Republican governors across the country. Engler is a top adviser to
Bush and was the only governor on Bush's exploratory committee
before Bush, the Texas governor, announced his presidential
candidacy. Term limits require Engler to leave office at the end of
his current term, his third, and there has been much speculation
that he would have a role in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Bush coalesced early last year among Republican
governors, many of whom saw the Texas governor as a superior
alternative to candidates from the Republican-controlled Congress,
which was ensnared then in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But if Engler fails, the image of all Republican governors will
suffer, said Curt Smith, the chief operating officer of the
conservative Hudson Institute, based in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has put his prestige on the line, and he has put his
organization on the line,'' Smith said, ``and if he can't deliver,
the perception might be in Washington that these governors are
popular at home but can't deliver for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler predicted that Bush would win the primary here by 4 or 5
percentage points, and said the vote would show that Republican
governors, rather than a Republican senator like McCain,
represented the best hope for wooing Republicans, Democrats and
independents alike in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' Engler said, ``it's the governors in the
Republican Party who have, without question, enjoyed substantial
success in the '90s and who have been bringing millions more
Americans into the Republican Party, far more than the McCain
campaign has brought in, in its short life. Through our
performance, we've earned not only a seat at the table but a very
important role in setting some of the direction of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he wanted to finish his term and declined to
speculate further on his own political future, other than to rule
out a bid for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say Bush is slightly ahead of McCain here, but that
the outcome will depend on turnout. In past Republican primaries
here, the turnout has tended to be 10 percent to 12 percent of
registered voters, about two-thirds of whom are in the party and
the balance of whom are Democrats, independents and Republicans who
vote only occasionally. McCain can win if he can increase turnout
to 15 percent _ close to 1 million people _ by attracting more
independents, Democrats and Republicans who vote infrequently, said
Ed Sarpolus, a pollster here at EPIC/MRA, which does a lot of
polling for media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 100,000 voters on Tuesday will be Republicans who seldom
vote in primaries but will vote for Bush at the request of the
Engler organization, Sarpolus estimated. That could be roughly
equal to the number of Democrats who vote in the Republican
primary, he added.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A few liberal Democrats have urged their supporters to vote for
McCain to punish Engler for stripping Detroit of some its control
over schools and courts. But Michigan's Democratic leaders have
disavowed this tactic, and pollsters have predicted that the effect
would be statistically insignificant. Engler has tried to galvanize
his supporters by attacking the limited Democratic efforts.

<P>
   Engler has spent his 10 years as governor, as well as most of
the 1980s, as president of the state Senate, assiduously attending
fund-raisers and other events for Republican chairmen in each of
Michigan's 83 counties. He is also a feared figure in state
politics, with a reputation similar to that of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York for remembering his friends and punishing his
enemies in budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Engler has been using all his influence to make sure that
local Republicans organize the grass-roots effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the Engler machine, or establishment, kicks in,''
said L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County executive. ``We have
resources, I think, that McCain doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Cox, the chairman of a large law firm in Troy, Mich., said
that he had agreed to a request from Oakland County Republicans to
turn over the firm's headquarters this weekend to volunteers who
would make phone calls asking Bush supporters to make sure they
voted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asked to do this for local races, but this is the
first time we've been asked for a presidential race,'' Cox, a
Republican, said. His firm, Cox, Hodgman &AMP; Giarmarco, represents
many Michigan cities in liability cases, including cities with
Democratic administrations. But Cox said that the decision to help
had been made ``because it's a good thing for the community'' to
increase voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's secretary of state, Candice S. Miller, said she had
arranged for 560 volunteers to work this weekend in shifts on 300
phones at local businesses to get out the vote for Bush in Macomb
County in Detroit's northeastern suburbs, her political base.
``We're approaching this not as if this were a presidential
campaign but as though there were county commissioner campaigns all
over the place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the McCain campaign has a total of just 25
volunteers who will be making calls from their homes in Oakland and
Macomb Counties, two of Michigan's three largest counties.
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for Engler's activity. William G. Milliken,
a moderate Republican who was Michigan's governor from 1970 to
1982, campaigned energetically at the last moment for Bush's father
in the Republican primary in 1980 and essentially cast the primary
as a referendum on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having lost a string of earlier primaries, and despite
trailing Ronald Reagan in Michigan polls by up to 12 percentage
points several days before the vote, Bush won the primary by 25
percentage points. The victory helped him secure the vice
presidential nomination at the Republican convention eight weeks
later in Detroit, an important step on the path to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken, who remains one of the most popular politicians in the
state despite having been retired for 18 years, endorsed McCain on
Thursday, saying that he admired his courage. But in a sign of the
weakness of McCain's organization in Michigan, Milliken said after
the endorsement that he had never heard from the senator or his
staff, even though McCain was scheduled to campaign on Monday in
Traverse City, the small city in northern Michigan where Milliken
lives.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After almost 18 years, $380 million in sales and
untold gallons of makeup, ``Cats,'' the longest-running production
in Broadway history, will close on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, at the Winter Garden Theater, will end its run
after 7,397 performances, a streak that began while much of the
show's current cast was in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   The closing, which has been rumored for several months, was
confirmed Saturday by Peter Brown, a spokesman for Andrew Lloyd
Webber, the musical's composer.
</P>
<P>
   An audience pleaser with seemingly endless appeal for children
and tourists, ``Cats'' will have been seen by more than 10 million
people in New York by the time its final curtain falls. Since
opening in 1982, it often ranked near the top shows on Broadway in
gross sales. It outlasted hundreds of other musicals, and will have
come close to outlasting three presidential administrations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the well of audiences has slowly run
dry, leaving the theater half full on some nights, with the show's
producers taking losses during the winter with hopes of making a
profit during the tourist-packed summers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Cats'' may have been simply done in by its own
success. The musical has been produced in 30 countries worldwide
and seen by an estimated 50 million people, or roughly the
population of California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, ``Cats'' easily ranks as one of the most successful
musical of all time, churning millions into the pockets of its
investors and making international stars and multimillionaires out
of Lloyd Webber and the show's lead producer, Cameron Mackintosh.
It also acted as an economic engine for New York City; a 1997 study
by Audience Research and Analysis said ``Cats'' had contributed
more than $3.12 billion to the city's economy and more than $195
million in state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But more than just a financial juggernaut, ``Cats''
fundamentally reshaped the landscape of Broadway by ushering in the
era of the megamusicals: big, flashy spectacles that required
little theatrical sophistication or knowledge of the English
language to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   As such, ``Cats''' proved that tourist audiences could drive a
show's sales. Indeed, tourists filled the Winter Garden long after
the musical had become passe among New York theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cats,'' with its lavish design and elaborate special
effects, also whetted audiences' appetites for increasingly complex
stagecraft. Soon Broadway was witness to all variety of expensive
stage magic, from falling chandeliers (in Lloyd Webber's 1988
musical, ``The Phantom of the Opera'') to helicopters landing
onstage (in Mackintosh's 1991 production, ``Saigon'') to the
foundering of the Titanic (in the 1997 musical of the same name).
</P>
<P>
   While visually arresting, these effects raised the cost of
producing musicals, making producers' prospect of turning a profit
_ always slim _ even more forbidding. Higher production costs led
to higher ticket prices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the run of ``Cats'' continued, the musical also became a
cultural touchstone, becoming synonymous with longevity _ and,
eventually, longueur _ in comedians' routines and among theater
gossips. Even its advertising slogan, ``Now and Forever,''
suggested a certain eerie, inevitable immortality.
</P>
<P>
   And in an industry populated by old-time showmen, ``Cats'' also
made its mark in marketing, adopting a text-free and thus
internationally recognizable logo. The production also saturated
the airwaves with television commercials and made its posters a
permanent fixture in New York City subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   It prompted a cottage industry in show-related trivia. More than
1.8 million pounds of dry ice have been used during the show's run
to create fog onstage. The sheer poundage of yak hair used for
wigs, 3,247 pounds during the run, outweighs a Volkswagen Beetle.
The musical's first-act finale, ``Memory,'' has been recorded 180
times by different artists around the world. ``Cats'' has employed
284 actors, 19 of whom have died. One actress, Marlene Danielle,
has been with the show since the beginning of its Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' opened in New York on Oct. 7, 1982, after months of
pre-show hype and a sold-old run in the West End of London. (The
London production is still running; ``Cats'' is now the
longest-running show in the history of the British theater.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,'' a slim volume
of poems by T.S. Eliot, ``Cats'' follows the tale of a group of
alley cats, one of whom, Grizabella, ascends to kitty heaven, known
as the heaviside layer, by show's end.
</P>
<P>
   But story was really never the appeal of ``Cats.'' The musical,
with a catchy, melodic pop score by Lloyd Webber, had no book and
little plot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the production's focus was on theatrical spectacle. The
actors, directed by Trevor Nunn, are outfitted in feline body
suits, foot-long whiskers and swirling face makeup and prowl the
theater's aisles, stealing popcorn from children's hands and
purring into people's faces. Aiding the illusion is a series of
ingenious effects by the designer John Napier, who transformed the
interior of the Winter Garden into a overrun junkyard seen from a
cat's-eye perspective. At the musical's finale, a giant
hydraulically powered tire lifts Grizabella into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times: ``Whatever the other
failings and excesses, even banalities, of `Cats,' it believes in
purely theatrical magic, and on that faith it unquestionably
delivers.'' He also predicted that ``Cats'' was ``likely to lurk
around Broadway for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His words proved prophetic. ``Cats'' won seven Tony Awards in
1983, including best musical, and in June 1997 it surpassed ``A
Chorus Line'' as the longest-running production in Broadway
history. The occasion was celebrated with a reunion of former cast
members and a block party in front of the Winter Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking then, Lloyd Webber recalled how the show, based on
unorthodox material, had struggled to find investors before its
first run in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had almost everything going against us,'' he said. ``We
couldn't get the investment companies interested.'' Theater lore
holds that Lloyd Webber mortgaged his house to make sure the
production was financed, a bet that paid off.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of whether similar festivities were
planned for the show's closing.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Garden's stage, which was completely deconstructed
for ``Cats,'' will have to be rebuilt. The theater as a whole will
probably need a good scrub.
</P>
<P>
   And if Broadway tradition holds true to form, those who have
never seen ``Cats,'' or want to see it one more time, will probably
buy tickets, meaning one last surge in sales. Only 144 performances
now remain.

FALLING CORPORATE TAXES BLAMED ON WILLINGNESS TO USE SHAM
SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID JAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With incomes rising, particularly among the wealthy, Americans
are paying a lot more in federal taxes than they did before the
economic expansion of the last decade. Not so, American
corporations. Their profits are growing even faster than Americans'
incomes, yet the taxes they pay have peaked and have begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have been striking. Almost 15 cents of every dollar
of income earned by Americans in 1997, the latest year for which
figures are available, went to the Internal Revenue Service, up
from 13 cents in 1990. By contrast, taxes paid by companies on
profits reported to the IRS fell to 20 cents on the dollar in 1997,
from 26 cents on the dollar in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors explain why the corporate tax burden has
fallen, from the legitimate use of various tax credits to the
deduction of the cost of stock options exercised by employees. But
the most troubling factor is the rapid spread of tax shelters,
especially among large corporations, according not only to experts
at the Treasury and IRS, but to some corporations and law firms
that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these tactics have been found in the courts to be
illegal tax dodges. Others, many of them novel arrangements, have
not been tested in the courts but are raising eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate tax shelters are our No. 1 problem'' in enforcing
the tax laws, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in an
interview, ``not just because they cost money but because they
breed disrespect for the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly alarms IRS and Treasury officials is what they
call a growing willingness by prominent companies that are well
known for guarding their public image to engage in the kind of tax
avoidance tactics more characteristic of the most disreputable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have been found to have engaged in what
the courts called shams are Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer and
United Parcel Service. For example, the tax court found last year
that UPS engaged in a long-running ``sham'' to evade more than $1
billion in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a race for the bottom,'' said Jonathan Talisman,
acting deputy Treasury secretary for tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq did not return calls seeking comment; Colgate-Palmolive
declined to comment, and United Parcel Service, in a statement,
said it was ``deeply offended'' that government officials ``would
even begin to equate'' its tax case with evasion or impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics have become widespread enough that even corporate
tax lawyers are quietly alerting the IRS about tax shelters they
think cross the line from legitimate tax planning into illegal
schemes. The New York State Bar Association's tax section, a
leading organization of corporate tax lawyers, said last year that
tax shelters were a growing problem and called for new legislation
to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax shelters differ from legitimate ones because they use
accounting gimmicks intended solely to lower tax liabilities and
have no legitimate business purpose. In one typical example, a
company that owes taxes forms a partnership with a business, often
one abroad, that for various reasons does not owe any taxes. The
company then shifts its profits to the other business' books,
reducing its own profits, and later takes back the money in ways
that do not count as profits. Many big accounting firms and Wall
Street investment houses help arrange such deals for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   In one current case involving AlliedSignal, the big automotive
and aerospace company that was acquired last year by Honeywell, a
substantial tax bill was wiped out. In that deal, AlliedSignal sold
its investment in a Texas petroleum company at a profit of more
than $400 million. The company would have owed more than $140
million in taxes on the profit. But, following a plan devised by
Merrill Lynch, the company shifted the profit to a partnership
created with a Dutch bank. AlliedSignal later took back the profit
from the partnership, untaxed, and even reported a $4 million
profit from the investment in the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Court disallowed the deal as having no purpose other
than avoiding taxes, and an appeals court upheld that decision this
month. Honeywell said in a statement that its policy was to comply
with all applicable tax laws and pay all taxes properly due.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like this one, which are revealed by IRS audits, have
repeatedly been labeled illegitimate by the courts. But the IRS may
find fewer than one such deal in 10, and its auditing resources
have been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is emboldening some companies to play ``audit
roulette,'' said Larry Langdon, commissioner of the IRS large and
midsize business division and former tax director at
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the amount of income taxes paid by corporations fell
2.5 percent from 1998, government finance records show, while
individual income tax revenue surged 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of taxes paid by individuals has been growing quickly
in recent years, even faster than the growth in incomes, because
more people are moving into higher tax brackets, where they pay in
taxes a larger percentage of each extra dollar of income. (The top
tax bracket is 39.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Individual incomes were 131 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990,
while taxes were 164 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the case for corporations, which have a tax rate
of 35 cents on every dollar. Corporate profits reported to the IRS
were 252 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990, but taxes rose just
191 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An additional factor is lowering corporate income taxes. A
Treasury Department analysis of tax returns filed by large
companies found that each year from 1991 to 1996 a shrinking
portion of profits reported to shareholders was reported to the IRS
as taxable income. This year less than 70 cents of each dollar of
profit reported by companies to shareholders will be reported to
the IRS as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1990, IRS officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these trends, in 1997 alone, companies paid $60
billion less in income taxes than they would have if they had paid
taxes at the same rate as in 1990. But individuals paid $80 billion
more.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reduction for companies is legitimate. For one
thing, companies report profits differently to shareholders and to
the IRS. And some of the reduction can be attributed to a growth in
tax credits taken for investing in new buildings and equipment,
among other things. Also, as stock options proliferate and are
exercised, companies can subtract the cost from their profits
reported to the IRS, even though they can ignore that cost and
report higher profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is widely agreed that such factors explain only part of
the drop in the corporate tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive corporate tax shelters, Summers estimated, cost the
government more than $10 billion a year, a figure Treasury
officials call conservative. They suspect the number is much
larger.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the fact that tax shelters are being created
faster than dot-coms on the Internet that worries Langdon and
others; it is which companies are embracing them. ``You can divide
the corporate world into white hats, gray hats and black hats,''
Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the black hats had long taken aggressive postures on tax
matters, pursuing schemes that white-hat companies would reject.
</P>
<P>
   What alarms IRS and Treasury officials is the willingness of the
white-hat companies to match this conduct ``because the payoff to
shareholders is sufficient to make the risk to their public image
worth it or because their shareholders will say, hey, everybody
else is doing it, you should do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said the tax shelters arranged by accounting firms
including PricewaterhouseCoopers, investment houses including
Merrill Lynch, and others go so far beyond lawful exploitation of
loopholes that he and other IRS officials are considering calling
on the chief executives of these and other companies to tell them
that they consider the conduct of the companies out of line.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked for comment, did not issue a
statement. Merrill Lynch said in a statement, ``These transactions
were carefully reviewed at the time by prominent outside tax
counsel and accountants, all of whom gave opinions that they were
proper and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers is proposing a law that would require companies to
disclose tax shelters to the IRS as they are being created and
would increase penalties for engaging in shams. The tax lawyers
section of the New York State Bar Association supports requiring
greater disclosure and other steps.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers' proposal has received a cold reception on Capitol
Hill. Last week Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, taking note of his long
experience with tax legislation, said that in the Treasury
secretary's proposal, ``There is a sort of an implicit indictment
of the corporation for doing something, as it were, unethical or
perhaps even illegal or maybe immoral, but the fact of the matter
is we write the Tax Code, and any corporation ought to do what they
can to minimize that cost on behalf of their shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   But some tax shelters should not be confused with legitimate tax
breaks, said Christopher Bergin, editor of the journal Tax Notes.
They ``cross the line and are pure and simple theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, corporations feel confident in proceeding with
such deals because their lawyers said the deals were legal, and
also because the IRS does not have the resources to challenge them
in Tax Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Executives Institute, a group of senior finance
and tax officials at large companies, says that there is no problem
that merits a new law as proposed by Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said that in the last decade he had seen a disturbing
shift in attitudes by corporate executives as to how aggressive to
be in avoiding taxes. ``The tax department is viewed more as a
profit center and a place that has more of an obligation to more or
less aggressively reduce the tax burden,'' he said. ``Most
companies used to worry about their image. When I was at
Hewlett-Packard, and we looked at one of these deals, my boss would
say, `I want you to write the article that you imagine that The New
York Times or Wall Street Journal would run if they find out about
this, and if the article passes muster we will consider doing the
thing.' The deals that couldn't pass that muster were not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, corporate finance and tax officials are under such
pressure to increase profits that image is hardly a consideration
in whether to cheat on taxes. ``Most chief financial officers these
days are more afraid of the Securities and Exchange Commission than
the IRS, because more of them have lost their jobs for violating
SEC rules than IRS rules.''

EARLY TALLIES SHOWS REFORM CANDIDATES GAINING IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Early results from Iran's elections indicated
Saturday that the country's reform-minded president, Mohammad
Khatami, may have a solid majority behind him in the Parliament to
make good on his promises of creating a more liberal society after
21 years of rule by puritanical Islamic clerics.
</P>
<P>
   The only counts completed, however, were in some provinces
outside Tehran, the capital, where a final tally is not expected
for some time. The ballots are being counted by hand, and in big
cities like Tehran, each ballot may contain up to 30 handwritten
candidate names that must be deciphered and sorted.
</P>
<P>
   According to some political analysts, the preliminary results
that have dribbled out of the provinces showed that hard-liners who
have resisted Khatami's drive for social reforms won just one seat
out of four in Iran's small towns and rural areas. The big winners,
they said, were candidates who had identified themselves as
outright reformers and those who called themselves
middle-of-the-road moderates but back Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Sayed Hossain Marashi, the deputy campaign manager for the
moderate Servants of Construction Party, said he had received
unofficial results showing that about 25 percent of the votes
outside of Tehran went to his party. An additional 20 percent, he
added, went to the left-wing Islamic Iran Participation Front,
which includes Khatami's brother and well-known liberal writers,
and most of the rest went to candidates who ran under the combined
banner of the two groups in many provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised because the predictions had been that up to
one-third of the votes would go to the conservatives,'' Marashi
said. ``Still, they will still be an important factor in the
Parliament, even if they don't get more than 25 percent of the
seats, because the other 75 percent is not one unified bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   While those who ran under the moderate banner support Khatami on
some issues, many are known to be hesitant to move too quickly to
loosen the conservative clergy's grip on matters dealing with the
courts and the country's many competing security forces, which do
not answer to the president. They also differ from the more leftist
reformers on the economic policy needed to create jobs and
investment in Iran _ issues that many Iranian voters said were
priorities in an overwhelmingly young country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the people in the middle who think about modernization
of the country along progressive lines,'' said Marashi. ``We are
not conservatives, and we don't want to be part of the left because
we don't agree with them that the economy should be
government-controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead figure for the moderates in Tehran was the former
president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official announcement on the size of the turnout,
and private estimates varied widely, from about 67 percent,
according to Marashi, to a hefty 88 percent, according to the
reformers' camp.
</P>
<P>
   As with previous Iranian elections for the Parliament, it may
take analysts some time to sort out the political orientations of
the winners. Many candidates in Tehran ran as aspirants from
specific parties, but outside the capital many more were associated
with loose coalitions of parties with little in common but their
stated support for either Khatami or more conservative symbols from
Iran's past, like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a big win for his supporters, Khatami may still have
an uphill struggle to achieve some of the systemic changes he has
advocated, including reforming the judiciary and guaranteeing a
free press.
</P>
<P>
   All legislation must be approved not only by the Parliament, but
also by a 12-man Guardian Council that has traditionally opposed
reforms that would give Iranians freedom of choice in what they
read, what they wear and how they behave in public and in private.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Khatami shares power with Ayatollah Ali Khameini,
who holds the post of supreme leader and embodies the clergy's
domination of Iranian politics, security and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leader has always respected the vote of the majority of
the people,'' said Ahmad Bourghani, a leader and parliamentary
candidate of the reform Participation Front. ``I think he will
cooperate with Khatami because he has been generally supportive in
the past of the president's programs, even though he sometimes
raises questions.''

<P>
   TULKARM, West Bank _ There is a quiet cult of the bee in the
land of milk and honey, and beekeepers, be they Israeli or
Palestinian, are the high priests of the hive.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time, then, in a place where passion and
conflict are so entwined, before the bees of the Holy Land became
ensnared in the tangled web of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bees, no peace,'' read the Hebrew placards at a recent
demonstration at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank, protesting
an epidemic of hive thefts by Palestinians. It was called the
Beekeepers Revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like astronauts in their white protective gear, dozens
of Israeli beekeepers briefly blocked a key entrance to Israel from
Palestinian territory. With their hives.
</P>
<P>
   They said the theft, of 2,600 hives in the past year, is
threatening not only their livelihood, but _ given the centrality
they attach to the bee _ the land of Israel itself. If Israeli
lawmakers don't pay greater attention to this phenomenon, they say,
they will bring their hives to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if worse comes to worse, we will release the bees,'' said
Roni Feldman, a 65-year-old, fourth-generation beekeeper who makes
an unlikely candidate for apiarist-terrorist. ``This is a struggle
for our existence, and I would dare say, since the flowers and the
orchards are so dependent on the bee, for the future of Israel
itself. That last part is what people don't seem to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian beekeepers share this kind of rapture:
without the bee, we are nothing. For the Israelis, it is a Zionist
thing. For the Palestinians, it is religious _ a whole sura, or
chapter, Number 17, of the Koran, is devoted to the bee _ and
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey is a holy product of the Holy Land,'' said Osman Arafat,
the leading beekeeping expert in the West Bank, who decided against
naming his company ``Arafat Bee Productions'' so as not to alienate
potential customers who oppose his namesake, the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Arafat continued, ``it is definitely a growth industry
with huge potential for our future state.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of peacemaking on bee-keeping was probably not
contemplated by the signers of the Oslo interim peace agreement of
1993. But there has been a profound effect, and the story is not
only one of conflict but of accommodation and cooperation, too. And
it underscores that there is nothing abstract about peace between
Israelis and Palestinians, who live elbow to elbow and share the
same land, acre by acre, honeycomb by honeycomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, there is no such thing as a Palestinian or
an Israeli bee,'' Arafat said. ``They fly freely over checkpoints,
linking us through nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman's 25-year-old son, Ziv, who wears his hair in a ponytail
and majors in communications at Tel Aviv University, sees it
differently. ``Bees don't like to mix with those who are not from
their hive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Arafat and other Palestinian beekeepers graduated
from a five-day training seminar administered by the Israeli
Agriculture Ministry in Netanya, Israel. Outside the hotel where
the seminar was offered, Israeli beekeepers, not including Feldman,
protested. But the Israelis' complaint is not really with their
colleagues, the true professionals like Arafat, who holds a
master's degree in beekeeping from Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It is with the thieves themselves, with the Palestinian police
who do not crack down on thieves, and with the Israeli officials
who do not pressure them on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Theft of cars and of agricultural products, from tractors to
bees, increased sharply after the Palestinians started taking
control of territory in the West Bank. Palestinian thieves became
able to disappear into Palestinian-ruled land without fear of
apprehension. A lot of the thievery involves collaboration between
Israeli and Palestinian criminals, the authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of theft is one of cooperation,'' said Samir Mouadi,
Israel's deputy agriculture minister for the West Bank. ``But it is
the cooperation of negative elements on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Car theft was attacked by a joint operation of Israeli and
Palestinian police. So far, though, hives have been largely
ignored, even though some government officials understand the
primacy of the bee.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli agriculture officials estimate that 80 percent of the
stolen hives made their way to the West Bank. That represents a
direct loss of only about $600,000 to the nation's beekeepers, who
tend 80,000 hives. But, as Feldman says, ``the smallest bee is
indeed a huge factory,'' and every hive contains thousands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Feldman's bee-keeping venture is a typical Israeli story. It
starts in Odessa in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   His great-great-grandfather was offered a deal he couldn't
refuse: the trade of a farm in what later became Nes Tziona,
Israel, for his place in Russia. The property was right near the
Western Wall in Jerusalem, he was falsely told. So after arriving
at the desolate ruin of a farm in the middle of nowhere, he
immediately turned around and returned to fetch 10 other religious
families so he could be ensured of a prayer quorum, or minyan.
</P>
<P>
   They started Israel's honey industry, whose history is soon to
be honored in a bee-keeping museum near Feldman's home in Nes
Tziona. The new immigrants were shown their first hives when they
asked locals about the boxes bumping on the sides of their camels.
And the rest is apiary history, despite the fact that Feldman's
great-great-grandfather quickly discovered he was allergic to bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that I believe I was actually conceived among bee
hives,'' Feldman said. ``And that from age zero, I grew up chasing
bees. I'm a Jew, so bees are not my religion. But close. If I'm not
stung several times a day, I don't feel alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman contends out that bee-keepers are ``high-quality''
Israelis, many of whom served in elite units of the army. Indeed,
the lore of the beekeeper, in ancient times or pioneering days,
infests Israeli literature.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One recent example is the bee-keeping protagonist in ``The Blue
Mountain,'' by Meir Shalev, an endearing character who calls his
wife ``the queen bee.''
</P>
<P>
   When a small-time beekeeper was wiped out by theft in December,
Feldman, who owns about 1,500 hives, was radicalized, he said. He
is right-wing, and skeptical about peace, but most of the other
beekeepers live in the farming collectives and kibbutzim belong to
the dovish Labor Party. Still, they think the government is
sacrificing their livelihood on the altar of peace _ unwilling to
make a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem Post supported the bee-keepers in an editorial
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halt unneighborly theft,'' it said. ``Addressing the plague of
agricultural theft does not conflict with the peace process. It is
part of the more fundamental process of learning to live together
as neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deserted woods of Bet Jamal near Bet Shemesh in Israel,
Feldman, his son, his son-in-law and a Palestinian worker recently
visited some of their hives. They all donned gear from head to toe
before they lifted the honeycombs from their wooden boxes, checking
to make sure the queen bee was still buzzing and that the others
were swarming and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Palestinian beekeepers in this West Bank town,
many of whom keep their hives in their backyards, visited their
bees without any protective clothing whatsoever. ``We Palestinians
are not afraid of the landmines all around us,'' Arafat said. ``Why
should we be afraid of little bees?''
</P>
<P>
   To sit in a living room here with the Tulkarm Beekeepers
Association, beneath a chandelier whose amber crystals look like
dripping honey, is to absorb an incredible passion for an ancient
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's best student, Adnan Hanoun, 37, keeps a sample of an
old-fashioned mud hive in his workshop on Paris Street. But it is a
piece of history, only. High-tech has come to the honey business
even here, where it is a fledgling industry of some 20,000 hives,
and Arafat owns an artificial bee insemination machine.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoun's connection began during the Gulf War, after he had
graduated from Bir Zeit University near Ramallah with a degree in
business administration. Locked in his town by Israeli
high-security measures, he started reading a how-to guide on
bee-keeping, then went on to train with Arafat and in France. He
has since surpassed his teacher in the amount of honey he can
extract from a hive.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when their businesses, which produce mostly for local
consumption, are getting off the ground, the Palestinian beekeepers
feel stung by the thievery issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank, we as Palestinian bee producers are hurt doubly,
maybe even more than the Israelis victims,'' Hanoun said. ``First,
because we cannot compete with the stolen product. Second, because
we are suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said they were thrilled by the Israeli seminar,
offered in the midst of this controversy. While some Israeli
beekeepers protested outside, they bonded with others inside, they
said, trading notes on bee nutrition and bee medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for a common language,'' Arafat said. ``The
common language was the language of bees.''

COMMENTARY: BUSH ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Watching W. in South Carolina was
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seeing a guy on an icy patch of sidewalk trying to
get to the other side,'' said Jack Germond, the political writer
who called his memoir ``Fat Man in a Middle Seat.''
</P>
<P>
   You were never sure if George W. Bush was going to get safely to
the other side of a sentence, or even a syllable, without slipping.
Resonate became resignate. Full disclosure became full exposure.
Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortars. And there was this delicious
mangled metaphor about John McCain: ``He can't take the high horse
and claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   You were never sure if the front-runner could negotiate his way
safely through a foreign affairs interview, or if he would be able
to connect the dots on a thorny domestic question.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman in Florence, S.C., asked him what to do about her
medical insurance not covering all the needs of her seriously ill
son, he was stumped. ``I'm sorry,'' he answered. ``I wish I could
wave a wand.'' When a partially blind biology student said she
couldn't afford a $400 device that would let her use a microscope,
his solution was to ask if anyone in the audience would pay for it.
Noblesse oblige is not exactly a detailed health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, you weren't sure if Bush could get past the icy patch
in his campaign to win the nomination. Only one thing was certain:
The candidate who left South Carolina was very different from the
one who came here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compassionate conservative has become the cutthroat
conservative,'' says Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard.
``Bush has done more damage to Bush than to McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the Texas governor appeared, fresh-faced,
optimistic, cheerful, youthful _ the antidote to the loser
Republican Party of '92, '96 and '98. ``He was different from the
old, tired party of Bob Dole and the mean, surly party of Newt
Gingrich,'' Kristol says. ``Now his campaign seems tired and
surly.''
</P>
<P>
   By running into the arms of Bob Jones III, Pat Robertson, Strom
Thurmond and Dan Quayle, by slighting Catholics and blacks, by
switching to a low Atwater-style campaign, Bush lost touch with all
the things that had made him attractive in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, his campaign guru, had always said he did not want
Bush to become polarizing. But now the governor is on the record
with an image on race, religion and abortion that he had hoped to
leave softer so he could win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   When The New York Times' Frank Bruni asked Bush if voters _
looking at his refusal to criticize the Confederate flag or to be
indignant about the racism and anti-Catholicism of Bob Jones
University _ might conclude that he was no foe of intolerance, Bush
testily replied: ``Don't you judge my heart based upon giving a
speech at a university.''
</P>
<P>
   What about judging his judgment? He should know that the
symbolism that certain gestures carry is an important part of being
president.
</P>
<P>
   Until New Hampshire, Bush's team assumed all he would need was
money, endorsements and organization. They planned to keep the
national media at bay and run out the clock. But then came McCain,
with his potent anti-Washington message mocking all the
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s problem was analogous to his father's in '92: an
establishment candidate with a weak message and communication
skills outmaneuvered by forces he never foresaw and did not know
how to react to.
</P>
<P>
   Down south, the Texas governor simply tried to become the
Arizona senator. But his backers were not impressed when the rich
kid ran through $50 million to come up with a slogan as
transcendentally dorky as ``Reformer With Results.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain went the other way, becoming the nice guy,
taking negative ads off the air, and the new hot fund-raiser,
scaring up tons of money on the Internet. After all of W.'s early
bragging about garnering a lot of the Hispanic and black vote in
Texas, and his vow to rally ``the armies of compassion,'' it was
the challenger who was more open, attracting independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could not morph into McCain, but he did manage to morph
into Steve Forbes, running a destructive _ and self-destructive _
campaign against a war-hero senator.

COMMENTARY: DYNAMO AND MICROCHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might have expected that in this election year the economic
report of the president _ a survey published each February _ would
be a highly political document, eagerly claiming credit for our
giddy prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But say what you like about their boss, Bill Clinton's
economists have always been admirably honest and evenhanded in
their reporting. The self-congratulatory boilerplate is actually
minimal, and the thrust of this report is that technology, not
policy, is the main source of good news.
</P>
<P>
   This is surely right. A technology-driven surge in worker
productivity is directly responsible for about two-thirds of the
acceleration in our economic growth from the 2.5 percent norm of
the '70s and '80s to the 4 percent of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The report plausibly argues that our unexpected ability to get
unemployment down to 30-year lows without inflation is also an
indirect result of the productivity boom. So there is no mystery
about why we are doing so well: The microchip did it.
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery is why now _ and not much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After all, gee-whiz information technology is not new. The
microprocessor itself was introduced in 1970. Digital faxes, video
games and the personal computer all date from the late '70s and
early '80s. Businessmen and politicians alike were excited by the
possibilities. (Does anyone remember the ``Atari Democrats''?)
</P>
<P>
   But until 1996 or so, there was simply no sign of a fundamental
improvement in economic performance; there were recessions and
recoveries, but no change in the trend. (Those are fighting words,
but I'll take on the myths of Reaganomics some other day.)
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, the fancy technology started to pay off.
What took it so long?
</P>
<P>
   Well, after looking at the economic report, I dusted off my copy
of a 1989 article by the Stanford economic historian Paul David,
which made a big impression on me when I first read it. And ``The
Dynamo and the Computer'' makes even better reading today.
</P>
<P>
   David pointed out that although the light bulb was invented in
1879, the big economic payoff from electrification didn't come
until after World War I. The problem was that simply replacing
steam engines with electric motors didn't do much: Businesses had
to rethink the whole concept. Traditional factories were compact,
multistory buildings _ the optimal design when power had to be
conveyed via shafts and belts from a steam engine in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Only when manufacturers realized the advantages of a sprawling,
one-story structure, with each machine driven by its own motor _ in
particular, the benefits of having plenty of room to move people
and materials around _ did electrification really show what it
could do. And this took decades.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is clear. Putting a computer on every desk didn't
do much by itself. Only by changing the whole organization of work
could business really reap the rewards of the digital age. It is
simply Bill Clinton's good luck that America Inc. finally figured
it out on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Is that it? Is the economic history of the United States these
past two decades just a matter of technological determinism? To a
first approximation, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, some of the really bad policy ideas of the '80s _ the
heavy-handed industrial policies urged by the Democratic left, or
the return to the gold standard urged by the Republican right _
could have derailed us. But since such policies were never really
on the table, politics had little if any effect on economic growth.
Even if Jimmy Carter had been more likable, even if George Bush the
elder had had the vision thing, the American economy would have
ended up in more or less the same place.
</P>
<P>
   What about the future? If the technology gurus are to be
believed, there are more payoffs to come as the Internet goes
wireless and all that. If they are right, then at least as far as
the economy is concerned we don't need to elect a great man as
president; all we need is somebody who won't do too much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Given the likely choices, that is what I would call a reassuring
thought.
</P>
<P>
   In my Feb. 13 column I described the Internet Tax Freedom Act of
1998 as a legal impediment to sales taxation. In fact it only
prohibits taxes on Internet service providers.

MALAYSIANS ARE STUNNED BY REPORTS DETAILING ABUSE OF SERVANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ One young woman said she was kept in a cage
by her employer. One was beaten with a heavy object that fractured
her skull. One said she was poked with a stick in the gums and
forced to beat herself on the thighs with a cane whenever she
``made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day now in Malaysia, people are reading newspaper
accounts of foreign domestic helpers who have been abused by their
employers. The revelations of these secret crimes have horrified a
society that sees itself as kind, hospitable and soft-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   People and societies reveal their true nature in the privacy of
their homes, said Ivy Josiah, executive secretary of the Women's
Aid Organization, a shelter for battered women and their children
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home is the most dangerous place, as far as I'm concerned,
because it is private,'' she said. ``Incest, spousal abuse, maid
abuse, it all happens in the home. Man by nature has to be given
checks and balances. If there is no law outlawing domestic
violence, it will carry on. We need to have laws in place to change
social behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding abuse of domestic workers, she said, ``We need to
widen the notion that maids, that poorer people who are working
with you, also have rights. This is not slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue came into the open when Josiah publicized the case of
Nurjanah Maytak, one of thousands of poor Indonesians who have
found work as domestic helpers in Malaysia, who said she had been
poked in the gums and forced to cane herself.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of her punishments drew particular comment from
people amazed at the seemingly endless human inventiveness in
hurting other people.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity about Maytak, whose case is to be heard in
mid-April, caused other abused domestic workers to come forward and
set off a public round of soul searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sort of monster cages their domestics and denies them
even the right to go to the toilet?'' asked Marina Mahathir, a
leading social activist who is the daughter of the prime minister,
Mahathir Mohamad. ``I shudder to think what this actually says
about our society.''
</P>
<P>
   As Malaysia led the pack in the region's rapid development
during the decade that preceded Asia's financial crisis in 1997, it
imported as many as 2 million foreign workers _ perhaps half of
them illegal _ to perform its hard labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation that cannot even construct a building with our
own hands any more,'' Sheryll Stothard, a Malaysian writer and
social critic, wrote at the time. ``We have become a nation of
subcontractors depending almost totally on foreign labor, money and
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, frightened by the prospect of a new wave of
``boat people'' fleeing poverty and violence in its huge neighbor,
Indonesia, the Malaysian government instituted ``Operation Go
Away,'' under which it summarily deported tens of thousands of
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was soon forgotten, partly because of the objections
of employers who rely _ like many in California and Texas _ on
low-paid migrant labor, documented and undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   And as Malaysia prospered, foreign domestic helpers, mostly from
Indonesia and the Philippines, became a common part of urban life.
But with few legal protections, long hours, low pay and physical
abuse also became common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this concept of, `I have purchased you for 3,000
ringgit and therefore I can use you,''' said Irene Fernandez, a
prominent human rights activist in Malaysia. The sum is equal to
about $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not new,'' she said, ``but it is serious, and
it's getting more serious. It demands immediate preventive
action.''

KOREAN FIGHTS FOR COALITION AND HIS AIMS AS A REFORMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Two years into his five-year term as
president, Kim Dae-jung is locked in a surprisingly ugly fight for
his political life _ or at least to avoid having the remainder of
his term turned into an ornamental presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of his predicament was driven home the other day when
one of South Korea's leading politicians compared the president,
who took office as a reformer with a long history of opposition
dissent, to Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   What was shocking was not so much that comparison to Mao but
that the critical comment came from Kim Jong-pil, the president's
erstwhile prime minister and nominally one of his most important
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old president may be a hero of the long struggle
against military dictatorship in his country, and more recently,
the engineer of a resuscitation of his country's economy that has
impressed international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 13, he faces elections for the national assembly
that almost everyone in South Korea _ including Kim himself _
agrees will be decisive. ``It will have a definitive influence on
things,'' Kim said in an interview. ``The ruling party must win in
this election in order to continue its reforms, and to make Korea a
leader in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's two years in power have eroded the aura of the reformer
that was a ticket to his popularity. Now, many grumble that he has
adopted much of the imperial style of his authoritarian
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Kim still speaks strongly in favor of democratization and human
rights, noting, for example, that the press enjoys a ``freedom
unknown in the past,'' or that last year, for the first time in
living memory, South Korea's fearsome police used no tear gas to
put down demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition politicians and independent observers alike say
that his government has taken an increasingly vindictive approach
to critics and perceived political enemies. The cases most often
cited include tax prosecutions and other legal harassments of the
owners of the newspaper Joong Ang Ilbo and the head of Korean Air.
</P>
<P>
   The news here last week was dominated by the government's clumsy
attempts to arrest a lawmaker, Chung Hyung-keun, on charges that he
defamed the president. Claiming that the arrest was illegal, Chung,
a high-ranking intelligence official during South Korea's
dictatorship, barricaded himself with supporters in the
headquarters of the opposition Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Kim has come under heavy criticism by opposition
conservatives for his policy of engagement with North Korea, the
so-called Sunshine Policy, which some have called a sellout for
allowing a lucrative market in tourism with the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kim is becoming more like Khomeini and less like
Mandela,'' said Park Shinil, assistant to the director of the Grand
National Party, the leading opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   Others dismiss comparisons like these as greatly overdrawn, but
offer criticisms of their own. ``In terms of dealing with the
North, or handling the nation's economy, the president has achieved
tremendous successes,'' said Lee Seog-yeon, secretary-general of
the Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice, a leading
nongovernmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But internally, in terms of human rights, political reform and
social justice, his performance has been below expectations,'' said
Lee. ``He has become so fixated on winning the elections that he
only seems to listen to the voices of his confidants rather than to
the wishes of the Korean people.''
</P>
<P>
   The April legislative elections may still be nearly two months
off, but South Korea has already become a political hothouse. Kim's
newly renamed Millennium Democratic Party barely holds one-third of
the 299 legislative seats. It is in coalition with a party headed
by his former prime minister, but that coalition is distinctly
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong-pil stepped down as prime minister a month ago to head
the coalition's election campaign. Then his name appeared at the
top of a list of reputedly corrupt politicians circulated by a new
coalition of civic groups that wanted those politicians excluded
from the election race.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister's supporters now suspect the president
of outmaneuvering their man, getting him to relinquish his office
and then encouraging an embarrassing attack on his reputation. A
breakup of President Kim's coalition, or a poor electoral
performance in April, Kim says, would mark the end of the reform
era in Korean politics. ``Only with a mandate can we promote our
agenda of a new human rights law, a new anticorruption law, a new
national security law and legislation to further democratize this
country,'' Kim said. ``We must win these elections.''

CORRUPTION CHARGES SWIRLING AROUND JAPANESE PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In this country's long history of embedded political
corruption, few cases have enraged Japanese society more than the
bribery and influence-peddling scandal that forced Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita to resign in disgrace 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita, who was the third Japanese leader to step down
because of corruption charges since World War II, admitted that he
and his aides accepted more than $1 million in illicit payoffs,
some in the form of securities, from a fast-growing information
services company called Recruit.
</P>
<P>
   So when a popular news magazine reported this week that the
secretary to the current prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, had
improperly acquired stock in a telecommunications company that
later skyrocketed in value, the political opposition smelled blood
and attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's chief opposition Democratic Party demanded that the
prime minister's political secretary, Toshitaka Furukawa, appear
before the parliament to explain how he acquired shares in a
little-known pager company just months before it was merged in
1988, eventually creating NTT Mobile Communications, the country's
leading cellular telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Satsuki Eda, a Democratic Party legislator, said that the stock
deal was suspicious because Obuchi was an influential policy maker
in Japan's telecommunications industry at the time and had insider
information of pending mergers. Obuchi's brother, Mitsuhei, also
acquired shares in the paging company, Jomo Tsushin Services.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the mobile telephone shares soared when the company
that emerged, popularly known as NTT DoCoMo, was listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The combined value of shares owned by Furukawa and Obuchi's
brother increased from about $55,000 in 1988 to about $64 million
today, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks very similar to the Recruit scandal in that you
have high-level government officials and their relatives receiving
stock from companies before the shares were available to the
public,'' Eda said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his party cannot prove the charge, Eda
said, ``We believe that the real holder of the stock is Mr. Obuchi,
even though his name doesn't appear on the certificates.''
</P>
<P>
   In past corruption scandals, many Japanese politicians used the
names of subordinates or family members to conceal their own
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has categorically denied any wrongdoing on his part or by
his aide and his brother. ``I think that people have negative
feelings about it because the shares rose in value, but they were
not obtained unlawfully,'' he said, answering questions this week
in a routine appearance before parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have known that the company would be merged,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's close association with those involved in
the scandal has prompted new questions about Obuchi among a
populace that has become outraged by its leaders' accepting bribes
and payoffs, especially during a prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if the opposition proves that the shares were
improperly obtained, the scandal could greatly damage Obuchi's
credibility and that of the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
especially in advance of general elections, which the prime
minister must call this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's proven that these guys lined their pockets with this
stock, it will resonate very badly and Obuchi will be in hot
water,'' said John F. Neuffer, a political analyst here. ``But if
the opposition doesn't come up with a smoking gun soon, the scandal
is likely to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, Neuffer said, comes at a time when the opposition
has been seeking to discredit Obuchi after it was forced to abandon
an 11-day boycott of parliament last week. The opposition had hoped
the boycott, which stalled the government's budget deliberations,
would bring an early election in the lower house, where the ruling
coalition has more than 70 percent of the seats. But the effort
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament, which is controlled by Obuchi's governing coalition,
has not compelled Furukawa, the prime minister's secretary, to
appear to answer questions. But he has filed a libel suit against
Weekly Gendai, the magazine that broke the story.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders have vowed to continue raising the
issue until they receive an explanation of how the shares were
acquired. Weekly Gendai reported that Furukawa had swindled the
widow of the original owner of the shares, an early supporter of
Obuchi, by having the stock illegally transferred to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition party officials said that the widow told them in an
interview that she inherited the shares after her husband died in
1974 and never authorized the transfer to Furukawa. The officials
said that at the very least Furukawa must provide proof that he
acquired the shares legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public may well wonder how there can be such a profitable
transaction,'' Naoto Kan, policy chief for the Democratic Party,
told Obuchi in a session of parliament this week.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be a counterstrike by the Liberal Democratic
Party, a former resort developer said in a magazine article
published on Friday that he gave Yukio Hatoyama, head of the
Democratic Party, $500,000 through donations and fund raisers from
the late 1980s to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Hatoyama adamantly denied the accusation,
saying, ``I swear there was no giving or receiving of money
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The former resort developer, Toshikazu Hanada, made the charges
in Shincho 45, a monthly magazine. Hanada was recently released
from jail after serving a term for his role in a 1991 scandal
involving unlawful lending by Fuji Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread calls for fundamental changes in Japan's
electoral system and rules governing campaign contributions, the
likelihood of such reforms is remote, and the country's political
system remains plagued by corruption, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, Japanese politicians have made a lot of
promises of reform, but the reality is that nothing has changed,
and they are just as dirty and corrupt as they have ever been,''
said Takashi Kakuma, a freelance journalist who has covered
Japanese political scandals for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kakuma said that with the advent of new information and
communications technologies in Japan and the growing number of
corporate mergers and acquisitions, political corruption had taken
on new forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are enriching themselves and their parties through
secret stock transactions, market manipulations, and the use of
insider information, which are against the law,'' Kakuma said.

IN WATCHING HONG KONG, CHINA LOSES THE SHADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The red wine flowed and the buffet tables groaned
with Chinese delicacies like duck's tongue and webbed feet in
mustard sauce. Sir Run Run Shaw, Li Ka-shing and other legendary
local tycoons mingled easily with their mainland Chinese hosts,
while members of Hong Kong's Democratic Party peered around the
ballroom like paratroopers caught behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the New China News Agency threw its annual spring
festival reception. Always a must for Hong Kong's elite, the party
had an added attraction this year. For the first time in half a
century here, China's state news agency, known as Xinhua, was no
longer operating under cover.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1949 Xinhua's Hong Kong branch has claimed to be in the
news business, when it was actually the de facto Chinese Embassy in
this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   A shadowy organization that operates in fortresslike
headquarters, Xinhua employs several hundred Communist Party
cadres, diplomats and intelligence operatives who woo local
business leaders, mobilize trade unions, and lean on friendly
newspapers to promote Beijing's views.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua also runs a news bureau with 20 or so genuine
journalists, though people here tend to pay more heed to the
agency's spies than to its scribes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Chinese government finally owned up to the
agency's purpose _ quietly changing its name to the Liaison Office
of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region. With Hong Kong firmly under Beijing's
control, China no longer feels it necessary to cling to the fiction
that Xinhua is something other than its eyes and ears in this
capitalist outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 50 years, Xinhua has been in the same boat
through rain and wind with its Hong Kong comrades,'' said Jiang
Enzhu, the agency's powerful director, in a toast at the reception.
``Now the name of the central government's representative office
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some, the new name does not dispel the mystery of Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice that it has finally changed its name,'' said Joseph
Cheng, a professor of politics at City University of Hong Kong.
``But we all know that it remains a front for the Communist Party
in Hong Kong. The next question to ask is: When will the party come
above ground?''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the Liaison Office is supposed to represent Beijing
on domestic matters in Hong Kong, ranging from cultural and
educational exchanges to the role of the People's Liberation Army.
Neither Beijing nor the local authorities acknowledge that the
office has ties to the Communist Party. But given Xinhua's long,
murky history in Hong Kong, some people here remain skeptical of
its motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that it could emerge as an alternative source of
power,'' said Emily Lau, an outspoken pro-democracy politician who
has clashed with the agency. ``If you know that Xinhua represents
the Communist Party, why bother going through the Hong Kong
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, said Xinhua's
new status could embolden it to interfere in Hong Kong's politics.
He noted that China already had a major presence through the Hong
Kong office of its Foreign Ministry and a garrison of the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of Xinhua note that the agency's role as an
umbrella for Communist Party activities in Hong Kong is hardly a
secret here. They say that by clarifying the agency's status,
Beijing has made it harder, not easier, for Xinhua to meddle in the
territory's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Enzhu has been here for a long time,'' said Tsang
Tak-sing, a former editor of one of Hong Kong's most influential
pro-Beijing newspapers, Ta Kung Pao. ``If he wanted to become an
alternative power center, he wouldn't have needed a name change to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who is himself a senior Communist Party official, seemed
sensitive to Xinhua's vaguely sinister reputation. On Thursday he
pledged to abide by ``one country, two systems,'' the arrangement
that promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years
following the 1997 hand-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not interfere in Hong Kong affairs,'' Jiang said, as
the territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, stood next to him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a show of conciliation, the Liaison Office for the first time
invited two members of the Democratic Party to its reception. The
Democrats welcomed the gesture, though it was clear that a single
gathering would not erase years of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the Democrats, Fred Li, was asked whether he had
shaken hands with Jiang, he became flustered and said he could not
pick him out in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was chatting with a knot of reporters just behind Li.

U.N. TRADE MEETING BRINGS RICH AND POOR NO CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ A U.N. conference on developing nations
concluded Saturday with expressions of good will but no real
narrowing of the differences that split a meeting of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates offered only general expressions of hope that rich and
poor nations might eventually agree on a formula that would allow
them to share the benefits of global trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a success or even a relative success at this meeting
and having the machine function in good order is a way of getting
back on track,'' said Poul Nielson, the development commissioner of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``I would warn against easy-fix approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   A key unresolved issue among the 160 delegations to the 10th
annual meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development was
a demand by poor nations that the more developed nations open their
markets fully to their products, without tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The poor nations also reiterated their objections to standards
of environmental and worker protection that the developed nations
generally seek, saying such standards make it even harder for them
to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, said that
although technology is rapidly bringing the world closer together,
populations ``remain split along a fault line that separates the
lives and aspirations of the rich and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were daily demonstrations outside the convention
center where the meeting was held, they were relatively small and
did not erupt into the disorder and violence that disrupted the
Seattle conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangkok meeting was the first meeting of an international
trade organization since Seattle, and some participants were hoping
to use it to address their grievances and heal rifts. But the
United States and other major developed nations did not send
high-level delegations, saying that the World Trade Organization
remains the proper and effective vehicle for setting standards for
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. trade meetings are designed to provide information and
expertise to help developing nations compete in the global trading
system.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the views of many developing nations, Shri Suresh
Pachouri, an Indian delegate, said, ``The rules of the WTO have
been framed mainly keeping in view the interests of the
industrialized countries.'' He said the standards demanded by the
World Trade Organization often ignored the political, social and
economic conditions of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional heart of the session came on Friday with a keynote
speech by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, who drew
applause when he said, ``The have-nots are funding the haves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding this new order of international economic relations
and its proclaimed advantages for the poor,'' he said, ``how can
one refrain from recalling the fable of the fox offering the stork
delicious meals on dinner plates but making the food out of
reach?''
</P>
<P>
   As a spokesman for African nations, he said his continent, still
suffering from the legacy of colonial rule, was now being crushed
by a new world order of international trade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Ultimately a new map of the world is being drawn up, and an
entire continent _ Africa _ is purely and simply being rubbed
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever African leaders try to take advantage of opportunities
for international trade, he said, they run into barriers erected by
richer nations as well as crippling demands for debt repayments.
</P>
<P>
   He said rich nations seem to be offering ``the macabre specter
of someone visiting a dying man and saying: `Well, die happy. You
won't have any debts to pay.'''

RISE OF FAR RIGHT PARTY BRINGS OUT LARGE PROTEST IN VIENNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Apparently unbowed by rain, tens of thousands
of people gathered in the streets of Vienna on Saturday to protest
the formation of a government that includes Joerg Haider's
anti-immigration Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, organized by human-rights groups and attended
by artists and intellectuals from throughout Europe, was by far the
largest since the coalition government took office two weeks ago.
But it elicited only contempt from Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who who were in power for the past 30 years, the Social
Democrats, cannot stand to lose,'' Haider said Saturday. ``That is
why they try to mobilize the population, and if that does not work,
even pay people to go out and protest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats angrily rejected the charge that anyone had
been paid, and Haider produced no evidence to support his
allegation. The demonstration appeared to be drawn from a very
broad swath of Austrian society, including artists, state
employees, factory workers, professionals and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to show the Austrian government and also the
international community that not all Austrians are Nazis,'' said
Martin Hochegger, a psychologist from Graz. ``I do not believe that
Haider is a Nazi, but he is a racist, and that is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The formation of a government made up of the Freedom Party and
the conservative People's Party of Wolfgang Schuessel has provoked
outrage in Europe because it has appeared to legitimize the far
right. Haider has made occasional remarks praising aspects of the
Third Reich, before recently denouncing Hitler's regime as
``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators said that while it was a good thing for
Austria's long-blocked democracy to have a change after three
decades of government by a coalition of Social Democrats and
conservatives, this particular change was abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud to have an Austrian passport, and now I am
ashamed,'' said Agnes Schmidt, who moved here from her native
Hungary 30 years ago and took Austrian nationality. ``Even if we
needed change, we did not need this one.''
</P>
<P>
   No estimate of the number of demonstrators was immediately
available; organizers had said they expected as many as 200,000
people. Those attending include Bernard-Henri Levy, the French
philosopher, and Michael Friedman, a leading member of the German
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators marched under banners saying ``Resistance''
and ``Never Again,'' and it was clear that the arrival of Haider's
party in power had abruptly politicized what had been a largely
apolitical Austrian youth.
</P>
<P>
   The government has vowed to cut the public sector, deregulate
Austria's highly bureaucratic economy, promote capital markets and
generally bring something resembling a Thatcherite revolution to
this country. These economic aims have provoked almost as much
alarm among Austrians as Haider's anti-immigrant or revisionist
declarations. Several banners said, ``No to social cutbacks,'' and
a large labor union presence was evident.
</P>
<P>
   Anna-Maria Maio, a lawyer, said the Freedom Party justice
minister, Michael Kruger, aimed to cut jobs in the justice
department and courts throughout Austria. ``I cannot accept this
any more than I can accept a justice minister who is against
foreigners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maio added that she was married to an Italian in the Tyrol area
of Austria and had frequently encountered racism, although she said
the situation had improved in recent years. ``From my private life,
I have learned what racism is, and there is no question that Haider
stirs up racism in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Posters for Haider's last election campaign showed fair-haired
Austrian girls as emblems of the threatened essence of the country,
while other posters in Vienna appeared to equate black people with
drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, the chancellor, dismissed the importance of the
demonstration. ``Those from the old left, the generation of 1968,
can have a good romp with the young and the Internet generation,''
he said. ``Then we will return to normality and get on with the
work that has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared from the breadth of the demonstration, and the
strong presence of powerful unions, that the work of the
conservative government will be arduous, both in its efforts at
home and its attempt to overcome a hostile international
environment.

MUBARAK VISIT TO LEBANON OFFERS SUPPORT AFTER RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made an
unexpected visit to Lebanon on Saturday to demonstrate Egypt's
support in the wake of Israeli bombing raids that destroyed three
Lebanese power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The brief visit was the first by an Egyptian president to
Lebanon since the overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy in 1952, and
came at a time of protests against Israel and the United States in
Lebanon and elsewhere in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Cairo, Egypt, Mubarak issued a joint
statement with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud that endorsed the
right of guerrillas fighting for the Iranian-backed Islamic
movement Hezbollah to attack Israeli forces in the zone in southern
Lebanon they have occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Israel described the Feb. 8 attacks on the power plants, which
cut Lebanon's electricity supply in half and wounded 20 Lebanese
civilians, as a retaliation for intensified Hezbollah attacks on
Israeli forces. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in in recent
fighting, until both sides appeared to de-escalate the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance has the right to confront Israeli occupation
until the land is liberated,'' the Egyptian and Lebanese leaders
said in their statement. They added: ``The resistance is the result
of the occupation, not the cause of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders said that peace in the region could only be
established on the basis of ``Israel's full withdrawal from
occupied Arab territories in southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa
Valley,'' the two areas of Lebanon that are covered by the
nine-mile ``security zone'' Israel declared in 1985 as a buffer
against cross-border attacks on targets within Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also demanded that Israel withdraw from the Golan
Heights, Syrian territory seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and
pull back to the pre-1967 borders, as well as ``from Palestinian
lands,'' which the statement did not specify. It also called for
all refugees to be allowed to return to their homes, an issue of
pressing concern for Lebanon, which has an estimated 350,000
Palestinian refugees, many of them living in camps here since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The demands amounted to a standard reiteration of those made on
Israel by Arabs. This, and the suddenness of Mubarak's trip, led
Western diplomats to suggest that the Egyptian leader may have had
purposes beyond what the Lebanese government described as ``a
gesture of solidarity'' in coming here.
</P>
<P>
   High among these, the diplomats said, was almost certainly the
desire to increase pressure on Israel to make concessions that
would re-start peace talks with Syria, suspended last month over
differences about terms for the return of the Golan Heights to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the diplomats said, Mubarak may have wanted to
enlist Lahoud's backing for a meeting of Arab leaders, a gathering
not held in several years.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate purpose of the visit appeared to be to deter
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel from military actions that
might escalate the fighting. After the power-plant bombings, Barak
warned of further severe retaliation against Lebanon if any more
Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the quieting of the fighting in the past week,
political tensions in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Arab world have
risen, with protests in many Arab capitals. In Beirut on Thursday
and Friday, large crowds attempted to break through army and police
cordons to the U.S. Embassy and the CNN offices. On both occasions,
they were forced back by tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it will withdraw its 1,000 troops from southern
Lebanon by early July. The announcement appears to have encouraged
Hezbollah, the militant Islamic group, to seek ways of turning the
Israeli pullout into what the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, has described as a humiliation.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the weather pattern across the nation will become
more evident Sunday as dry and milder air begins to dominate the
region east of the Rockies. Meanwhile, clouds and precipitation
will be more widespread in the West. The jet stream will start a
retreat from the East, but it will be impeded by a fresh surge of
polar air into the upper Great Lakes which will move into New
England on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive high-pressure system over the lower Mississippi
Valley will control the weather over the South. The clockwise
circulation will draw cooler air into the Southeast. The leading
edge of the cool air will reach into Florida with scattered
showers. The return flow of warmer air into the southwest Plains
will be accompanied by thickening clouds. Showers will develop in
the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Milder air will move into the northern Plains and eastern
Rockies. This warmth marks the beginning of at least several days
of well above seasonal readings. As the warmer air progresses into
the Midwest, it will encounter cold air over snow-covered terrain.
The result will be some flurries.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance which brought showers to southern California on
Saturday will move into the southern Rockies with valley showers
and patches of snow in the mountains. A larger and more powerful
disturbance will near the California coast with moderate to heavy
rain in northern sections and showers farther south. Snow levels
will decrease in the Sierra and southern Cascades. The Northwest
will turn dull, but stay seasonably mild. Showers will arrive at
night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Train of Showers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Ohio Valley were drenched Friday as a complex
winter storm spun its way through the region. Evansville, Ind.,
measured a February record of 3.38 inches of rain in less than 24
hours. A swath of showers, with a link to Gulf moisture, developed
near the Ohio River and kept reforming over the same parts of
southern Indiana and western Kentucky. This elongated train of
showers is more common in the warm season, but when atmospheric
conditions are ripe and a rich supply of moisture is available,
like the Gulf of Mexico, then this ``training'' can happen at any
time of the year.

NAACP OPPOSES COMPROMISE ON S.C. FLAG  
 MORE TROUBLE FOR THE REFORM PARTY  
 THE POWER OF CHEESE IN NORTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Minn., N.C.)  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Confederate battle flag issue was here when
the Republican presidential candidates arrived months ago to begin
campaigning for Saturday's primary. And it will still be here when
they depart, as politically contentious and seemingly intractable
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have been asked repeatedly whether the banner
should be hauled down from atop the Statehouse, no small decision
in a state in which ``The War'' remains very much on some minds.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, saw the question as a sure-fire loser
whatever answer they offered. So they skittered away, saying the
flag's fate was not for outsiders to decide.
</P>
<P>
   That struck the third candidate, Alan Keyes, the black
conservative commentator, as rank wishy-washiness _ not the kind of
wash McCain and Bush had in mind as they skittered. He demanded
that the flag be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   It still flies. And the debate rages on as the candidates take
their leave.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, proposed on Monday that the state
Legislature approve moving the flag to a site near the Statehouse
on which there is a large statue of Gen. Wade Hampton, a Civil War
hero. Standing with the governor when he announced the plan were
numerous business and community leaders who are concerned about the
impact of the dispute on the state. Standing there, too, were 22
state legislators, nine of them black.
</P>
<P>
   Given the makeup of that gathering, it appeared the governor's
proposal, with its nod to both sides in the fight, might have the
kind of backing needed to end the impasse. Such a compromise had
long seemed to many South Carolinians to be the best way to get the
flag off of the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Hodges plan appears to be in some trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which has called for an economic boycott of South Carolina until
the flag comes down, says the compromise is inadequate and
unacceptable. What is more, some black leaders say state NAACP
officials have begun warning black legislators, many of them weary
of the flag issue and eager to move on, to vote against the Hodges
plan or risk political retribution.
</P>
<P>
   One NAACP ally, state Sen. Darrell Jackson, told The State
newspaper of Columbia on Thursday that the group's leaders minced
no words in demanding that black legislators put up a solid front
of opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership said to them emphatically,'' Jackson said,
``that anybody that supports it, they would consider them against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reform Party, More Turmoil
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last weekend's rowdy free-for-all in
Nashville, Tenn., where Ross Perot forces snatched back control of
the Reform Party from allies of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, a
move is afoot to draft Perot for a third run for president.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being led by Jim Mangia, the party's national
secretary, who was a leader of last week's Perot putsch. He says it
is critical that the party have a competitive race between
candidates this year if it is to survive and grow, and he argues
that Perot, the party's founder, is the man who can make it
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   To many Reformers, the ``draft Ross'' call has a ``stop Pat''
sound, Pat being Pat Buchanan, the only big name still proclaiming
or hinting at an interest in the party's nomination, now that
Ventura and Donald Trump have said they want no part of the party.
To Ventura and Trump, Buchanan is a political extremist, not a
reformer, and they believe his nomination would finish off what is
left of an already badly shattered party.
</P>
<P>
   As for Perot and Buchanan, they had seemed to be on good terms
until Mangia began his draft effort, though Perot had not endorsed
Buchanan. In fact, after Jack Gargan, Ventura's man, was ousted as
Reform Party chairman last Saturday, the Perot supporters installed
Pat Choate as the interim chairman. He was Perot's running mate in
1996 and, until he took the interim chairman's job, was helping run
Buchanan's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Perot is not commenting on the draft effort, at least not yet.
But if Perot jumps in, Buchanan vows to fight. He has been working
the party's grass roots in recent months and has built up enough
support that his backers made the difference the Perot faction
needed for the Nashville takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Do not look to Russell Verney, Perot's closest political adviser
and his spokesman on party matters, to explain away all this
confusion. He is talking up Sen. John McCain of Arizona as the
possible Reform nominee, arguing that McCain espouses the closest
thing to a real reform message this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be both the Republican nominee and the Reform
nominee,'' Verney says.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheese Heads In North Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   The American Diary Association was casting about for a new way
to promote cheese when the bright idea hit. Why not run a
television spot keyed to the election season?
</P>
<P>
   So the advertising people went to work and came up with a skit,
now showing nationally, in which a fictional presidential candidate
named ``Hayes'' refuses an offer to try a piece of cheese in a
campaign appearance. The crowd is outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' opponent, a fictional fellow named ``Taylor,'' calls a
news conference and declares his love for cheese. Flashbulbs pop
and scribes scribble and Bob Dole _ he of real political and
advertising fame _ calls Hayes ``a doofus.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing scene finds Hayes back in his campaign headquarters,
alone and deserted _ a cheesy guy. The lights dim and an announcer
intones, ``Ah, the power of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, indeed, for it turns out that in the 8th Congressional
District in south-central North Carolina, there just happens to be
a genuine race involving two fellows named Hayes and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The district's incumbent congressman, Robin Hayes, a Republican,
is in a down-to-the-wire contest with Mike Taylor, a Democrat who
almost captured the seat two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that many 8th District voters have seen the cheese
commercial, both candidates are working ``pro-cheese'' references
to it into their speeches, with Hayes boasting that his wife hails
from Wisconsin and Taylor promising to be a ``Gouda'' legislator.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Pure coincidence, dairy association officials insist. They say
the characters in the commercial were named for two advertising
agency employees.

IDAHO SEEKS A MORE TOLERANT IMAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ Greg Carr's native Idaho is a state well known
for its spectacular wild beauty. But, he said, it also has a
reputation as a haven for racists, an unfortunate distinction
generated by white-supremacist groups that congregate in northern
Idaho and exacerbated by the fact that it is one of the least
ethnically diverse states in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So in an unusual example of the burst of philanthropy now going
on among Internet-era executives, Carr, the former chairman of
Prodigy Inc., last year issued a ``challenge grant'' to the people
of Idaho to raise money for a human rights memorial that might
represent a step toward counteracting the image.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Idaho seem to have responded, raising about
$750,000 over four months and more than meeting the $500,000 goal
that Carr set as a baseline for him to kick in $500,000 toward the
project.
</P>
<P>
   And, it was announced here recently, construction will begin
this spring on the Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, to be
built along the Boise River Greenbelt near the city's public
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idahoans are good people, and this response is evidence of
that,'' said the 40-year-old Carr, who resigned from Prodigy, the
online services company, to pursue philanthropic matters full time,
including establishing the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ``Sadly, it
really only takes a very few people, a tiny group, to give the
entire state a bad image.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a 175-foot-long wall of granite panels with
quotes and images from human rights figures, including Nelson
Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Margaret Mead.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a life-size statue of Frank and a bronze
model of the diary that she kept as she and her family hid from the
Nazis in an Amsterdam, Netherlands, attic. Frank, who would have
turned 70 last year, died at 15 of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp, a few months before the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The donors came from across Idaho, offering amounts that ranged
from the $50,000 contributed by Hewlett-Packard Co. and Albertson's
Inc., the supermarket chain, down to the $23 collected by a young
girl who sold bookmarks to be used in reading Frank's diary, one of
the most widely read books in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the memorial will help project Idaho as a far more
tolerant place _ or, more important, help make it so _ remains to
be seen. Many people here are confident that it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of little things to change perceptions,'' said
the state controller, J.D. Williams, a Democrat. ``I would describe
this as a big little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say it is only the first step in a long process,
or even worry that having a human rights memorial to point to will
divert people from harder actions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Baker, a professor of sociology at Boise State
University, who has written two books on race relations in Idaho,
said that Hispanic people in the state, many coming here to work in
agriculture, are routinely viewed as ``second-class citizens'' by
the majority. Efforts to give them stronger wage or
working-condition protections are routinely beaten back in the
Legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much more problematic than an image issue,'' he said.
``There is institutionalized racism here, and nobody even wants to
talk about it.'' That said, though, Baker added that he strongly
supported the human rights memorial as a way to help spark
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho is undeniably far from diverse. Of its 1,228,684 people,
just 88,284 are Hispanic and 7,158 _ barely half of 1 percent _ are
black, according to Census Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Hardy, who moved with some trepidation from New York
City last year to become executive director of the Idaho Black
History Museum, which opened last March, said she found more
friendly curiosity than xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an outsider, all I had ever really heard about Idaho was
the Aryan Nation and potatoes,'' said Hardy, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away the potatoes, and that's a pretty negative
image,'' she said. ``But since I've been here, I've found that
that's not fair. I talk to a lot of people who've lived here all
their lives and they simply don't know about blacks. They've never
been around black people, but they want to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Anne Frank theme for a human rights memorial
emerged after nearly 50,000 people, including schoolchildren from
all over the state, attended the international Anne Frank in the
World exhibit when it came to Boise in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Peterman, executive director of the Idaho Human Rights
Education Center, said the memorial was expected to open sometime
in the fall. Describing an outpouring of checks and letters that
had come in , she said: ``The vast majority of people here want to
do something together that will really speak louder than the few
voices of those groups. I think this memorial will send that
message, loud and clear.''

LABOR LEADERS SUPPORT GORE DESPITE STANCE ON CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leaders of the AFL-CIO said this weekend that they would
continue pushing union members to campaign aggressively for Vice
President Al Gore, even though he has reiterated his support for
President Clinton's trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading Congress to reject the China accord has become
organized labor's No. 1 legislative goal this year, and some labor
leaders are voicing fears that Gore's support for the deal could
cause many rank-and-file union members to sour on the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore told labor leaders meeting in New Orleans that
any trade agreements he negotiated as president would have strong
labor and environmental protections. Some union officials took that
to mean that Gore was unenthusiastic about the China deal, which
does not contain such protections.
</P>
<P>
   But after some administration officials and corporate executives
criticized Gore for seemingly undermining the deal, he sent a
letter to a powerful business group reaffirming his support for the
China accord, and his aides said his remarks had been
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said that even though
he was unhappy with Gore's stance on the China deal, labor would
back him enthusiastically. The AFL-CIO, which represents 13 million
union members, endorsed Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's picking up a lot of momentum with our members,'' Sweeney
said in a telephone interview on Friday night. ``We were confident
when we started down this path that he was the right person and the
best candidate, and that's just been reconfirmed for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Several labor leaders said Gore's speech to the AFL-CIO's
executive council resonated with them on many issues other than
China, like Social Security and the need for legislation that would
make it easier to unionize workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who has transformed organized labor into a more potent
political force, is walking a fine line in trying to mobilize union
members to fight the China deal while somehow keeping them
enthusiastic about Gore. Even many of Sweeney's union allies say
this will be hard to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think China raises the legitimate issue that no candidate is
perfect on our issues,'' said Andrew Stern, president of the
Service Employees International Union. ``If I were this
administration, I wouldn't hold this vote now. It will not generate
enthusiasm among union members, and certainly among parts of the
labor movement it's going to be incredibly debilitating.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he had told Gore to urge President Clinton to delay
the vote and instead focus on issues popular with union members,
like safeguarding financing for Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, shortly after the AFL-CIO endorsed Gore, the
Clinton administration reached its trade deal with China, a move
that will help pave the way for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. The deal calls on China and the United States to
remove barriers to each other's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives have praised the deal, saying it will
increase American exports, create jobs and force China to follow
world trade rules. But union officials have condemned it because it
does not require China to improve its performance on human rights
or worker rights.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders fear that once China joins the World Trade
Organization, it will use its influence to block efforts to
persuade the organization's members to include labor protections in
future trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have helped cement labor's support of Gore
despite his stance on the China accord. For one thing, his
Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, and the two leading
Republican presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, all support the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore has repeatedly called for inserting
enforceable labor, environmental and human rights provisions into
the fabric of future trade agreements, rather than relegating such
provisions to unenforceable side agreements. That has convinced
many labor leaders that he will take a more pro-labor stance in
trade negotiations than President Clinton has.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Al Gore is supporting the president and the China trade
agreement, he was very clear at our convention as to where he will
stand on trade agreements when he is the president,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders who support the China deal say that Gore
has been trying to walk a tightrope in dealing with trade _ and
that when he spoke to the AFL-CIO on Thursday, he fell off. They
say he apparently tried to signal his ambivalence about the China
deal by telling labor leaders, minutes after he had said he
supported the deal, that as president he would negotiate accords
more to labor's liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was trolling for votes and grass-roots support,''
said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``It's unfortunate, to be quite honest, that he did this
right when this is being teed up in Congress. He's running for
president, and they had endorsed him earlier, and for any Democrat
to win the presidency, you have to keep intact that important union
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Josten said he considered the AFL-CIO's opposition
short-sighted, because blocking the deal will reduce the number of
export-related jobs. He noted that China will join the World Trade
Organization whether or not Congress approves the agreement. If the
deal is rejected, he said, American companies will continue to face
trade barriers in China, and European and Japanese competitors will
have an advantage in exporting to the world's most populous nation.

</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers say they expect Congress to vote on the China
accord this spring or summer, although some union officials and
Democratic lawmakers say it would be best to delay the vote until
after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in Congress will feel intense pressure to vote
for the agreement, from business leaders as well as President
Clinton. But if they do, many union members could turn against them
in a year when the Democrats hope to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a vote on China is potentially devastating for the
Democrats,'' said Mike Mathis, director of government affairs for
the Teamsters union. ``In our case, our general president, Jim
Hoffa, is going to be out front on this trade issue, and it's going
to be a real selling job for us to have our general president
pushing the importance of defeating this trade agreement and then
ask our members to vote for Al Gore. The only way to do that is to
say, `If he's president, he will be a better president on trade
than whoever the Republican is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Josten said he was upset by Gore's remarks, because if the vice
president was questioning the deal, that might give wavering
Democrats political cover to oppose it. Nonetheless, he said, he
was confident that Congress would approve the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders say they plan to spend at least $9 million
lobbying for the deal, while the AFL-CIO is planning an advertising
campaign to pressure wavering members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their dismay with the Clinton administration's trade
policies, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United
Auto Workers have bucked the union tide and not endorsed Gore. The
Teamsters' executive board is scheduled to meet on Feb. 29 in
Orlando, Fla. Teamster leaders say that a majority of the board is
leaning toward Gore.

TRIPLE KILLING IN COFFEE SHOP STIRS DEATH PENALTY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN FILES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal prosecutors are pressing for the death
penalty against a man charged with murdering three employees at a
Starbucks coffee shop here in July 1997, clearing the way for the
city's first death penalty case in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an outline issued this week, the prosecutors said they wanted
to press a capital charge because the defendant has a history of
violent crime. They said he shows no remorse and poses a continuing
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Carl D. Cooper, 30, has been charged with the three killings in
the affluent Georgetown section of the city. The bodies of Emory
Allen Evans, 25; Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 24; and Aaron David
Goodrich, 18, were found by another Starbucks employee.
</P>
<P>
   The case gained national attention because it happened in one of
the city's fashionable neighborhoods, a 34-square-block area
northwest of downtown Washington known for bars, restaurants,
boutiques and narrow residential streets of expensive town houses.
Georgetown is home to members of Congress, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other political figures, as well as
Georgetown University. There is not a great deal of crime or
violence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno decided to seek the death penalty
for Cooper with advice from Wilma A. Lewis, the U.S. attorney for
the District of Columbia. A death penalty review panel at the
Justice Department concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Wainstein, assistant U.S. attorney, in a 35-page
document, cited Cooper's ``continuing pattern of criminal
conduct,'' including armed robberies dating to 1989 and possession
of firearms and drugs dating to 1988; laundering of money obtained
from robberies; and threats to murder witnesses and law enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The case moved to federal court in August with a 48-count
indictment against Cooper, charging him with crimes from 1993 to
1997. His trial is to start on May 2 in federal court in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The last person executed in the city was Robert E. Carter, 28,
an unemployed laborer electrocuted on April 27, 1957, for killing
an unarmed, off-duty police officer. The last trial in a capital
case was in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The city repealed the death penalty in 1980. Residents voted
overwhelmingly in the 1992 election to reject a provision that
would have reinstated the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, many of whom are opposed to the decision to make
Cooper's a capital case, criticized Reno for ignoring the views of
the city's residents and urged that the city be allowed to handle
the situation with some autonomy. If Cooper were prosecuted under
local jurisdiction, the maximum sentence he could receive would be
life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's delegate to Congress, wrote to
Lewis: ``The Cooper case is essentially a local homicide matter
with federal charges tacked on. If the District had a local
prosecutor, she could not ask for the death penalty. The
application of the harshest and most controversial penalty in our
law should not depend on whether the U.S. attorney or a locally
chosen prosecutor litigates the case. Where the local jurisdiction
of taxpaying citizens is deprived of a local prosecutor, the U.S.
attorney has a special obligation to respect local law.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton said in an interview that ``serious equal protection
questions are raised'' when a high-profile case is chosen for the
death penalty. She said it is disturbing that, with about 300
homicides in the city in a year, most of them in poor
neighborhoods, federal officials chose to elevate a case from the
``most glamorous part of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Williams, mayor of the District of Columbia, said he
agreed with the attorney general on ``the need for harsh penalties,
including life in prison without parole.'' But, he added, ``I do
not support the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton and Amnesty International USA have drawn comparisons to a
1995 triple murder at a McDonald's in Southeast Washington. Kenneth
J. Marshall pleaded guilty and received 80 years to life in prison.

<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ The pretrial litigation has reached the
five-year mark with depositions and arguments ever growing in
Dickensian stacks dense enough to make the judge cry out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court has been submerged,'' complained Judge James
Michael here in U.S. District Court. ``No more of these 180-page
briefs,'' he ordered the battery of lawyers as he applied a firm
hand to one of the more enigmatic environmental lawsuits inching
its way across a highly valued corner of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The suit involves a group of preservationists in a rustic
antebellum enclave of Louisa County and two strip mining companies,
but not in the usual configuration.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is Historic Green Springs Inc., the nonprofit
group of preservationists, that is being sued after decades of
aggressively using the courts to help create a 11,000-acre land
trust of 18th century working farms and Civil War plantation
houses. The trust was set up 30 years ago as a federal National
Historic Landmark. Through conservation easements, the local
property owners agree not to develop their land.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave of more than 250 privately owned 18th and 19th
century homes, barns and slave quarters 25 miles east of
Charlottesville survives as one of the little noticed jewels of the
rolling Virginia countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our survival,'' said Rae H. Ely, a founder
of the Green Springs land trust, which is being accused by one of
the mining companies, Virginia Vermiculite Ltd., of participating
in an antitrust conspiracy in having accepted a gift of 1,400 acres
of vermiculite-rich land for the trust.
</P>
<P>
   The gift was unexpectedly made by the second mining company,
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., which ended its plans for an elaborate
strip-mining project on the land and yielded the acreage as an
unusual gift after years of fighting the tenacious Ely and her
neighbors in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil suit, conducted largely behind closed doors in the
name of protecting trade secrets, Virginia Vermiculite is demanding
the award of most of the Grace gift plus $20 million in damages,
contending that the donation to the land trust amounted to an
unfair monopoly of a rare mineral, vermiculite, which is used as an
insulation material.
</P>
<P>
   Grace , rejecting that argument, stands accused alongside the
Green Springs trust, while major preservation groups like the Land
Trust Alliance and the National Trust file friend of the court
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists fear that the suit, if successful, could chill
future donations under federal programs that protect more than
700,000 acres of historic areas around the nation from industrial
development by the use of conservation easements and pledges to
keep the land configured for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to destroy us,'' said Ely, contending that the
lawsuit had no merit but was being pursued in a costly effort to
break the trust, which she said had no paid staff, had exhausted
its resources and was more than $150,000 in debt from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ely is a fierce defender of the land as she squares off against
her chief antagonist, Robert Sansom, a former environmental
official in the Nixon administration who is head of Virginia
Vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom's company has been mining a smaller strip at the edge of
the trust and is suing to gain the valuable Grace gift as a
resource he contends is vital for the nation's interests. ``It's
the finest reserve of vermiculite in the United States, the biggest
and highest quality,'' Sansom said.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom paid a battle-weary compliment to Ely after this and
years of earlier legal clashes over mining rights. ``She never
sleeps,'' he said. He argued that the district was not threatened
by the suit and rejected the argument that a defeat of the trust
would essentially open the other 10,000 acres of the National
Historic Landmark to relentless development pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Sheehan, who as part of the trus thas restricted
development of Prospect Hill, his small plantation inn, disagreed.
``If you can successfully challenge supposedly iron-clad easements,
then the whole thing falls,'' he said. ``What I have sacrificed is
not for me or my children. It's for 100 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirits are running high among the Green Springs homeowners,
whose holdings range from the humblest working farms to Henry
Taylor's family homestead, a gleaming mansion called Westend that
dates from 1847. ``Virginia Vermiculite is aiming to destroy the
historic district,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of the struggle contrasts with this region's tone
of Virginia courtliness, a quality personified by Michael, who
keeps a sharp edge to his drawl as he prods the lawyers to work
harder and faster. ``You all aren't doing very much in the way of
geein' and hawin','' he observed, employing the mule driver's
vernacular to the case that is only now attracting wider notice of
the quiet beauty and simmering conflict at Green Springs.

   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Seven years into a project to honor the
rights advocate Sojourner Truth with a bronze statue, organizers
are finding themselves in the middle of a dispute over fairness.
</P>
<P>
   When they announced last month that they had chosen five
designer finalists, all male, from a field of 49 entrants about
equally balanced between men and women, local artists expressed
outrage and gathered 100 signatures in protest. Last week the
Sojourner Truth Memorial Statue Committee announced a new list of
finalists, now including five women.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first set of finalists were not happy. ``I'm trying
to bite my tongue and not say anything negative,'' said one of the
finalists, Thomas Jay Warren of Vilas, N.C. He has been awarded
commissions for statues of such people as Medgar Evers and Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded list also became fodder for at least one national
radio show, whose hosts, Judy and Jason Jarvis, complained that
affirmative action was invading the art world.
</P>
<P>
   A committee member, the Rev. Andrea Ayvazian, dean of religious
life at Mount Holyoke College in nearby South Hadley, responded
that ``the process that chose the first five men had integrity and
was fair but we had to have a gender-balanced diverse pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, she said, was sparked by grass-roots activists
after the Rodney King beating eight years ago. ``We wanted to do
something powerful to combat racism that was not a onetime event,''
Ayvazian said. ``Sojourner Truth is a local hero and she needs to
be honored with a statue in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Born as a slave in 1797, Isabella Van Wagener changed her name
to Sojourner Truth when she was free. She lived in Northampton from
1843 to 1857 and was a member of a utopian community called the
Northampton Association of Education and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Truth was no stranger to gender politics. In 1851, she spoke
about her place in the women's rights movement during a meeting in
Akron, Ohio. The speech, later known as ``Ain't I a Woman,'' has
become part of the feminist canon.
</P>
<P>
   But even the speech is open to dispute. ``Later attempts to cast
Sojourner Truth as an outsize force of nature fit well with a 1960s
feminist agenda,'' according to Nell Irvin Painter, a Princeton
University history professor, who wrote a biography of her. A white
reformer, Frances Gage, wrote down and embellished Truth's remarks
for her own polemical purposes, Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojourner Truth was known as a fiery orator who Painter says was
often ``an electrifying black presence in a white crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth was also skilled at promoting herself. She was one of the
first African-American women to have her image widely disseminated.
She had her picture printed on a ``carte de visite.'' Slightly
larger than business cards, her cards were ``wildly popular in the
1860s,'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojourner Truth sold these images, along with transcripts of a
narrative of her life story, to support her preaching.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 10 contest finalists has been given $1,000 to
produce a maquette, a small three-dimensional rendering of a
design. A winner will be announced in August.

   TEACHER-TENURE _ WASHINGTON _ The Georgia legislature is on the
verge of adopting a law that would make it the first state to
abolish the right of veteran public school teachers to demand a
hearing either before or after a school board's decision not to
re-hire them for the next school year. Gov. Roy Barnes is winning
his legislative battle to abolish tenure protection for all
teachers who start working for a Georgia school district after July
1, 2000. His plan is is far bolder than the limited attacks on
tenure by the governors of Colorado and Alabama, and goes further
than past attempts to ``abolish tenure'' in other states where
leaders claimed to abolish tenure, according to records at the
quasi-official Education Commission of the States and interviews
with scholars, state education officials and attorneys for school
boards and unions from coast to coast. They differ on whether the
change will help or hurt the state's schools. (Mollison, Cox News

LOS ANGELES BOARD RULES POLICE SHOOTING WAS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a vote seen as a crucial test of the city's
commitment to change and oversight of the city's police force, the
Los Angeles Police Commission has ruled that an officer's shooting
of a mentally ill homeless woman last year violated department
policy.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 3-2, the commission concluded that the woman,
Margaret Mitchell, had not posed an imminent danger and that
alternatives had not been exhausted before she was killed. In doing
so, the commission accepted the recommendation of its civilian
inspector general, Jeffrey Eglash, over that of Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks. Parks had argued that the shooting should have
been found within the department's policy guidelines even if the
tactics leading to it were faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted on Tuesday after more than a year of debate
over the inspector general's role in department affairs and
questions about the commission's independence from the police chief
and Mayor Richard J. Riordan, who appoints commission members and
is a strong backer of Parks.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago a city attorney determined, for the first time,
that the civilian commission, and not the police chief, was the
head of the department. Still, there is growing conflict over
whether the commission should have the ultimate say in a
department-wide examination started following accusations of
corruption and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Some city leaders believe that the commission and the inspector
general should be given the chance to review the examination and
determine whether the changes it recommends are adequate to correct
deficiencies. Other leaders and civil rights advocates believe that
an outside commission _ similar to the Christopher Commission
convened in the wake of the Rodney King beating _ should be
appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor supports the police commission,'' Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez said on Wednesday. ``They've done their job,
they've looked at the facts and they've voted on the matter. This
shows that they are independent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the narrow vote, and the rarity of the civilian panel
overruling the police chief, has others reluctant to proclaim a new
day in the troubled police force. ``The fact that this has happened
once in most of our memories does not mean that it signals the
police commission is truly independent,'' said Ramona Ripston, the
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union chapter
here, which is calling for an appointed commission to oversee the
changes. ``There's too much evidence that they're not
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 54, a college-educated onetime bank teller rendered
homeless by mental illness, was shot last May after brandishing a
foot-long screwdriver at two officers who approached her to ask if
the shopping cart she was using had been stolen. The commission
unanimously agreed that the officer who killed Mitchell, Edward
Larrigan, had used flawed tactics leading to the shooting: He did
not take the screwdriver when he had an opportunity, he did not use
nonlethal options and he did not keep a safe distance from her.
</P>
<P>
   But it was divided over whether the shooting was within
department guidelines. In the majority opinion, three commissioners
said the evidence, including Mitchell's 102-pound frame, did not
support the officer's belief that he had been in imminent danger.
But the two dissenting commissioners found that Mitchell's conduct
justified the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell case has given rise to a new debate over how police
commissioners assess the validity of police shootings. In the past,
shootings have been examined in three parts: tactics leading to the
incident, drawing of the weapon and the use of force. The approach
allowed officials to criticize parts of an incident without
condemning it entirely. The Mitchell case is leading some to
question whether it is possible to find a shooting within policy
guidelines if the tactics that led to it were faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Martin, Riordan's chief of staff, told the commissioners
that the question was a policy issue that deserved public debate
and should not be applied to the Mitchell case. Some commissioners
reportedly interpreted that instruction as lobbying by the mayor's
office for them to adopt Parks' position. Martin adamantly denied
that the mayor's office had lobbied the commissioners to reach a
certain conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended ``administrative disapproval'' of the
shooting, meaning the case will now go to Parks for disciplining of
the officer. Punishment could range from from an official reprimand
to dismissal from the force.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

ISOLATION OR NO, AUSTRIA WON'T CRAWL, SAYS ITS CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Wolfgang Schuessel has only to gaze from his
window at the creamy Hapsburg palaces to know that the tumult of
history is no stranger to this town. But seldom has a modern
Austrian leader been as lonely as he is, or as angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to bring this government down from the
outside,'' the conservative Austrian chancellor said in an
interview. ``We stand firm, a small, independent country. Isolation
may last days, weeks or even one year, but we are not going to come
crawling and asking for favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacket off, bow tie, as ever, on, Schuessel looked indignant, a
man much maligned in a quaint country of comfortable cafes that
scarcely looks like a danger to Europe or the world.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Austria's isolation lies in Schuessel's decision
this month to form a coalition government with the Freedom Party of
Joerg Haider, a right-wing populist who has made isolated, later
regretted, statements praising aspects of Hitler's rule. The
European Union downgraded its relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   This decision by 14 governments of the European Union against
the 15th member has provoked a furious debate about the meaning of
national sovereignty in a unifying Europe and about whether the
demands of what appears to be an emerging new international order
that its proponents say is based on morality can take precedence
over the democratic expression of a people's will.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly referring to France and Germany, the two countries most
vehement in their denunciation of him, Schuessel asked, ``Is this
the start of some new procedure that two big states tell other
European Union members what governments they should have?''
</P>
<P>
   In elections last October, Haider's Freedom Party took 27
percent of the vote, fractionally more than Schuessel's People
Party. The coalition, which ended 30 years of increasingly stalled
Social Democratic-led government, has 104 seats in the 183-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The untransparent, unfair and counterproductive methods used
against us are unacceptable,'' Schuessel said. ``The European Union
took six months to impose the first timid sanctions on Slobodan
Milosevic. And yet in three days, it imposes sanctions on a member
of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who spent five years as foreign minister and so
knows all the ministers who have now turned against him, continued:
``I did not take Haider's past statements lightly and I would never
have formed this government without a strong and credible apology
from him. I would not have done this if I did not feel I could now
trust Haider. Watch us. There will be no shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Schuessel's assurances, his invitations to one and all
to visit Vienna and his joint statement with Haider on the eve of
the government's formation promising an Austria in which
``xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism'' have no place, France and
Germany have kept up a steady verbal assault.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has
accused Schuessel of taking ``a false route,'' and French President
Jacques Chirac has spoken of an Austrian ``rupture'' of the
European Union's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements have reflected a growing determination to turn
a union that was long essentially a trade bloc into an ever closer
political community with some aspects of a federal state, one bound
by a shared determination to ensure that Europe puts its terrible
20th century firmly behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden acceleration of Europe's push for integration has
polarized the Continent, prompting widespread enthusiasm most
frequently articulated by French intellectuals and uneasiness in
some, mainly conservative quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with the German weekly Die Zeit,
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said the
principles applied in Austria would also apply in Italy, if
necessary. ``Europe would have to intervene if neo-fascists were
again sitting at the Cabinet table. We cannot allow ourselves to
lower the standards we have set.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder was referring to the fact that the rightist National
Alliance led by Gianfranco Fini joined a government in 1994,
setting off an indignant reaction in Italy. Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Fini was not Haider and accused the German
chancellor of a ``superficial, unjustified and arbitrary''
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, a political and legal minefield has been opened.
Schuessel, 54, said, ``We need procedures, we need transparency, we
need rules of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Several European ministers advised him to reconsider his
decision to ally with Haider, Schuessel said. But he received no
prior warning of the European sanctions, which include a freeze on
bilateral relations and a refusal to receive Austrian ambassadors
at anything above ``technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, reflecting its ambitions, the European Union revised
its treaties to allow the sanctioning of member states in which
there are ``serious and persistent'' breaches of principles of
liberty, democracy and respect for human rights. Nobody has accused
Austria of any such transgressions, let alone persistent ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider's past reference to Nazi concentration camps as
``punishment camps,'' his praise of Hitler's labor policies and his
party's racist anti-immigration electoral posters have awakened
ghosts that Europe is determined to suppress, even if Haider has
never passed from words to deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel contrasted the European reaction with that of the
Clinton administration, whose approach he described as
``reasonable, moderate, positive and showing an understanding that
what matters are deeds.'' He said he had spoken more than once with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The United States briefly withdrew its ambassador and registered
its distaste for Haider's party, but has not imposed any punitive
measures. Schuessel said his government was determined to meet
certain ``American benchmarks'' laid down to measure progress on
issues like compensating Nazi-era slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of immigration, the chancellor said the Freedom
Party had been obliged to drop the demands of some of its members
that there be ``zero immigration'' and that Austria would continue,
as it had in recent years, to restrict immigrants to a quota of
about 10,000 a year, plus about 10,000 seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our posture is to be open in a limited way,'' he said. ``The
United States is a land of immigration, but it is a huge continent.
Austria is a tiny country and cannot be a land of immigrants in
that way. This has nothing to do with xenophobia. It is merely a
practical point of view.''

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE INVISIBLE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   If there is a political issue that has stirred young people in
America in recent years, it is the exploitation of child labor
overseas. College students have organized to ensure that their
university's athletic wear is not sewn by children. Elementary
school classes have petitioned Disney and Nike to keep children out
of their factories. Because of consumer clout and the importance of
reputation to American manufacturers, child labor in their
factories overseas has indeed diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of child labor, however, goes far beyond the tennis
shoe. A quarter-billion children 14 and under work worldwide.
UNICEF estimates that fewer than 1 in 20 make goods for export _
and those who do are the most fortunate working children. The vast
majority are employed in far more harmful occupations. Children in
agriculture are poisoned by pesticides. Prostitutes get AIDS.
Miners and glassworkers inhale dangerous substances. Shoe shiners
and gum sellers are at the mercy of the streets. Domestic servants
live in isolation and suffer beatings and sexual abuse. Millions of
children in South Asia are sold by their parents into bonded labor
to work off family debts. American consumers are right to insist
that the goods we buy are not made by exploited children. But these
efforts will backfire if children kicked out of these factories
drift to more hazardous occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Helping children in these dangerous jobs _ where they are
isolated and invisible, and have no champions overseas _ is far
more complex than keeping them out of factories. Fortunately, the
Clinton administration is taking a sophisticated and constructive
approach. Earlier this month the White House proposed doubling
Washington's spending to fight child labor. The child labor
division of the International Labor Organization, which is based in
Geneva, would get $45 million next year, up from $30 million this
year and only $3 million three years ago. Washington is now by far
the group's largest and most influential donor. An additional $55
million would go to U.S. programs overseas. Both efforts would
attempt to provide the most effective antidote to child labor _
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of child labor occurs in places with high
levels of rural poverty and lax legal enforcement. Virtually every
country bans hazardous child labor and most underage labor. In most
nations, however, poor enforcement leaves children to be exploited
by employers _ who often prefer to hire children because they are
cheaper and more docile workers than adults. But economic
development and effective law enforcement are not likely any time
soon. For now, the best way to reduce child labor is to make
primary education cheaper, better and more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Most children who work either have no school nearby or cannot
afford to buy uniforms and textbooks and pay school fees. The
education available is often so terrible that parents do not
believe it worthwhile to send their children to school and forsake
the few dollars a month they could earn.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO's flagship program, in Bangladesh, works with the
government, manufacturers and citizens' groups to establish special
schools for children who worked in garment factories. Their
families receive a small stipend to keep them in school. About
10,000 children have attended these new schools, and child labor in
the garment industry has dropped sharply since the program began.
</P>
<P>
   Much child labor would be prevented if governments emphasized
basic education for all. Countries that keep children in school,
like Sri Lanka, have relatively low levels of child labor. But many
poor nations are actually cutting education budgets and raising
school fees, in part because they have overwhelming foreign debts.
They, and the nations that hold that debt, are fueling a cycle of
poverty and condemning children not only to misery later, but
misery now.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the

   Baryshnikov practices his modern moves in the seclusion of an
exotic nature preserve
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Passy
</P>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There are 7,500 acres of wide open space at
the White Oak Plantation _ and not an inch seems wasted.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to receive an invitation to this posh
retreat, just north of Jacksonville, you can spend your day however
you choose. Canoeing on a secluded lake. Bowling in a private
two-lane alley. Even watching rhinos make love.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you're Mikhail Baryshnikov, you can dance as long as your
52-year-old body will allow.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a little too bizarre _ the world's most heralded ballet
star of the last quarter-century in this remote northern Florida
paradise, a corporate hideaway-turned-cultural oasis where the rich
and famous congregate and rare breeds of animals laze in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live here all year-round,'' says the Russian-born
Baryshnikov, known as Misha to virtually all the plantation's 350
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baryshnikov has a house in suburban New York, he
escapes to White Oak whenever he can. He's here for some of the
same reasons that have drawn other big-name celebrities, from
President Clinton to Colin Powell to Julia Roberts. He plays a
little golf on the nine-hole course. He rides horses with his four
children. He travels the grounds in his lovingly restored 1957
Buick.
</P>
<P>
   But White Oak is far more than Baryshnikov's favorite vacation
spot: It's also where he comes to work. The sprawling plantation is
the birthplace of the company he founded 10 years ago: the White
Oak Dance Project. The troupe, which performs two programs this
week at the Kravis Center, has been at the heart of his transition
from ballet legend to modern-dance impresario.
</P>
<P>
   A MACHINE WAITING TO MOVE
</P>
<P>
   White Oak, even more than New York or Russia, is Baryshnikov's
spiritual home.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense as much when you make the long drive from the
small town of Yulee _ population 19,000 _ through the dirt roads
that lead to the plantation. His studio sits in the most clustered
part of the property, next to a series of buildings that house
everything from conference facilities to a state-of-the-art gym. An
oversized wooden structure that blends into the background of
countless pine trees _ ironically, there are few white oaks _ it's
far larger than the typical urban dance space. The windows let in a
pure, cool light one associates more with New England than North
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in baggy sweats, Baryshnikov is already waiting alone in
the studio a little after 10 a.m. Regardless of the repeated
surgeries he's endured to fix what a three-decade career has
wrought, his 5-foot-7-inch torso remains like that of a
bantamweight champion, all compressed strength, a machine waiting
to move. His dog, Maggie, a doormat of a boxer, stays constantly at
his side _ until the dancers arrive and he directs her into a
corner with a sharp command. ``She was chasing a deer the other
day, and she's not herself,'' Baryshnikov says by way of apology
for her sluggish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov's seven-member company rarely spends much time at
White Oak anymore, although he remains a frequent visitor. The
current rehearsal period, which started in late January and runs up
to the Kravis engagement, is the longest the ensemble has been at
the plantation in years. But there's something about each visit
that clearly feeds the company's soul. Unlike New York, where so
many dance groups are based, White Oak is a place with no agenda,
no politics, no spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if I would have had enough patience with
New York,'' Baryshnikov says, mulling the question of whether he
could have started White Oak elsewhere. ``New York doesn't need
another dance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does White Oak necessarily need Baryshnikov and the White
Oak Dance Project. But there's a reason for their presence.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation is the brainchild of the late Howard Gilman, a
New York arts patron who struck up a friendship with Baryshnikov
right after he defected to the West in 1974 and became the ballet
world's poster boy. Not so incidentally, Gilman was also heir to
the Gilman Paper Co., based near White Oak in St. Marys, Ga. The
family had owned the 7,500-acre North Florida estate since 1938 but
considered it little more than a rustic hunting camp. When Gilman
took over the company, he envisioned the plantation as something
else. In the '70s, he began turning the property into one of the
world's most private play yards _ complete with 15 residences,
pools, game rooms and movie theater _ to woo potential clients. He
also complemented that mission with a conservation program that's
the envy of many a first-class zoo, protecting about 400 animals,
including giraffes, tigers, okapis, cheetahs, wolves and Florida
panthers. ``Most guests think we're like a Jurassic Park,'' says
Ricky Bridges, a White Oak supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOCAL VIEW
</P>
<P>
   Ask the locals what they think of White Oak, and you'll get a
range of responses. Those in high places are unabashedly
supportive. ``It is wonderful,'' says John Mead, an active member
of the chamber of commerce who owns a frame and trophy shop in town
and has been to the plantation for special events. Since entrance
is strictly by invitation, he secures a few guest spots and sells
them at a premium of $75 to benefit a local charity. ``That was a
bargain,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Others maintain a sense of skepticism about the place _ and all
the powerful folks who pass through it. ``A lot of people come
here, kings and all that crap,'' says Trisha Gose, who runs the
Down Home Market just a couple of blocks from the downtown traffic
light (yes, there's only one). She claims a girlfriend of hers who
works at White Oak even scored a marriage proposal from a member of
some visiting royal family.
</P>
<P>
   But do the locals know that Baryshnikov is in their back yard?
Some do, some don't. And, sad to say, a few have trouble
recognizing the name. ``It's in the back of my head somewhere,''
says the clerk at the Holiday Inn Express that sits a few miles
from the plantation's gate. Perhaps that is part of the reason the
notoriously media-shy Baryshnikov likes to come here. In New York,
he can't walk down a street without being recognized. At White Oak,
he's an unknown _ and with all its creature comforts, he doesn't
have to bother with a trip into town. Nights are often spent in the
company of the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch some stupid TV shows,'' he says between bites of a
cheeseburger during lunch at the plantation's small cafeteria. ``We
were watching ``The Sopranos'' the other day. Fabulous, fabulous
show.''
</P>
<P>
   It's as if Baryshnikov has the run of the place. Ask the guy
with the clipboard at the entrance if you might be able to see some
of the animals after visiting the dance studio and he says, ``If
you can get with Misha, he might hook you up.'' Other employees
talk of the dance legend as if he were family _ which he
practically is considering the time Baryshnikov has spent here with
his four children (one by former flame, actress Jessica Lange).
``My children grew up here, they started to swim, they started to
ride horses here,'' Baryshnikov says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life of privilege _ all White Oak visitors stay for free
_ and Baryshnikov must sense it as he asks an attendant to arrange
for a group outing or has a golf pro give him pointers on his
swing. (''It's my time, instead of going to the psychiatrist,'' he
jokes of the latter.) But there's also a sense that what he has at
White Oak, he's been given through friendship and loyalty. ``He was
the closest friend. He was like older brother,'' Baryshnikov says
of Gilman, speaking as always with a thick Russian accent. ``He
knew how much I loved the place.''
</P>
<P>
   AN HONEST PERSPECTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, who died in 1998, must have also known that Baryshnikov
needed space and isolation to pursue his adventurous, full-throttle
foray into modern dance. And his foundation's commitment remains as
strong today. When Baryshnikov started White Oak, it followed a
nine-year stint as artistic director of the American Ballet
Theatre. It was Baryshnikov's last great run as a ballet dancer,
even though he used the company as a platform to branch into
contemporary work. The more snide critics suggested the move was
because he could no longer handle the physical stress of ballet.
But Baryshnikov insisted it was because modern work offered a more
honest perspective. (''Mannered art'' is how he once described
ballet.) White Oak, which he began in 1990 as a partnership with
``enfant terrible'' choreographer Mark Morris, would be his new
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gilman) said, why don't you guys come, and I will build a
studio for you,'' Baryshnikov recalls of the company's origins.
(That first makeshift dance space was replaced in a few years with
the current elaborate studio, which even Baryshnikov admits is ``a
little too big.'') In a way, the idea harked back to the earliest
days of modern dance, when pioneer Ted Shawn brought his charges
into the woods and experimented with the concept of movement as an
earthly expression. Baryshnikov also liked the inherent isolation:
Free from the distractions of the city, his dancers, an all-star
group of professionals in their 20s and 30s from other modern and
ballet companies, would become a true unit. ``The idea was to get
together ... have fun, have some hard work and a lot of bonding,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the concept remains basically that. What's
changed, however, is the company's reputation and outlook. White
Oak is no longer the new kid on the modern block; it's an
established powerhouse, one of the few arts organizations of any
kind that doesn't have to seek nonprofit status to pay its way. (Of
course, there's Gilman's largesse to thank partially for that.) And
its scope of choreographers has expanded well beyond Morris,
although he continues to remain an important contributor. Among the
major names Baryshnikov has wooed to White Oak are Lar Lubovitch
and Paul Taylor, but lesser-known, young choreographers are also
part of the mix. (Baryshnikov has toyed with the idea of doing a
piece by Lake Worth's Demetrius Klein, a recent Guggenheim fellow;
for now, he's planning a joint program with Klein's company in
Hollywood, Fla., this spring.)
</P>
<P>
   In essence, White Oak is something that modern dance has never
truly had: a repertory company with emphasis on the current scene.
``I rarely, rarely bring back (works). It's much more interesting
to do something new,'' Baryshnikov says. And it has something even
rarer to the genre: the power of celebrity. Although decisions
about programming and touring are made by the entire group of
dancers, it would be naive to think this company would be where it
is today without Baryshnikov, who by his mere presence has made
modern dance acceptable to mass audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that idea has started to wear thin in recent years _
and the company is having to raise money for a project in the fall,
a first in its history. Even the Kravis dates have yet to sell out,
a marked contrast to Baryshnikov's first visit to the West Palm
Beach center (with Twyla Tharp) in 1993. But to Baryshnikov's
credit, he's stuck to his vision, plugging a few audience-friendly
works into the mix, but refusing to shy away from more daring
material. ``If the audience is interested in dance, they will get
there somehow,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Yvonne Rainer, one of the choreographers recently
invited to the North Florida studio to create a piece for the
group. A member of the avant-garde Judson Dance Theater in the
'60s, Rainer left dance in 1975 to pursue a filmmaking career. What
drew her back to the stage? Baryshnikov, naturally. ``I said to
Misha that more people will see this dance than who saw 15 years'
worth of my work from 1960 to 1975,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   PATIENCE NOT A VIRTUE
</P>
<P>
   But a day at Baryshnikov's studio, which has also been used by
other prominent dance groups, is not a star-studded affair. It's
the business of dance as usual. There is no company class per se,
just a quick, no-nonsense warm-up. Whether at the barre or standing
on the floor, Baryshnikov relays a few movement ideas to his
company, and the members respond accordingly. There is nothing
high-pressured about his manner _ he asks rather than orders.
``Shall we do the 'rond de jambe' ?'' he says at one point,
referring to the circular movement of the legs. But with that
sullen stare _ his blue eyes seemed burned into their sockets _
it's obvious he doesn't suffer many mistakes. Patience is not one
of his signature virtues. ``Hey, what's cooking in there?'' he says
sharply when a couple of dancers take too long during a bathroom
break.
</P>
<P>
   After the warm-up, Baryshnikov freely hands over the company to
Rainer, who runs through her challenging 45-minute work, a dense
mix of abstract movement, death-bed speeches and the occasional
running in circles. In keeping with White Oak's democratic design,
Baryshnikov shares the stage equally with five other dancers, at
one point jostling with them in a scene that could have been lifted
from a New York subway during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov's star presence does pose a challenge, Rainer
admits: Do you ignore it or acknowledge it? For the most part, she
chooses the former. But she does give him an extraordinary solo, a
slow-movement section in drag that suits the thought-provoking
dancer he's become. And she tosses in a revealing line for one of
the other dancers, who points to Baryshnikov and asks the audience
if they're looking for him: In perfect post-modern fashion, she
subverts the crowd's expectations into part of the theatrical
experience. Rainer explains it all by offering this apt summation
of White Oak: ``It's not the Misha show, although it is the Misha
show.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STUDIO IS THE STUDIO
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation not lost on the dancers, either. Many can
recall their feelings of humility when they were contacted by
Baryshnikov about working with the company. But the feelings don't
last: He's just a man, after all. ``I had the image of who he was,
but then I met him, and he was so personable and easy-going and
relaxed. I just immediately forgot,'' says Rosalynde LeBlanc, the
newest member of the company. ``He seems to create an atmosphere
where everybody evens themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the opportunity to come to White Oak affect the
process, the dancers insist. Oh, there are the not-so-small details
of staying at a private getaway, including being fed gourmet meals
(tonight's dinner features homemade venison sausage, roast Cornish
game hen and a honey pecan tart) and having a staff on call. The
dancers joke that they leave the plantation just so they can remind
themselves what it's like to open their wallets. But the studio is
the studio. ``The time you spend ... is spent with the
choreographer's mind, and that's true whether it's a New York
studio or here,'' says Emily Coates, who left a promising career
with the New York City Ballet to dance for White Oak. ``These other
things are just this added luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day draws to a close, the luxury indeed becomes an
afterthought. Baryshnikov is now just another observer in the
studio, watching the group rehearse a different Rainer work, to be
performed later this year. He is quiet, almost melancholic,
reflecting that he would like to join the company in the piece,
except ``there's a few elements which my knee wouldn't allow.'' But
after watching him throughout the long morning, where he also
rehearsed John Jasperse's hyperkinetic ``See Through Knot'' without
breaking into a sweat, it's hard to believe he's past his prime.
During lunch, he offers a blunt assessment of what it means to be a
52-year-old dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not things to do with the physical,'' he says. ``I can
still dance with them in difficult pieces ... It's an internal
realization. You have to prepare your exit somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   At White Oak, Baryshnikov has been able to dance _ and think.
It's all too easy to see the plantation as a place where an aging
former ballet star gets the royal treatment. But the remote setting
has clearly freed Baryshnikov's mind and, in turn, allowed his
still graceful body to work what wonders it can. Here, the final
curtain has been placed on hold.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Mike Buddie played with a skinny kid in Class A
baseball seven years ago, so frail, Buddie recalled, that it seemed
he might break in half if a runner slid into him.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly fragile youngster has been at work again in this
last off-season, adopting another weight-training program _ this to
increase the strength in his legs and his middle body, his physical
core. Buddie laughed at his memory of Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter,
compared with what Jeter looks like now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from being Kevin Garnett to Shaquille O'Neal,'' said
Buddie, referring to the CD-thin forward from the Minnesota
Timberwolves and the mountain range of a center for the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has gained 18 pounds since the end of last season, pushing
his weight to 203 pounds, but the increase is not apparent in the
usual manner. It's a baseball cliche to arrive in spring training
with massive biceps, with a chest and neck muscles puffed up, and
Jeter has worked out his upper body, too. But he doesn't have that
extra-large look. He is still lean, but just appears stronger, in
the upper, middle and lower portions of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get stronger,'' Jeter said. ``I'm not trying to
win any body-building contests.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Manager Joe Torre said: ``Oh, wow, he's gotten big. He's
gotten big, and he's been able to maintain his flexibility, which
is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's agent, Casey Close, had long encouraged the shortstop to
consider the training regimen taught and tendered at the
International Performance Institute in Bradenton, Fla., less than
an hour from here. Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra developed his
strength program there, actually living at the institute one
off-season, and now dozens of baseball players and athletes from
other sports have begun working out there.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared to begin his off-season training in earnest, Jeter, 25,
visited the facility last December with Russ Orr, the Yankees'
strength and conditioning coordinator for the minor leagues. In
consultation with the Yankees' staff, Jeter added elements of the
institute's program to his own, going through them on a daily basis
at the Yankees' minor league facility here, aided by Orr.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's going to do is help you through the course of a
season,'' Jeter said. ``When you lift weights, you get stronger,
but the season is so long, you want to be as strong in September
and October as you were at the beginning of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who weighed 195 at the start of 1999, lost about 10
pounds during the season, and felt weaker. He wants to maintain his
weight better, to maintain his long-term stamina. This off-season,
he began training his lower body, his legs, for the first time.
Some of that training is standard leg work, squat-lifting free
weights.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts, adopted from what the institute emphasizes, work to
increase the explosive movements. A sandbag weighing anywhere from
15 to 30 pounds is placed on Jeter's shoulders, like a collar
around his neck, and he lunges forward, to the sides, backward,
repeating the movements over and over, to increase the strength in
his legs.
</P>
<P>
   The results become apparent particularly in August and
September, said Luke Wilcox, a Yankees outfielder who has worked
out at the institute for the last three off-seasons. The baseball
season tends to sap leg strength, and suddenly, Wilcox said, he has
found the spring in his legs in those last months to chase down a
distant fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you overlook your legs in terms of playing,''
Jeter said. ``People go and lift and try to get big arms and a big
chest, and they sort of forget about their legs. This year, I'm
trying to use my legs more when I hit, and hopefully, it'll help.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has also concentrated on increasing the strength in what
is referred to by strength coaches as the core, the abdomen and
flanks, the area that connects the upper torso to the hips. To do
this, he will lean against a physioball _ imagine a superstrong
beach ball _ with weights in each hand, and as he moves, the middle
body is forced to provide the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, took Jeter on a
tour of Yankee Stadium right after Jeter signed with the team out
of high school, and remembered Jeter being frail. ``He's so much
stronger,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   For a hitter, additional strength can translate into more bat
speed; more bat speed means the hitter can wait extra milliseconds
to swing. That's more time to determine if the pitch is going to be
in the strike zone, more time to identify whether it is a slider
moving outside or a fastball running high, more time to decide
whether to swing at all, or whether to attack.
</P>
<P>
   And once Jeter hits the ball, the additional bat speed means he
will hit the ball harder and longer. Buddie, a right-handed
pitcher, has been shagging fly balls during Jeter's batting
practices for almost eight years now, and figures that he is
driving the ball an additional 30 to 40 feet, ``at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter rarely used to drive the ball to left field in batting
practice, Buddie said, but Jeter has become an all-field hitter as
he has gained strength and experience. The other day, Jeter took
batting practice with Tino Martinez and Darryl Strawberry on a
spacious practice field at the Yankees' minor-league facility, in
less than ideal conditions for long-distance driving: a batting
practice pitcher throwing the ball at diminished speeds, a
crosswind and Jeter's timing at the plate not being optimal at this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he launched towering shots over the fence in left
and left-center field, hammered the ball against the black screen
that extends some 20 feet above the fence in dead center, and
reached the fences in right-center and right repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   What the others have noticed here this spring, since Jeter began
the program to strengthen the muscles in his middle body, is how
much more explosively he is turning on the ball. Imagine a rubber
band in three segments: With the newly developed core, it's as if
Jeter has strengthened the middle part of that rubber band, the
part that twists and then releases explosively.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, Jeter's home run potential was
talked about in terms of 15 to 20 a season; last spring, those
estimates changed to 25 a year. Now, after slugging 24 home runs in
1999 _ and not at the expense of his batting average, which
increased to .349 _ reasonable baseball scouts and executives tend
to talk about Jeter hitting 30 to 40 home runs a year, even while
remaining an opposite-field hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, the San Diego outfielder with 3,067 hits in his
career, stopped at second base during the 1998 World Series and
told the right-handed-hitting Jeter to just keep doing what he has
always done: lining the ball to right-center and right field. Jeter
is cognizant that this has made him successful, and he has been
careful not to stray from his basic approach. But he is trying to
refine what he does well, through strength training.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee pitcher David Cone said: ``He could stay in New York and
do a thousand endorsement deals. He chooses to stay in Tampa and
work on his game. He's clearly not satisfied with his success; he
wants more.''

EDITORIAL: TREATMENT OF ADVANCED BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Women who suffer from advanced, intractable breast cancer have
been confronted with discouraging developments over the past year.
Thousands had hoped that, after all else failed, an arduous
procedure known as a bone marrow transplant might save them. But
four major clinical trials reported last May found that women with
advanced breast cancer who were given bone marrow transplants fared
no better than women given conventional chemotherapy. This month, a
well-publicized study in South Africa that appeared to show some
benefit of the bone marrow transplant was acknowledged to be a
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Even discouraging results from well-conducted studies are
helpful in the fight against the disease. This is particularly true
in the case of the controversial transplants. For years now,
desperately ill women have sought out this therapy _ which involves
removing some of the marrow, hitting the patient with high doses of
toxic drugs and then replacing the marrow _ even though there has
been no scientific evidence that it is effective. Under pressure
from patients, hospitals and lawmakers, insurers have been paying
for these very costly and difficult treatments, with the result
that few women have been willing to participate in clinical studies
in which some would be assigned to a control group and get
conventional treatments. In the last decade, as many as 30,000
breast cancer patients may have received bone marrow transplants
while only 1,000 participated in studies designed to test whether
the procedure works.
</P>
<P>
   The desire of very sick patients to try even an unproven therapy
is understandable. But had more women been enrolled in the studies,
answers about the effectiveness of the treatment might have been
achieved earlier. The resources spent on this treatment might have
been better directed to other approaches. The National Breast
Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group, concluded that this treatment
does not benefit women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is reason to continue with more clinical trials
because there may be subsets of patients for whom this treatment is
effective. Recently, Aetna/US Healthcare, a prominent insurer,
decided to stop covering bone marrow transplants for breast cancer
patients, though other insurers will still do so. But Aetna will
continue to pay for the treatment if it is provided in a federally
approved clinical trial. Other companies, including a coalition of
major insurers in New Jersey, are agreeing to pay for experimental
cancer treatments in clinical trials. That is a sound step toward
finding answers for breast cancer and other diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ In Venezuela, there is baseball royalty.
Then there is Melvin Mora, king of kings.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, the reserve infielder/outfielder who is one of the more
intriguing position players reporting to the Mets training camp,
has only 11 major-league hits, but he is the man of the moment in
his homeland. The most famous Venezuelan in baseball history
recently crowned him as such.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Concepcion, the shortstop who starred for the Cincinnati
Reds from 1970 to 1988, is revered at home and honored by the
current generation of Venezuelan players. Six of the nation's
major-leaguers, including the Mets' Edgardo Alfonzo, wear
Concepcion's No. 13. So imagine Mora's joy _ and shock, and pride _
when Concepcion came to a winter league game in Caracas, pulled him
aside and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to see one guy. I've been playing baseball all my
life, and I never saw anybody play like you. You play in New York,
but you're not scared. I've never seen a kid play with such
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora, who was playing for Magallanes, was amazed that Concepcion
even talked to him. Before Mora could ask for a picture, the legend
produced his own camera and said he wanted a photo with the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `You're my favorite player,''' Mora said recently
in a telephone interview from his mother's house in Valencia,
Venezuela. ``I don't know why he told me that, because I just
started my career.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mora started on a big stage. His fifth hit (in his 31st and
final at-bat of the regular season) sparked the game-winning rally
against Pittsburgh on the final scheduled day of the regular
season, sending the Mets to a one-game showdown against the
Cincinnati Reds that secured the wild-card spot. He played in all
six games of the National League Championship Series against
Atlanta, slamming his first career home run, batting .429 (6 for
14), stealing two bases, throwing out three runners and becoming a
cult hero.
</P>
<P>
   Mora planned to rest before joining the Magallanes team in
December, but he received such an overwhelming reception that he
quickly changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me like a king,'' Mora said. ``I'm not a king, but
they respect me because I play hard. How I played in the playoffs
in New York, that's how I've always played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from New York, they saw me at the airport and
they called my name: `We want you to play! When are you going to
play?' What could I tell them? No? Three days later, I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora led the team in hitting at .333, and his performance
increased his fame. In December, when floods ravaged Venezuela,
Mora's mother watched on television as an orphaned boy claimed to
be a relative of the family's. Mora suggested he might adopt the
boy and found out the two were distantly related, but a closer
relative took custody.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of winter. Everybody wanted him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin was the spark plug of our ballclub,'' said the former
major-leaguer Cesar Cedeno, a coach for Magallanes. ``As Melvin
goes, so goes Magallanes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gibbons, who managed Mora at Class AAA Norfolk (Va.) last
season, said: ``He's in the middle of everything good. When he
first got called up, we were leading the league. There was
definitely a big drop-off without him, because he was the spark
plug.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Mets, there is no place for Mora to start every day. His
best chance for playing time is as a replacement for Derek Bell if
the right fielder struggles early, or for Rickey Henderson on the
left fielder's days off. Mora is not an accomplished base stealer
and the Mets do not consider him a potential leadoff hitter. But he
could be valuable, if anyone could figure out exactly what he
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said he thinks of Mora first as a
utility infielder, a lonely position on the Mets. At the same time,
Valentine praised Mora's versatility and professionalism, and
called him his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played a lot in the major leagues, so it's hard to
start saying what he is at the major-league level,'' Valentine
said. ``But he's a talented player _ he plays both sides of the
game, offense and defense, and he does a lot of things better than
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an extra man, he is probably underutilized. And as an
everyday player, he'd be subjected to a lot of scrutiny. So he's an
interesting character.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips said that Mora could be a
potential starter, just at a different position each day, the way
Tony Phillips used to play second and third and left and right. ``I
could envision his role at some point developing into that,'' the
general manager said. ``To start the season, it's a little unclear
still.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who know Mora, one thing is certain: he will make an
impact. Mora is resourceful. His father died when he was 6 years
old, and to escape poverty the boy tried boxing and soccer. He took
up baseball at 15 because he realized there was more money in the
game. Mora impressed scouts, but his mother _ who paid no attention
to baseball _ told him not to sign a professional contract; she did
not want him away for seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston Astros ran an academy near his home, and
eventually the money was too much for Mora to resist. He was
already 19 when he signed for a $10,000 bonus in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those people that says, `It's myself against the
world,''' said Andres Reiner, who directs the Astros' Venezuelan
program. ``You have to have this real special feel for surviving,
and he has that. You can put him in an airplane with a parachute
and drop him on the North Pole, and he would survive. He is one of
those guys, and you have to respect those kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora spent seven seasons in the Astros' system, partly because
he needed to learn so many positions. But at none of those stops
did Mora bat .300, hit 10 home runs or steal 25 bases, and the
5-foot-10, 180-pound utility player had the makings of a Class AAA
lifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have a lot of money in him, he's not 6-foot-4 with
an Adonis body, and he doesn't have a real position because of his
versatility,'' said Dave Engle, a Mets minor league manager who
managed Mora in the Astros' system. ``He's the prototypical guy
that's a quality player in Triple A. He's going to have to be
clutch, and he's going to have to keep knocking on the door,
wedging his foot in when he has a little crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed up after 1997, Mora signed with a team in the Chinese
Professional Baseball League in 1998. But when he batted .335, he
encountered trouble. He was approached by men he suspected were
gamblers, and they were not happy with his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, they don't pay you for hitting, they pay you for
striking out,'' Mora said. ``I know they were talking about
gambling, because I was hitting pretty good. I told them, `I don't
speak Chinese,' and they ran away. I said, `I've got to get out of
here.' I left.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora contacted Alfonzo's brother, Edgar, a Mets' minor league
coach. That led to a job at Class AAA Norfolk. As a nonroster
invitee to spring training last year, Mora hit .421 and was the
last player cut. But his door had opened, even though he wouldn't
burst through it until October. Mora liked what he saw on the other
side, and now he wants to experience more of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know me, and I don't have as much pressure as before,''
Mora said. ``Last year I was invited to spring training. Now, I'm
on the roster and waiting for the chance to play every day. They
know what I can do.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Waterman, who wrote books about hiking in the New England
mountains and the preservation of their purity, died on Feb. 6. He
was 67 and lived in East Corinth, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman climbed to the top of Mount Lafayette, a 5,249-foot
peak in the White Mountains in northern New Hampshire, and sat down
to die in below-zero temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   He had sent letters to friends telling them what he planned to
do and where to find his body. Five friends retrieved the body on
Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived with such intensity that he couldn't sustain it
anymore,'' said Rebecca Oreskes, a friend who works in the White
Mountain National Forest. ``He talked to us all about not wanting
to grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterman's death ended an accomplished life, but one with many
abrupt changes of direction. At 16, he was a professional jazz
pianist, and later was a speechwriter for three presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, a year after his second marriage, to Laura Johnson, the
couple moved to Vermont to live in a cabin that had no electricity,
plumbing or telephone, and was a mile from the nearest road.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dickerman, a friend of the Watermans who also writes about
the New England outdoors, said the couple were avid mountain
climbers. They had scaled all 48 peaks in New Hampshire that are
4,000 feet or higher, ``in the winter, from all four sides,''
Dickerman said.
</P>
<P>
   They also wrote four books seeking to add historical context and
philosophical perspective to their wilderness activities. These
were ``Backwoods Ethics: Environmental Issues for Hikers and
Campers (Countryman Press, 1979), ``Forest and Crag'' (Appalachian
Mountain Books, 1989), ``Yankee Rock and Ice'' (Stackpole Books,
1993), and ``Wilderness Ethics'' (Countryman Press, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Another book, ``Mountain Tales: Tall and True,'' containing 20
pieces, half fact and half fiction, is scheduled to be published
this year by Mountaineers Books in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Watermans' commentary was barbed, like the
condemnation of hikers who bring their cell phones to remote,
pristine forests. And some of the commentary was quite practical,
like their 11 pieces of advice for winter climbing. One example:
``Don't count on following your footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waterman said that she and her husband tried not to preach,
but instead emphasized ``the spirit of how people should come to
the mountains.'' He expressed great disappointment to his wife in
his failure to persuade others to leave the mountains unspoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman spent most of his life in New Haven, Conn., where his
father taught physics at Yale University until being appointed as
the first director of the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Waterman attended the Foote School in New Haven, the
Shady Hill School in Cambridge, Mass., and the Sidwell Friends
School in Washington. On vacations, he would hike and canoe in
remote parts of New England with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In his teens he began appearing in jazz clubs in the Washington
area as a pianist with the Riverboat Trio. He married before
entering George Washington University; by the time he graduated he
had three sons.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman then found work as a legislative staff aide and
speechwriter, working mainly for the Senate Minority Policy
Committee. A staunch Republican, he wrote speeches for Presidents
Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. Waterman later became a speechwriter
for General Electric Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Watermans were married in 1972, after meeting while rock
climbing near New Paltz, N.Y. She is the daughter of Thomas H.
Johnson, who was chairman of the Lawrenceville School in
Lawrenceville, N.J., and edited the letters and poetry of Emily
Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Watermans homesteaded on 27 acres near East Corinth, a
village in east-central Vermont. Though they had no modern
conveniences, their living room included a Steinway grand piano
that had been lugged in piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``They purposefully created a really amazing life for
themselves,'' said Helen Whybrow, editor in chief of Countryman
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Waterman's sons from his first marriage, which ended in
divorce, were lost to him in separate incidents. In 1973, William,
the oldest, wrote an enigmatic letter to his father saying he was
going on an extended trip. He was never heard from again and is
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   John, the youngest son, died in 1978 while trying to climb Mount
McKinley in Alaska with grossly inadequate provisions.
</P>
<P>
   James, the surviving son, lives in Longmont, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The summit of Mount Lafayette where Waterman died was like a
second home to him and his wife. They carefully created paths to
guide hikers away from rare alpine flowers. Nearby on another
ridge, he had built a cairn, a conical heap of stones built as a
monument or landmark. Inside the cairn he put a pair of his son
John's hiking shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waterman said she could not explain her husband's decision
to kill himself. ``He stayed with us as long as he could,'' she
said.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN ALL OF AMERICA SKATED ON GOLDEN POND 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Ken Morrow remembered how his U.S. Olympic
teammates jumped over the boards to celebrate Mike Eruzione's
go-ahead goal against the Soviet Union, but Morrow, the bearded
defenseman who would go on to win four consecutive Stanley Cups
with the New York Islanders, stared at the scoreboard clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike scored with exactly 10 minutes to go,'' recalled Morrow,
now the Islanders' pro scouting director. ``I thought how this is
going to be the longest 10 minutes of our lives. The Russians were
capable of scoring five or six goals in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Americans completed their 3-2 upset of the Soviets
on Feb. 22, 1980, in the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, it changed
how U.S. hockey and its players were perceived and appreciated. To
many historians, the ``Miracle on Ice'' was the most memorable
single American sports event of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   That hockey game, like any really historic event, has stood the
true test of time: People remember where they were when they saw it
or heard about it. Wherever they were when the buzzer sounded in
the 8,500-seat Olympic field house, people all over America
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   America had needed something to cheer about. American hostages
in Iran were still being held in the embassy there. Soviet troops
had invaded Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter was threatening an
American boycott of the Olympic Summer Games in Moscow later that
year. The Cold War with what Ronald Reagan would call the ``evil
empire'' was still being fought in the icy intrigue of
international politics.
</P>
<P>
   So this was more than just a hockey game, much more. This game
had not involved merely the provincial pride of, say, a New York
Yankees victory in the World Series or a Chicago Bulls victory for
the pro basketball championship. This was for national honor; for
the Soviets, too. Before the Soviet delegation left Moscow, the
athletes gathered at a Kremlin reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told,'' recalled Slava Fetisov, now a New Jersey
Devils assistant coach but then a rookie Olympic defenseman on the
Soviet team, ```You can lose to anybody but the United States.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected the Soviets to lose. They had won five of six
previous Olympic tournaments. The year before, in a Challenge Cup
series with the National Hockey League All-Stars, the same basic
Soviet team had won two of the three games, including a 6-0 finale.
In a pre-Olympic appearance at Madison Square Garden, the Soviets
had strafed the Americans, 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Many NHL observers considered the Soviets the world's best team
at that time. In contrast, the seventh-seeded Americans, coached by
Herb Brooks (on Olympic leave from the University of Minnesota),
were mostly comprised of college players from Minnesota,
Massachusetts, Michigan and Wisconsin. ``I thought we might win a
bronze,'' Brooks acknowledged later.
</P>
<P>
   In their Olympic opener, the Americans salvaged a 2-2 tie with
third-seeded Sweden on goaltender Jim Craig's 34 saves and
defenseman Bill Baker's goal with 27 seconds left. They then
surprised second-seeded Czechoslovakia, 7-3, before dominating
Norway, 5-1, Romania, 7-2, and West Germany,4-2, to set up the
showdown with the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stand in awe,'' Brooks told his players before the 5
p.m. game that wouldn't be televised until 8 o'clock that Friday
night. ``You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets took a 2-1 lead but with one second remaining in the
first period, center Mark Johnson shot the puck past Vladislav
Tretiak, the tall 27-year-old goaltender with the spiderlike arms
and legs whom some NHL talent appraisers then rated the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking the period had ended, the Soviets skated off, but the
referee called them back for a meaningless face-off. When the
Soviets reappeared, their goaltender was Vladimir Myshkin, the
backup. When the second period began, Myshkin was still the
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   The great Tretiak had been benched by Viktor Tikhonov, the stern
coach who also coached the Central Red Army team in Moscow, the
core of the Soviet roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tikhonov was trying to shoot two birds with one arrow,''
Fetisov recalled. ``To win without Tretiak and to show how smart he
was. He miscalculated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets tied the score, but in the third period the
Americans were changing lines when Buzz Schneider came off early
and Eruzione, hopping over the boards, found himself on a line with
John Harrington and Mark Pavelich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harrington gave me the puck inside the blue line,'' Eruzione
said later. ``I shot, the defenseman screened the goaltender, and
it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ``longest 10 minutes'' that ended with Craig making a
total of 37 saves, the standing-room only crowd kept shouting
``U.S.A., U.S.A.'' and waving American flags. The Soviets, who
would win the 1984 and 1988 gold medals, were in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on,'' Fetisov recalled with a smile, ``Herb Brooks told
me, `I'm glad it wasn't a best of seven.'''
</P>
<P>
   But to win the gold, the Americans had to defeat Finland on
Sunday; if they lost, they would be fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before practice on Saturday,'' recalled Brooks, now the
Pittsburgh Penguins' coach, ``I told them, `You were lucky. You're
too young. You can't pull it off.' Halfway through practice I told
them that again, and after practice I told them that again. I
wanted to get them mad, and I could tell that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were not too young to pull it off, winning, 4-2,
for the gold medal that changed the perception of young American
hockey players. Suddenly the NHL scouts realized they could play.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the Olympians went on to the NHL, but their gold
medals had already inspired a generation of American youngsters
that had been watching television, notably Brian Leetch, Pat
LaFontaine and Tony Amonte. Brooks also went on to the NHL,
coaching the Rangers, the Minnesota North Stars and the Devils, but
as a winning Olympic coach, he was not entitled to a gold medal.
Only the players were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a gold medal, though,'' the coach recalled with a smile.
``Somebody slipped me an extra one.''

DOWNTOWN CRITICS PAN DIALLO LAWYERING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the hallways of the sprawling Manhattan Criminal
Courts Building, lawyers have long made a sport of griping about
judges' decisions, gossiping about their colleagues' performances
and engaging in Monday morning trial quarterbacking. Over the last
two weeks, the focus of courthouse chatter has turned northward, to
the trial of four New York police officers accused of killing
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing all the facts of the case or seeing every moment
of prosecutors' and defense lawyers' performances, the shotgun
opinions of Manhattan lawyers border on speculation. And surely,
the lawyering in Albany is no worse and perhaps better than much of
the lawyering in Downtown Manhattan. It is simply more public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a series of impromptu interviews last week, Manhattan
defense lawyers and some judges contended that the lawyering on
both sides had at times been mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps have had impressive moments, courthouse veterans
said, but prosecutors have lacked passion and defense lawyers have
made amateurish mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, criticism focused on the defense team of Stephen
Worth, John Patten, Steven Brounstein, James Culleton and Bennett
M. Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Worth and Patten first erred, some critics said, by asking
questions of a prosecution witness that allowed her to testify that
she had heard someone say, ``OK, OK, we just want to say this,''
after the shooting. That statement could lead jurors to suspect a
police cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' decision then to call Schrrie Elliot as a defense
witness was ``a rookie mistake,'' critics said. Elliot saw the
shooting but did not want to testify for the defense, and because
of earlier court decisions and her refusal to meet with the defense
lawyers, they did not know exactly what she would say when she took
the stand. Their move violated a cardinal rule of trial lawyering,
critics said: Never ask a question without knowing the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot ended up giving an account that was so potentially
damaging to the officers that the defense team had her declared a
hostile witness and cross-examined her to undermine her
credibility. ``It appears to be a mistake that there is no good
explanation for,'' said David Stern, a Manhattan defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer said it would have been wiser to let the officers
_ and no one else _ tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've got Mother Teresa looking out the window, you
don't need anyone other than the cops,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   And some critics contended that the defense did a poor job
coaching the four officers on their testimony, which the critics
said was sometimes hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers and court officers expressed skepticism about
the officers' account of the first moments of their encounter with
Diallo outside his Bronx apartment building. The men testified that
they had used the words ``please'' and ``sir'' and had identified
themselves as New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police don't talk that way,'' said Frank Rothman, a Manhattan
defense lawyer. ``They don't speak that way in that neighborhood,
especially in a potentially dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, prosecutors have also erred, lawyers
contended, delivering a sometimes flat performance and failing to
hammer away at their argument that Officers Sean Carroll and Edward
McMellon, who each fired 16 shots at Diallo, acted recklessly. The
two other officers, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss, fired four and
five shots, respectively. The issue of recklessness could prove
pivotal as jurors consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or
criminally negligent homicide. The officers are charged with
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the prosecution's cross-examination of Carroll, the
first defendant to take the stand, was lackluster and too brief.
And once prosecutors failed to knock Carroll off balance, they
appeared to lose steam in their other cross-examinations, lawyers
said. Several said they were surprised that prosecutors did not
cross-examine the defense's final witness, a police procedure
expert.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ricco, a Manhattan defense lawyer, said one of the
prosecutors' biggest errors was failing to raise the role that race
might have played in the shooting. He and other lawyers said the
issue hanging over the trial was whether the four white police
officers were more suspicious of Diallo because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been dealt with more honestly,'' said Ricco,
referring to the race issue. ``When that occurs, the community has
more confidence in the verdict, whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kuby, a defense lawyer in the Manhattan courthouse on
Thursday afternoon, agreed that both sides' performance had been
mediocre at times. But he pointed out the folly of legal
handicapping, and noted that no one had any idea what the most
important audience _ the jury _ was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a serious problem with treating criminal trials as a
sporting event,'' he said. ``In a sporting event, you know the
score by looking at the scoreboard, but in a criminal trial if you
try to be a sportscaster, you put undue emphasis on certain events.
You're always surprised by what the jurors find relevant.''

 &HT;    History For Sale: A battle over Civil War artifacts exemplifies
how greed is erasing America's prized relics
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cost of war has never been cheap, but Union and
Confederate quartermasters would be astonished to see what is
happening these days to the price of Civil War provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ One Sharps carbine bullet, $3.
</P>
<P>
   _ One 30-pound artillery shell, used in the Siege of Vicksburg,
Miss., $185.
</P>
<P>
   _ One Leech &AMP; Rigdon revolver, made in Georgia, $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ One Confederate States of America belt buckle, $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half a handful of blackened hardtack, as unpalatable as the
day it was made, $10.
</P>
<P>
   Six score and 15 years after Robert E. Lee's surrender at
Appomattox, Va., the market for relics of the nation's bloodiest
war is exploding _ spurred by forces as diverse as Ken Burns'
documentary ``The Civil War'' to the legions of re-enactors in blue
and gray who now regularly refight every battle from Bull Run to
Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   History has its price. And it's going up fast.
</P>
<P>
   At relic shows and shops and on the Internet, thousands of
Americans buy, sell, trade and collect Civil War relics. For them,
the soaring market is an exciting trend. For law enforcement
officials, it has become a growing headache _ an unwelcome
incentive for a small but pernicious group of relic hunters to
scavenge public battlefields for booty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices for Civil War relics have been rising ever since the
war's centennial in the 1960s, but lately they have been going
through the roof,'' says George Juno, who appraises Civil War
material for TV's ``Antiques Roadshow'' and whose American Soldier
store in Allentown, Pa., buys and sells high-end military
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-quality, authentic material is harder and harder to come
by, and demand is growing so fast that the prices just keep going
up,'' says John Sexton, the owner of Stone Mountain Relics,
Atlanta's largest dealer in Civil War relics and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   As Sexton talks from behind his table at a relic show in
Nashville, Tenn., he pulls a Confederate presentation sword and
scabbard from an express mail pouch and examines it. He paid a
widow in Washington, Ga., $7,500 for the family heirloom a few days
earlier. Within minutes, it has sold for $9,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Items that cost $100 10 years ago now sell for several
thousand,'' Juno says. ``In 1993, an Army of Northern Virginia
battle flag sold for $73,000. Today it would easily bring $200,000.
With some Civil War belt buckles going for $20,000 to $35,000, it's
a real incentive for some people to go get a metal detector and
start digging things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Civil War relics have honorable origins _ acquired as
government surplus, handed down through generations, passed on from
collector to collector. Even many so-called ``dug'' relics, those
excavated from the battlefields, are legitimate if they were taken
from private land with the permission of the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, however, the mother lode of Civil War relics
available on private land has dwindled. Demand has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a gold rush mentality itch in Civil War
artifacts that virtually every battlefield in the country has been
heavily scavenged,'' says Patrick Garrow of TRC Garrow Associates,
Georgia's largest contract archaeology firm. ``We did a survey of
one site in Charles County, Va., that was being considered for a
landfill. It was the scene of an unnamed battle between a full
division of Union cavalry and a light division of Confederate
cavalry in 1864. As many as 20,000 people were involved on both
sides. When we surveyed it recently, it was almost barren of
artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   As privately owned portions of the battlefields have been picked
or paved over, some relic hunters have found the lure of public
lands irresistible. ``Some of these people are fine folks who are
genuinely interested in the Civil War,'' says Mike Greenfield,
supervisory ranger for Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania Battlefield Park
in Virginia. ``But some have such a desire to own artifacts they
don't care whether they find them on private property or a national
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Richmond area men, Jeffrey S. Blevins and John H. Walker,
were recently convicted of repeatedly looting Petersburg National
Battlefield in Virginia, the scene of six major Union and
Confederate clashes and more than 70,000 casualties. Over 18
months, Blevins and Walker sneaked into the park as often as three
nights a week. National Park Service officials said the pair dug
more than 240 holes and stole more than 2,000 artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very organized in the way they went at it,'' says
Richard Waldbauer, who tracks archaeological crimes for the Park
Service. ``They operated like a business as they systematically
looted more than nine acres. They had lookouts and exotic ways to
get in and out of the park. They dressed in camouflage. Their metal
detectors were wrapped in black tape so they could work at night.
They often worked on holidays when they knew there would be less
law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men pleaded guilty and were fined more than $25,000 each
and sentenced to several months in federal prison. In meting out
the heaviest penalties ever imposed for archaeological crimes in
the eastern United States, federal Judge Richard Williams noted
that ``Civil War buffs are a cult all their own'' and said he hoped
the sentences would temper others' ``craving for artifacts'' from
the parks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, dozens of arrests and convictions in recent
years are proof that battlefield parks and public lands are a
tempting target for looters. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two armed men were caught with an intact artillery shell they
had found with a metal detector at the Spotsylvania battlefield. In
1998, they were put on probation, and barred from national parks,
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Three visitors to Vicksburg National Military Park in
Mississippi were caught digging in a remote area of the
battlefield. All three pleaded guilty, were fined a total of $8,900
and forfeited their artifacts, four metal detectors and a Ford
Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two northern Virginia men were arrested for dredging thousands
of Civil War artifacts from Herring Creek, a state-owned tributary
of the James River. They pleaded guilty and got suspended jail
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield, 30 miles north of
Atlanta, park rangers augment their regular patrols with
radio-controlled remote sensing devices and trip wires that can
detect intrusions by would-be looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 11.5 miles of Union and Confederate lines to
protect,'' says Kennesaw Superintendent John Cissel. ``There are
hundreds of ways a person can enter the park. We can't watch them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cissel says the precautions seem to have reduced looting at
Kennesaw in recent years, but he says his rangers are powerless to
do anything about active relic hunting occurring on private
property that surrounds the park.
</P>
<P>
   To protect artifacts that are still in the ground, national
parks have banned the use of metal detectors, which are now
sensitive enough to distinguish a bullet from a brass button up to
a foot below the surface. At some parks, visitors are warned that
even if they are just driving through, their metal detectors must
be treated like guns _ disassembled and carried in the trunks of
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal detecting is very popular, but unfortunately there are a
few bad apples,'' says Andy Sabisch, a relic hunter and metal
detector enthusiast from Canton, Ga., who says reputable hobbyists
are appalled by the abuse of the technology in parks. ``With the
explosion of prices for relics, some people just find it too
tempting to sneak into a battlefield on a rainy night dressed in
camo fatigues. They need to realize that if they get caught,
they're going to jail. There is nothing in a national park that is
worth a felony conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for authorities is that most Civil War parks, such
as the Kennesaw and Chicamauga battlefields in Georgia, are an
irregular checkerboard of private and public lands, making it all
but impossible to pinpoint the origin of some artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of collectors actually prefer dug relics because they
can be tied to a particular battle and a particular location,''
says Charles Nash of Stone Mountain Relics. ``But once it's dug,
there's no way to tell whether it came from private or public
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, authorities can directly tie looted material
to the burgeoning market for relics.
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia's Colonial National Park, a park ranger acting on a
tip from nearby residents caught three North Carolina men with
metal detectors who had stopped off to loot the park on their way
to a Civil War show in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The men, including a schoolteacher and a certified public
accountant, had plotted the location of each of their finds on a
map of the park. They explained that they had planned to spend two
days digging in the park to supplement their collections with fresh
material. As part of the sentence they received for their crimes,
the three were required to make a videotape warning other relic
hunters to stay out of the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups of career relic hunters who travel what we
call the `Cannonball Circuit,' going from park to park,'' says Sam
Weddle, chief ranger at Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military
Park. ``Some are highly educated about the areas they loot.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Vizi, special agent at the FBI's Philadelphia office,
which has made several recent arrests for artifact thefts, says the
real problem is the skyrocketing value of Civil War relics,
especially Confederate material. ``As prices increase, more people
are seeing the opportunity to make money,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Civil War show in Richmond that put FBI agents on the
trail of two Pennsylvania men who stole $3 million worth of
artifacts from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. A dealer in
antique weapons told agents of his suspicions about 10 antique
swords that a Pennsylvania Civil War collector had offered to sell
him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the investigation was over, federal agents had arrested
the collector and a museum custodian who had been stealing objects
from a museum storeroom for 10 years. In all, 200 items were
recovered, including a lock of George Washington's hair and the
flintlock rifle that abolitionist John Brown used at the siege of
Harper's Ferry, W.Va. Both men were sentenced to four years in
prison and three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip from another Civil War relics dealer, FBI
undercover agents last year recovered a rare regimental battle
flag, the silk standard of the 12th Regiment Corps d'Afrique, one
of the Union Army's first units with black soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, stolen from the Army's collection at Fort Jackson,
S.C., more than 20 years ago, was seized by undercover agents when
Charles Wilhite of Overland, Kan., offered to sell it to them for
$28,000, according to the agents. Experts say the rare flag, now in
a trophy display at FBI headquarters, could have netted more than
$100,000. If convicted, Wilhite faces up to 10 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' Weddle says. ``Many collectors don't realize that
this kind of criminal activity is going on. A lot of them would be
horrified to know that something they just bought came from a
battlefield park. But some of it does.''

A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY FOR MARBURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Home for Stephon Marbury was never
really the icy terrain of Minnesota where he started his National
Basketball Association career and spent the first two-and-a-half
seasons of his career.
</P>
<P>
   When he forced his way out of there last season, conspiring with
his agent, David Falk, to create a way to bring him back to the
metropolitan area where he had grown up and forged his schoolboy
legend, he left behind few friends and no regrets. Still, after a
hard year spent with the Nets since the trade that brought him
here, Marbury admits to some pangs of emotion, feelings that will
surely resurface when he returns to face his former team for the
first time on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Nets struggles this season, Marbury would hear of
Kevin Garnett's dominating opponents out West, and suddenly
Minnesota did not seem so cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss playing with Kevin,'' Marbury said. ``I miss playing
for Flip Saunders. I loved playing basketball in Minnesota. It was
great playing ball there. The fans are unbelievable. The coach is a
great coach. He knew exactly what he wanted. He knew what he was
doing. It was fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin McHale put the team together, put the right pieces into
the team to make a championship team. It was fun. But I just wanted
to come back home.''
</P>
<P>
   His return to Minnesota comes in the Nets' only nationally
televised appearance of the season. It also falls on his 23rd
birthday, providing him with the likely, but unwanted, gift of an
arena filled with fans booing his every move and a team that most
likely remembers how he forced his way out of town. It will be more
frigid inside the arena than outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ironic, very ironic,'' Marbury said. ``National TV on
my birthday. It's like, `Let's see him have a bad birthday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury dismisses the notion that this appearance in the Target
Center will be any different than any other game, reminding anyone
who asks that he has already returned to Madison Square Garden as
an enemy and that it cannot be worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win, like I want to do every day,'' he said.
``I know it's going to be a different situation, but nothing like
the Garden. I play according to the game. I play the same way every
time I go on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trading deadline last year Marbury was dealt to the Nets,
along with Chris Carr and Milwaukee's Elliot Perry, in a three-way
deal that sent Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling, Brian Evans and the
Nets' first-round pick in 1999 to Milwaukee, and Terrell Brandon to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The deal broke up the dreams that Marbury and Garnett would
replace Utah's John Stockton and Karl Malone as the next great
inside-outside tandem. Each has continued to flourish without the
other, with Garnett averaging 23.2 points a game, 10th-best in the
NBA, while Marbury is 13th at 22.3. Garnett is fourth in the league
in rebounding at 12 a game and Marbury is eighth in assists with
8.4 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who counts Garnett among the few friends he left behind
despite the rumors of alleged jealousy regarding Garnett's
contract, does not believe that his former teammates will hold a
grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're looking at me like that,'' Marbury said.
``They know I'm the same way. They're coming at me. I'm coming at
them. They already know that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marbury is enjoying life close to his home, a quick drive
from the Brooklyn neighborhood where he grew up and then starred at
Lincoln High, it is the basketball things that sometimes make him
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he speaks wistfully of Garnett's skills and
Saunders' coaching, he never voices his doubts about his current
teammates or coach. During the Nets' dreadful 2-15 start, he was
criticized for his play for the first time in his career and
alienated teammates by taking the floor for a practice with the
words ``33 Alone'' inscribed on his sneakers. But he never
reconsiders the decision he made to force the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``Never. When I make a decision, I
think about it before I do it. When I do it, that's it. It's done.
That's how I feel, and I stand on my decision like I stand on my
word. That's all you got in this world. People trust you from what
you tell them.''

MILITARY SPENDS TOO MUCH ON OFFICERS' HOUSING, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas)  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Defense Department has been spending too much
money on housing for high-ranking officers, according to the
department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, Navy and Air Force have repeatedly surpassed the
annual spending limits imposed by Congress for the maintenance and
repair of officer housing in the last three years, the inspector
general said in a newly published report.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Congress gave the services larger budgets for special
repairs, they exceeded the allowed amounts, the report said. Other
violations cited in the report include the repair and maintenance
of residences with money set aside for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released at the end of January, comes when the
Defense Department is seeking more money to improve the housing of
its rank-and-file service members. Poor housing is one of the major
reasons people leave the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposed this month increasing the
Pentagon's housing budget by $3 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amounts spent on housing for admirals and generals
are relatively small, the report said the military failed to comply
with congressional instructions and the policies of the Department
of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been concerned about the issue since last May, when
the Navy and the Air Force reported improperly financed repairs on
several large homes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Navy said it had financed $5.7 million worth of
repairs to the homes occupied by three admirals using money
intended for other purposes between 1992 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report examined generals' and admirals'
houses, which are the most expensive to maintain in the Defense
Department's housing system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, Congress has limited spending on repair and
maintenance to $25,000 a year for each of these residences. If a
service thinks a project will require more than $25,000, it must
get congressional approval for the extra financing.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the inspector general examined 79 of the military's
882 homes for top officers. One of the largest violations was at
Fort Belvoir in Virginia, according to the report. In fiscal 1997,
the Army spent $47,230 to renovate one house, almost double the
limit allowed by Congress, without seeking congressional approval,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In another violation, the Navy sought congressional approval for
a large renovation project last year in Corpus Christi, Texas, but
went beyond the approved budget without notifying Congress, the
report says. The project received a budget of $258,600 and reported
spending $257,999. But the report says spending eclipsed $295,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and the Air Force have already taken action to correct
some of the violations, but the inspector general still recommended
that each of the three services begin complete investigations of
the incidents cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and the Air Force said they would follow the
report's recommendations and begin investigations. But the Navy
said it saw no need to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the inspector general, the Navy said it
was already ``investigating potential violations'' and had taken
steps to correct previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that many of the residences occupied by
high-ranking officers ``are historic treasures that require
extraordinary efforts to maintain in a condition suitable for
simple habitation.''

OUTDOORS: FISHING QUOTAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska)  (mk) 
 By PAUL MOLYNEAUX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fishermen who have long cherished free access to marine
resources may soon have to come to terms with the privatization of
some of the ocean's fish stocks. According to the National Academy
of Science, the best way to conserve some fisheries may be to give
a limited number of fishermen and boat owners exclusive rights to
the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Academy's National Research Council released a
report titled ``Sharing the Fish,'' which recommended that Congress
lift its 4-year-old moratorium on the use of Individual Fishing
Quotas _ or IFQs _ as a management tool. The controversial quota
systems allocate guaranteed shares of a total allowable catch to
fishermen, or boat owners, within a specified fishery. The shares,
usually based on a fishing operation's past landings, are often
transferable _ and are hence also referred to as Individual
Transferable Quotas or ITQs. Among fishermen, the two terms are
used almost interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   For regulators, individual quotas provide a simple mechanism to
help them keep fisheries landings within conservation guidelines,
and leave heated allocation issues to the market, assuming that
more profitable fishing operations will buy quota from less
efficient ones. In the view of the academy's report, the ensuing
consolidation of quota shares is desirable, and will serve the
national interest by providing a better net return on fishing
investments.
</P>
<P>
   While individual quotas are intended to promote stewardship of
the resource by giving shareholders a long-term stake in the
fishery, critics argue that quota systems give what is left of
troubled fisheries to the people most responsible for depleting
them, and squeeze out low-impact user groups. ``Recreational
fishermen are generally against any management that privatizes a
public resource,'' said Andy Mezirow, who runs a halibut charter
boat out of Seward, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, ``commercial fishermen are strongly opposed to
ITQs,'' said Tom Hill, chairman of the New England Fisheries
Management Council. Hill believes that the IFQ moratorium will be
lifted during the forthcoming congressional reauthorization of the
Magnuson Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act. He notes, however,
that ``IFQs raise some interesting philosophical questions about
people's access to public resources, and those issues are going to
have to be wrestled with as we form a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the quotas are just another option for fisheries
managers. ``IFQs can be a useful tool,'' said Ed Urban, chairman of
the committee that wrote ``Sharing the Fish.'' Urban points out the
IFQ program set up in 1995, for the Alaskan halibut fishery, as an
exemplary case.
</P>
<P>
   Before the switch to quotas, the Alaskan halibut fishery was a
``derby'' in which participants caught as many fish as they could
during seasons as short as three days. The resulting glut of fish
on the market led to poor prices, and the race for fish often kept
fishermen working in dangerous weather.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of the IFQ program, halibut stocks have
increased, and fishermen have been able to play the market, as well
as the weather. ``They have a more profitable, and safer, fishery
now,'' Urban said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mezirow is not happy with the much-touted halibut program,
which, in his area, has reduced sport fishermen's percentage of the
annual halibut landings by 15 percent. ``If there is not a shortage
of fish, then the public should have a fair share of them,''
Mezirow said. ``Quota shareholders feel like they own their shares,
and anybody else catching halibut is taking from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommended integrating recreational and commercial
sectors in individual quota programs, but Bob Zales, president of
the National Association of Charterboat Operators, sees individual
quotas as a threat to the recreational fishing industry. ``You
cannot manage a recreational fishery on fixed quotas,'' Zales said.
``It ends up being too much hassle, and people go do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand Zales points out that some commercial
fishermen, advocating individual quotas for the red snapper fishery
in the South, may get more than they are bargaining for. ``These
quotas could go to the highest bidder, and recreational fishermen
can pay a lot more,'' Zales said. ``What commercial fishermen think
is the cure-all could be the end-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace also believes that the benefits of the quotas come at
a high cost. The environmental organization commissioned an
independent study of IFQs, and released its own report, ``Scaring
the Fish,'' last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academy's report is a promotion piece for IFQs,'' said
Gerry Leape of the Greenpeace Oceans Campaign. ``We wanted to get
an alternative view out before the upcoming legislative session.
Congress may decide IFQs are necessary but they need the whole
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Using evidence from Iceland, where IFQs have been in use since
1984, the Greenpeace document supports the contention that
consolidation of the resource in the hands of a few highly
capitalized operations is devastating to traditional fishing
communities. The transfer of quota out of small communities in his
country has led to what a University of Iceland anthropologist,
Gisli Palsson, calls ``a national identity crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Icelanders tend to pride themselves in a close relationship
with the sea,'' Palsson said. ``With ITQs, this relationship is
shattered. There are no more `communal' fishing grounds, and some
communities are on the verge of bankruptcy due to loss of quota.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual quotas have also been a hard sell to most commercial
fishermen in New England and the mid-Atlantic states, where the
tradition of free access to the marine resources is deeply
entrenched. Nonetheless, some fisheries in the region, such as
bluefin tuna, are likely candidates for individual quota systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the bluefin tuna fishery, harvesters race for a limited
amount of fish during short openings. They glut the market, and
push the limits of their boats in foul weather _ problems similar
to those resolved by IFQs in the Alaskan halibut fishery.
</P>
<P>
   But few fishermen want to see fishing rights become private
property, and although the academy's report defines IFQs as simply
an ``individual's privilege to harvest fish,'' in order to attract
investment, that privilege needs to be stable.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Urban acknowledges that ``quota shares could tend to take on
some aspects of property,'' and he sees the problems that shifting
large slices of the fisheries' pie would pose for traditional
fishing communities. But Urban believes his committee's report is
objective, and that it makes reasonable recommendations to deal
fairly with the issues of property and community access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each program appears to have gotten better at dealing with
these problems,'' Urban said. ``In Alaska there are limits on how
much quota a single shareholder can own, and we've made
recommendations that communities be able to hold quota.''
</P>
<P>
   Under any IFQ scheme, however, conservation will come at cost to
some sectors of the fishing industry, raising philosophical
questions about public access to marine resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, prosecutors say, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum
committed a murder that for more than a decade would stand as the
perfect crime. They say he killed his young wife in the couple's
Upper East Side apartment, rented a plane and dumped her body into
the Atlantic Ocean. She was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, when a female torso washed up on a remote
beach on Staten Island, it was mistakenly thought to be that of
Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, and the body was buried and mourned by the
Katz family.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of inaction on the case, prosecutors have
charged Bierenbaum, 44, with second-degree murder, contending that
circumstantial evidence and missteps by the wealthy plastic surgeon
in the years since his wife's disappearance will prove his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Bierenbaum ``absolutely and unequivocally''
denied the charges, and his lawyer, Scott Greenfield, accused
prosecutors of engaging in ``rampant speculation, character
assassination and flagrant hearsay.'' He also suggested that
Katz-Bierenbaum might have killed herself, died at the hands of a
paramour or run off with one. Prosecutors responded that
Katz-Bierenbaum's lovers had nothing to do with her disappearance
and would even testify against the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Katz, the missing woman's brother, said he hoped
Bierenbaum would finally be held accountable. ``I really, for
myself, believe that he did this,'' said Katz, who was 15 when his
older sister disappeared. ``I can't even look at him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor left New York in 1990 and has since remarried,
fathering a daughter and building successful plastic surgery
practices in Las Vegas and then North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to be held this fall, and in it, a
Manhattan jury will learn the details of an Upper East Side
marriage that on its surface was the picture of promise, but in
truth was troubled, violent and adulterous, prosecutors say. The
panel will be asked to determine whether Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, who
was never found, is alive or dead. And it must decide whether her
now graying husband was a hapless victim of circumstance or a young
criminal genius.
</P>
<P>
   The case began unfolding at 8:30 p.m. on July 8, 1985, when
Robert Bierenbaum walked into the 19th Precinct station house on
the Upper East Side and reported his wife missing. Bierenbaum said
he had last seen his wife at their home the previous morning,
according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Katz-Bierenbaum was described by her husband as in ``good''
physical condition but ``poor'' mental condition. And the police
report said that she had had a history of mental illness and that
she had ``had argument with husband.''
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up police report said Bierenbaum reported ``that he had
been fighting with his wife over the weekend'' and that he had last
seen her when she left their apartment on July 7. He also reported
that she was suicidal and that the couple had undergone marriage
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to the missing persons bureau. When
Katz-Bierenbaum failed to turn up five days after she was reported
missing, the police reinterviewed her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of this interview is likely to be the foundation
of prosecutors' circumstantial case. During the interview, a
detective asked the doctor, then a resident at Maimonides Medical
Center in Brooklyn, if he had ever tried to strangle his wife.
Bierenbaum responded abruptly that ``he did not want to talk about
it,'' according to the police report. The detectives then asked
about ``an incident with a cat.'' Bierenbaum responded with ``the
same abrupt answer,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had threatened to jump out of a window during an
argument, he said yes, but again said he did not want to talk about
it. Detectives then asked the young surgeon if he knew anyone named
Ken or Anthony, an apparent reference to Katz-Bierenbaum's lovers.
Bierenbaum replied that their ``names are in her book.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the interview ended, according to the police report, the
young doctor told the detective, ``This don't look right and people
are going to start to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   The series of bizarre and violent incidents referred to in the
interview are the central reasons Katz-Bierenbaum's family cite for
their long-running suspicions about the doctor. In a fight just
before the couple's 1982 marriage, Bierenbaum tried to drown the
couple's cat in a toilet after complaining that his fiancee cared
more about the cat than about him, said Alayne Katz, the missing
women's sister.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on Nov. 8, 1983, Katz-Bierenbaum filed a complaint
with the police stating that her husband had strangled her to the
point where she lost consciousness. Two weeks later, Michael Stone,
a psychiatrist counseling the couple, drafted a letter that he
wanted Katz-Bierenbaum to sign to release him from liability should
anything happen to her.
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated that Katz-Bierenbaum was aware Stone had told
her ``that for reasons of my own safety'' she should no longer live
with her husband. It referred to ``the unpredictable nature of my
husband's physical assaults'' and warned that, ``If I do not heed
this advice, I must accept the consequences, including the
possibility of personal injury, or death, at the hands of my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Alayne Katz said her sister showed the letter to her mother but
never signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The police also later discovered that Bierenbaum had rented a
single-engine Cessna and took a two-hour flight the day his wife
disappeared. According to records from Essex County Airport in
Caldwell, N.J., the young surgeon flew over the waters of the
Atlantic Ocean between Cape May, N.J., and Montauk Point, N.Y., for
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disappearance was considered a missing persons case
at first, the couple's apartment, the doctor's car and the plane he
had rented were not searched until 18 months after
Katz-Bierenbaum's disappearance. No traces of blood, hair or any
evidence of a murder were found.
</P>
<P>
   After the case languished for a decade, prosecutors reopened the
investigation in 1997 because of the lingering suspicions of Andy
Rosenzweig, a former police detective who had become chief
investigator in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators went to Las Vegas, where Bierenbaum lived from
1990 to 1995, and to his current home in North Dakota, interviewing
former girlfriends, friends and fellow doctors, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Daniel Bibb, an assistant district attorney, said the
surgeon had given inconsistent explanations for his wife's
disappearance in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   Bierenbaum's lawyer argues the prosecution has no body, no
confession and no case. He accuses them of engaging in a ``public
witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing woman's brother and sister say they want answers
from their former brother-in-law and finally some sense of closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought that he has been free all this time, and has a
wife and a child and has been practicing, it's extremely
upsetting,'' said Steven Katz. ``His life has gone on, but from
that point forward my family's life stopped.''

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The thrill is far from gone. After a
hectic off-season in which he had to fulfill commitments virtually
every day, Dale Jarrett says he is eager to begin defense of his
NASCAR Winston Cup Series championship. And why not? Robert Yates
Racing, for whom Jarrett drives, may have made his job easier.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates lured five of Jeff Gordon's Rainbow Warriors to
work his pit and hired eight members of Ricky Rudd's crew, and then
Rudd himself as the team's second driver.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was not a big surprise when Jarrett qualified for the
pole position in Sunday's Daytona 500, the initial Winston Cup race
of the season, and Rudd qualified second. The last time one team
had a front row starting monopoly at Daytona came in 1992, when
Junior Johnson Racing had Sterling Marlin on the pole and Bill
Elliott next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's guys were not able to capitalize, with both going out
in a wreck on the 92nd lap. It may take such rotten luck to keep
the Jarrett-Rudd combination out of the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep looking ahead at what's going to benefit you
down the road,'' Jarrett said. ``If we just sit still, people are
not only going to catch us, they're going to surpass us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, at 43, embraces what a superior support system can do
for a driver. He won his Winston Cup title at 42, after 16 years of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have that team around you, it doesn't matter how
good you are,'' he said. ``There are probably better people out
here that are better race car drivers than I am, but I'm in a
better position than they are. You got to have the whole package to
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett should feel even better about his pole position because
he drives a Ford, and never mind that this is a restrictor-plate
race (restrictor plates slow cars by cutting down on the flow of
air into the carburetor). Both Ford and Chevrolet came out with new
models this season, and then NASCAR made rules changes regarding
shock absorbers and springs.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's front end has had more aerodynamic difficulties than
Ford's. Chevy owners asked for relief through another change in the
shocks-springs rules, but NASCAR said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Ford can set out there and run faster by itself than a
whole pack of cars, then there's something way wrong,'' said
Richard Childress, who owns two Chevrolets. ``It's such an
unbalanced field right now. We feel the deck is stacked against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress said he has learned never to underestimate Dale
Earnhardt, one of the sport's legends. Yet even Earnhardt is
feeling overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   After Earnhardt finished 11th in his qualifying race on Thursday
_ following 10 straight years of winning his heat _ he singed
NASCAR's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took NASCAR Winston Cup racing and made it some of the
sorriest racing,'' he said. ``They took racing out of the hands of
the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust and make our cars drive
like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona. This is a
joke to have to race like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott, 44, in particular dazzled with his qualifying
victory on Thursday. He says he has the best car he has brought to
Daytona since finishing second in the Winston Cup standings in '92.
``We've come light years in the last month, and if anything, that's
an understatement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett does not have to be convinced. ``Bill is one of the best
at drafting. We always hear a lot about Dale Earnhardt being one of
the best, but Bill knows as much about the draft as anybody here.
And man, his car looked great.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, driving a Chevy and breaking in a new crew chief,
does not seem to be drawing much attention as a serious contender
this week, despite his three Winston Cup titles in five years and
two Daytona 500 victories over the last three years. But the
resolve is clearly there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told the guys in the garage, `We don't have to come out
and do great things,''' said Gordon's crew chief, Robbie Loomis.
``What we need to do is work together well as a team and give him a
good, solid foundation. Then put Jeff Gordon in the car and he'll
take care of the rest.''

GREENS AT RIVIERA ARE GIVING WOODS FITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ Tiger Woods trailed by five shots
going into Saturday's third round, a deficit which, in his
universe, can disappear at light speed over a few holes. Yet if
Woods does not rally and win the Nissan Open, he can legitimately
point to the Riviera Country Club's greens as his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Poa annua grass is synonymous with bumpy and inconsistent
putting at Riviera and other stops on the PGA Tour's west coast
swing. A stretch of hot weather can smooth out poa annua greens,
which would help if these tournaments were played in July. Every
player has missed his share of putts, of course, but Woods' luck
has been rotten even by low standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, he couldn't find the hole on at least a half
dozen putts no longer than 10 feet, including three attempts that
hit the cup. In the second round, two more tries lipped out and
some others appeared struck well enough to fall. Woods still
managed to shoot 68-70, but he left several birdies and possibly
the lead on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make any putts,'' Woods said, including second-round
laments for his playing partners Hal Sutton and Steve Pate. ``I
think we as a group easily had double-digit lipouts. We didn't hit
bad putts. They just didn't go in. That's really frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the only ones suffering, although most players
simply endured missed opportunities rather than cursed lousy
putting strokes. Sutton put together a bogey-free 67 and pulled to
within three shots of the leaders, Bob Tway and Greg Chalmers.
Still, things are haywire on the greens last week. Despite carding
Friday's low round, a six-under-par 65, Brandel Chamblee said he
was baffled when missing three attempts inside 4 feet. On Thursday,
Nick Faldo, who read these greens well enough to win the 1997
Nissan Open, five-putted No. 11 for a quadruple bogey 9.
</P>
<P>
   It's clearly feast or failure at Riviera. With the lead at nine
under par, the cut at one under and 39 players within five shots of
first place, birdies obviously are plentiful. With Woods lurking,
the chance for a dramatic finish also exists. Also five shots
behind and not yet out of contention were Jesper Parnevik, who
ranks second to Woods on this year's PGA Tour money list, and Vijay
Singh, who ranks sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, it wasn't supposed to be Woods' week here. Bumpy
poa annua greens aside, the length of Riviera's back-nine par-5's,
564 yards at No. 11 and 576 yards at No. 17, provided him with less
of an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par is 68 for him on just about every golf course,'' said Neal
Lancaster, who ballooned to a 79 Friday, after an opening-round 66,
and failed to make the cut. ``Not with a course like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure from Woods' winning streak was supposed to catch up
with him. But Woods was not worried about his length on the par-5's
nor the continued glare of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing getting on my nerves is the ball not going in
the hole,'' he said. ``That's the only thing that really bothers
me. The media and the fans, that's just part of playing well, but
it's frustrating when good putts don't go in.''

   Although nobody wants to talk about it on the record, New York's
Republicans are quietly agonizing over the intrigue and backbiting
among the state's top party leadership. Gov. George Pataki, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Joseph Bruno, the state Senate majority leader,
and William Powers, the state party chairman, are contenders in a
struggle for the dominance once exercised by Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   This feuding _ in some cases a rekindling of old hostilities, in
others an effort to establish a new power base _ comes at a
particularly bad time for the state's Republican regulars. New
York's presidential primary, set for March 7, has already left its
embarrassing mark on the state party nationally, after Pataki and
Powers tried unsuccessfully to keep Sen. John McCain off the New
York primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle at the top threatens the party's unity and strength
in a critical election year, not merely for the presidential and
U.S. Senate races, but also for choosing legislators who will map
voting districts for state and federal offices for the next decade.
If done with political expertise, these maps can be drawn to keep
the draftsmen, and their party, in power.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the most open combatants are Pataki and Bruno.
The longest-running discord, patched on occasion for public
appearances, is between Pataki and Giuliani. And the least
understood, and in some ways most intriguing, part of the mix is
the relationship between the governor and Powers, an early backer
of Giuliani and a friend of Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's conflict with Pataki began surfacing last year when the
the Senate majority leader bucked the governor on several issues,
including health care and reforming the state's sleazy lobbying and
gift-taking system in Albany. Suddenly the governor was asking
Bruno's colleagues whether they were satisfied with how the
majority leader was conducting his business. At the same time,
several state workers with ties to Bruno mysteriously lost their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's allies were furious, spreading the word that the
governor was on a power trip, trying to control every political
move made by Republicans and, they charged, making a mess of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Benjamin, dean of the college of arts and sciences at the
State University of New York at New Paltz, suggests that the
governor is trying to send a hard and clear message that he has
taken over as the state's top elected Republican. As the powers of
D'Amato fade, the powers of his protege, Pataki, gain strength.
Benjamin said: ``Firing the employees is a way of saying to Bruno:
`I'm in charge now. Here are the new facts and you are going to
have to live with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing struggle between Pataki and Giuliani offers an
almost weekly twist. Most recently, the mayor embarrassed the
governor by saying the New York presidential primary should be open
to candidates other than George W. Bush, including the mayor's
friend, McCain. The resulting steam leaking from Pataki's office
could have relieved the heating crisis in several upstate counties.
</P>
<P>
   It has been labeled a coincidence, but shortly after Giuliani
broke ranks by criticizing the primary, he began to face the
renewed possibility of competition within his own party. Rep. Rick
Lazio, a Republican from Long Island, had wanted to run for the
Senate this year. But he harnessed his ambitions a few months ago
to make way for the mayor. Suddenly, Lazio is reminding the
political world that ``I have not closed the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki quickly dismissed any possibility that he was behind the
return of Lazio, but the timing, as one Republican suggested
privately, sent a signal from the governor to the mayor just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all these veils is Powers, a reclusive figure credited in
state party circles with pulling the party out of the hole created
in 1990 when a GOP gubernatorial candidate lost by a landslide and
left behind $1.5 million in party debt. After almost a decade of
pushing and financing Republican candidates at every level, Powers
wants Giuliani to win the Senate race, a yearning that has, on
occasion, put him at odds with Pataki. No doubt there are also
strains between the two over their disastrous failure to deliver an
uncontested primary to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's national reputation clearly suffered from this debacle.
Allies who once dreamed of a Pataki vice-presidential nomination
are now setting their sights on a Cabinet appointment in a
Republican administration. Still, the big unanswered question is
whether the state's feuding Republican leaders can muster enough
party unity to mount a massive voter turnout for Giuliani in his
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.

PRADA'S FIERY OWNER STIRS CREW WITH WAVES OF ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Resplendent in a cream linen suit, the
fashion scion Patrizio Bertelli _ husband of the clothing designer
Miuccia Prada, financial wizard behind the fabulously successful
Milan, Italy-based company that bears her family name, and the
latest in a long line of multimillionaires to challenge for the
America's Cup _ stood ankle deep along a shaggy, green bluff while
sheep grazed in the lush, adjacent meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential for a dry-cleaning disaster, Bertelli was
ebullient. It was two weeks ago and, moments earlier, he had taken
possession of the Louis Vuitton trophy, emblematic of the
wonderful, dramatic victory his Prada America's Cup challenge had
completed the previous afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli had bankrolled the $55 million campaign from his own
deep pockets, and his crew had vanquished San Francisco's America
One syndicate in a thrilling series to earn the right to face Team
New Zealand in the America's Cup finals. The racing was scheduled
to begin this weekend, but was curtailed by a frustrating lack of
wind on Saturday; only in yacht racing are the games canceled
because the weather's too nice.
</P>
<P>
   The literal and figurative center of attention, Bertelli had
been busy arranging a group photo of his 130-strong sailing team
and their families: gesticulating, commanding, getting it right. To
his left and to his right, tanned sailors casually posed in the
standard yachtsman's garb of white trousers and blue blazers.
</P>
<P>
   As conductor of this maritime orchestra, the linen-clad Bertelli
had earned the right to tack away from the occasion's collective
crew uniform. It was more than a symbolic moment for, in his dress
and in his firm, omnipotent management style, Bertelli was apart
from the others.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been known to flash a temper. In fact, his pot
boiled over on the day that America One came storming back from a
3-1 deficit to take a 4-3 lead in the five-of-nine-race
challenger's finals. When the Prada boat returned to the docks, the
54-year-old Bertelli was waiting. And his advice for the skipper,
Francesco de Angelis, and the tactician, Torben Grael, was loud and
pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terribly angry,'' said a reporter from one of Italy's
largest daily newspapers who witnessed the outburst, and who spoke
on condition of anonymity, fearful of incurring Bertelli's wrath.
``He's from Tuscany, and you must understand these people. One
minute they are smiling. The next they are on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli is proud of his Tuscan connection and, while he does
not dispute the summation of the personal characteristics of those
who hail from the region, he also points out that the Prada
campaign has dispelled a myth about another purported trait of its
natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuscans tend to be pretty disorganized,'' he said. ``We've
proven we can organize and undertake a project of this size, and do
it to international or Anglo-Saxon standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli's talent for and dedication to organization have turned
Prada into a billion-dollar concern. In many ways, it has been an
unlikely success story. Miuccia Prada took over her family's ailing
luggage business in 1978 and joined forces with Bertelli, a belt
manufacturer, two years later. With Bertelli serving as chief
executive officer and his wife in the role of chief designer, their
alliance has been magical.
</P>
<P>
   A competitive amateur sailor who successfully campaigned his own
boats in the offshore racing scene in the 1970s, Bertelli was lured
into the cup wars by Argentine naval architect German Frers, with
whom he was contemplating the commission of a large cruising yacht.
Frers insisted that Bertelli was the perfect man to lead an Italian
challenge, and Bertelli almost immediately agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the aftermath of a cup challenge can be hazardous
to the health of Italian tycoons. Maurizio Gucci, who led the
Italia syndicate in 1987, was later assassinated after his former
wife, Patrizia Reggiani, took out a contract on his life. And Raul
Gardini, who bankrolled the 1992 cup challenger, Il Moro de
Venezia, committed suicide a year later in the middle of a
financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelli is in it for the long run. Asked whether he would
return to New Zealand and try again if this attempt at the cup
ultimately proves to be unsuccessful, he said: ``Yes. We'll wait
and see until what happens after the finals, of course, but I'm 99
percent certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he returns to cup competition as the defender or as the
challenger, in either case his style will continue to be
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rolls into things like a tank,'' Bruno Trouble, who heads
up the challenger's series, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Gardini and I know Bertelli and I like them both,'' he
added. ``But Gardini had much more glamour and panache. That's not
Bertelli's style. He's not really doing it the Italian way.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Bertelli's doing it his way. And as the sailors aboard Prada
are learning, there really is no other.

MARVIN MILLER'S FAME IS SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
(Eds: Allen Barra is a sportswriter in the New York area.) 
 By ALLEN BARRA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask people connected with baseball and they will say that Marvin
Miller, the man who founded the Major League Baseball Players
Association and the man who brought free agency to baseball,
belongs in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Red Barber once called Miller, along with Babe Ruth and Jackie
Robinson, ``one of the three most important men in baseball
history.'' Arthur Ashe felt that Miller ``did more for the welfare
of black athletes than anyone else.'' Bob Costas said that, with
the possible exception of Branch Rickey, ``there is no nonplayer
more deserving for the Hall of Fame than Marvin Miller.'' Even team
owners like George Steinbrenner and former executives like Buzzy
Bavasi endorse Miller's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The players themselves are unanimously behind Miller. Jim
Bunning, a U.S. senator from Kentucky and Hall of Famer, said,
``The Hall of Fame is about players, and Marvin did more for the
players than anyone else.'' Tom Seaver called Miller's exclusion
from the hall ``a national disgrace.'' Hank Aaron wrote that
``Miller should be in the Hall of Fame if the players have to break
down the doors to get him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are wondering if that's what it might take to get him in.
If Miller is not tapped by the veterans committee on Feb. 29 _ and
speculation is that the choice will be Sparky Anderson, the former
Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers manager _ then the
behind-the-scenes rumblings that surround the issue may break out
into one of the Hall of Fame's biggest controversies. Or, as Brooks
Robinson, the Hall of Fame third baseman and member of the board of
directors, put it: ``Too many of us who want this to happen have
let it slide for a long time. This year, we're going to ask the
right questions and find the right answer to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, it appears, will focus on rule 6(b) of the ``Rules
for Election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by members of
Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans.'' According
to the rule, ``Baseball Executives and/or Managers and/or Umpires
who have been retired from organized baseball as Baseball
Executives and/or Managers and/or Umpires for at least five years
prior to the election'' are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, does Miller qualify?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, definitely not,'' a veterans committee member said. ``It
says `baseball executive,' and Marvin Miller was not a baseball
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   To which a former player on the veterans committee said:
``That's ridiculous. The rule says `baseball executive,' not
`executive employed by major-league baseball.' Marvin Miller was
the executive director for all the players in baseball, not just
the players of just one team. The players are baseball. If Marvin
Miller isn't a real baseball executive, who is?''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the interpretation of rule 6(b) is the stumbling
block.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the interpretation of the rule that matters,'' said
Leonard Koppett, the sportswriter and a veterans committee member,
who favors Miller's candidacy. ``The board of directors make the
rules, and we can't put Marvin on the ballot until the board
interprets the rule and tells us it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Idelson, vice president for communication and education
of the Hall of Fame, said: ``There is nothing in rule 6(b) to
prohibit Marvin Miller's candidacy. If Leonard Koppett or anyone
else puts up his hand and said, `Let's rule in Marvin Miller,'
they'd have to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Holtzman, another sportswriter on the veterans committee,
said, ``That's not my understanding of how the process works.''
</P>
<P>
   And who is on the screening committee? The Hall of Fame will not
say except that the screening committee is made up of veterans
committee members
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't the screening committee brought Miller before the
veterans committee for the three-fourths approval vote that would
put Miller in the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody on the screening committee,'' a veterans committee
member said, ``always has a hang-up about rule 6(b).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know,'' Dick Moss, a player agent who was Miller's
former legal counsel at the players association, said, ``why people
who have tried to sort through this years ago screamed in
frustration and walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people trying to sort through it now might feel the same
way. Joe Morgan, the Hall of Fame player and ESPN broadcaster, who
is a member of the hall's board, devoted a section in his recent
book, ``Long Balls, No Strikes,'' to advocating Miller as a Hall of
Famer, said. ``I didn't even know about the screening committee,''
Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who know about it are not sure how it works.
``It's my understanding,'' Seaver said, ``that the screening
committee is only there to help the veterans committee. I am not
aware that it's necessary to have the screening committee present
someone before the veterans committee in order for a vote to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who see Miller's exclusion as more than the
result of mere confusion; they view it as intentional obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some baseball executives tell the press,'' a veterans
committee member said, ``and what they say to each other when the
doors are closed are two different things. The Hall of Fame is a
private organization run by the owners of major-league baseball.
There are a great many men on those committees who have vivid
memories of the stomping Marvin Miller gave them in every labor
battle. Do you think those men are going to roll out the red carpet
and ask him into Cooperstown? If anything is going to be done about
this, the push is going to have to come from the players themselves
and the players association.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Robinson concurred. ``This is our fight,'' he said,
``and, frankly, it's our fault Marvin isn't in the Hall of Fame.
We've wasted too much time waiting around for this to happen. It's
time we got together and said: `Look, we want this to happen. Does
this rule exclude Marvin Miller, and, if so, let's change it.'
Marvin Miller taught us all to stand up for ourselves. It's time we
took the responsibility and stand up for him.''

FALLING CORPORATE TAXES BLAMED ON WILLINGNESS TO USE SHAM
SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID JAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With incomes rising, particularly among the wealthy, Americans
are paying a lot more in federal taxes than they did before the
economic expansion of the last decade. Not so, American
corporations. Their profits are growing even faster than Americans'
incomes, yet the taxes they pay have peaked and have begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have been striking. Almost 15 cents of every dollar
of income earned by Americans in 1997, the latest year for which
figures are available, went to the Internal Revenue Service, up
from 13 cents in 1990. By contrast, taxes paid by companies on
profits reported to the IRS fell to 20 cents on the dollar in 1997,
from 26 cents on the dollar in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors explain why the corporate tax burden has
fallen, from the legitimate use of various tax credits to the
deduction of the cost of stock options exercised by employees. But
the most troubling factor is the rapid spread of tax shelters,
especially among large corporations, according not only to experts
at the Treasury and IRS, but to some corporations and law firms
that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these tactics have been found in the courts to be
illegal tax dodges. Others, many of them novel arrangements, have
not been tested in the courts but are raising eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate tax shelters are our No. 1 problem'' in enforcing
the tax laws, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in an
interview, ``not just because they cost money but because they
breed disrespect for the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly alarms IRS and Treasury officials is what they
call a growing willingness by prominent companies that are well
known for guarding their public image to engage in the kind of tax
avoidance tactics more characteristic of the most disreputable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have been found to have engaged in what
the courts called shams are Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer and
United Parcel Service. For example, the tax court found last year
that UPS engaged in a long-running ``sham'' to evade more than $1
billion in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a race for the bottom,'' said Jonathan Talisman,
acting deputy Treasury secretary for tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq did not return calls seeking comment; Colgate-Palmolive
declined to comment, and United Parcel Service, in a statement,
said it was ``deeply offended'' that government officials ``would
even begin to equate'' its tax case with evasion or impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics have become widespread enough that even corporate
tax lawyers are quietly alerting the IRS about tax shelters they
think cross the line from legitimate tax planning into illegal
schemes. The New York State Bar Association's tax section, a
leading organization of corporate tax lawyers, said last year that
tax shelters were a growing problem and called for new legislation
to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax shelters differ from legitimate ones because they use
accounting gimmicks intended solely to lower tax liabilities and
have no legitimate business purpose. In one typical example, a
company that owes taxes forms a partnership with a business, often
one abroad, that for various reasons does not owe any taxes. The
company then shifts its profits to the other business' books,
reducing its own profits, and later takes back the money in ways
that do not count as profits. Many big accounting firms and Wall
Street investment houses help arrange such deals for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   In one current case involving AlliedSignal, the big automotive
and aerospace company that was acquired last year by Honeywell, a
substantial tax bill was wiped out. In that deal, AlliedSignal sold
its investment in a Texas petroleum company at a profit of more
than $400 million. The company would have owed more than $140
million in taxes on the profit. But, following a plan devised by
Merrill Lynch, the company shifted the profit to a partnership
created with a Dutch bank. AlliedSignal later took back the profit
from the partnership, untaxed, and even reported a $4 million
profit from the investment in the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Court disallowed the deal as having no purpose other
than avoiding taxes, and an appeals court upheld that decision this
month. Honeywell said in a statement that its policy was to comply
with all applicable tax laws and pay all taxes properly due.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like this one, which are revealed by IRS audits, have
repeatedly been labeled illegitimate by the courts. But the IRS may
find fewer than one such deal in 10, and its auditing resources
have been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is emboldening some companies to play ``audit
roulette,'' said Larry Langdon, commissioner of the IRS large and
midsize business division and former tax director at
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the amount of income taxes paid by corporations fell
2.5 percent from 1998, government finance records show, while
individual income tax revenue surged 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of taxes paid by individuals has been growing quickly
in recent years, even faster than the growth in incomes, because
more people are moving into higher tax brackets, where they pay in
taxes a larger percentage of each extra dollar of income. (The top
tax bracket is 39.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Individual incomes were 131 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990,
while taxes were 164 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the case for corporations, which have a tax rate
of 35 cents on every dollar. Corporate profits reported to the IRS
were 252 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990, but taxes rose just
191 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-CORPORATE-TAX-DODGES-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: 191 percent.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An additional factor is lowering corporate income taxes. A
Treasury Department analysis of tax returns filed by large
companies found that each year from 1991 to 1996 a shrinking
portion of profits reported to shareholders was reported to the IRS
as taxable income. This year less than 70 cents of each dollar of
profit reported by companies to shareholders will be reported to
the IRS as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1990, IRS officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these trends, in 1997 alone, companies paid $60
billion less in income taxes than they would have if they had paid
taxes at the same rate as in 1990. But individuals paid $80 billion
more.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reduction for companies is legitimate. For one
thing, companies report profits differently to shareholders and to
the IRS. And some of the reduction can be attributed to a growth in
tax credits taken for investing in new buildings and equipment,
among other things. Also, as stock options proliferate and are
exercised, companies can subtract the cost from their profits
reported to the IRS, even though they can ignore that cost and
report higher profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is widely agreed that such factors explain only part of
the drop in the corporate tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive corporate tax shelters, Summers estimated, cost the
government more than $10 billion a year, a figure Treasury
officials call conservative. They suspect the number is much
larger.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the fact that tax shelters are being created
faster than dot-coms on the Internet that worries Langdon and
others; it is which companies are embracing them. ``You can divide
the corporate world into white hats, gray hats and black hats,''
Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the black hats had long taken aggressive postures on tax
matters, pursuing schemes that white-hat companies would reject.
</P>
<P>
   What alarms IRS and Treasury officials is the willingness of the
white-hat companies to match this conduct ``because the payoff to
shareholders is sufficient to make the risk to their public image
worth it or because their shareholders will say, hey, everybody
else is doing it, you should do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said the tax shelters arranged by accounting firms
including PricewaterhouseCoopers, investment houses including
Merrill Lynch, and others go so far beyond lawful exploitation of
loopholes that he and other IRS officials are considering calling
on the chief executives of these and other companies to tell them
that they consider the conduct of the companies out of line.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked for comment, did not issue a
statement. Merrill Lynch said in a statement, ``These transactions
were carefully reviewed at the time by prominent outside tax
counsel and accountants, all of whom gave opinions that they were
proper and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers is proposing a law that would require companies to
disclose tax shelters to the IRS as they are being created and
would increase penalties for engaging in shams. The tax lawyers
section of the New York State Bar Association supports requiring
greater disclosure and other steps.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers' proposal has received a cold reception on Capitol
Hill. Last week Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, taking note of his long
experience with tax legislation, said that in the Treasury
secretary's proposal, ``There is a sort of an implicit indictment
of the corporation for doing something, as it were, unethical or
perhaps even illegal or maybe immoral, but the fact of the matter
is we write the Tax Code, and any corporation ought to do what they
can to minimize that cost on behalf of their shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   But some tax shelters should not be confused with legitimate tax
breaks, said Christopher Bergin, editor of the journal Tax Notes.
They ``cross the line and are pure and simple theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, corporations feel confident in proceeding with
such deals because their lawyers said the deals were legal, and
also because the IRS does not have the resources to challenge them
in Tax Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Executives Institute, a group of senior finance
and tax officials at large companies, says that there is no problem
that merits a new law as proposed by Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said that in the last decade he had seen a disturbing
shift in attitudes by corporate executives as to how aggressive to
be in avoiding taxes. ``The tax department is viewed more as a
profit center and a place that has more of an obligation to more or
less aggressively reduce the tax burden,'' he said. ``Most
companies used to worry about their image. When I was at
Hewlett-Packard, and we looked at one of these deals, my boss would
say, `I want you to write the article that you imagine that The New
York Times or Wall Street Journal would run if they find out about
this, and if the article passes muster we will consider doing the
thing.' The deals that couldn't pass that muster were not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, corporate finance and tax officials are under such
pressure to increase profits that image is hardly a consideration
in whether to cheat on taxes. ``Most chief financial officers these
days are more afraid of the Securities and Exchange Commission than
the IRS, because more of them have lost their jobs for violating
SEC rules than IRS rules.''

   NEW YORK _ Stagehands gathered outside the Apollo theater in
Harlem on Saturday and threatened a walkout, two days before a
scheduled Democratic presidential debate at the historic theater.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke off at midnight Friday after members of the
Apollo Theater Foundation and the union, Local 1 of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which has
2,350 members in New York, failed to agree on a new contract and
additional payment for night-shift workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They insulted our intelligence at midnight,'' said Jim
Claffey, a business manager with the union. He promised a strike
unless the Apollo foundation gave the union a signed agreement
before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A strike and resulting picket line will likely throw the
scheduled 90-minute debate between Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley on Monday into chaos. The debate is to be
televised live on CNN at 9 p.m. and moderated by its anchorman,
Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore would not cross a picket line,'' said
Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore. ``We hope that this issue can
be resolved, as we would like to debate.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bradley, Michael Powell, would not comment on
whether Bradley would cross the picket line. He said only, ``We
don't think there's going to be a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Field, a spokeswoman for CNN, said, ``We're going ahead
with the debate as scheduled,'' and added that CNN was not
researching other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo officials could not be reached for comment and did not
respond to messages left on the theater's answering machine
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers at the theater, at 253 W. 125th St., said
Saturday that the stagehands had worked without a contract since
last September, were not paid extra for working the overnight, or
lobster, shift and said the Apollo's management had discriminated
against them for union activities.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began, they said, in August 1998, when the
stagehands joined the union and held a five-week walkout. Charles
Richardson, a shop steward who had worked at the Apollo for 10
years and helped organize the stagehands, said he was fired in July
1999 for having a bad attitude but claims he was really being
punished for his union activities.
</P>
<P>
   The 33 stagehands do electrical, carpentry and audio work and
are paid $20 to $35 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sprauve, an assistant shop steward, who took over
Richardson's duties, said: ``We can't get responses to grievances.
We get no return phone calls. We're still getting no respect.''

OFF-SEASON FOR ROCKIES GENERAL MANAGER WAS AN EXHAUSTING ONE  
 JUST THE FAX  
 GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The caller solicitously inquired about the general manager's
health. Was he all right, was he feeling OK? Yes, Dan O'Dowd
replied, puzzled at the question. Well, he was told, you haven't
made a trade for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd laughed. ``It hasn't been for a lack of trying,'' he
said. ``It's getting harder now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies' new general manager was so active in the
first four months of his tenure that he could have suffered
exhaustion. He made six trades, including a three-way deal, that
brought the Rockies 13 players. He also signed five free agents and
he claimed one player on waivers. Eleven players who were with the
team before rosters expanded in September are gone. Approximately
15 newcomers could be on the team's opening-day roster, maybe more
if O'Dowd succeeds in executing another trade or two.
</P>
<P>
   Easily the busiest team in the off-season, the Rockies arrive in
spring training as the most changed team in the major leagues. When
they hold their first full-squad workout Wednesday, under a new
manager, Buddy Bell, of course, they will not be able to tell the
players without a scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope all the jerseys come in with names on them,''
O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, Tampa Bay, Texas, the Chicago Cubs and the New York
Mets were other teams that had an active winter. No team, of
course, made a more significant move than the Cincinnati Reds, who
snatched Ken Griffey Jr., one of the best players ever traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who had regressed since reaching the playoffs in
their third year of existence, finished in last place last season
with the National League's highest batting average and the highest
earned run average, demonstrating that their hitters could not
overcome their pitchers' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd, however, did not simply overhaul the pitching staff; he
restructured the team's hitting element, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team came off three poor seasons,'' O'Dowd said.
``Something had to be done. It just wasn't working and wasn't going
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   For their first seven years, the Rockies relied on power. They
tried to beat their opponents into submission. For two successive
seasons, they had three players with 40 or more home runs. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to change an offense,'' O'Dowd said, ``that was based
on a hit, a walk and a three-run home run to one that we hope will
feature going deeper into counts, working the pitcher more, having
better at-bats. We wanted to get more of a pure hitter. We
sacrificed power, and we might have to add some later on.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Rockies are looking for higher on-base
percentages to go with their fewer home runs. ``You need a high
on-base percentage,'' the new general manager said. ``If you have a
high slugging percentage and a low on-base, you're going to get
beat eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   So O'Dowd traded Vinny Castilla and Dante Bichette, who last
season hit 30 percent of their home runs and drove in 26 percent of
their runs, who in seven seasons in the Rockies slugged 403 home
runs and drove in 1,436 runs. Jeff Cirillo, from Milwaukee, will
replace Castilla at third base, and Jeffrey Hammonds, from
Cincinnati, will take over from Bichette in left field. Tom Goodwin
is the new center fielder and Brent Mayne is the new catcher.
</P>
<P>
   On the pitching side, which he wanted to stock with people who
could throw strikes, O'Dowd shed pitchers who started half of the
team's games last season. He retained Pedro Astacio and Brian
Bohanon, and they will be in the rotation this season with three
pitchers of a group of five newcomers _ Rolando Arrojo, Masato
Yoshii, Scott Karl, Manny Aybar and Jose Jimenez, who pitched a
no-hitter for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Other off-season acquisitions will compete for spots in the
bullpen _ Stan Belinda, Rick Croushore, Julian Tavarez, Mike Myers,
Billy Taylor. Gone are Curtis Keskanic and Dave Veres, who between
them relieved 136 times last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to make changes here,'' O'Dowd said. ``But
things just kind of unfolded. One piece fit another piece and led
to another. We didn't go into this off-season thinking we were
going to do all this. I've been around the game long enough to know
we made some good decisions and we made some bad ones. I think our
analysis was good and our thought process was good, but that
doesn't mean you made the right decision every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisions the Rockies made weren't based wholly on getting
this particular player or creating a certain kind of offense. It
was imperative, O'Dowd said, to create flexibility in the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to establish some type of long-term strategic plan that
tied into the payroll,'' said O'Dowd, formerly the assistant
general manager of the Cleveland Indians. ``In Cleveland it was the
foundation of everything they've been able to do there. Here we had
eight players tied up with $54 million. It would have been even
higher in 2001. Now the payroll will wind up at around $60 million
for 25 players.''

 UNDATED: 25 players.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mariners Make Moves
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mariners reluctantly traded Ken Griffey Jr., they
signed themselves into the favorite's role in the American League
West, adding five free agents _ first baseman John Olerud, a
versatile Mark McLemore, the starting pitcher Aaron Sele, the
reliever Arthur Rhodes and the noted Japanese reliever Kazuhiro
Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mariners were adding, the Rangers were subtracting. In
the process, they tried to transform their team from one that had
relied on hitting to one that will try to win with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers traded or lost as free agents players who drove in a
third of the runs they scored last season. Juan Gonzalez and Todd
Zeile are the most prominent of that departed group. The defending
division champions also lost an 18-game winner, Sele, but they
gained three left-handed starting pitchers, Kenny Rogers and Darren
Oliver as free agents, who began their careers with Texas, and
Justin Thompson in the Gonzalez trade.
</P>
<P>
   Using money but not androstendione, Tampa Bay bulked up this
winter, signing Greg Vaughn (95 home runs the past two seasons) and
trading for Vinny Castilla (191 the past five). The Devil Rays also
signed Gerald Williams to be their leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who also signed two pitchers, Juan Guzman and
Steve Trachsel, had one of the weakest hitting teams in the league
last season, and that weakness, their 25 percent plunge in
attendance in their second year and the success of their expansion
partner Arizona, prompted them to alter their plans and try to make
the team more potent and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were much more active this winter than last, because
they assured Don Baylor they would be. Baylor is their new manager,
and because he had his pick of jobs he would not have gone to the
Cubs if they had planned to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs signed catcher Joe Girardi and shortstop Ricky
Guttierez and traded for Eric Young, Damon Buford and Ismael
Valdes. Unlike last year, they appear to be serious about
contending.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Fax
</P>
<P>
   Postscript to the Ken Griffey Jr. trade:
</P>
<P>
   In the first month of Jim Bowden's three-month effort to get his
favorite player in all of baseball, the Cincinnati general manager
sent a proposal to Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, by
fax. Gillick called Bowden about an hour after he received the fax
and said: ``You have a major security problem. Someone has stolen
your letterhead and forged your name on the most ridiculous
proposal I've ever seen in my life. You should look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he would. An appropriate passage of time later, the
Reds' general manager called Gillick and said: ``You're right.
Obviously the proposal that was faxed to you the Reds would never
consider doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even general managers have to have some fun in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gone but Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   Last December, when he was still employed by the Mets, Bobby
Bonilla issued a warning. If he did not play more regularly than he
did last season, he said, he would become a distraction and cause
trouble for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all going to love me next year,'' Bonilla told
reporters. ``In the millennium, there will be some fireworks. I
want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bonilla was asked if he would try to create difficulty for
General Manager Steve Phillips and Manager Bobby Valentine if he
did not play, Bonilla said: ``Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets officials, of course, were outraged at this threat of
deliberate trouble-making. Bonilla is gone now, but Valentine is
still the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, what those same team officials must have thought
when they read this comment from Valentine last week. He was
responding, in an interview with Jack Curry of The New York Times,
to his status as a manager in the last year of his contract with no
guarantee of continued employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was looking for a headline story,'' Valentine said, ``I'd
watch for that one day we had a long practice that didn't go well
and I find out there's something wrong at home, and someone gets to
me as soon as I get into the office. Ask me the wrong question at
the wrong time and that guy will have one heck of a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that Valentine would have borrowed
anything from Bonilla?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just off the Clearview Expressway in Bayside, Queens,
Aline Euler has created a welcoming back yard. From a sprawling
sycamore, three bird feeders hang, one full of the premium thistle
seed that attracts finches. There are sunflower hearts for the
chickadees and, a few trees to the left, a suet feeder that
attracts downy woodpeckers and starlings.
</P>
<P>
   An electric cord runs under the snow to the house, to keep the
water in the birdbath from freezing. Two birdhouses await spring
guests. With a notebook and field guide in hand, Euler carefully
counts the arriving guests.
</P>
<P>
   Euler is one of thousands of bird-watchers participating in the
Great Backyard Bird Count this weekend, collecting statistics about
which species are showing up at feeders, lawns and bushes around
the United States and Canada. The project is in its third year,
sponsored by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National
Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entire weekend and through Monday, observers count the
number of birds they find per day in at least half an hour of
observation, and submit their numbers, via the Internet, to the
North American count. The Web site, www.birdsource.org, shows a
running tally of how many birds were counted, with breakdowns by
state and province.
</P>
<P>
   With the statistics, ornithologists will be able to study how
this winter's weather has influenced bird populations, and whether
migrating waterfowl species are moving as far north this year as
last. Birders are asked to pay careful attention to house finches,
which have suffered recently from conjunctivitis, an eye infection
that hinders their ability to feed. With information from the bird
count, ornithologists hope to be able to map the spread of the
disease, which might be contracted from other birds at feeders.
</P>
<P>
   Euler spreads birdseed instead of salt or sand on her front walk
when it is icy. As a reward, the trees above her home are filled
with birdsong, even late on a frosty Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are what she calls the ``typical New York
birds'' _ pigeons, starlings, house sparrows _ around the feeders.
But soon a trio of American goldfinches, drab in their winter
feathers, alight on the thistle-seed feeder, and a pair of red-wing
blackbirds pick at the suet. Other days, other seasons, Euler has
spotted a migrating indigo bunting, a red-bellied woodpecker and a
hooded warbler.
</P>
<P>
   One of her more exotic visitors was a sharp-shinned hawk, which
helped itself to some of the songbirds she feeds. She knew it was
the nature of the species, and tolerated it, so long as it kept to
house sparrows.
</P>
<P>
   Euler, who is the education director at Alley Pond Environmental
Center in Douglaston, Queens, is hoping her yard can be certified
as an official Backyard Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife
Federation. She also plants flowers and bushes to attract
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so relaxing to come out and watch them here,'' she said
as she sat in her enclosed porch, with its large windows installed
specifically for bird viewing. ``We like to be next to nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Dunne, vice president of natural history information at the
New Jersey Audubon Society, said that birding was the second
favorite American outdoor pastime, after gardening, and had grown
in popularity during the last decade. Of the country's 54 million
birders, 80 percent never leave their back yard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Euler keeps a vigilant eye on her feeders, and groaned in dismay
when a black and white cat crossed her yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really like to see cats,'' she said. ``They really
decimate the birds.'' She does not use pesticides on her garden or
lawn, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame because a lot of the birds we had in the past we
don't see as many of,'' she said. ``We used to have lots of jays,
but we don't anymore, I think because of pesticide use.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing such trends is important, she said, so that causes can
eventually be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important, because it provides people with
an understanding of what birds reside here in urban areas,'' Euler
said. ``Many people believe that birds are the barometers of the
health of the environment _ canaries in a coal mine.''

FALLING CORPORATE TAXES BLAMED ON WILLINGNESS TO USE SHAM
SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category code ``f'')  
(nk) 
 By DAVID JAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With incomes rising, particularly among the wealthy, Americans
are paying a lot more in federal taxes than they did before the
economic expansion of the last decade. Not so, American
corporations. Their profits are growing even faster than Americans'
incomes, yet the taxes they pay have peaked and have begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have been striking. Almost 15 cents of every dollar
of income earned by Americans in 1997, the latest year for which
figures are available, went to the Internal Revenue Service, up
from 13 cents in 1990. By contrast, taxes paid by companies on
profits reported to the IRS fell to 20 cents on the dollar in 1997,
from 26 cents on the dollar in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors explain why the corporate tax burden has
fallen, from the legitimate use of various tax credits to the
deduction of the cost of stock options exercised by employees. But
the most troubling factor is the rapid spread of tax shelters,
especially among large corporations, according not only to experts
at the Treasury and IRS, but to some corporations and law firms
that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these tactics have been found in the courts to be
illegal tax dodges. Others, many of them novel arrangements, have
not been tested in the courts but are raising eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate tax shelters are our No. 1 problem'' in enforcing
the tax laws, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in an
interview, ``not just because they cost money but because they
breed disrespect for the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly alarms IRS and Treasury officials is what they
call a growing willingness by prominent companies that are well
known for guarding their public image to engage in the kind of tax
avoidance tactics more characteristic of the most disreputable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have been found to have engaged in what
the courts called shams are Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer and
United Parcel Service. For example, the tax court found last year
that UPS engaged in a long-running ``sham'' to evade more than $1
billion in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a race for the bottom,'' said Jonathan Talisman,
acting deputy Treasury secretary for tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq did not return calls seeking comment; Colgate-Palmolive
declined to comment, and United Parcel Service, in a statement,
said it was ``deeply offended'' that government officials ``would
even begin to equate'' its tax case with evasion or impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics have become widespread enough that even corporate
tax lawyers are quietly alerting the IRS about tax shelters they
think cross the line from legitimate tax planning into illegal
schemes. The New York State Bar Association's tax section, a
leading organization of corporate tax lawyers, said last year that
tax shelters were a growing problem and called for new legislation
to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax shelters differ from legitimate ones because they use
accounting gimmicks intended solely to lower tax liabilities and
have no legitimate business purpose. In one typical example, a
company that owes taxes forms a partnership with a business, often
one abroad, that for various reasons does not owe any taxes. The
company then shifts its profits to the other business' books,
reducing its own profits, and later takes back the money in ways
that do not count as profits. Many big accounting firms and Wall
Street investment houses help arrange such deals for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   In one current case involving AlliedSignal, the big automotive
and aerospace company that was acquired last year by Honeywell, a
substantial tax bill was wiped out. In that deal, AlliedSignal sold
its investment in a Texas petroleum company at a profit of more
than $400 million. The company would have owed more than $140
million in taxes on the profit. But, following a plan devised by
Merrill Lynch, the company shifted the profit to a partnership
created with a Dutch bank. AlliedSignal later took back the profit
from the partnership, untaxed, and even reported a $4 million
profit from the investment in the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Court disallowed the deal as having no purpose other
than avoiding taxes, and an appeals court upheld that decision this
month. Honeywell said in a statement that its policy was to comply
with all applicable tax laws and pay all taxes properly due.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like this one, which are revealed by IRS audits, have
repeatedly been labeled illegitimate by the courts. But the IRS may
find fewer than one such deal in 10, and its auditing resources
have been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is emboldening some companies to play ``audit
roulette,'' said Larry Langdon, commissioner of the IRS large and
midsize business division and former tax director at
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the amount of income taxes paid by corporations fell
2.5 percent from 1998, government finance records show, while
individual income tax revenue surged 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of taxes paid by individuals has been growing quickly
in recent years, even faster than the growth in incomes, because
more people are moving into higher tax brackets, where they pay in
taxes a larger percentage of each extra dollar of income. (The top
tax bracket is 39.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Individual incomes were 131 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990,
while taxes were 164 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the case for corporations, which have a tax rate
of 35 cents on every dollar. Corporate profits reported to the IRS
were 252 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990, but taxes rose just
191 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An additional factor is lowering corporate income taxes. A
Treasury Department analysis of tax returns filed by large
companies found that each year from 1991 to 1996 a shrinking
portion of profits reported to shareholders was reported to the IRS
as taxable income. This year less than 70 cents of each dollar of
profit reported by companies to shareholders will be reported to
the IRS as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1990, IRS officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these trends, in 1997 alone, companies paid $60
billion less in income taxes than they would have if they had paid
taxes at the same rate as in 1990. But individuals paid $80 billion
more.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reduction for companies is legitimate. For one
thing, companies report profits differently to shareholders and to
the IRS. And some of the reduction can be attributed to a growth in
tax credits taken for investing in new buildings and equipment,
among other things. Also, as stock options proliferate and are
exercised, companies can subtract the cost from their profits
reported to the IRS, even though they can ignore that cost and
report higher profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is widely agreed that such factors explain only part of
the drop in the corporate tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive corporate tax shelters, Summers estimated, cost the
government more than $10 billion a year, a figure Treasury
officials call conservative. They suspect the number is much
larger.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the fact that tax shelters are being created
faster than dot-coms on the Internet that worries Langdon and
others; it is which companies are embracing them. ``You can divide
the corporate world into white hats, gray hats and black hats,''
Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the black hats had long taken aggressive postures on tax
matters, pursuing schemes that white-hat companies would reject.
</P>
<P>
   What alarms IRS and Treasury officials is the willingness of the
white-hat companies to match this conduct ``because the payoff to
shareholders is sufficient to make the risk to their public image
worth it or because their shareholders will say, hey, everybody
else is doing it, you should do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said the tax shelters arranged by accounting firms
including PricewaterhouseCoopers, investment houses including
Merrill Lynch, and others go so far beyond lawful exploitation of
loopholes that he and other IRS officials are considering calling
on the chief executives of these and other companies to tell them
that they consider the conduct of the companies out of line.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked for comment, did not issue a
statement. Merrill Lynch said in a statement, ``These transactions
were carefully reviewed at the time by prominent outside tax
counsel and accountants, all of whom gave opinions that they were
proper and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers is proposing a law that would require companies to
disclose tax shelters to the IRS as they are being created and
would increase penalties for engaging in shams. The tax lawyers
section of the New York State Bar Association supports requiring
greater disclosure and other steps.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers' proposal has received a cold reception on Capitol
Hill. Last week Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, taking note of his long
experience with tax legislation, said that in the Treasury
secretary's proposal, ``There is a sort of an implicit indictment
of the corporation for doing something, as it were, unethical or
perhaps even illegal or maybe immoral, but the fact of the matter
is we write the Tax Code, and any corporation ought to do what they
can to minimize that cost on behalf of their shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   But some tax shelters should not be confused with legitimate tax
breaks, said Christopher Bergin, editor of the journal Tax Notes.
They ``cross the line and are pure and simple theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, corporations feel confident in proceeding with
such deals because their lawyers said the deals were legal, and
also because the IRS does not have the resources to challenge them
in Tax Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Executives Institute, a group of senior finance
and tax officials at large companies, says that there is no problem
that merits a new law as proposed by Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said that in the last decade he had seen a disturbing
shift in attitudes by corporate executives as to how aggressive to
be in avoiding taxes. ``The tax department is viewed more as a
profit center and a place that has more of an obligation to more or
less aggressively reduce the tax burden,'' he said. ``Most
companies used to worry about their image. When I was at
Hewlett-Packard, and we looked at one of these deals, my boss would
say, `I want you to write the article that you imagine that The New
York Times or Wall Street Journal would run if they find out about
this, and if the article passes muster we will consider doing the
thing.' The deals that couldn't pass that muster were not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, corporate finance and tax officials are under such
pressure to increase profits that image is hardly a consideration
in whether to cheat on taxes. ``Most chief financial officers these
days are more afraid of the Securities and Exchange Commission than
the IRS, because more of them have lost their jobs for violating
SEC rules than IRS rules.''

BUSINESS CONTINUES FOR THE RAVENS  
 A BETTER HELMET IN THE WORKS  
 GOOD PLAYER, GREAT MONEY  
 SEVERAL TEAMS SHOW AN INTEREST IN GRAHAM  
 THOMAS' CHILDREN AND HIS PENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days have been busy, and stressful, for the Baltimore
Ravens' owner, Art Modell. ``I've aged 40 years in the last two
weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason his pulse has been racing is because of good news.
Last week, his team signed free agent tight end Shannon Sharpe,
after re-signing some key free agents like quarterback Tony Banks _
and spending $12.5 million in signing bonuses. There is no question
about it: Baltimore should be considered a sleeper as a Super Bowl
contender next season.
</P>
<P>
   But of course there is another reason Modell has been getting
little sleep lately: Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   When the team's best linebacker is accused of a double murder,
that is sure to lead to many sleepless nights for all involved,
especially the families of the two dead men.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League, however, is a business. As
horrible as the situation is, the sport goes on. And the Ravens
find themselves in a difficult situation. On one hand, the team
believes Lewis is innocent, but on the other, it must prepare for a
future that may not include an All-Pro player.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, when two people are stabbed to
death, as happened in Atlanta after a Super Bowl party on Jan. 31,
and another, Lewis, faces the possibility of spending the rest of
his life in prison, what happens on a football field seems trivial.
But the Ravens still have a season to prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving forward, getting ready for next year,'' Modell
said. ``This has not been easy for anyone. We may have some tough
choices. But this organization is moving full steam ahead. We
signed Shannon Sharpe. We re-signed Tony Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Lewis, 24, the Ravens may face some serious choices.
Lewis, who was released on $1 million bond in Atlanta last Tuesday
and returned home to Maryland, has asked for a speedy trial, but
there is a possibility that it could be delayed until after the
season starts. If that is the case, would the Ravens, or the NFL,
allow Lewis to play?
</P>
<P>
   The league would almost certainly not allow a murder suspect to
play. Ravens officials say privately that they could be forced to
sign a free-agent linebacker to replace Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore and the NFL, at least for now, do not want to suspend
Lewis, because such an act may prejudice a jury when he is tried.
That is different from the case of former Panther Rae Carruth. The
league suspended Carruth before his murder trial, mainly because he
fled from authorities after it became clear that he was a suspect
in the shooting of a pregnant girlfriend. Carruth is being held
without bail in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens may also face a salary-cap problem. Lewis is due more
than $3 million this season. If Lewis' case goes to trial, and he
is found guilty, would this year's salary, and future ones, count
against the cap? Again, the league does not yet have the answer.
But the question is critical to Baltimore. There is little room to
spare for teams in terms of the $62.172 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   These questions seem small considering what is at stake for
Lewis, and that two men were killed, but to the Ravens, what
happens in the next few months can affect the franchise for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping for the best,'' Modell said, ``and we're prepared
for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A Better Helmet
</P>
<P>
   Last season, San Francisco quarterback Steve Young was hit so
hard in the head that he lay on the turf, crumpled, unconscious, as
his teammates watched in horror. It was one of several concussions
sustained by Young over his long career. The hit renewed a debate
about head injuries and prompted calls for the NFL to better
protect its players.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, within the past year, the league has intensified its
research into head injuries and helmet technology. Now, several
league officials say, specialists have developed technology for a
new helmet that may lower the risk of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the studies will be discussed with teams at the
Indianapolis scouting combine next week. It is possible that a new
type of helmet could be introduced in time for next season,
although it seems more likely that it would be used in several
years.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: The NFL believes this new technology
can help its players.
</P>
<P>
   Good Player, Great Money
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of unusual free-agent signings this
off-season, including Joey Galloway ending up in Dallas and Bruce
Smith leaving Buffalo for Washington. One of the more interesting
scenarios involved the Tennessee offensive lineman John Runyan. His
case shows just how much a team is willing to overpay for a player
it considers a great talent.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan is a 26-year-old tackle with Pro Bowl credentials, and is
a good run blocker and a talented pass protector. But by no means
is he a great player _ just a good one. The Titans offered him $27
million over six years. Runyan declined, and instead went to
Philadelphia, who gave him $30 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem with free agency. Sometimes teams lose all
perspective and get tunnel vision, locking on a good player and
paying him as if he were a future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   A few years from now, Runyan may question why he left a Super
Bowl team for the Eagles. There is a good chance that the Titans,
with a good young quarterback and running back, will remain at a
top level while Philadelphia stays mired in mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Graham
</P>
<P>
   The former Giants quarterback Kent Graham, cut by the team this
month, is finding interest from a number of NFL teams. He has
received an offer from the Cincinnati Bengals, and in the next few
weeks is scheduled to visit Jacksonville, Pittsburgh and Detroit.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are deciding between Graham and Neil
O'Donnell as a backup to Shaun King.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' Children
</P>
<P>
   Few NFL players were as highly thought of away from the field as
Derrick Thomas, the Kansas City star who recently died as a result
of an automobile accident. He donated not just his time to charity,
but also hundreds of thousands of dollars as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs have long been extremely fond of Thomas. Now the team
is dealing with a potentially awkward situation involving the
pension fund and estate of Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had at least six children with five different women,
according to several football officials. Thomas had taken care of
the children financially, and when he died, several of the mothers
contacted the Chiefs and inquired about his financial situation.
One of the issues involves Thomas' pension fund. The way his
pension works is that the six children would divide $3,000 a month
for four years, then $1,500 a month until they turned 19.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Thomas provided other means to take care of
his children in addition to the pension fund. Some officials are
concerned about possible fights _ and lawsuits _ over Thomas'
estate.

<P>
   While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
</P>
<P>
   When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lord Byron
</P>
<P>
   ``Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' &QR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Good thing this is New York. Having stood 1,920 years
fewer than the one in Rome, the Coliseum on Columbus Circle is
about to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Its facade is already being shrouded in the funereal pall of
safety netting as workers land the first blows. The main exhibition
hall, once brimming with futuristic cars, sybaritic yachts, indoor
gardens, model apartments, antiques, cameras and even three-ring
circuses, is dark and filled with a cartilaginous network of
scaffolding. Crews are carting out drums full of asbestos and will
soon be wrestling with 24-foot-high, 120-foot-long steel trusses.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a structure will disappear in the next six months.
Workers are taking the first big chunk out of the physical legacy
of Robert Moses, the sovereign master builder who transformed New
York, for better and worse, in midcentury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He named it the Coliseum very specifically because he wanted
to be remembered as immortal as the Caesars of Rome,'' said Robert
A. Caro, author of ``The Power Broker,'' the definitive 1974
biography of Moses. ``He believed his works would confer
immortality on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even New Yorkers who did not equate Moses with Titus might have
had a hard time imagining on opening day in April 1956 that the
Coliseum _ subject of a first-class postage stamp, self-proclaimed
Exposition Capital of the World and a ``$35 million investment in
the gregariousness of man,'' in the words of The New York Times _
would be rubble before the century ended.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of Moses' ``matchless imagination,'' Caro said, the
Coliseum was the first in a series of urban renewal projects,
including the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, whose social
and economic reverberations are still being felt on the Upper West
Side.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Coliseum may have paved the way to its own
extinction by launching a wave of redevelopment that ultimately
rendered a 3.4-acre site on Columbus Circle too valuable to sustain
a relatively low-rise building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It outclassed itself, that's what happened,'' said Anthony
Rafaniello, executive vice president of HRH Construction Corp., the
construction managers of Columbus Centre, the $1.6 billion, 2.5
million-square-foot project that will replace the Coliseum and
adjoining office tower, 10 Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Centre, which is to be finished in 2003, will include
the headquarters of AOL Time Warner, a concert hall for Jazz at
Lincoln Center, a Mandarin Oriental Hotel, restaurants, stores,
apartments and a garage. It is being developed by a group including
Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies and William L. Mack of
Apollo Real Estate Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to tie the West Side together,'' said Bruce L.
Warwick, president of Columbus Centre L.L.C., a unit of Related
Companies. By that, he meant it would close the geographic gap
between Lincoln Center and the Broadway theater district with new
performance spaces and television studios.
</P>
<P>
   And it is about time, said Edward Koch, who sought to replace
the Coliseum in the 1980s when he was mayor. He professed no
remorse at the impending demolition. ``While I didn't know Moses,''
Koch said, ``I can't for a moment think that he didn't believe that
you move forward and that nothing is forever.''
</P>
<P>
   To make an omelet, as Moses himself said, you have to break some
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum rose on a two-block site created by the closing of
59th Street between Columbus Circle and Columbus Avenue. More than
30 structures, including the Circle and Majestic Theaters and the
23-story Gotham National Bank Building, were torn down to make way
for the exhibition hall and office tower, a spectacle witnessed by
12-year-old William Mack, whose father was the demolition
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   To earn its oversize name, the Coliseum was inaugurated with
three big shows simultaneously: the Fifth International Philatelic
Exhibition, the International Automobile Show and the National
Photographic Show.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 125,000 people at the Coliseum on opening day was
Mayor Robert Wagner, who called the building ``one of the wonders
of the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the crowd was Frank Lloyd Wright, who took a
slightly different view. ``It's a great utilitarian achievement,
but architecture is something else again,'' he said. ``I think it's
all right for New York, but I hope it stays here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which built the
Coliseum under the chairmanship of Moses, could not say much more
about the bland, faceless, buff-brick box, designed by Leon and
Lionel Levy, than that it was an example of ``conservative-modern
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it had 300,000 square feet of exhibition space, the
Coliseum was straining under demand even before it reached its 10th
anniversary in 1966, which Moses celebrated by announcing a
22,500-square-foot expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Moses to celebrate the 30th anniversary _ he had
died five years earlier. The Coliseum closed in March 1986, after a
men's sportswear show. The next month, the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center opened, with three times the space.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it appeared that the Coliseum would be torn down
imminently for an enormous project by Mortimer B. Zuckerman of
Boston Properties. But that deal, beset by litigation and a
plunging real estate market, fell through.
</P>
<P>
   So the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent of the
Triborough agency, reopened the Coliseum on an interim basis in
1992. One-of-a-kind events were held there, as was the New York
Coliseum Antiques Show, produced three times a year by Stella Show
Management Co. The last antiques show was in January 1998. The hall
has been dark since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't beautiful, but it was there,'' said Joan Tramontano,
a show manager at Stella. ``We mourn the loss of exhibit space in
Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Count also among mourners the longtime neighborhood opponents of
the Columbus Circle redevelopment project. ``We think it's wrong to
take down a perfectly good building with years of life in it to put
up something that will be very harmful, with traffic, air
pollution, wind and shadows,'' said Olive Freud, of the Committee
for Environmentally Sound Development.
</P>
<P>
   Even the men who are about to raze the building have a respect
for its heavy bones, which will challenge their demolition skills.
``It's like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' said Rafaniello of HRH.
``Architecturally, it left something to be desired, but
structurally it's a magnificent design.''
</P>
<P>
   Most imposing _ though invisible to sidewalk superintendents _
are the 120-foot-long trusses. Six of these monsters, each two
stories high, support the roof. Rafaniello said a crane would be
set up in the middle of the exhibition hall to take the trusses
down in 24-by-24-foot sections.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Coliseum and 26-story office tower should be cocooned
in scaffolding by the end of the month. The contractor for the $17
million demolition job is Safeway Environmental Corp. of
Whitestone, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   By September, there should be nothing at all left of the
Coliseum. But the shadow cast by the Power Broker is not destined
to fade any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important things that Robert Moses did won't go away
in any foreseeable future _ the roads, the highways, the bridges;
the way he made the metropolitan area so dependent on cars,'' Caro
said. ``His overall impact on New York will endure for centuries.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every month, like clockwork, Alla Kozirovskaya would
leave her tiny apartment in Brighton Beach and walk to the bank to
visit her dead mother. It was such a comforting routine.
Kozirovskaya, 62, would sign in at the bank, wait for a clerk to
retrieve her safe deposit box, and then open it up and run her
bent, wrinkled fingers over a single ring, a single bracelet and a
single brooch.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had worn this jewelry for decades, as had her
mother's mother, and their mothers before them. The jewelry was all
that remained of the family's prosperous roots in czarist Russia,
all that had survived the gloom of communism, the turmoil of two
world wars and the family's escape to the United States in 1990.
When Alla Kozirovskaya touched the brooch, she might remember how
her mother smiled. With the ring, she might recall a song. This was
the best kind of magic.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, Alla Kozirovskaya and her husband, Yakov Kozirovsky,
made the monthly trip to their bank, a Dime branch on Coney Island
Avenue in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. And that is how
she discovered that her mother's beautiful jewelry had mysteriously
vanished from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   That morning a bank official politely informed her that there
was no record of her owning a safe deposit box. Nothing in the
computer. Nothing in the files.
</P>
<P>
   The news seemed so impossible that Kozirovskaya hardly knew what
to say. As her own records showed, she had rented her box on April
7, 1994 _ a week before the death of her 87-year-old mother,
Yelizaveta Krush _ and had paid the $32.48 rental fee each year
since. Her last receipt showed she was paid up through April 7,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kozirovskaya pulled out a small, worn envelope that held her
keys to the box. She showed them to the bank official along with
the box number, 3359, which she had written on the envelope. More
bank officials came. They led her into the vault where the safe
deposit boxes are kept. She went to the spot where her box had
always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hole, no doors,'' she said. ``And inside this hole,
our empty box.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozirovskaya, who once taught Russian literature in Kiev but now
is battling cancer, said she began to cry. The bank officials, she
said, tried to reassure her. They said everything would be fine,
that there had to be some reasonable explanation. They promised to
call when they found her items, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, she is still waiting for a phone call, an
explanation of what happened to the magic that she left in that
box.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all the bank has produced is a one-page form stating
that on Jan. 3 _ two days before Kozirovskaya went in to check on
her heirlooms and only weeks after she had last visited them _ bank
employees opened safe deposit box 3359 because a computer indicated
it was vacant and had no owner.
</P>
<P>
   The form said the employees found nothing inside.
</P>
<P>
   Kozirovskaya's son, Victor Kozirovsky, hired a lawyer to write a
letter to the bank, asking about the missing jewelry. He said the
family has yet to hear back. Kozirovskaya also told her story to
Marsha Rapaport, an aide to state Sen. Seymour P. Lachman, who
represents Brighton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rapaport said that she heard an identical tale
from another elderly woman who kept bonds and other valuables in a
box at the same Dime branch, which holds 6,500 safe deposit boxes.
When the woman went to check on her box in December, Rapaport said,
the bank told her it had no record of her owning a box. Other
families in the Russian community of Brighton Beach have reported
similar incidents, Rapaport and Kozirovskaya said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaport said she suspected the items' disappearance had
something to do with the fact that a nearby Dime branch was
recently closed and merged with the Coney Island Avenue branch.
``The move-over and confusion was really horrendous,'' said
Rapaport, adding that she, too, has yet to receive a response to a
letter she wrote the bank seeking an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Weaver, vice president of public relations for Dime
Savings Bank of New York, said in an interview on Wednesday that he
could not discuss what happened to Kozirovskaya's safe deposit box
because ``the facts are just starting to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the bank is investigating both Kozirovskaya's
case and that of the Dime customer who lost her bonds in December.
He said senior bank officials had not heard of other cases. ``We're
working really hard to come up with a quick and fair resolution to
this matter,'' Weaver said, declining to say whether the bank
suspected either foul play or a simple bureaucratic mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   If Kozirovskaya's heirlooms are gone for good, she is in a
difficult position. She did not insure her mother's jewelry, mainly
because she thought the pieces were safely stored away in a bank
vault. Her only record of ownership, her mother's handwritten will,
was in the safe deposit box, too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for value, she acknowledged that she did not possess any
written appraisal of their worth or even their composition. Some of
the stones looked like rubies, some like diamonds, but that is
about as much as she can say for certain.
</P>
<P>
   During the family's trip out of Russia, she said, they had been
offered about $100,000 for the jewelry. As much as they could have
used the money, the offers were rejected because, for the family,
the jewelry represented something of greater value _ their
collective survival and heritage as Russian Jews. For Kozirovskaya,
the monthly trips to the bank were the sentimental equivalent of
visiting her mother's grave, a way to reconnect with fragments of
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month I check, and then I see, and then I remember my
mother,'' Kozirovskaya said, at first fighting back tears, and then
giving in to them. She struggled for the English words to describe
her incredulity that something like this could happen here, in a
country she admires for its efficiency and fair play. ``I never
believe it will be in America. In bank. In safe box.'' The magic,
she said, is gone.

RENOVATIONS: A FIXER-UPPER GETS ITS FIXER-UPPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in this real estate market, when many houses and
apartments generate instant bidding wars, some properties sit
around a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes deals are made but fall apart. Sometimes co-op boards
are resistant to the buyers who are offered and reject one after
another. And sometimes the place is so daunting that even the
fearless walk away.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with a four-story, four-bedroom house on
Degraw Street in Brooklyn, between Clinton and Court Streets on the
border of Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. It is a vital
neighborhood, with hundreds of charming old town houses and a hip
commercial strip on nearby Smith Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like an easy sell. But when Michael Bruno first saw it in
January 1998, even he wasn't interested, and he had renovated other
homes, including one in Chicago and his family's apartment in
Brooklyn. The stairs were falling away from the wall, the marble
mantels were tilting, the floors sloped and there was a big hole in
the living room ceiling. He figured it was beyond him, in terms of
both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruno, 40, was intrigued. ``No one would buy it,'' he
says. ``Everyone in the neighborhood had seen it, and every general
contractor said, `Don't buy it.''' The house had been on the market
for about six months.
</P>
<P>
   One day, driving back into the city at the end of the weekend
with his wife, Rebecca Stevens, 39, and their two young sons,
Victor, 3, and Kohler, 6, he simply made an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving down the expressway coming back from Sag Harbor
and I say, `Rebecca, I hate my job. I'm quitting, and we're buying
that bombed-out house.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bruno was the vice president of Cynthia Rowley, the
clothing designer, and he and his wife, an artist and a teacher at
St. Ann's, a private school in Brooklyn, lived in Brooklyn Heights
in a two-bedroom co-op apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that they could never afford the house unless he worked
as the general contractor and also made many of the repairs
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The house was still available; one bid had collapsed after an
engineer delivered a negative report, and two other bids seemed to
be meeting the same fate. So six months after first seeing the
house, Bruno and his wife offered $510,000, about $140,000 less
than the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   After a few months, their deal went through. Maybe it helped
that they chose an optimistic engineer who said that no single
project in the house would cost more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   They closed in January 1999 and spent the next month frantically
doing the cosmetic work that would make it livable, filling three
Dumpsters with garbage. Although Stevens was less enthusiastic than
her husband, she didn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it much more intimidating than Michael had,'' she
says. ``It was big, and the stairs were falling down, and it was
dark and dank.''
</P>
<P>
   But the process, she says, has not been nearly as awful as she
feared, in part because by the time they moved in, the children's
room was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Bruno has done many repairs on the house,
with help from his father, Al, who worked as a carpenter as a young
man. Now retired from his later job as a construction manager and
living in Chicago, he visits New York for a week at a time, his son
says, ``working 12 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bruno has also saved money by searching for
bargains. Someone in the neighborhood, for instance, said he would
charge $2,400 to strip the paint from four sliding pocket doors.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford that, Bruno found someone in Baltimore to do
the work for $600. He said that contractors who toured the house
estimated it would cost at least $250,000 to renovate; he figures
he will spend about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its flaws drive him crazy. ``Our house really sags,'' he
says. ``You can jack it up,'' but because of the stress on the
walls and ceilings and the brittleness of old materials, the lovely
leaf-shaped plaster moldings would be cracked and ruined. And so he
plans to rip the floors out, level them from below and put in new
wide-plank oak floors.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold day, he enters the house and immediately lights
candles that are grouped in the living room fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love lighting fires,'' he says; he bought the house partly
because every room has a fireplace. Whether they work, he doesn't
know. This summer, he plans to have them inspected and have at
least one of them made functional.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says she loves the house now because it gives them room
for relatives to visit and space for their boys to roam. It is
cozy, too, especially in the living room, with its yellow walls,
enveloping red couch and paintings by Stevens on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But she says she doesn't know whether they will live there for
three years or 20. ``The thing with Michael is, you never know,''
she says. ``It's his creative, artistic outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't disagree. ``She's right,'' he says. ``I'm always
looking for a house.'' If one turned up with a sunny back yard, he
might make the leap again.
</P>
<P>
   But this house has been more than just a project. It actually
led to his new career.
</P>
<P>
   While redoing the bathrooms, Bruno made a number of visits to
Ann Sacks in Manhattan, a showroom where he picked out tumbled
marble, a bowl sink and glass tiles. One day, a customer had a
question, and he found himself answering.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he had gotten interested in something that turned
out to be compelling, and before he knew it, he became a salesman
for the company.

VOTERS TURN OUT IN LARGE NUMBERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ With an enthusiasm that party officials say
they have never seen in a primary, voters of all political creeds
thronged the polls Saturday to choose a Republican presidential
candidate, many of them giddy at the thought that their choice
might determine the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Polling places around the state reported long lines and the
potential for a record turnout. J. Sam Daniels, the executive
director of the state Republican Party, said the overall turnout
would certainly exceed 300,000 and might reach 400,000, far more
than the 276,000 who voted in the Republican primary of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in polling places in traditionally Democratic areas _
many open for the first time, because of a federal lawsuit filed by
Democrats _ was far higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also large numbers of voters in Republican areas.
In Forest Acres, a primarily Republican suburb of Columbia with
large numbers of independents and so-called Reagan Democrats,
nearly a quarter of all 1,600 registered voters in one precinct had
voted by 10:20 a.m. Most of those standing in line said they were
voting for Gov. George W. Bush, but there were also many bumper
stickers for Sen. John McCain and for Alan Keyes in the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lawsuit, which charged that the Republican Party
had closed many polling places in black and other Democratic areas
in 1996, there were hundreds more polling places than ever before
open this year. The suit was settled last week when the party
agreed to provide volunteers or pay state workers to open every
possible polling place, but the large number of inexperienced poll
workers caused problems throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, a conservative bastion of Bush support, 21
polling places that were scheduled to open were closed because
volunteers did not show up, Daniels said. This infuriated the
McCain campaign, which has been relying on support from Democrats
and independents. McCain's aides charged that some precincts in
Democratic areas had been kept closed to suppress votes for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought the court had clearly dictated that all polling
sites should be open,'' McCain said on his bus Saturday morning.
``I believe there should be a full investigation. I don't know what
to say. It's so disappointing to hear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said there had been no political intent in the closings,
for which he blamed inexperienced volunteers. Only three of the
closed polls were in black or Democratic areas, he said; the others
were in solid Republican districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some voters have been inconvenienced, but we have done
everything humanly possible to let them know where to vote,'' he
said. ``It's not political at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Greenville, however, there were few reports of problems.
In Lexington County, a suburban area west of Columbia, all the
polling places opened as scheduled, and voting was substantial even
in Democratic areas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brookland United Methodist Church in West Columbia, a
traditionally Democratic area, workers had expected about 139
voters for the whole day, based on past turnouts in Republican
primaries. But by noon, with seven hours left to vote, there had
already been 120 voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in politics since I was 15, and I've never
seen this many voters for a primary,'' said Tommy Windsor, the
county's Republican chairman. ``This is approaching
general-election levels, and we've never had that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was much lower in black areas, although there was a
trickle of voters in the community center in Martin Luther King Jr.
Park near downtown Columbia. Black voters make up about 60 percent
of the state's Democratic Party, and many have said they are not
interested in either of the leading Republican candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One black woman at the center who would not give her name said
she voted for McCain because her husband was a veteran and liked
the senator's war record.
</P>
<P>
   In Ward 4 of Orangeburg, a black precinct about 40 miles south
of Columbia, only 13 people had voted as of 1 p.m., compared with
19 people who voted in 1996. But in white areas of town, turnout
was quite heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exceptionally high even for a general election,'' said
Dan Peck, a volunteer poll manager for Wards 7 and 10 in
Orangeburg, who predicted nearly 50 percent participation in his
areas. ``I suspect that it's due to the very, very close race
between the two men.''

GORAN TUNSTROM, 62, OF SWEDEN; WROTE NOVELS, PLAYS AND POETRY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goran Tunstrom, one of Scandinavia's most prolific contemporary
authors, died on Feb. 5 at his home in Stockholm. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause was heart failure, Swedish news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstrom published his first collection of poems in 1958. Since
then he had produced a new volume of fiction, poetry, drama or
travelogue almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Karlstad in the Varmland region of western
Sweden, a region famous for its storytelling tradition. The son of
a clergyman, he spent his boyhood in a parsonage in Sunne, a small
community there.
</P>
<P>
   His own writing was marked by his father's early death and the
family's move from the parsonage. He frequently drew on the
Varmland milieu to tell of people overcoming sorrow, of recovering
a lost idyllic existence and of the complexity of relationships,
particularly between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   His work, characterized by a vivid imagination and sensitivity,
often appeared in foreign translations. His poetry was praised for
its rhythmic language and for visionary qualities noted also in his
novels, several of which adopted an approach to writing known as
magic realism.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of his books, ``Juloratoriet'' (1983), appeared in the
United States. Translated as ``The Christmas Oratorio,'' it was
published in 1994 and remains in print at Verba Mundi/Godine,
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The book explored a family's efforts to come to terms with an
accidental death. The narration swirls through several generations
and culminates in a performance of the Bach oratorio of the title.
It was made into a motion picture in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstrom won many Swedish and Scandinavian literary awards. In
1998, his ``Famous Men Who Have Visited Sunne'' took Sweden's top
prize, the August Award for Book of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lena Cronquist, and a son.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN ALL OF AMERICA SKATED ON GOLDEN POND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes score from 4-2 to 4-3 in third graf from end.) 
(lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Ken Morrow remembered how his U.S. Olympic
teammates jumped over the boards to celebrate Mike Eruzione's
go-ahead goal against the Soviet Union, but Morrow, the bearded
defenseman who would go on to win four consecutive Stanley Cups
with the New York Islanders, stared at the scoreboard clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike scored with exactly 10 minutes to go,'' recalled Morrow,
now the Islanders' pro scouting director. ``I thought how this is
going to be the longest 10 minutes of our lives. The Russians were
capable of scoring five or six goals in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Americans completed their 3-2 upset of the Soviets
on Feb. 22, 1980, in the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, it changed
how U.S. hockey and its players were perceived and appreciated. To
many historians, the ``Miracle on Ice'' was the most memorable
single American sports event of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   That hockey game, like any really historic event, has stood the
true test of time: People remember where they were when they saw it
or heard about it. Wherever they were when the buzzer sounded in
the 8,500-seat Olympic field house, people all over America
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   America had needed something to cheer about. American hostages
in Iran were still being held in the embassy there. Soviet troops
had invaded Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter was threatening an
American boycott of the Olympic Summer Games in Moscow later that
year. The Cold War with what Ronald Reagan would call the ``evil
empire'' was still being fought in the icy intrigue of
international politics.
</P>
<P>
   So this was more than just a hockey game, much more. This game
had not involved merely the provincial pride of, say, a New York
Yankees victory in the World Series or a Chicago Bulls victory for
the pro basketball championship. This was for national honor; for
the Soviets, too. Before the Soviet delegation left Moscow, the
athletes gathered at a Kremlin reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told,'' recalled Slava Fetisov, now a New Jersey
Devils assistant coach but then a rookie Olympic defenseman on the
Soviet team, ```You can lose to anybody but the United States.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected the Soviets to lose. They had won five of six
previous Olympic tournaments. The year before, in a Challenge Cup
series with the National Hockey League All-Stars, the same basic
Soviet team had won two of the three games, including a 6-0 finale.
In a pre-Olympic appearance at Madison Square Garden, the Soviets
had strafed the Americans, 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Many NHL observers considered the Soviets the world's best team
at that time. In contrast, the seventh-seeded Americans, coached by
Herb Brooks (on Olympic leave from the University of Minnesota),
were mostly comprised of college players from Minnesota,
Massachusetts, Michigan and Wisconsin. ``I thought we might win a
bronze,'' Brooks acknowledged later.
</P>
<P>
   In their Olympic opener, the Americans salvaged a 2-2 tie with
third-seeded Sweden on goaltender Jim Craig's 34 saves and
defenseman Bill Baker's goal with 27 seconds left. They then
surprised second-seeded Czechoslovakia, 7-3, before dominating
Norway, 5-1, Romania, 7-2, and West Germany, 4-2, to set up the
showdown with the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stand in awe,'' Brooks told his players before the 5
p.m. game that wouldn't be televised until 8 o'clock that Friday
night. ``You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets took a 2-1 lead but with one second remaining in the
first period, center Mark Johnson shot the puck past Vladislav
Tretiak, the tall 27-year-old goaltender with the spiderlike arms
and legs whom some NHL talent appraisers then rated the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking the period had ended, the Soviets skated off, but the
referee called them back for a meaningless face-off. When the
Soviets reappeared, their goaltender was Vladimir Myshkin, the
backup. When the second period began, Myshkin was still the
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   The great Tretiak had been benched by Viktor Tikhonov, the stern
coach who also coached the Central Red Army team in Moscow, the
core of the Soviet roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tikhonov was trying to shoot two birds with one arrow,''
Fetisov recalled. ``To win without Tretiak and to show how smart he
was. He miscalculated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets tied the score, but in the third period the
Americans were changing lines when Buzz Schneider came off early
and Eruzione, hopping over the boards, found himself on a line with
John Harrington and Mark Pavelich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harrington gave me the puck inside the blue line,'' Eruzione
said later. ``I shot, the defenseman screened the goaltender, and
it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ``longest 10 minutes'' that ended with Craig making a
total of 37 saves, the standing-room only crowd kept shouting
``U.S.A., U.S.A.'' and waving American flags. The Soviets, who
would win the 1984 and 1988 gold medals, were in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on,'' Fetisov recalled with a smile, ``Herb Brooks told
me, `I'm glad it wasn't a best of seven.'''
</P>
<P>
   But to win the gold, the Americans had to defeat Finland on
Sunday; if they lost, they would be fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before practice on Saturday,'' recalled Brooks, now the
Pittsburgh Penguins' coach, ``I told them, `You were lucky. You're
too young. You can't pull it off.' Halfway through practice I told
them that again, and after practice I told them that again. I
wanted to get them mad, and I could tell that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were not too young to pull it off, winning, 4-3,
for the gold medal that changed the perception of young American
hockey players. Suddenly the NHL scouts realized they could play.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the Olympians went on to the NHL, but their gold
medals had already inspired a generation of American youngsters
that had been watching television, notably Brian Leetch, Pat
LaFontaine and Tony Amonte. Brooks also went on to the NHL,
coaching the Rangers, the Minnesota North Stars and the Devils, but
as a winning Olympic coach, he was not entitled to a gold medal.
Only the players were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a gold medal, though,'' the coach recalled with a smile.
``Somebody slipped me an extra one.''

KAMENSKY AND FLEURY PROVIDE MORE GRIEF THAN GOALS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Theo Fleury, the frustration has increased to the point
where broken hockey sticks have turned into obscene gestures. For
Valery Kamensky, the frustration stems from what he perceives as
not enough ice time.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Rangers, the source of their frustration this season
can be traced directly to the lack of production from both Fleury
and Kamensky, the team's two biggest free-agent signings last
off-season. So far, they have been the Rangers' two biggest busts.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury and Kamensky were supposed to be the stopgaps in the
Rangers' rebuilding process. They were seen as the two players
whose offensive capabilities would hasten the Rangers' return to
respectability _ and the playoffs, allowing the organization to buy
a little time while it awaits the arrival of Jamie Lundmark and
Pavel Brendl from the junior leagues. (The stunted development of
Manny Malhotra, who has spent much of his sophomore season in the
National Hockey League in street clothes, is another question
altogether.)
</P>
<P>
   But after a 4-2 loss to Colorado at Madison Square Garden on
Friday, Fleury _ who was stoned by Patrick Roy on a first-period
short-handed breakaway _ admitted that he has been in a season-long
slump. A four-time 40-goal scorer over his first 11 NHL seasons,
Fleury has just 13 goals this season, none on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Kamensky, meanwhile, who scored 26 or more goals four times over
his first eight NHL seasons, has just eight this season.
</P>
<P>
   If Fleury and Kamensky were performing to their capabilities, no
one would be speculating about the job security of either Coach
John Muckler or Neil Smith, the team president and general manager.
But they aren't. And the Rangers' tenuous hold on the eighth and
final Eastern Conference playoff spot gets looser with each passing
day.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration for Fleury hit a new low Friday night, going
beyond the smashing of his sticks on the ice. Saturday Fleury
admitted he directed an obscene gesture at the Garden crowd that
was booing him in the third period after he again failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just frustrated more than anything else,'' Fleury said.
``I just heard the boos. Hopefully I score three goals tomorrow and
that will be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury had ample opportunities to tie the game in the third
period with the Rangers trailing, 3-2. But he could not beat Roy,
his teammate for a few months last season, from the left side of
the net on two good chances. And so afterward, Fleury had to face
the same questions he has heard all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting the opportunities,'' said Fleury, who has made an
effort to shoot more lately. ``And eventually, it's going to go in.
Hopefully, that will be the start of something.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be too late for the Rangers, if and when Fleury
finally does regain his scoring touch? This is a player who has
averaged 34 goals a season over his NHL career. This season, he is
on an 18-goal pace. When asked if he had experienced anything like
this before, Fleury said: ``Never. Never. Thirteen goals? That's
not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said: ``You always feel he's going to break out of it.
So far, he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-handed breakaway was most frustrating of all. In
Denver on Nov. 5, Fleury had steamrolled Roy to score a breakaway
goal. This time, he pulled up and tried numerous dekes from the low
slot before Roy made a glove save on Fleury's forehand shot. At the
time, the score was tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I score that goal, it's a huge momentum boost for our
team,'' said Fleury, who responded by destroying his stick. ``I
want to do those things. It's just not going in. I'm as
disappointed and frustrated as anybody. I know why I'm here, and
it's not happening. That's what's really eating me up inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, what's eating Kamensky up is the way he is being
used by Muckler. When asked Friday why his reconstituted line with
Alexandre Daigle and John MacLean played so well offensively in the
third period after being invisible for most of the first two,
Kamensky said: ``Because we sit the first two periods. Look at the
ice time. That's why.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler might point to the minus-2 rating that each player on
the line had as to why they sat for most of the first two periods.
But it was not the first time Kamensky complained about his lack of
ice. The problem is, he is not doing enough with the time he has
received.
</P>
<P>
   And the inability of both Fleury and Kamensky to score is
threatening to overshadow the moves the Rangers have made this
season _ like the acquisition of Radek Dvorak _ and the progress of
the rookies Jan Hlavac, Mike York and Kim Johnsson as the Rangers
wait for the rest of their future to arrive.

RIVERA LOSES RULING ON SALARY BUT TAKES IT IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Mariano Rivera was in the middle of doing sit-ups
just past noon Saturday when Rick Cerrone, the New York Yankees'
director of media relations, told him he had lost his arbitration
decision. To Rivera, it was a $2 million conversation: The
arbitrators ruled he will earn $7.25 million for the 2000 season,
rather than the $9.25 million for which he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, thank you,'' Rivera said politely, without stopping his
sit-ups. Sweat dripped down the sides of his face as he continued
through several more sets of sit-ups. He did not stop to gripe to
teammates, or reflect. He did not whine or complain. ``It's good
for me either way,'' he said, as he walked off the field. ``I'm
happy with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera wanted more money, undoubtedly; he rejected a four-year,
$36 million offer from the Yankees that might have been increased
if there had been more progress in the negotiations. But within an
hour of the decision, Rivera joked with teammates, accepting their
good-natured barbs with laughter. When the bullpen coach Tony
Cloninger asked if Rivera was going to take him to lunch, the
Yankees' closer held up a hand and replied, ``Can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters approached him joylessly to ask about the
decision, Rivera began to chuckle. ``It's like somebody died in
here,'' he said. ``I'm not upset at all, and I have to concentrate
on what I have to do this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a loss, Rivera's arbitration award was the largest in
baseball history, surpassing the $5.3 million Jack McDowell was
awarded in 1994, also in a losing case. Rivera, who saved 45 games
in 49 chances last year and is arguably the best closer in
baseball, defeated the Yankees in arbitration last year, winning a
salary of $4.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees discussed a long-term contract with Rivera's
representatives in January, and even in the minutes leading to the
hearing here Thursday. The Yankees' offer stood at $36 million over
four years _ and they may have been willing to increase that by $2
million or $3 million _ and Rivera's representatives reduced their
asking price, proposing a deal with a base salary of $39 million,
in addition to what the Yankees considered substantial incentives.
Feeling their offer fair, the Yankees' officials rejected that
proposal, and the arbitrators, Howard Block, Elisabeth Neumeier and
Alan Symonette, heard the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' contention was that their offer of $7.25 million
would still make Rivera the highest-paid closer in the game, for
although San Diego's Trevor Hoffman signed a four-year, $32 million
deal, he actually will make $6.6 million in salary this year before
any bonuses. Rivera's agent, Jim Bronner, noted that before this
year Rivera's salary has virtually matched that of the shortstop
Derek Jeter. Rivera made $550,000 in 1997, Jeter $540,000; Rivera
and Jeter both earned $750,000 in '98; Jeter made $5 million last
year, Rivera $4.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Jeter settled his case at $10 million for this
year, Bronner argued, and he was also a valuable member of the
Yankees' team, why should a disparity exist now?
</P>
<P>
   As Rivera waited for the decision Saturday morning, the Yankees'
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, appeared near the practice
field to watch; once that happened, David Cone mused later, it was
probably a bad sign for Rivera. ``Heard anything about the case?''
Cone yelled to Steinbrenner. ``Mariano's nervous over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner yelled back, ``Cone, you old union guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner did not learn of the decision until Cone passed on
the news in the clubhouse later, and Steinbrenner immediately
walked to Rivera, placed hands on either of his shoulders and
assured him nothing would change; Rivera nodded his head and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said afterward that the team would continue to try
to explore a long-term deal with Rivera _ ``Our people will be
talking to them,'' he said _ but that may not be the case
immediately. After getting hammered by decisions involving Rivera
and Jeter in arbitration last year, the Yankees might very well
withdraw their long-term offer, something club officials certainly
will discuss in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera intends to get back to baseball. ``The money,'' he
said, ``will take care of itself.''

U.S. MOVES TO EXPEL CUBAN DIPLOMAT LINKED TO SPYING CHARGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States on Saturday ordered the expulsion
of a Cuban diplomat linked to a U.S. immigration official charged
on Friday with spying for the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said that the
diplomat, whom he did not identify, was given seven days to leave
the United States for activities ``incompatible with his diplomatic
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that Felix Wilson, the acting head of the Cuban
interests section _ an embassy in all but name _ was summoned to
the State Department by Charles Shapiro, the coordinator of Cuban
affairs, and told that the diplomat was being expelled.
</P>
<P>
   When expulsions like this are made, the targeted country usually
retaliates by expelling a diplomat from the country that sent off
the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the likelihood of such a reprisal, Foley said: ``We
don't see any grounds for that. Our diplomats are operating in an
open and acceptable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Cuban interests section, Luis Fernandez,
said: ``It depends. They need to convince our government that they
have proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley declined to identify the expelled diplomat. ``He is making
arrangements to depart and it doesn't serve any interests to
identify him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and Cuba do not have formal
diplomatic relations, they are represented in each other's country
by an interests section under the flag of another country, in this
case Switzerland. It is a sort of intermediate diplomatic
severance. In the cases of Iran or Serbia, for example, the United
States does not even have an interests section.
</P>
<P>
   The American charged with spying, Mariano M. Faget, is a senior
official in the Miami field office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. He was born in Havana and left Cuba for the
United States as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it arrested him late Thursday after he was caught
passing along to a Cuban-born New York businessman false
information that U.S. officials had fed him about a Cuban
intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they could not recall another case in
which a government official was charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
   Faget's arrest further complicated Cuban-American relations
already strained by the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old boy who survived his mother's drowning when she fled
Cuba with him in November. Elian's relatives in Florida are trying
to continue custody of the child in the United States over the
objections of his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cuba mission Saturday, Fernandez, the spokesman,
referring to Elian's case, said: ``This is a very dirty maneuver to
try to create a smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he knew Faget, Fernandez said he did not but
that the interests section might have. ``We are in contact with
many persons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview whether the expulsion would hurt
relations between the two countries, Fernandez said, ``This is a
very traumatic situation.''

PHILADELPHIA: A SPECULATIVE DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. WALLACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The first speculative office project in almost a
decade is under way in downtown Philadelphia, as a 20-story
building atop a commuter railroad hub is about to be stripped down
to its steel skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   When the renovation at the southwest corner of 16th Street and
John F. Kennedy Boulevard is complete, its owners say the building,
Four Penn Center, will be a brand-new structure using the steel
framework of its predecessor. It will be the first office project
since 1992 that was begun without tenants already signed to leases
for a significant part of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Leggat McCall Properties LLC, of Boston, bought the building for
$12.3 million in December from the government of Singapore,
according to the contract of sale filed with the office of the
city's recorder of deeds. Leggat McCall said it had budgeted an
additional $70 million for the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown office space, in short supply after two strong years of
leasing activity, has been further depleted by the removal of 15
older office buildings from the city's inventory. Six have been
converted to hotels; the rest have been converted into apartment
houses, with developers taking advantage of a 10-year tax-abatement
program.
</P>
<P>
   These and other losses have depleted 10 percent of what had been
in 1990 the city's 40.5 million square feet of office space,
according to Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the real estate services company. As of
Dec. 31, Grubb &AMP; Ellis reported, the downtown office vacancy rate
was 9.5 percent, compared with 13.1 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At Four Penn Center, work began this month on asbestos removal,
said C. Craig Guers, a Leggat McCall senior vice president, and the
building is expected to reopen in the spring of 2001 with 400,000
square feet of space. The building, which sits above the tracks and
platforms of Suburban Station, a hub for regional rail and subway
lines, is just two blocks from City Hall and the municipal and
criminal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Guers said he expected annual rents in his building to be about
$26 a square foot, nearly 20 percent less than the rents of up to
$32 asked in the city's newest buildings, most of which were
completed between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages to not trying to build a new structure,
however. ``I shave 12 months off the project by the steel already
being in place,'' he said. ``Brand-new construction, including
approvals and design, would be a 30- to 40-month process. We're
doing this in 15 months and we feel that's a manageable time frame
and economical because the West Market Street corridor has a 7
percent vacancy rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Guers estimated that the renovation, including new building
systems, wiring, elevators and climate controls, would cost about
$155 a square foot, adding that he looked for midsized law firms to
be among his tenants.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew that some had leases expiring in the coming year
because they had signed leases with him a decade ago, when he
worked at other Penn Center buildings as a development manager for
Radnor Corp., the former real estate development arm of Sun Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown rents were in the low $20s two years ago,'' Guers
said. ``Then, in 1999, absorption set a record for the decade and
vacancy dropped by 25 percent in about six months. Leggat McCall's
biggest strength is in renovation _ we do it from Boston to
Washington _ and our people went through the building and figured
out how to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leggat McCall has new construction projects in the Philadelphia
suburbs, including Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and Mount Laurel, N.J.,
that stress quick construction in established markets where there
is room for relatively small buildings.
</P>
<P>
   While his company is willing to take small risks for small
rewards, he said, it is not willing to overextend itself on huge
projects involving large loans. Now, Guers said, there is a greater
emphasis than in the city's last building boom in the late '80s on
smaller, more efficient buildings closer to amenities such as
hotels, shops and restaurants and outfitted with premium systems
such as high-speed telecommunication and computer wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Penn Center project is a major step in recovery for a
city still shaking off the hangover of excess space that lasted
from 1992 to 1996, said Wayne Fisher, senior vice president at
Grubb &AMP; Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   For most of those years, the city had a surplus of office space
that led to price cutting and costly incentives to lure tenants as
brokers worked to sublease or re-lease space vacated by takeover
targets such as Conrail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, most of Conrail's operations were split between two
other rail carriers, CSX and Norfolk Southern. It then became a
small regional freight carrier in selected cities _ primarily in
the Northeast, but including Detroit _ and subleased 100,000 square
feet of its former 850,000 square feet of office space. CSX has
sublet an additional 650,000 square feet, 250,000 square feet of it
to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Merger announcements unsettled an otherwise positive real estate
leasing picture. Peco Energy Co., the region's electric utility, is
merging with Unicom Corp., a Chicago electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   And SmithKline Beecham, a pharmaceutical company that last year
opened an additional 215,000-square-foot building adjacent to its
598,000-square-foot headquarters two blocks north of Four Penn
Center, has agreed to merge with Glaxo Wellcome, a British
pharmaceutical corporation. No decision has been made on the site
of the Glaxo-SmithKline headquarters, according to Thomas Johnson,
a SmithKline spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Over 1.3 million square feet of downtown office leases were
signed in 1999, a record year, more than double the city's average
of 553,000 square feet per year, said Fisher of Grubb &AMP; Ellis. The
flurry of leases leaves many potential tenants for Four Penn Center
already committed elsewhere, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents aren't spiking the way they are in Boston or
Washington,'' he said. ``But we're getting a steady 10 percent per
annum or about $2 extra per square foot. All the background
statistics say now is the time if you were ever going to do a
renovation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks Fisher identified was a shrinking pool of
prospective tenants looking to lease more than 100,000 square feet
of space; the likelihood that Philadelphia will not repeat the
stellar pace of 1999 and the constant exposure to mergers and
acquisitions, which might open up space in otherwise fully rented
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-building Penn Center complex, which has a total of
about 5 million square feet of space, extends from 15th to 19th
Street, between Market Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard. It
occupies the former site of the old Pennsylvania Railroad's massive
rail station and elevated tracks, which were demolished in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1953, the Penn Center development initiated a shift of
office construction from the city's geographic center of Broad and
Market streets to the Market Street corridor as far west as 22nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a modest 20 stories, Four Penn Center is not
overshadowed by the majority of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This is because, for more than half a century, developers
observed a self-imposed 500-foot restriction on the height of their
office towers so that they would not rise higher than the 548-foot
City Hall, which is topped by a bronze statue of William Penn. But
in 1986 the restriction was scrapped with the completion of the
945-foot 1 Liberty Place tower.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the office buildings in the central business district
built before that date have changed ownership in the last five
years, Guers said. The Four Penn Center building has been empty for
two and a half years since its last tenant, Reliance Insurance Co.,
moved into a tower several blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest challenges for developers, said Glenn
Mueller, managing director of Legg Mason Real Estate Research in
Baltimore, is finding tenants that are viable over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real risk is not in whether you can rent it today but
whether the company will be around two or three years from now,
because of the Internet and merger-and-acquisition activity,''
Mueller said.

METS WELCOME BROOKS TO CAMP WITH OPEN WALLETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Each of Al Leiter's 162 strikeouts cost
him $100 last year, and the New York Mets left-hander was happy to
pay it.
</P>
<P>
   The money went to a charity sponsored by the country singer
Garth Brooks, who was sincere during a spring training tryout with
the San Diego Padres last year. So Leiter made the donation gladly,
and welcomed Brooks warmly Saturday when he reported for work at
Mets camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to San Diego guys, he took it seriously,'' Leiter
said. ``Had we heard grumblings that it was just a fun fantasy camp
for him with San Diego, there would have been a little different
perception in the Mets organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Brooks was at Thomas J. White Stadium by 7:45
a.m., before almost all of his new teammates. He took part in
batting practice, immediately after Mike Piazza, and fielding
drills, using a glove he got from Toronto pitcher David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Turk Wendell invited him to go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal here is that people see my respect for the game
is unequaled, and my love for the game is equal to any fan's on the
other side of the fence,'' said Brooks, who will leave during the
final week of exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The other aim for Brooks is to promote his charity, the Touch
'Em All Foundation, which gives money to children's organizations.
Players make performance-based donations, which corporations and
celebrities match. The Mets are donating $100,000, as is
eSuperstars.com, a new charity-based Internet auction site for
which Mets manager Bobby Valentine is the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will play third base and left field for the Mets, whose
spring training tickets are selling at their highest rates since
the 1994-95 players strike. Last spring, Brooks went 1 for 22,
though he struck out only four times. The Padres star Tony Gwynn
left him a note at the end of camp telling Brooks he could have
made it if he had started younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could hit some balls out now and then in batting
practice,'' Padres General Manager Kevin Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty good feel of the strike zone and didn't swing
at a lot of bad pitches. His arm got sore because he hadn't played
a lot, but it was strong when he started, and he took good routes
in the outfield and hit the cutoff guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a speed demon, but he went 100 percent down the line.
The ball could already be at first, and Garth would still be
running as fast as he could through the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brooks, who has sold 97 million albums, the hardest thing
about baseball is remembering he is not giving a concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gig is to pull the people in,'' Brooks said. ``Here, if you
hear one of them, you're gone, and I never got over that. As soon
as I stepped out on the deck, it's like, `This is the show.' So I'm
so wound up by the time I get up there; all I'm thinking is
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is going to sound stupid, but I probably plan to
strike out more this year because I'm going to be swinging. I'm
trying to be a ballplayer this year, instead of trying just not to
strike out.''

JOACHIM-ERNST BERENDT, 77, JAZZ HISTORIAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joachim-Ernst Berendt, a German writer who was best known as a
jazz critic but who was also a radio and concert producer and the
author of books on nature and acoustical phenomena, died Feb. 4 in
Hamburg, Germany. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   He died a day after he was struck by a car, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Berendt's most popular work, ``The Jazz Book,'' written in 1952,
went through six editions, the most recent one published in the
United States in 1992. The Independent Publishers Group, his U.S.
distributor, said the book sold almost 2 million copies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Among histories of the genre, ``The Jazz Book'' is perhaps the
most encyclopedic; its focus is on aesthetic lineage. In it,
Berendt relentlessly traced practitioners, no matter how new or
ephemeral, to the roots of their styles, dividing and naming
musical substreams of each era.
</P>
<P>
   Berendt also wrote ``The Third Ear,'' a book on hearing, and had
just published a new book, ``Nur Gehen'' (``Only Walking''), on his
experiences with nature. A co-founder of the Suedwestrundfunk radio
station in Baden-Baden, Berendt programmed more than 10,000
broadcasts of jazz and produced records for labels like MPS,
Atlantic and Electrola.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marijan.

TIGHTENING ADMISSIONS IN CONDOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More and more often, condominium boards in New York
City are acting like co-op boards in screening potential buyers,
according to brokers, lawyers and managing agents, a pattern that
seems to conflict with one of the primary reasons that condominiums
frequently sell for more than similar co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the disparity in price, they say, is that
co-op boards have the power to reject potential buyers for just
about any reason other than one that would be deemed
discriminatory, making them more difficult to sell. In addition,
they say, co-ops are more likely to have constraints on subletting
_ with policies and rules ranging from the imposition of time
limits and sublet fees to outright prohibitions against the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the premium that condominiums command in the
marketplace, however, there seems to be a growing number of
condominiums whose boards are beginning to act more like co-op
directors than condominium managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding a tremendous push on the part of some condominiums
to be more like co-ops,'' said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of
Heron Ltd., a Manhattan property management company. ``With the
market for apartments so hot, condominium boards are trying to be a
little more particular about who buys into the building. And if
they're not sure whether a particular buyer is financially
qualified, they'll usually ask for some backup proof of the buyer's
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Arougheti, who is also a lawyer, said that until fairly recently
it would have been unusual for a condominium board to demand such
information from a buyer. That, she said, is because condominium
boards generally have only limited power to block a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arougheti said, in most cases the only thing a board of
managers can do when confronted with a sale they would rather not
see consummated is exercise its ``right of first refusal'' whereby
the condominium association may buy the apartment from the seller
on the same terms and conditions that had been offered by the
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   While the right of first refusal is a formidable tool, it is
also an expensive one; most condominiums are hardly in a position
to block sales they don't approve of by buying apartments they
don't really need. How, then, could a condominium board of managers
use the right of first refusal to control who buys into the
building?
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking so long to make up their minds that moss grows on
the contract,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth
Warburg Associates, a Manhattan real estate brokerage firm. He
explained that most condominium bylaws give the condominium board
the right to ask for financial information from a potential buyer
so that it can make an informed decision about whether or not to
exercise its right of first refusal.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, in recent months boards have been asking for
increasing amounts of information and taking increasing amounts of
time to examine it. And that, he said, can stretch some deals to
the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, the whole point of buying a condominium is
not having to worry about going through an admissions committee,''
Peters said, adding that the increased scrutiny alone was enough to
discourage some potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what has now begun to emerge with this new trend is that
boards will ask for all this financial information and then take so
long to act on the package that the contract expires. We try to
persuade people to comply with their requests, but frankly, it's
absurd, and the buyers are frequently and understandably furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur I. Weinstein, vice president of the Council of New York
Cooperatives and Condominiums, agreed that some condominiums
appeared to be trying to exercise greater control over admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that in exercising its right of first
refusal, most condominium boards have the power to inquire into the
finances of the proposed purchaser,'' Weinstein said. ``And some
do, in fact, make the same kinds of inquiries that a co-op board
would make because their concerns are basically the same.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Weinstein said, it is probably more important
for condominiums to ferret out financially shaky potential
purchasers than it is for co-ops, because it is more difficult for
a condominium association to collect unpaid common charges when a
unit owner defaults than it is for a co-op to collect maintenance
charges in the same circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is because when a condominium unit owner defaults
on his common charges and mortgage, the owner's lender, rather than
the condominium association, must be paid first. With a co-op,
Weinstein said, the co-op corporation must be paid before the
shareholder's lender.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that more condominiums have been burned by
nonpayers than co-ops,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some condominiums have sought to extend their control even
beyond the admissions process to the controversial issue of
subletting, said Weinstein.A condominium can adopt rules regulating subletting the same
way that a co-op can,'' he said. For example, he explained, a
condominium could conceivably amend its bylaws to impose maximum
time limits on sublets or even prohibit them entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, the method that has been used to control
sublets has been for the condominium to exercise its right of first
refusal to rent the apartment from the owner and then sublet it to
an acceptable tenant,'' Weinstein said. ``But there's nothing that
would prevent a condominium association from amending its bylaws to
require approval of any tenancy in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that he has seen
some condominiums take yet another page from the co-op playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condominiums have started to realize that they really have no
way of raising money when they need it,'' Brett said, explaining
that since condominium associations own no property that they can
mortgage, the usual method for raising cash is to impose an
assessment on unit owners. ``But condominium boards have noticed
that co-ops have this wonderful little thing called a flip tax,''
he said, ``and now the condominiums want a flip tax too.''
</P>
<P>
   A flip tax _ a charge imposed on a co-op shareholder when a unit
is being sold _ can range from a couple of hundred dollars to many
thousands of dollars, depending on the formula used to calculate
the payment. For example, Brett said, in a recent condominium
conversion he negotiated, the tenants who purchased apartments
agreed to pay a 15 percent flip tax to the condominium association
when they sell their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   For existing buildings, he said, a condominium association would
have to amend its bylaws to initiate a flip tax _ a change that
usually requires a two-thirds majority of unit owners.
``Condominiums have traditionally never had flip taxes,'' Brett
said. ``But money's the name of the game in this town, and nobody
likes to do an assessment when money is needed. So for some
condominiums, a flip tax might make all the sense in the world.''

 &HT;    In Michigan, McCain campaign urging primary cross-over to punish
governor
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Two separate efforts _ one by Sen. John McCain's
presidential campaign committee _ have begun in Michigan urging
Democrats to cross party lines and vote for McCain against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dayton Daily News obtained a post card the McCain
campaign in Michigan sent to a registered Democrat here in Flint,
urging Democrats to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III, a black Democratic
lawmaker from Detroit, is helping lead an effort to persuade
Democrats to vote for McCain to punish Republican Gov. John Engler,
leader of Bush's Michigan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the GOP primary and Democratic and
independent voters are considered crucial to McCain's efforts to
defeat Bush. Polls have shown Bush leading among likely Republican
voters, but McCain with a lead among all likely voters, including
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Democrats will chose their national convention
delegates in caucuses March 11 and neither Vice President Al Gore
nor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is on Tuesday's primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The post card sent to Democrats by the McCain committee says,
``The Democrats are not holding a presidential primary in Michigan.
But you can still make your vote count by voting in the Republican
primary on Tuesday, Feb.22.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your voice heard by voting for the one candidate
committed to reform. John McCain will reform the current
disgraceful and corrupting system of financing campaigns,'' the
card continues.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John J.H. Schwarz, a Battle Creek Republican and
McCain's Michigan chairman, said that the cards are consistent with
McCain's invitation to ``Republicans, independents and like-minded
Democrats'' to support him
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said that he did not know how many of the cards have
been mailed. He also said that he hoped that the cards would help
counter some of the Bush campaign's negative ads targeting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that Engler, a third-term governor, has mistreated
Democrats, particularly Detroiters. He cited Engler's role in
replacing Detroit's elected school board with an appointed board
among other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our chance to retaliate,'' Lemmons said. ``We
(Democrats) are in a minority. African-Americans are in a double
minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that fliers are being sent to Detroit-area churches
in predominantly black neighborhoods urging people to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Responding specifically to questions about Lemmons' campaigns,
Susan Shafer, Engler's deputy press secretary, said that they would
only re-energize the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks read these kind of things, it re-energizes them and
rejuvenates them as Republicans. We are deciding who are candidates
are going to be, not Democrats and independents. This is a
Republican primary,'' she said.

OFF TO CAMP? FORGET BEDROLL, TAKE BANKROLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRICK, N.Y. _ ``Now, you mentioned something tropical,''
Laurel Barrie said into the phone. ``Something along the lines of
Belize or Puerto Rico?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the small office, Barrie's colleague Ronni Bergman was
telling another client, ``Irene, when you see these waterfronts,
your eyes will absolutely bug out.''
</P>
<P>
   These women were not scouting locations for ``South Pacific,''
or even for honeymoons. They were talking summer camp. Remember the
bulky footlockers, the squeaking oarlocks, the ``best friends'' for
life (or eight weeks), the rivers of bug juice and calamine? Camp
might as well be college now, with the expense, the finely tuned
themes, the agonizing selection process.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the phones are ringing at the headquarters of Camp
Connection, the Century 21 of summer camps. Actually, it's just a
small office attached to Barrie's vinyl-sided house here. But so
many people want help planning their children's summers that Camp
Connection is about to expand, right into Barrie's den.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie sits at the intersection of two powerful trends, more
kids and more money. The office is an echo chamber of motherly
advice, gentle nudging and eye-rolling patience, all delivered in a
zesty South Shore Long Islandese.
</P>
<P>
   Here Barrie explains that she never talks to parents when
children are present. ``You tell me what parent is going to say in
front of their kid, `He thinks he's a great athlete and he's
not,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Or what about those former ``hippie'' parents who remember
summers of joyous experimentation? ``They say, `I had the best time
but my kid better not be able to do those things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie went to summer camp, as did her children, who are now
grown, and she met her husband working at a camp owned by his
parents. She's pretty much heard it all when it comes to parental
anxiety and quirky kids.
</P>
<P>
   But some cases are memorable, like the ``white food girl,''
whose mother insisted she would eat only things like white bread,
rice and vanilla ice cream. Barrie found a camp that would not make
her eat any polychromatic food. ``She went to camp and survived,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Connection, which is paid commissions to represent hundreds
of camps and summer programs, helps parents pick through a dizzying
dessert cart of possibilities. The list reads like the periodic
table. Lakota and Lokanda and Lohikan and Louemma and Tree Tops and
Timber Tops and Tall Pines and Tall Oaks and Watitoh and Watonka
and Waukeela and Wekeela.
</P>
<P>
   For teen-agers there are four- to eight-week travel trips around
the country. Community service trips whisk older teen-agers to
economically depressed but exotic locations like Indian
reservations or Thailand, where they build houses or provide child
care and also hike or go sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the first time they're giving back,'' Barrie said.
``They're coming home with callused hands.'' All for thousands of
dollars. These programs are gaining popularity, she said, because
``there's a lot of money, and parents are not pushing their kids
out of the house at 16 to work.'' Summer programs can cost $6,000
or more for eight weeks and, like the ordeal of picking a college,
families often tour camps a year before. ``Really, college is
easier,'' Barrie said. ``You're restricted by SATs. You're
restricted by grades. You're restricted by price.'' With camp, the
only limit is your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Take last week's case of the fourth-grade football fanatic.
Barrie told the young Steve Young's mother that contact football
camps lasted only a week to keep children from being pulverized.
``It's terrible,'' she sympathized over the phone, ``but they're
doing it to protect the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie told her that there's one week in New York, another in
Orlando, Fla., another in Washington, and so on. ``I guess you can
fly him all over the country,'' Barrie said, facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to get the woman some information. When she hung up,
she rolled her eyes, ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to fly him around the country.''

FORTUNES WORSEN IN A NEW YORK COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ As Nassau County's financial footing grows
shakier, with a large deficit looming and its bonds rated just
above junk status, it seems that there is one component of any
likely recovery plan that dare not speak its name: higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the county, analysts say, is that its budget
is out of joint. It spends more than it takes in. And the only
solutions for that are to spend less or take in more.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has so far centered almost exclusively on the first
alternative. But while cuts have been made to human services and
bus routes, they have failed to impress Wall Street. Moody's
Investors Service indicated as much last week when it lowered the
rating on the county's general obligation bonds to Baa3, just a
notch above Bb, which applies to most junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Now analysts are saying that the county will need to cut costs
and increase revenues if it is to balance its budget. This year the
projected deficit has been estimated as high as $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is too big to solve with just one fix, cutting
spending or raising revenues,'' said Helen Cregger, an analyst at
Moody's. ``They need to take significant action on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jacobson, who worked as a budget consultant for
Republicans in the county Legislature last year, agreed. ``The
bottom line is you can't solve Nassau's problems only on the
expense side of the budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to increase revenue through taxes and fees could
result in voter disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Thomas Gulotta has hardly mentioned the word
``tax'' in public since last year. That was when he persuaded his
fellow Republicans to raise taxes, only to watch them turn on him
as they fought a bitter campaign that ended in November when they
lost control of the Legislature for the first time in 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Those same Republicans, while still a lame-duck majority,
immediately repealed one of the taxes they had enacted, a land
transfer tax, blasting a $60 million hole in the 2000 budget. Since
then they have voted against every tax or fee that has come before
them, saying that they are returning to their roots as ``the party
of low taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   That has left to the new Democratic majority the task of
enacting fees that the Republicans had put in the 2000 budget. Now
the Democrats merely say ``everything is on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer of the
legislature, said today that her colleagues planned to do
everything they could to cut spending before looking at new taxes
or fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would advocate raising taxes until you can show the
community you have done everything else possible,'' she said. She
said that the Democrats had held hearings on waste in the county
jail, proposed selling a third of the county's cars and begun
hearings on revamping the system of assessing property.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that the scope of the county's budget
problems virtually guaranteed that something would have to be done
to raise more revenue. ``I do expect that the final plan will have
to do something on the revenue side as well,'' she said.
``Otherwise, the math simply doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, said that he
would consider higher taxes or fees only as a last resort. ``When
we have made every cut we can make, when we have squeezed every
ounce of fat out, then we would look at that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta did not respond to several requests to discuss the
county's financial options.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several steps can be taken in the short term and the long term
to shore up the county's finances, analysts, fiscal experts and
elected officials said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Legislature is likely to approve higher fees for using
the county's parks. The fees were included in the 2000 budget
passed by the Republicans last year but were never enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the work-force issue. Gulotta won an agreement
from the county's union leaders in December to let the county
withhold two weeks' salary from each worker until the worker leaves
the job _ in effect, a temporary loan of $20 million. In return for
the deferral, known as a lag payroll, he pledged to make no layoffs
this year, and virtually guaranteed that there would be no layoffs
for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal has been wildly unpopular with the rank and file,
who must vote on it soon. If the union members vote no, though,
they will likely risk layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the county is likely to search for more revenue where
it can find it. It closed 1999 in the black after selling its
hospital and using its share of the nation's settlement with
tobacco companies. In fact, preliminary figures indicate that the
county may have ended the year with a surplus, which can be used to
plug this year's gap.

   Olgita DeCastro, who performed and recorded with her famous
singing cousins, the DeCastro Sisters, for over 30 years, died Feb.
14 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 65.
</P>
<P>

   DeCastro, who was born in Los Angeles, joined the DeCastro trio

   The original trio had their breakthrough hit in 1954, with
``Teach Me Tonight,'' by Sammy Cahn and Gene de Paul. The sisters
came to the United States from Cuba in 1947 and appeared that year
in the film ``Copacabana'' with Carmen Miranda and Groucho Marx.
</P>

HIGH COST OF OIL FINDS COUNTLESS WAYS INTO EVERYDAY LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with
surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more
widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as
with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BAKER FEELS THE SQUEEZE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the aroma of pita bread baking at the rate of 11,000 an
hour, Edward Mafoud stood on the cavernous floor of Damascus
Bakeries in Brooklyn and explained how the steeply rising oil
prices had taken a significant bite out of his bakery's already
slim profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of producing and shipping his pitas and other Middle
Eastern breads has gone up by about $40,000 in the last 12 months,
he said, not only because of higher transportation costs, but also
because of the rising price of plastic packaging bags, a
petroleum-based product he uses by the millions each year.
</P>
<P>
   Although $40,000 may seem relatively little for a company with
about $5 million a year in gross revenues, it is important, Mafoud
said, because ``in the bread industry we work with small profit
margins'' on each item.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your profitability margins are basically running 3 percent
and you chop off 1 percent, it doesn't leave you that much to
operate with,'' he said. Less money is left to upgrade equipment,
expand production or merely remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the bread made by Damascus, a major pita
producer, is distributed nationally, carried by independent
truckers who in recent months have added fuel surcharges to the
bakery's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Mafoud, 39, is part of the third generation of his family to
operate the 70-year-old bakery in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reluctant to raise prices because it would mean
risking the loss of some wholesalers and retailers. An increase of
2 or 3 cents on a four-pita package _ to compensate for the nearly
10 percent rise in the cost of plastic bags and the 2 percent to 3
percent truckers' fuel surcharges _ could lead distributors and
retailers to say, ``No, we'll buy from your competitors,'' he said.
 &UR; TAKING A TOLL ON APARTMENT MANAGERS  &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The spike in oil prices is punching holes in the finances of
those who run apartment buildings in the city, from small walk-ups
to the giant Co-op City complex in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to bust a lot of budgets; it already has,'' said
Jordi Reyes-Montblanc, president of the Housing Development Fund
Corp. Coalition, which helps limited-income tenants take over and
run buildings whose owners default on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To pay soaring oil bills, some co-ops may impose assessments or
raise maintenance fees, he said. ``Our co-ops operate on a very
small margin, and this was totally unexpected. Many buildings can
withstand the pressure for a limited time, but with others, it's
like living from paycheck to paycheck, and this can break you.''
</P>
<P>
   At a 24-unit building he manages on West 134th Street in
Hamilton Heights, Reyes-Montblanc said: ``On Jan. 20, we got an
1,800-gallon delivery at $1 a gallon. On Feb. 5 we got another
delivery that cost $3,600,'' or $2 a gallon, ``and in the next few
days we may have to order again.''
</P>
<P>
   For many buildings, oil costs have been more of an annoyance
than a crisis. ``Many of our members are heating with gas, or they
have a level billing plan and won't get hit for an adjustment until
later on,'' and others are dipping into reserve funds, said Mary
Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York
Cooperatives and Condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   But not all buildings have a cushion. Amy Rosado, who helps run
a tenant-owned building in the Bronx, said it could pay only half
the $6,000 bill for its last oil delivery. The supplier agreed to
extend credit for the rest.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG TANKS, BIG BILLS  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle has surged in popularity in part
because of its size, but it is sometimes more hungry for gas than
two compact cars. That's not much of a problem when gasoline prices
are low.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, drivers of sport utility vehicles and minivans are
rolling their eyes as they spend as much as $50 to fill their large
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Castro of Manhattan's Lower East Side, said he used to fill
the tank of his minivan, a 1996 Plymouth Voyager, once or twice a
week. Now, he can afford to buy only $10 worth of gas three or four
times a week. When he can, he buys gas in Brooklyn to save a few
pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he could not consider a smaller car, he said: ``I
have three children and my wife. Anything smaller would drive me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was buying gas Thursday morning at the Amoco station on
Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, where prices ranged from $1.51 to $1.65
a gallon, generally less than in Manhattan. At a Merit station
nearby, where gas was selling for a few cents less.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Bell of Flatbush, a mechanic for U-Haul, was filling up a
rental truck. He said he had cut down on driving because of the
jump in gas prices. ``I don't go out of state too much anymore,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   TINA KELLEY &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CASHING IN ON AN ALTERNATIVE  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the new year opened to mild weather, Mike Ruff struggled to
drum up business for his Brooklyn plumbing and heating installation
company. Then serendipity struck: the recent increase in oil
prices, coupled with an onslaught of bone-chilling temperatures,
ushered a wave of customers his way.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and his company, KeySpan Energy Solutions, are among the
few who have profited from the increase in oil prices. As more and
more homeowners convert from oil to natural gas, some plumbing
companies are finding that what began as a sluggish winter may turn
out to be a boom season. ``Since the last week or two of January,
we've seen a big jump in the number of customers,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said business had increased by about 60 percent over the
same time last year. In an average year, conversions to gas heat
account for about 15 percent of the company's total gross revenues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's parent, KeySpan Energy, along with Consolidated
Edison, provides gas to homes in New York. Bob Mahony, a spokesman
for the parent company, said that while oil prices were hovering
about $2 per gallon an equivalent amount of natural gas cost about
$1.15. Converting from oil to gas heating usually runs $3,500 to
$4,500, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is good right now,'' Ruff said. ``We just don't know
how long the oil prices will stay up. And in this business, you're
always at the mercy of the elements.'' &QL;

   &UR; A COOPERATIVE SOLUTION  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marion Reinhardt of Rutherford, N.J., works hard to make her
110-year-old house more energy efficient and her heating bills
affordable. A few weeks ago, she put weatherstripping around her
back door. When she goes to work, she lowers the thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the recent rise in gasoline prices that made her
realize that no matter what she did to conserve, it was going to
cost more to heat her home this season. ``I was driving to work the
other day, and I passed a gas station that was selling gasoline for
$1.38 a gallon, and I was so astounded at the increase,'' said
Reinhardt, who is 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and called my oil dealer, and they were going to
charge me $1.60 or $1.80 per gallon,'' she said. ``I couldn't
believe it.'' In January, she paid $1.12 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Reindhardt had been hearing of an oil cooperative
from her friends and neighbors. A few days ago, when she realized
how oil prices had risen, she called the New Jersey Citizen Oil
Group, a nonprofit group that buys oil in bulk and sells it at a
discount to its 6,000 members. Through the cooperative, Reindhardt
is paying 50 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Miller, the organization's director, said the
cooperative sold about nine million gallons a year to its members,
saving them about $1.5 million. Prices for the oil vary, but are
capped at 99 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt said the winter would be hard on people with older
homes, like hers, who were doing all they could to conserve. ``Last
month it was pretty cold,'' she said. ``And winter's not over yet.
I needed to do something.''

 CATHOLIC GROUP BARRED FROM COUNSELING ASYLUM SEEKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service has barred
a group of Roman Catholic counselors from detention centers in the
New York area in what the group is calling an effort to limit
asylum seekers' access to advocacy organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the agency's detention centers, Wackenhut in Queens and
Elizabeth in New Jersey, are administered by private companies for
the agency. The INS itself administers the Varick Street Service
Processing Center in Manhattan, which houses immigrants who have
criminal records. The three centers hold about 600 people, some of
whom have been in detention for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly do not want detainees to speak to us about the
experience of detention,'' said Will Coley, the director of the
barred group, Jesuit Refugee Service in New Jersey, which had
provided English classes and pastoral services in Elizabeth. ``They
do not want us to give hope to detainees, to possibly educate them
about their rights or let us see what detainees are experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the INS, in a statement from Andrea J. Quarantillo, the
district director, said the refugee service ``broke the covenant
that had been reached with INS.'' The program to offer English
classes, pastoral visits and Bible study, Quarantillo said, ``was
initiated to provide detainees with a positive outlet for their
energies that would not deal with detention issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of the religious group became an issue when discussions
in their sessions violated the agency's restrictions. Coley said
immigration officials were adamant that his volunteers not talk
about issues of detention, and he admitted that some had broken
that rule, although he said it was inadvertent.
</P>
<P>
   Coley said the detainees inevitably brought up issues of
detention in the classes and Bible groups, especially because many
lacked legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Jesuit Refugee Service was barred from the
Elizabeth center, which holds 300 detainees, after two and a half
years of work. The service said 80 to 90 people had attended weekly
Bible classes, and about 180 people studied English.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee service said the agency had not responded to a
request it made two months ago to work in the Wackenhut facility.
</P>
<P>
   In Varick, the Rev. Peter Piasta of the Archdiocese of New York
saw his services, which included celebrating Mass, suspended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, unlike the prison system, does not permit a formal
ministry program for the some 17,400 people in its detention
centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The agency cited two specific incidents that led to the
termination of the program at Elizabeth. During a Bible study on
Nov. 17, 1999, led by the Rev. Thomas Sheridan, a priest and a
retired theology professor, the weekly lectionary was taken from a
passage in Matthew in which Jesus admonishes his followers to
welcome strangers and comfort those who are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion, which was monitored by the agency,
apparently touched on issues of detention, and the Jesuit Refugee
Service was thrown out of the center the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion in the Bible study came only a day after another
volunteer had asked students in an English class to write
evaluations of the program and describe the experience of
detention. The volunteer, with an INS monitor present, also
informed the students about an upcoming meeting of an immigration
rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Quarantillo, in the statement, said that the INS ``has no
objection to Matthew 25 or any other Bible passage and does not
seek to censor them. We only request that detention issues not be
included in the lesson plans.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the agency accepted a proposal by the Rev. Joe
Parrish, an Episcopal priest, to hold Protestant Bible classes and
religious services at the Elizabeth center with four other
Protestant pastors. Parrish said that he was told he would not be
allowed to include the Jesuits in the group, but that the
authorities did not say why.

ISLANDERS' POWER PLAY IS TOO MUCH FOR DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Islanders' power play,
ranked 26th in the National Hockey League, would not seem much of a
challenge for the New Jersey Devils' penalty-killing unit, which is
the league's second-best. But the Islanders made a mockery of those
statistics Saturday afternoon at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With two power-play goals _ by the rookies Josh Green and Tim
Connolly _ the Islanders put an end to the Devils' seven-game
unbeaten streak, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils still have the league's best record at 36-16-7, but
the Islanders, with a nearly mirror-image mark of 17-35-7, have
split the season series, 2-2. The outcome was notable for the
Devils for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Devils allowed two power-play goals in the first two
chances after holding their opposition to just three in 50 attempts
over the previous 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was only the second loss in goalie Martin Brodeur's last 22
starts.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was the Devils' second loss in their last 16 home games
(13-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   The two teams showed their dislike for each other from the early
stages. Captain Scott Stevens of the Devils and Steve Webb set the
tone with a fight with seven minutes 29 seconds left in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who had lost just once in their previous five
games, played with confidence from the outset. They had more jump
in their play and were eager to erase the memory of their previous
visit here, a 4-0 loss on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Scatchard got the Islanders off to a quick start, scoring
his sixth goal of the season just 4:04 into the game. It came when
he redirected Kenny Jonsson's pass from the left side during a
break that was executed with such speed and perfection that it
caught Brodeur facing the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Scatchard's goal came on the second shot of the game for the
Islanders, but they enjoyed their lead for a mere 69 seconds before
John Madden tied it from the slot after a pass by Brian Rafalski.
It was the second goal in as many games for Madden, who has 10 in
his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the first period, the Islanders put on a surprising
burst of special-teams excellence that proved to be decisive. On
their first power play of the game, Connolly took a pass from Mark
Lawrence and scored from close range on the left for his 10th over
the fallen Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the Islanders got their second power play
and Green scored his fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   What made the first session worse for the Devils was that they
failed on two manpower advantages of their own, including a
five-on-three advantage they held for 75 seconds. The Devils were
so inept with the man advantage that it was the Islanders who had
the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Devils, Brodeur held his ground when Niklas
Anderson broke away after intercepting a pass by Claude Lemieux and
tried to beat Brodeur with a move from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   That brilliant save by Brodeur _ one of only 15 he made Saturday
_ failed to inspire the Devils, who allowed Green's goal with just
1.1 second left before the first intermission to put themselves in
a precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were the better team in the second period, holding
the Islanders to just three shots in the session while taking 10.
But all the Devils managed was a power-play goal by Jason Arnott
with 1:37 left in the session.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MONTHLY BOXING SHOW WITH ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``If I had Oscar De La Hoya everyone would know who I
am,'' Cedric Kushner said wistfully. His sad eyes and hangdog gray
mustache furthered the sense of deprivation; De La Hoya fights
Derrell Coley on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden and poor
Cedric, like you and me, won't have a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   But two nights earlier, just across the street from the Garden,
he will offer up his version of boxing, so retrograde, so socially
incorrect, so true to the sport's intrinsic character that its time
has probably come yet again. It is a monthly evening of booze,
food, cigars, songs, scantily clad women dancing and scantily clad
men hitting each other.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner calls it ``a respectable men's night out.'' It is billed
as ``Heavyweight Explosion'' and occurs again Thursday night at the
Hammerstein Ballroom of the Manhattan Center on 34th Street off
Eighth Avenue. It may be a more rewarding event for anthropologists
than for purist fight fans. I found last month's respectable men's
night out an endearingly sleazy evening of girlie jiggle and
erratic pugilism. Kushner, a realist, took no offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a single guy,'' said Kushner, 51. ``I love to go out with
the guys to a restaurant or a bar and talk nasty. In my heart, I
believe that is what guys like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   We were looking down on Central Park from Kushner's high-rise
living room last week. Calls came from all over the world. Like all
action entertainments, boxing has no borders. Most of the 57
matches he promoted from Tokyo to Biloxi last year have been seen
on foreign television as well as cable here. A former music
promoter, Kushner says he has 35 fighters under exclusive
promotional contract. If only one of them becomes a heavyweight
champion or beats De La Hoya, everyone would know who Kushner is.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he isn't trying to become as powerful as the reigning
warlords, Bob Arum, whom he says he likes, and Don King, whom he
blames for most of boxing's problems. (Everyone in boxing says this
until there is a chance to make a deal with King.)
</P>
<P>
   Kushner has admitted trying to have his fighters boosted in the
ratings of the boxing organizations by paying off officials.
Bribery is not exclusively an Olympic event. In boxing, however, it
has always been factored into the cost of doing business and may
even add to the faux outlaw sensibility that gives soft boys in
ringside seats the testosterone shivers.
</P>
<P>
   Soft boy that I am, I arrived early for last month's show. A DJ
was sampling, Mr. T-type bouncers were guarding the ropes, young
women dressed for the beach were ankling about. I felt young again.
The cream of boxing society held court around the empty ring. There
was Lou DiBella, the HBO booker, a prince of this realm, and LeRoy
Neiman, its Toulouse-Lautrec, an artist whose work seems to adorn
every program and hang above the mantel of every rich athlete.
</P>
<P>
   I must have forgotten that Bert Sugar, boxing's Thucydides, does
not doff his signature hat for the national anthem but rather tilts
it forward to obscure his still ferally handsome face. Meanwhile,
the cheaper seats in the balconies were filling with the families
and neighbors of the boxers, and the hard-core fans, many of them
middle-aged working men with Purple Heart noses.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't seen the yuppie traders right away because they were
downstairs in the VIP room, bonding over food, drink and cigars,
and watching the prelims on closed-circuit TV. They had to be
herded up to their $125 seats to hoot at the dancers and the ring
girls, which brought back memories of bonding in strip clubs before
the mayor closed them down. There is only one x in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fights are the nucleus of the evening,'' Kushner had told me,
``but atmosphere is as important.''
</P>
<P>
   The fights themselves were mostly second-rate. A top boxer
(Shannon Briggs will be on display Thursday) does not expose
himself to damage in a 2,000-seat arena for a short purse (Kushner
says $20,000 is the most he has paid a main-event fighter, $600 is
an average for the prelims). So there are house pets against tomato
cans and cupcakes, and the occasional solid pro; I liked Monte
Barrett, a local fighter who hammered out a unanimous 10-round
decision. I also liked his tattoos, especially ``In God I Trust''
in illuminated letters across his back. He will be fighting
Thursday, too.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Beats me. The jiggly women displayed
Internet addresses on their round cards and most of the fighters
who lost seemed as unwilling as I am to take punishment. I called
around vainly for explication until my son read me a paragraph from
Philip Wylie's recently reissued 1942 classic, ``Generation of
Vipers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wylie imagined a future historian writing about pre-World War II
sports thusly: ``The sight of two men hammering each other in this
fashion _ occasionally, indeed, to death _ was doubtless some
psychic compensation to the ordinary man for the formidable and
revolting circumstances in which he was forced to live.''

OLD TUNE FOR STARKS: NEW CLUB, NO CHANCE 
TAX'S CHILLING EFFECTS 
RADOJEVIC'S FAMILY TIES
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Starks heard that Pat Riley wanted him for a playoff run in
Miami. It was the kind of gossip that made Starks daydream of
having the ball in his hands with the season on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about that,'' said
Starks, the former Knicks guard. ``When your name is on the trading
block, you hear things and you hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks spoke by cellular phone from the office of the Chicago
Bulls team physician last Friday, moments after he had taken his
physical.
</P>
<P>
   Just like last year, when the Knicks shipped him to the woeful
Warriors for Latrell Sprewell, Starks pulled the shortest straw of
a three-way trade last Wednesday that sent Toni Kukoc to
Philadelphia and Larry Hughes to Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   John Starks, Chicago Bull. The player who once dunked on Michael
Jordan laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, it's strange,'' he said. ``After all the
rivalries over the years we had with Chicago, all of a sudden I end
up in a Bulls uniform. It's a business. I already knew that. It's
just, as a player, from my standpoint, I want to be competing for a
championship. When you think of it in those terms, it's kind of
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance that Starks could be moved by the Bulls
before Thursday's trading deadline. Chicago general manager Jerry
Krause has shipped players in the last year of their contracts.
Starks is in the last year of his deal, and understands that he
probably is not in Chicago's long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, Milwaukee, Toronto and Detroit are still looking for
complementary players to vault them past their Eastern Conference
counterparts. For now, Starks can shelve any visions of knocking
the Knicks out of the playoffs with a clutch 3-pointer. He was
scheduled to suit up against the Clippers Saturday night at the
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Starks just sold his home in Stamford, Conn., and had moved his
family to a rental in northern California to begin the season. At
34, he still believes there are a few seasons left. But the days of
starting at shooting guard and playing 30-plus minutes appear over.
Spurring a playoff team off the bench is the one role he still
covets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no resentment against Golden State,'' he said. ``They
gave me an opportunity. From their standpoint, they got a younger
player with a lot of talent in exchange. It made perfect sense.
Larry Hughes is going to be a great player in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll get to play here if I stay. But I just hope it works
out where I can have a chance to really compete again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax's Chilling Effects
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are still listening to offers for Glen Rice, the
Wizards are hoping someone takes Ike Austin off their hands and
Miami has made murmurs about plucking Walt Williams from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trading deadline nears, many of the 29 teams are
showing restraint in regard to pulling off a blockbuster deal. The
reason? With an escrow tax kicking in for the 2001-2 seasons,
owners do not want their teams to take on long-term, exorbitant
contracts that catapult their franchise significantly past the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning that season, teams will have to pay into an escrow
account for each dollar over the salary cap. For example, if the
Knicks' composite salaries were $10 million over the salary cap
they would have to deposit an extra $10 million into a fund
negotiated by the players and owners during last year's collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the luxury tax is having an impact several years in
advance as teams prepare for it,'' said John Nash, the Nets'
general manager. ``The thinking is, why make a trade for a guy like
Juwan Howard or Shawn Kemp today when it could cost you millions in
taxes tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Kemp are among the underachieving players who signed
$100 million deals before the new agreement was in place. In Kemp's
case, the Cleveland power forward is due a combined $47 million in
the final two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking at the projected stagnant revenue growth and the
escrow threshold, you look at those last two years at $22 million
and $25 million and you ask yourself, `Do you really want to take
that on?''' said Geoff Petrie, the Sacramento Kings' general
manager. ``You've got to figure you're going to be paying tax if
you do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando general manager John Gabriel said, ``It may impact
future signings even more. Without balloon payments and ways to
offset the cap by reworking deals in certain seasons, you can't be
as creative as you once were. With the restrictions and the tax,
you better know what you're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rice is clearly the No. 1 commodity on the market, his
stock has fallen enough recently that the potential for the Lakers
swingman to secure the maximum-allowable deal from another team is
beginning to look slim.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tracy McGrady can sign with any team after the
season, the Raptors' forward is not on the block. Toronto general
manager Glen Grunwald has apparently made a concerted effort to
hold onto McGrady in hopes he will become attached to the franchise
and want to re-sign this summer.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Radojevic's Family Ties
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, entourages and hangers-on are part of the landscape.
Young players who come into money often share their wealth and new
opulent lifestyle with friends from the neighborhood, if for no
other reason than to repay their childhood loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Alek Radojevic is no different. The 7-foot-3-inch Toronto
Raptors rookie brought his posse to town recently, and it made for
one of the more touching reunions of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic's posse is his family from Montenegro, an unstable
republic in the former Yugoslavia. In October, his sister, Zeljka,
30, joined him in Toronto. In January, his mother, Ilinka, and twin
brother, Zelimir, 23, left their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   They all fled Montenegro and drove to Budapest, where Radojevic
had arranged for the Canadian Embassy to grant them temporary
visas. Another sister, Ana, who lived in Quebec, moved to Toronto
to be with the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I always wanted, for every one to be here with
me,'' Radojevic said. ``The visas run out in a few more months, but
I'm doing everything in my power to keep them here. It is bad
situation in my country right now. I don't want them to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic has yet to play in a NBA game. He underwent surgery
for a herniated disk in his back in January. That has not stopped
him from setting milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for a Kansas junior college for a season after coming to
the United States, Radojevic went from being potentially drafted
into the Serbian army and fighting in Kosovo to being drafted into
the NBA. He became the highest-drafted Eastern European player ever
last June when the Raptors made him the 12th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic also won the first arbitration case in the history of
the NBA and FIBA, basketball's international governing body. In a
dispute over whether he was still under contract with a team in
Montenegro, Radojevic and his agent, Marc Cornstein, flew to London
with Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief counsel at the time.
Mishkin convinced an independent arbitrator that the contract with
the foreign team was invalid, enabling Radojevic to sign with
Toronto last August.
</P>
<P>
   He will be sitting at the end of the Raptors' bench on Wednesday
when Toronto and Vince Carter come to Madison Square Garden. With
his family safe at home in Toronto watching, Radojevic will not
play. But he has already proved how big and strong you have to be
to play in this league.

   SC-PRIMARY (Charleston, S.C.) _ South Carolina voters turned out
in record numbers Saturday to decide the hard-fought primary battle
between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
populist insurgent hoping to stage a second come-from-behind upset.
Bush needed victory to reassure worried supporters and prove he
remains electable in November after his surprise defeat in the New
Hampshire primary. McCain looked for an upset to catapult him into
success in Michigan's primary on Tuesday and to persuade
Republicans that his appeal to independents and Democrats gives the
GOP a better chance to recapture the White House in November. By

DAREDEVILS SKIP LUGE TO PROMOTE SKELETON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Jimmy Shea is riding a major adrenaline
high, he says. And it's not from his usual 80 mile-an-hour slide
down a banked ice chute.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, a Lake Placid resident and champion World Cup racer in a
sport known as skeleton, has gone from alternately training and
bartending to being anointed as something of a star for the 2000
Winter Goodwill Games, Ted Turner's made-for-television, five-day
multisport spectacle that concludes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more than 250 athletes from 20 countries
competing in such sports as skiing, figure skating, snowboarding,
ski jumping and speed skating, the world's best male and female
skeleton racers from North America and Europe are having their own
two-day, two-heats-each-day fest here at the new $20 million Mount
Van Hoevenberg Olympic bobsled and luge facility.
</P>
<P>
   For Shea, who leads the men's skeleton after Saturday's two
runs, that means national television exposure and likely national
team and individual sponsorship. That means no more duct tape
holding his racing suit and sled together, and no more late shifts
at a few of this resort town's bars and restaurants in between
training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very exciting,'' said Shea, 31, after sharing the
stage at the opening ceremony earlier in the week with Turner, Gov.
George Pataki and other celebrities. ``Still, there's so many
stronger athletes here than me, and they deserve a lot more
recognition. I'm really honored, really I am, and I am just happy
to promote my sport, to make it better for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Traditional sliding sports include luge
and bobsled, but skeleton racing is the one that most resembles
children on Flexible Flyers sledding on a snowy neighborhood hill.
The similarity ends there. International skeleton racers ride a
lugelike sled, but unlike luge racers who slide feet first on their
backs to limit the risk of injury, skeleton racers slide headfirst,
face down, their chins a few slim inches from the ice surface.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton sled's steel runners are also rounded, unlike those
on the luge and bobsled, which are sharpened for maximum control.
At speeds illegal on any highway in the United States, keeping the
sled straight is no small feat on the twisting, mile-long course.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a child's sled, the skeleton sled has no steering.
Skeleton racers, resembling human rockets, slide with their arms
compressed to their sides, adjusting their course with slight
shifts of weight.
</P>
<P>
   Each slider wears only a Lycra speed suit and helmet, although
many wear duct tape on their suits to cover abrasions to shoulders,
elbows and knees. It's no wonder that this sport has a reputation
for attracting racers that are part athlete (note the sprint and
jump start) and part masochist (note the unpadded, concrete
embankments on the ice track).
</P>
<P>
   With no major sponsor or Olympic participation in decades, the
ragged look of skeleton racers has made them stepchildren among
traditional winter sliding sports. ``That is changing,'' Shea said,
``especially with the Goodwill Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting, a producer of the event, is featuring
skeleton on its prime-time telecasts, and used Shea in many of its
promotions for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   This has cemented skeleton's bid for credibility, along with its
recent inclusion as a medal sport in the next Winter Olympics, to
be held in Salt Lake City in February 2002. (Skeleton was dropped
as an Olympic event after the 1948 Winter Games.)
</P>
<P>
   Shea plans to compete for the United States in 2002 in Salt Lake
City. Shea's grandfather, Jack Shea, won two gold medals in speed
skating in the 1932 Winter Olympics, and his father, Jack Jr., was
a Nordic combined skier for the 1964 Olympic team in Innsbruck,
Austria. This would make Shea the first third-generation American
Olympian, according to skeleton officials.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton at the Goodwill Games is the end of the 2000 season
for Shea. The experience has been uplifting, he said, especially
after a World Cup finish of seventh; he placed first the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Shea has one more goal here: ``I am going to try to get Ted
Turner on a sled. That would be so cool.''

 &HT;    He has the cars, the drivers, the crew but not the Cup

<P>
   HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. _ The building is a gem set among the piney
woods in the Huntersville Business Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sleek and modern, it would not be out of place as an addition to
Atlanta's High Museum. But this is one of the new temples of
stock-car racing, the Joe Gibbs place.
</P>
<P>
   It has all the trappings of success, including the big mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   A trophy case holds trinkets that Joe Gibbs gathered during his
NFL coaching career: Super Bowl rings, the coat he wore for
induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a leather jacket from
the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Another window displays trophies that Bobby Labonte has won in
the Gibbs-owned No. 18 Pontiac. Another window is filling up fast
with Tony Stewart items _ helmets, photos, trophies and his Winston
Cup Rookie of the Year award. Still another window shows off Gibbs'
cars in drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the trophy cases: a 160-seat auditorium with a mega-watt
sound system, a break room where the Gibbs race team takes weekly
Bible study with the on-staff chaplain, a health club for both men
and women employees and a picture window overlooking a garage so
spotless you could picnic among the race cars.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing obviously missing is a Winston Cup Championship
Trophy. But that's almost a given. It is here that media sentiment,
if not the general public, already has delivered a loving cup,
anointing Gibbs' team as the powerhouse favorite in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, the boss says; we haven't won anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's success suddenly has positioned Gibbs as the most
formidable team in Winston Cup. Labonte finished second in the
point standings in 1999, winning five races. Stewart set a Cup
rookie record by winning three times and finished fourth in points.
Gibbs' two Pontiacs won four of the last five races.
</P>
<P>
   It took Gibbs nine years to achieve overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, everybody pictures this as instant success
for us,'' Gibbs said. ``I just want to say this has been one long,
hard deal. Think about it: This thing is nine years of guts, blood
and hard work, and we still haven't won a championship. I tell
everybody it's amazing, and I'm not bragging, but I won a Super
Bowl the second year I was a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gibbs certainly likes his chances this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think prior to last year, when we were a single-car team, if
you rated our race team, we could win races but we were not one of
the teams that race in that top three or four every week that's
able to win a championship,'' Gibbs said. ``The highest we finished
was fourth one year. I think what happened last year was for the
first time Bobby's team took a big leap forward in consistency.
Winning races is very important, but being there every week and not
having the big mistakes is just as big. ``I think we've got one of
the best pit crews. Our team won the pit-crew challenge (last
year). You've got to have a great motor program; we think we have
that now. You've got have great crew chiefs, people to run the
program. Great engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, all these little pieces have to be put together, and I
think for the first time last year we showed that we were
consistent enough to say that we can run for a championship. That's
the exciting thing about this year.''
</P>
<P>
   FROM TURF TO TRACK
</P>
<P>
   The pieces have been falling nicely into place for Gibbs' racing
operation since it began with Dale Jarrett behind the wheel in
1992. But the answer to the question _ What's a football coach
doing in stock-car racing? _ goes all the way back to Gibbs'
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in moonshine country in Mocksville, N.C., grew up
near Asheville. His dad was a deputy sheriff and later the
alcohol-and-beverage inspector for Buncombe County.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the deputy sheriff's department was like five
guys having a ball,'' Gibbs said. ``My dad had two major auto
wrecks, and he had to run the radio for six months. He'd take me
down to the office, and I'd listen to them all night. They'd be
laughing and chasing bootleggers all over town.''
</P>
<P>
   His first ride in a fast car came in the first or second grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me up one day and got a call over the radio that
there was a bus going out of town with a fugitive on it. He went
through town, up on the side of curbs, and chased this bus down. I
think he totally forgot I was sitting back there. I remember being
scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to California when Gibbs was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there, in the '50s, it was like the movie `Grease.'
Everybody had a street rod, and everybody was running around town
at the local hamburger joints and at the local drag strips, drag
racing. I got hooked on cars. I had every kind of street rod: a '49
Mercury, I had a '32 Ford Victoria, I had a '37 Chevy, I had a '27
Model T. Then I got off into drag racing.''
</P>
<P>
   His dates with Pat, who eventually became his wife, were
Saturday nights at the Lions drag strip. ``It was just part of the
culture, and I got sucked up into that and loved it,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   His other love was football, but Gibbs thought that when he
finished playing at San Diego State he might become a race-car
driver. The school offered him a coaching job. He took it. When he
left for a job at Florida State a few years later, Gibbs sold all
his cars. ``I said, `Well, I guess I'll just be a big race fan my
whole life,' '' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was toward the end of his 12-year career as the Redskins'
coach that Gibbs first considered getting into racing as a team
owner. ``My son, J.D., was just coming out of college and he told
me, 'Dad, I don't want to go into coaching,' '' Gibbs said. ``He
was too smart for that; he saw that life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a life that had consumed Gibbs to the point of physical
exhaustion. He was away from home so much that Pat would make him
audio tapes announcing the latest adventures of J.D. and his
younger brother, Coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to J.D., 'What do you think about us trying to start a
race team? Could we talk your mother into that?' '' Gibbs said.
``So we started the process of trying to talk Pat into letting us
start a race team.'' An idea five years in the making was put into
place within eight months.
</P>
<P>
   TWO CARS BETTER THAN ONE
</P>
<P>
   The first season, Gibbs was an absentee owner, still coaching
the Redskins. But the building blocks for his race team were being
assembled. Jarrett brought along his brother-in-law, Jimmy Makar,
as crew chief. They didn't win a race in Chevrolets the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, 1993, Jarrett won the Daytona 500 and finished
fourth in points. But the following season, Jarrett fell back to
16th in points and asked out of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a key part of the equation,'' Gibbs said,
``because I told Dale, `We've got an existing contract. You can't
leave unless I can get somebody we're really happy with.' We did
research and research and research, and it worked out through a
wild set of circumstances that we were able to get Bobby Labonte.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was driving for Bill Davis, but his future appeared
shaky because of sponsorship problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's been a crucial part of everything that's happened from
that point on,'' Gibbs said. ``He had not won a race to that point.
The next year, he won three with us, and it's been kind of steady
progress from that point on.''
</P>
<P>
   The next key part to the equation was Gibbs' decision to switch
from Chevys to Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said we were nuts,'' he said. ``At that point Pontiac,
really, was fairly mediocre. We sat down and talked about going to
Pontiac. Our thought was, if we stay in Chevrolets, obviously,
Hendricks is always going to be in front of us. They've won
championships; they deserve to be in front of us. Childress has won
a bunch of championships. So chances are if we stayed in Chevrolet,
the best we could hope for is third, fourth, when it came to
getting resources or being considered for technical things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did make a move to Pontiac, there was a chance to maybe
distinguish ourselves and maybe get more resources and put
ourselves in a better position with GM.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the two genius moves: Adding a second car and picking
Stewart to drive it. Gibbs, his son, J.D., Labonte and Makar were
all in on the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we determined what the advantages of doing it would be,
we all agreed that money wasn't necessarily the No. 1 reason to do
it,'' Makar said. ``We didn't want to create a second team that
would just be a B-team or a No. 2 team. Bobby and I both said if we
are gonna do this, we wanted a team of equal caliber of what we
have today, to help us grow, not for us to grow them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's when we decided one thing we're going to have to
have is a great race-car driver,'' Makar said. ``We can't settle
for just anybody to put in the car. We made a short list of names
of five or six guys to give to Joe to go after. Tony was very, very
high on the list. We were real fortunate to get him. He was one of
the guys we went after first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made the transition from Indy Racing League open-wheel
cars to stocks look easy, although he didn't win any of the 22
Busch races in which he understudied in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding the second team was a big deal because Bobby's best
finish, I think, had been sixth before that point,'' Gibbs said.
``With the addition of Tony, the two-team thing has helped both
cars. It's helped Bobby. You've got two drivers; you've got two
crew chiefs; you've got two crews, (and) you've got more resources
to solve problems every week when you go to the race track.
</P>
<P>
   'WHOEVER CAN WIN, WINS'
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs contends that his two-car operation is unlike others; it's
an equal opportunity situation. ``We decided to have both of them
under one roof. Both teams are here, both crew chiefs sit next to
each other down there. Both drivers know they get the same cars
built by the same people. Most of the people in this building work
on both cars. They don't work on one car. It's not separated. Only
the road crews are separate. Bobby and Tony know they get the exact
same motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's some differences based on the driver's
capabilities and feelings in the car, but I think what's different
about us is we try to make it really one team. We try to make sure
we don't have the in-fighting. Now, they're both very competitive.
There are no deals; (when) it comes down to the end, whoever can
win, wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs experienced that first-hand last season at Homestead, when
Stewart tapped Labonte's side on his way to the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both going for it,'' Gibbs said. ``They'd run one
and two all day, and Bobby at that point happened to be leading,
but Tony had led up until then and had led the most laps. He goes
in first; his pit crew did a great job. When he came out of there,
he didn't see cars, he didn't see nothing, he was just going for
it. Both of them hit out on the race track and scared me to death.
I think it shows the competitive spirit of both these guys. I don't
think either one of them is going to let somebody else win a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   BILLS COME FAST, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs marvels at how his new life has fallen into place. He got
out of coaching because it was pulling him away from his family.
J.D. is the company president; he and Coy will race some in the
truck and Busch divisions, and Pat gets to a lot of races. ``We've
got two grandbabies just arrived on the scene, a 2-year-old and a
6-week-old,'' Gibbs said. ``All those things for me in this life
are much better than what football could be.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different is the business pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in motorsports is the race owner is the
hardest job to try and make a living,'' Gibbs said. ``I think any
race owner will tell you that. People say, 'Well, you've got this
big building.' And I say, 'Yeah, I've got a lot of debt because of
this big building.' The sweat's trying to pay this off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won Atlanta a year ago and won $125,000. The pro golfer
that week won $370,000. I took 14 people to the race track and
probably spent $200,000. That's an example of the inequities. I
knew what it was when I got in it, but I'm saying this is a
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe isn't complaining. ``I tell everybody, `` Gibbs said,
``if something happens to me tomorrow, just put on the tombstone:
'I had a ball.' ''

SYDNEY IS LAST HURRAH FOR SAMARANCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Juan Antonio Samaranch left Sidney on
Friday, apparently convinced that the 2000 Summer Games here would
be ``the greatest Olympics ever'' and thus a monument to his 20
years as president of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney program of 28 sports, 292 events, 635 sessions and
10,200 athletes will make it the largest Olympics ever.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's tenure officially ends in July 2001, but in effect
it ends at Sydney's closing ceremony on Oct. 1. Samaranch, 80, will
have little or nothing to do with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City or the 2004 summer games in Athens, where preliminary
work is also under way.
</P>
<P>
   This past week as he looked around Sydney's main Olympic site,
the 110,000-seat Stadium Australia, Samaranch had reasons for
confidence some 200 days out from the opening ceremony there on
Sept. 15. The $425 million stadium, the largest in Olympic history,
and a dozen other new facilities nearby, are ready for competition
after months of testing by athletes, spectators and organizers in
pre-games meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney could run the games tomorrow,'' said Dick Pound of
Canada, the Olympic committee's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials are projecting a similarly rosy outlook
about the financial future of the Olympic movement and developments
in drug detection tests for competitors in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in place to have an excellent games,'' said
Jacques Rogge, the IOC's chief coordinator. ``For for the first
time, everything is ready six months in advance. That is a
record.'' Making his sixth visit to Sydney in three years, Rogge
said finishing downtown transportation and recruiting temporary and
volunteer workers are the main tasks left.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been some stumbles, including recent problems
with ticketing and the budget. Sydney's minister for the Olympics,
Michael Knight, made a financial point about a possible $20 million
revenue gap by greeting Samaranch at the airport with a minibus,
rather than the usual stretch limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall, about 1 percent of the overall $2 billion budget,
could shrink or spread, depending on ticket sales, which have been
slowed by computer and management errors.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, a target for several years of criticism about
financial misconduct within his ``Olympic family,'' urged
journalists here not to exaggerate IOC and Sydney problems. ``Tell
the truth, and the truth here is that the news is good,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of the week for the committee was the return to
the Olympic financial fold of the John Hancock insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Its president, David D'Alessandro, has been the most critical
corporate advocate of change in the committee's structure and for a
cleanup of its corruption-prone system of inspecting cities
competing to stage Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, D'Alessandro, an Olympic sponsor since 1993,
suspended a $20 million television agreement with NBC, the main
Games broadcaster, saying, ``Corporations should keep the IOC's
feet to the fire on reform and withhold new sponsorships until we
see what the reforms are.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, D'Alessandro turned down the heat.
</P>
<P>
   He renewed a $50 million agreement with the IOC as a global
sponsor through the 2004 Games. He also resumed negotiations with
NBC for spots on its Sydney coverage, which the network says has
already attracted $750 million in advertising, about $80 million
more than for the Games in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro thinks the committee, which forced out 10 members
and censured others for accepting gifts from aggressive promoters
of Salt Lake City's bid, has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement the committee released here, D'Alessandro said:
``For the IOC to regain confidence it had to become more democratic
and accountable. The IOC has listened to voices for change and
addressed the issues. It deserves credit for this progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said the Hancock renewal was a ``testament to the
reforms we made last year.'' These include new procedures for
choosing IOC members, eight-year terms for members and elimination
of member visits to bidding cities.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is the fifth sponsor to sign up for the 2002-4
program. The others are Coca-Cola, Visa, Time Warner and Sema
Computers.

11,000-acre land trust of 18th century working farms and Civil War
plantation houses. The trust was set up 30 years ago as a federal
National Historic Landmark. ``We're fighting for our survival,''
says Ely, a founder of the trust. (Shana Raab/The New York Times)

U.S. MOVES TO EXPEL CUBAN DIPLOMAT LINKED TO SPYING CHARGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States on Saturday ordered the expulsion
of a Cuban diplomat linked to a U.S. immigration official charged
on Friday with spying for the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said that the
diplomat, whom he did not identify, was given seven days to leave
the United States for activities ``incompatible with his diplomatic
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that Felix Wilson, the acting head of the Cuban
interests section _ an embassy in all but name _ was summoned to
the State Department by Charles Shapiro, the coordinator of Cuban
affairs, and told that the diplomat was being expelled.
</P>
<P>
   When expulsions like this are made, the targeted country usually
retaliates by expelling a diplomat from the country that sent off
the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the likelihood of such a reprisal, Foley said: ``We
don't see any grounds for that. Our diplomats are operating in an
open and acceptable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Cuban interests section, Luis Fernandez,
said: ``It depends. They need to convince our government that they
have proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley declined to identify the expelled diplomat. ``He is making
arrangements to depart and it doesn't serve any interests to
identify him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and Cuba do not have formal
diplomatic relations, they are represented in each other's country
by an interests section under the flag of another country, in this
case Switzerland. It is a sort of intermediate diplomatic
severance. In the cases of Iran or Serbia, for example, the United
States does not even have an interests section.
</P>
<P>
   The American charged with spying, Mariano M. Faget, is a senior
official in the Miami field office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. He was born in Havana and left Cuba for the
United States as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it arrested him late Thursday after he was caught
passing along to a Cuban-born New York businessman false
information that U.S. officials had fed him about a Cuban
intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they could not recall another case in
which a government official was charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
   Faget's arrest further complicated Cuban-American relations
already strained by the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old boy who survived his mother's drowning when she fled
Cuba with him in November. Elian's relatives in Florida are trying
to continue custody of the child in the United States over the
objections of his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cuba mission Saturday, Fernandez, the spokesman,
referring to Elian's case, said: ``This is a very dirty maneuver to
try to create a smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he knew Faget, Fernandez said he did not but
that the interests section might have. ``We are in contact with
many persons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview whether the expulsion would hurt
relations between the two countries, Fernandez said, ``This is a
very traumatic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Cuba and the United States have generally
improved in recent years after the setbacks brought on by the rise
of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1996, Cuba expelled Robin Meyer, a U.S. diplomat
with the political-economic section of the American interests
section in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer had worked in Cuba for two years, tracking dissident
groups, meeting openly with their members and delivering them
messages of moral support from the United States. Cuba charged then
that Meyer had carried out activities incompatible with her
diplomatic status. In response, the United States expelled Jose
Luis Ponce, the Cuban interests section's spokesman in Washington.

 &HT;    Inside NHL: A quick look at last week's big stories in the NHL
and what to watch for during this week.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Top teams in the Eastern and Western conferences
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. New Jersey: The Devils lost only twice in a span of 14 games
amid stories of the team being sold and possibly moved. We assume
this means coach Robbie Ftorek will not be fired after all.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto: Finally hit a slump (four-game losing streak). But
better that the young Leafs go through this now than when the
playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia: General manager Bobby Clarke has added Keith
Primeau and Gino Odjick. But one player keeps this team from being
a powerhouse: goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   4. Florida: Goalie Trevor Kidd is on the verge of returning to a
team few have been able to slow down. If Kidd regains form,
Panthers will challenge for the conference lead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ottawa: The Senators jumped to an 11-4-1 start and have been
a .500 team since. There is no indication they will try to move
holdout Alexei Yashin before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   6. Washington: The Capitals may have been on the verge of being
dismantled until their recent run. After a 3-1 loss to the
Thrashers on Jan. 6, the Caps went 14-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pittsburgh: Ivan Hlinka will replace Herb Brooks, who
replaced Kevin Constantine, who may resurface in Minnesota. Jaromir
Jagr may be great but Penguins aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   8. N.Y. Rangers: They began playing up to their talent level
(nine wins in 10 games) about the time coach John Muckler was
supposed to get fired, but they've had two bad games since the
break.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis: Continuing to win despite the absences of injured
stars Pierre Turgeon and Al MacInnis. The Blues have a league-best
19-8-2 road record after winning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   2. Detroit: Reason to be nervous: Goalie Chris Osgood is only
8-8-2 since returning from a broken hand. But general manager Ken
Holland said to forget about the trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dallas: Considering this team's injury problems, it's amazing
the Stars have one of the league's five best records. Dallas is 9-2
since a 3-1 loss at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   4: Colorado: Injuries to Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic and Co. have
resulted in only 25 goals in a 12-game span (3-6-3) before a 5-5
tie with New Jersey on Thursday. But Forsberg is back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix: A familiar problem has returned to the Coyotes:
goal-scoring. But that's what happens when Keith Tkachuk sprains an
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   6: Los Angeles: After fast start, the Kings dropped to .500 last
month and looked like they were destined for also-ran status. But
they've won six out of seven.
</P>
<P>
   7. Edmonton: How does Glen Sather keep doing it with a
shoestring budget? The Oilers went 3-0-2 on a recent trip,
including a win vs. the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   8. San Jose: Sharks are sinking fast. They've won only four of
14 _ those against the Mighty Ducks, Lightning, Thrashers and
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   _ Mighty Ducks winger Teemu Selanne: He had a 12-game
point-scoring streak (seven goals, 14 assists) entering the weekend
for Anaheim and passed the 700-point plateau last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Islanders forward Mariusz Czerkawski: Something positive on
Long Island. He has seven goals, 12 assists and 41 shots on goal
during a 12-game point streak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo: Unbeaten in his past six starts
and has allowed two or less goals in eight of his past nine.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton's Alex Selivanov: He has two goals in his past 54
games and was lectured by coach Kevin Lowe last week for lackluster
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kings defenseman Aki Berg: Los Angeles general manager Dave
Taylor went to great lengths to sign the free agent from Finland in
the offseason. But Berg's play has been erratic and coach Andy
Murray even has made him a healthy scratch of late.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the kind of game typical of a New Jersey-Colorado
meeting. But the teams played to a 5-5 tie Thursday night in New
Jersey in the game of the week _ something for tie-knockers in the
league office to take note of. ``It was the kind of game you don't
see too often in the league any more,'' Peter Forsberg said. ``It
was a great game to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Jere Lehtinen's most recent surgery on his ankle means
he won't return until April 2 at the earliest. But Stars general
manager Bob Gainey denies he is pursuing either Mark Messier or
Doug Gilmour to fill a hole up front.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you call playing for a contract: Kirk Mueller was
signed by Dallas for a base salary of only $190,000 _ exactly 10
percent of what he earned last season ($1.9 million). But he will
earn more than $200,000 in playing time incentives and has been
signed to a $750,000 extension. ``We brought him in on kind of a
let's-see-what-you've-got left-in-the-tank tryout,'' assistant GM
Doug Armstrong said. ``Obviously, there's quite a bit left.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur, on trade rumors that have the
Devils moving Brendan Morrison, Lyle Odelein or others and
importing Teemu Selanne: ``(GM) Lou (Lamoriello) has built an
empire here. If it's not going to make us better, he's not going to
move guys just to move them or get a big-name player. When you're
going good the way we are, it's hard to judge and say you have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Tucker, traded from Tampa Bay to Toronto, should cash in
several incentive bonuses he never would have reached with the
Lightning. They include: $40,000 for finishing third in the
conference up to $90,000 for first; $15,000 to $100,000 for each
playoff round won, leading up to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour on the Stanley Cup hangover: ``Everyone
knows how short the summers are for a Stanley Cup champion team and
guys don't train too much in the summer. There's a lot of
celebrating. So I think when we come to training camp, most of us
aren't too motivated. Sometimes it can lead to a slow start. We got
off to a slow start and, adding to that, we had all of the
injuries. It took us a while to get back in the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   _ The Flames, who built an improbable winning record because of
their overtime success (10-0-1), have lost four in a row in
overtime and were winless in 10 consecutively overall (0-9-1)
</P>
<P>
   _ Rangers coach John Muckler tried to play three defensemen
every time Florida's Pavel Bure was on the ice, with Brian Leetch
shadowing the Russian star. But Bure scored anyway and the Panthers
won easily 3-0. Bure said: ``I was just trying to pull Leetch out
of the zone to create more room for my teammates. Calgary played
against me the same way in the 1994 playoffs. It basically became a
four-on-four game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kings' Luc Robitaille scored his 545th goal moved him past
his boyhood idol, Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard into 18th on the NHL's
career list. Robitaille's immediate reaction: ``This will never
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   _ Nashville defenseman Jan Vopat might be forced to retire
because of a rash that players have nicknamed ``The Gonk.'' The red
blotches on Vopat's skin, which have baffled doctors, bring
swelling, itching and bleeding. ``It's very frustrating,'' Vopat
said. ``It's one thing if you break your leg because you say, `OK,
I'll be back in a couple of months.' But with this, I can just hope
that it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida, which talked to the Thrashers about defenseman Darryl
Shannon before passing on him, is now focusing on Vladimir
Malakhov, who is out of favor in Montreal. Malakhov was suspended
briefly by the Canadiens after skiing when he was supposed to be
rehabbing from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Panthers goalie Trevor Kidd, coming back from a dislocated
shoulder, will start his minor-league conditioning assignment today
with a start for Louisville (AHL) in Hershey, Pa. It will be his
first start since Dec. 11, before he was injured in a skills
competition. His first start likely will be at Carolina on
Thursday. ``I told him going down is for the peace of mind for
himself and for me,'' GM Brian Murray said. ``It's just different
than practice.''

 &HT;    A bumpy ride for journalists
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John McCain was feeling two things when he got back
aboard his campaign bus last week for a ride into Atlanta. He was
feeling good after a well-attended event at a park on the shores of
Lake Keowee near Seneca, S.C. And he was feeling hungry.
</P>
<P>
   And, soon, both those feelings had gone. A pork barbecue
sandwich took care of the hunger. Questions from two experienced
Atlanta journalists, WSB's Bill Nigut and The Atlanta
Constitution's Cynthia Tucker, sparked the mood change.
</P>
<P>
   Nigut and Tucker, not regular riders on the Straight Talk
Express, got what has become a rare glimpse of the candidate's
famous temper.
</P>
<P>
   With the whine of the bus motor as background noise, Tucker
prefaced a question by saying the Arizona senator was an
``ultra-conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Good move journalistically. Bad way to break the ice with a
candidate seeking the votes of political moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insulting to the people of Arizona to say I'm
ultra-anything,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Nigut attempted to draw McCain into a discussion
about school vouchers, which McCain supports.
</P>
<P>
   Nigut, Atlanta television's pre-eminent political voice, is
nothing if not insistent. So he presented one counterargument, then
another and another.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take McCain long to accuse Nigut of being on the side
of teachers unions, which oppose voucher programs.
</P>
<P>
   He began one comment with a sarcastic ``My dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Nigut said, ``I'm trying to clarify ...''
</P>
<P>
   McCain broke in, ``You're not doing very well at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Nigut's turn to get steamed, and it showed in his
face. Brighter shades of red may not occur in nature, but Nigut's
voice at least did not betray any irritation.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, McCain's staff had taken note of the increasingly
unpleasant atmosphere in the back of the bus. They soon summoned
the candidate to the front of the bus, away from the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned after several minutes, McCain's mood was much,
much better. And, an hour after that, when the ride ended in
Atlanta, he apologized for being rude.
</P>
<P>
   `GEORGE E.' TAKES REVENGE ON NIT-PICKERS
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has acknowledged that their candidate has been
retooled and repackaged for the crucial South Carolina primary. Now
it looks like he has been renamed.
</P>
<P>
   The daily schedule passed out on the press bus every evening
looked a bit different Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip of Governor George E. Bush to Charleston, South
Carolina,'' said the headline.
</P>
<P>
   And the attached schedule was for the coming to an end rather
than for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The press corps, which never makes a mistake, was ruthless in
holding the errors up for on-bus
</P>
<P>
   ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Last laugh, of course, went to the campaign staff. The 6 a.m.
baggage call for the next morning was not a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMSON RALLY HAS LANGUAGE ALL ITS OWN
</P>
<P>
   For Clemson football fans, it would have been a familiar sight.
Loudspeakers thumped out ``Tiger Rag'' as cheering fans spelled out
the school's name. A supportive gantlet of students formed a
welcoming line for the arriving stars, who made their way through a
thick haze generated by a smoke machine.
</P>
<P>
   Those weren't linebackers and running backs who got this
treatment Wednesday night, but Rep. Lindsey Graham, Gary Bauer and
the big star of the evening, Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign hoped to attract younger voters to the
primary, and this rally at Clemson's amphi- theater was aimed
squarely at the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two more days, guys, we're going to rock their world,''
Graham told the mostly student audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain slyly thanked the students for taking time from ``your
heavy academic duties'' and promised the ``patriotic young South
Carolinians'' they would be the ``foot soldiers'' of a movement to
clean up Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us. It's great fun,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students already on board wore a T-shirt that might have
puzzled outsiders, but would also be familiar to Tiger fans.
</P>
<P>
   With a pawprint outlined in red, white and blue, it said,
``Pawsitively McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM OF SPEECH _ FOR SOME, AT LEAST
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in the news media?'' Gov. George W. Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not,'' Samuel T. Ross-Lee said. ``I am a Christian
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   So unwound a testy exchange between Bush and Ross-Lee at a
campaign event Tuesday in Irmo. The exchange highlighted Bush's
ongoing discomfort with some of the thornier questions he gets from
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Lee wanted to discuss Bush's stance on the Confederate
flag. Bush repeated his position that the people of South Carolina
should decide whether to stop flying the flag from the Capitol.
When Ross-Lee pressed Bush, the
</P>
<P>
   overwhelmingly white audience shouted him down and Bush told him
to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in answer to another question, Bush
applauded the First Amendment. ``Freedom of speech ... gives a
chance for everybody to stand up and state their opinion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Reel, 37, said she was on the fence before the exchange,
but is now thinking of voting for John McCain. ``For Bush to tell
him to sit down really bothered me,'' Reel said. ``The way he asked
the question was very clear and I don't think Bush was being very
clear in his answer.''
</P>
<P>
   UNACCUSTOMED MOOD IS SIGN OF THE TIMES
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Election Commissioner Jim Hendrix braked Friday
driving past the Statehouse, a usually placid site transformed by
Bush and McCain supporters shouting and waving campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists honked horns in a blast of anxious excitement in the
showdown for South Carolina's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the most amazing thing I've ever seen,'' Hendrix said.
''Usually we don't see that much enthusiasm. It has been amplified
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacked one upon another, as high as campaign workers could
reach, placards transformed utility poles around Columbia into
totem poles of red, white and blue. Street corners were planted in
signs.
</P>
<P>
   People plastered cars and vans in signs. Bush placards decorated
a Buick Roadmaster at the polling place at Irmo Middle School,
where voters began arriving as early as 6:30 a.m. to stand in line.
</P>
<P>
   First in line was C.W. Bowman, 53, who had arrived an hour
before the polls opened and waited in his pickup truck drinking
coffee until poll workers arrived.

HIGH YIELD STARTS FAST ON ROAD TO DERBY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ High Yield, a well-traveled son of Storm Cat
who traveled from California to Florida this week, won the Fountain
of Youth Stakes Saturday and took the lead among this season's
3-year-old horses traveling the tortuous road to the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The colt, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, withstood pressure from
Hal's Hope, the surprise winner of the Holy Bull Stakes last month,
and drew clear by 3 1/4 lengths, winning for the third time in 10
career starts. Hal's Hope finished behind him, three lengths in
front of Elite Mercedes, third by the length of his neck over
Greenwood Lake, who made up 20 lengths to finish fourth.
</P>
<P>
   They still have a long way to go before the Derby at Churchill
Downs on May 6, and no dominant horse has emerged. But High Yield,
with Pat Day riding him for the first time because Jerry Bailey and
Corey Nakatani were committed elsewhere, heads for Louisville with
the proper seasoning and pedigree. He seems a little like Cat
Thief, last year's star of the Lukas barn, who ran frequently, lost
frequently but won some big ones. High Yield ran second in his last
two starts and third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the
Champagne, and had not won since the Hopeful at Saratoga last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only beat the horses that show up, and a lot of them
didn't show up,'' Lukas said. ``But we represented the West Coast
horses very well. We'll keep him in the East now. He'll be an East
Coast horse. He'll go to the Florida Derby. We know where we want
to go. We just have to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has won the Kentucky Derby four times, and three times in
the last five years. Now he is back with a star colt, High Yield,
and a star filly, Surfside. And he said, ``We know our way around
Churchill Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield led most of the way after breaking from the fourth
slot in the gate, with Hal's Hope right on his heels, a length and
a half back after half a mile and three lengths back after
three-quarters of a mile. Then he challenged High Yield as they
turned for home, but High Yield, clinging to the fast lane along
the rail, shook him off and won in a driving finish.
</P>
<P>
   He covered the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:42 2/5, paid $6.80
for a $2 bet as the favorite and earned $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on him before,'' Day said later. ``But Wayne
said he was sharp. There was some other speed in there but Wayne
said if we broke well, to go on with it; don't give up what comes
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was generally a coming-of-age tailored for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   In an allowance race called the Unbridled, with the purse raised
to $75,000 to attract horses who might not be ready for the
Fountain of Youth, Nick Zito scored with his 8-1 shot, Bare
Outline, a colt owned by William Condren and ridden by Corey
Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
   He outran the favorite, Tahkodha Hills, by a length and a
quarter, while Grundlefoot, aiming for the Kentucky Derby, finished
fourth and Wayward Ways pulled up lame leaving the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   In a later allowance, Cot Campbell's Dogwood Stable unleashed
its prodigy, Trippi, who won his second straight with exceptional
speed. The colt, a son of End Sweep and grandson of Forty Niner,
won his debut last month by nearly five lengths. And he won his
second start by more than nine lengths, displaying the breakaway
power of his namesake, the onetime running star of Georgia
football, Charley Trippi. He is trained by Todd Pletcher, and Jerry
Bailey has been his jockey in both winning starts.

 &HT;    Inside NHL: A quick look at last week's big stories in the NHL
and what to watch for during this week.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Top teams in the Eastern and Western conferences
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. New Jersey: The Devils lost only twice in a span of 14 games
amid stories of the team being sold and possibly moved. We assume
this means coach Robbie Ftorek will not be fired after all.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto: Finally hit a slump (four-game losing streak). But
better that the young Leafs go through this now than when the
playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia: General manager Bobby Clarke has added Keith
Primeau and Gino Odjick. But one player keeps this team from being
a powerhouse: goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   4. Florida: Goalie Trevor Kidd is on the verge of returning to a
team few have been able to slow down. If Kidd regains form,
Panthers will challenge for the conference lead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ottawa: The Senators jumped to an 11-4-1 start and have been
a .500 team since. There is no indication they will try to move
holdout Alexei Yashin before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   6. Washington: The Capitals may have been on the verge of being
dismantled until their recent run. After a 3-1 loss to the
Thrashers on Jan. 6, the Caps went 14-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pittsburgh: Ivan Hlinka will replace Herb Brooks, who
replaced Kevin Constantine, who may resurface in Minnesota. Jaromir
Jagr may be great but Penguins aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   8. N.Y. Rangers: They began playing up to their talent level
(nine wins in 10 games) about the time coach John Muckler was
supposed to get fired, but they've had two bad games since the
break.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis: Continuing to win despite the absences of injured
stars Pierre Turgeon and Al MacInnis. The Blues have a league-best
19-8-2 road record after winning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   2. Detroit: Reason to be nervous: Goalie Chris Osgood is only
8-8-2 since returning from a broken hand. But general manager Ken
Holland said to forget about the trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dallas: Considering this team's injury problems, it's amazing
the Stars have one of the league's five best records. Dallas is 9-2
since a 3-1 loss at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   4: Colorado: Injuries to Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic and Co. have
resulted in only 25 goals in a 12-game span (3-6-3) before a 5-5
tie with New Jersey on Thursday. But Forsberg is back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix: A familiar problem has returned to the Coyotes:
goal-scoring. But that's what happens when Keith Tkachuk sprains an
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   6: Los Angeles: After fast start, the Kings dropped to .500 last
month and looked like they were destined for also-ran status. But
they've won six out of seven.
</P>
<P>
   7. Edmonton: How does Glen Sather keep doing it with a
shoestring budget? The Oilers went 3-0-2 on a recent trip,
including a win vs. the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   8. San Jose: Sharks are sinking fast. They've won only four of
14 _ those against the Mighty Ducks, Lightning, Thrashers and
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   _ Mighty Ducks winger Teemu Selanne: He had a 12-game
point-scoring streak (seven goals, 14 assists) entering the weekend
for Anaheim and passed the 700-point plateau last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Islanders forward Mariusz Czerkawski: Something positive on
Long Island. He has seven goals, 12 assists and 41 shots on goal
during a 12-game point streak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo: Unbeaten in his past six starts
and has allowed two or less goals in eight of his past nine.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton's Alex Selivanov: He has two goals in his past 54
games and was lectured by coach Kevin Lowe last week for lackluster
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kings defenseman Aki Berg: Los Angeles general manager Dave
Taylor went to great lengths to sign the free agent from Finland in
the offseason. But Berg's play has been erratic and coach Andy
Murray even has made him a healthy scratch of late.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the kind of game typical of a New Jersey-Colorado
meeting. But the teams played to a 5-5 tie Thursday night in New
Jersey in the game of the week _ something for tie-knockers in the
league office to take note of. ``It was the kind of game you don't
see too often in the league any more,'' Peter Forsberg said. ``It
was a great game to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Jere Lehtinen's most recent surgery on his ankle means
he won't return until April 2 at the earliest. But Stars general
manager Bob Gainey denies he is pursuing either Mark Messier or
Doug Gilmour to fill a hole up front.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you call playing for a contract: Kirk Mueller was
signed by Dallas for a base salary of only $190,000 _ exactly 10
percent of what he earned last season ($1.9 million). But he will
earn more than $200,000 in playing time incentives and has been
signed to a $750,000 extension. ``We brought him in on kind of a
let's-see-what-you've-got left-in-the-tank tryout,'' assistant GM
Doug Armstrong said. ``Obviously, there's quite a bit left.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur, on trade rumors that have the
Devils moving Brendan Morrison, Lyle Odelein or others and
importing Teemu Selanne: ``(GM) Lou (Lamoriello) has built an
empire here. If it's not going to make us better, he's not going to
move guys just to move them or get a big-name player. When you're
going good the way we are, it's hard to judge and say you have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Tucker, traded from Tampa Bay to Toronto, should cash in
several incentive bonuses he never would have reached with the
Lightning. They include: $40,000 for finishing third in the
conference up to $90,000 for first; $15,000 to $100,000 for each
playoff round won, leading up to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour on the Stanley Cup hangover: ``Everyone
knows how short the summers are for a Stanley Cup champion team and
guys don't train too much in the summer. There's a lot of
celebrating. So I think when we come to training camp, most of us
aren't too motivated. Sometimes it can lead to a slow start. We got
off to a slow start and, adding to that, we had all of the
injuries. It took us a while to get back in the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   _ The Flames, who built an improbable winning record because of
their overtime success (10-0-1), have lost four in a row in
overtime and were winless in 10 consecutively overall (0-9-1)
</P>
<P>
   _ Rangers coach John Muckler tried to play three defensemen
every time Florida's Pavel Bure was on the ice, with Brian Leetch
shadowing the Russian star. But Bure scored anyway and the Panthers
won easily 3-0. Bure said: ``I was just trying to pull Leetch out
of the zone to create more room for my teammates. Calgary played
against me the same way in the 1994 playoffs. It basically became a
four-on-four game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kings' Luc Robitaille scored his 545th goal moved him past
his boyhood idol, Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard into 18th on the NHL's
career list. Robitaille's immediate reaction: ``This will never
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   _ Nashville defenseman Jan Vopat might be forced to retire
because of a rash that players have nicknamed ``The Gonk.'' The red
blotches on Vopat's skin, which have baffled doctors, bring
swelling, itching and bleeding. ``It's very frustrating,'' Vopat
said. ``It's one thing if you break your leg because you say, `OK,
I'll be back in a couple of months.' But with this, I can just hope
that it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida, which talked to the Thrashers about defenseman Darryl
Shannon before passing on him, is now focusing on Vladimir
Malakhov, who is out of favor in Montreal. Malakhov was suspended
briefly by the Canadiens after skiing when he was supposed to be
rehabbing from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Panthers goalie Trevor Kidd, coming back from a dislocated
shoulder, will start his minor-league conditioning assignment today
with a start for Louisville (AHL) in Hershey, Pa. It will be his
first start since Dec. 11, before he was injured in a skills
competition. His first start likely will be at Carolina on
Thursday. ``I told him going down is for the peace of mind for
himself and for me,'' GM Brian Murray said. ``It's just different
than practice.''

BATON PASSED TO BIG STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now the bitter struggle for the Republican presidential
nomination _ freed from ground wars in small, idiosyncratic states
like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina _ enters an entirely
new phase.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign this week moves into the major population
centers, it is being fought by two candidates whose political
identities have been transformed by the first phase, which ended
when the ballots were counted in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important, the struggle between Governor George W.
Bush of Texas and Senator John S. McCain of Arizona is for the
nomination of a party that itself has been transformed _ utterly,
deeply, perhaps irrevocably _ by the events of the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose victory Saturday came at a time when he was closer
to elimination from the GOP race than his advisers dared admit
publicly, is a far different candidate now that he has had to fight
for the nomination than he was when he believed it simply would be
handed to him. McCain, whose loss came at the end of an 18-day
period in which he dominated American political discourse, has been
transformed into a reformist icon in dire need of a win.
</P>
<P>
   These two men _ an easy, mild charmer who has become a pugilist
and an intuitive, fiery conservative who has become a populist
beloved by moderates and fascinating to liberals _ now go forward
in their effort to lead a party that is struggling to come to grips
with the uncomfortable possibility that its nominee could steer it
into the uncharted waters of reform.
</P>
<P>
   And _ almost lost in the wild swings from Iowa to New Hampshire
and then to South Carolina _ a nation that viewed politics as the
province of the professionals and as a hopeless bore may be
awakening from its decade-long slumber. A poll released last week
by the Pew Research Center showed a dramatic increase in public
interest in the campaign in the past month, with the steepest gain
coming among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend belongs to Bush, of course, for halting the
Arizonan, whose dramatic 19-point victory in New Hampshire made him
a brilliant, streaking comet in the winter sky and transformed
McCain into that most rare of American political phenomena: a
proper name that stands for a movement. Bush's victory, which of
course could be rendered an ephemeral detour if he loses Michigan
and Arizona only two days from now, is nonetheless a triumph of the
party establishment that rallied to his cause and that, for a half
century, has ruled Republicans in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, no less than the campaign and the party, has been
affected by McCain and his intoxicating idiom of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Texas governor, who began by talking about
``compassionate conservatism,'' then by emphasizing ``prosperity
with a purpose,'' now speaks of being a ``reformer with results.''
He was saved Saturday by his blue-chip allies, but he knows that
the support of elected officials and a relaxed sense of destiny may
have been enough to prevail in earlier GOP campaigns but is neither
necessary nor sufficient to win in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCain does not recover this week or on March 7, when
California, New York, New England, Ohio, and other states vote, he
has left his mark on the campaign, party and nation. He remains the
only political figure in a generation, with the possible exception
of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who has inspired outsiders, lured the
disillusioned to registration desks and polling places, and changed
the debate. By asking uncomfortable questions he jarred a
comfortable candidate, a comfortable party and a comfortable
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now the campaign's outcome is more uncertain than it has been at
any time since the first soundings began, two summers ago, in a
political atmosphere that is completely unrecognizable now.
</P>
<P>
   And a curious logic has set in. The small states have explored
the nature and character of the candidates. But their tentative
reactions to them _ an embrace of Bush in Iowa, a wild fling with
McCain in New Hampshire, a reconciliation with Bush in South
Carolina _ have served only to defer the final decision to the
bigger states, where the population more nearly reflects the
country and where the campaign will more nearly resemble the
general election in the autumn. The small states have passed
judgment _ and one of those judgments is that the decision should
be passed on, to bigger states and at least for a short while
longer.

REFORM MESSAGE SAID KEY TO TEXAN'S SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The news was good Saturday, but there were no
early celebrations in the George W. Bush camp. Even Bush, learning
of his substantial lead after the first wave of exit poll results,
gave the mildest possible reaction: He settled down for an
afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   But as the votes were being counted it was clear Bush and his
aides felt buoyed by the preliminary South Carolina primary
results, which showed Bush ahead among registered Republicans and,
perhaps just as important, indicated he had somewhat neutralized
support among Independents and Democrats for his chief opponent,
Senator John S. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after his surprisingly large loss in the New Hampshire
primary, Bush burst back onto the campaign trail with a slew of new
campaign posters and the retooled message of ``reformer with
results,'' which he delivered tirelessly straight through Saturday
afternoon. The problem in New Hampshire, Bush said, was that he
allowed McCain to claim the ``reform'' title. He also vowed not to
``be defined'' by his opponent, as he felt he had been.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, aides said Bush had clearly reclaimed the mantra of
reform for himself, and had succeeded in conveying his track record
of change in Texas. Aides even began to recast the New Hampshire
loss as a blessing in disguise, having forced Bush to hone his
ideas into a campaign platform with which people could identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at him and saw how he handled adversity, and saw
how he passed through this test, and liked it,'' senior adviser
Karl Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said McCain had not helped himself any with a negative
campaign ad comparing Bush to President Clinton. That ad, he said,
was a ``substantial'' mistake. ``And it's a stain that can't be
easily washed away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove and other Bush aides refused to concede that their own ads
about McCain may have affected the outcome. Since last week, only
Bush was running ads about his opponent. McCain had pulled his
negative ads, saying he thought the tenor of the race had gone too
far. Bush, along with several outside groups such as the National
Right to Life Committee, had been running ads that mentioned McCain
by name, and in several cases, cast him as an outright hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rove insisted, Bush's success was attributable to the
candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what made the difference between New Hampshire and South
Carolina, Rove said: ``Bush returning to his roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran in 1994 as a candidate who desired to make four big
changes, four big reforms, he talked about it endlessly, used the
word `reform' endlessly,'' Rove said. ``I think that was a big part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove delivered news of the early exit poll results to Bush at
1:40 p.m. Saturday, as the Texas governor was resting in his room
at the Columbia Sheraton. Bush asked whether Rove thought the
numbers would hold up. Then, Rove said, Bush ``settled down for a
power nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, Bush went for a 5-mile run with two of
his media advisers, Mark McKinnon and Matthew Dowd. When Bush
returned to the hotel, he sat down for a speechwriting session.

MCCAIN'S S.C. BID FINISHES WHERE IT BEGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Ending his hard-fought and crucial South
Carolina campaign where he began it _ with fellow war veterans _
Arizona Senator John McCain called on ``my comrades'' to undertake
``one more mission'' and vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to win this election, but it's going to be
dictated by voter turnout,'' McCain told a Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Greenville, S.C., Saturday morning. ``I'm asking you
to go on one more mission and make sure you and everybody you know
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, however, McCain knew the majority of South
Carolinians had not voted for him. In Charleston, McCain took a
long nap to prepare for what his friend, former New Hampshire
senator Warren Rudman, said was a 48-hour sprint ahead, to the
Michigan and Arizona primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a very solid guy, and defeats are part of politics,''
Rudman said, adding that McCain had taken ``one of the greatest
negative assaults'' he could recall in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a thousand tomahawks in the air, and it was hard to
fight off every one of them,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political
director.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not have been higher, as the former POW and
political maverick who won a spectacular victory in the New
Hampshire primary 20 days ago needed to show here that he was no
shooting star but the candidate with the staying power to stop
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers insisted that McCain would press on, probably
through March's primary-heavy schedule, and they predicted that he
would win Tuesday's contests in Michigan and his home state.
</P>
<P>
   A big turnout of Democrats and independents propelled McCain in
New Hampshire. Saturday, McCain woke up to polls that showed Bush
with a solid lead overall and to calls from supporters who
suggested Republican Party operatives were making it hard for
independents and Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain aides, more than 20 polling places in
largely Democratic, African-American neighborhoods of Greenville
did not open as planned Saturday, and voters were rerouted to a
``consolidated'' precinct. Weaver accused the GOP chairman in
Greenville County of closing polling places the party had agreed to
staff under the federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not charge anyone with trying to suppress turnout,
but he did call for an investigation and said he was unhappy voters
had been denied access to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disappointing that anyone, anywhere, is deprived of
the ability to vote,'' McCain told reporters as he prepared to
leave Greenville for Charleston. ``It's just not fair. It's not in
keeping with the principles of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who got into an acrimonious debate with Bush over who
was running the dirtier race, told the veterans he was proud of his
campaign in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we prevail today, but if we don't, we know we have
taken the honorable way,'' said McCain, who last week directed his
staff to pull some negative ads off the air. ``I am proud of the
way we have conducted this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver refused to second-guess the campaign's decision to pull
the negative ads, even as Bush bombarded South Carolinians with a
harshly anti-McCain message. He said the decision was McCain's, and
``it was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's John's campaign, and he did not want to wake up, or have
his family wake up, and feel dirty about it,'' said Weaver, adding
that Bush had ``penalized'' his efforts with the kind of campaign
he ran here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great man,'' said Johnnie Robinson, a past state
commander of the VFW.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, too, seemed moved by what he called ``this wild ride,''
which Saturday included his wife, Cindy, their four children, two
grown sons from a first marriage, and a busload of friends from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm very old, in the old soldiers' home with my feet up
on the railing,'' McCain said, ``I'll look back on the South
Carolina experience and say, `that was an incredible part of my
life.' ''

 &HT;     BUSH DEFEATS McCAIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, EXIT POLLS SHOW   
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL And DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   CHARLSTON, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively revived
his flagging front-runner campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, exit polls showed Saturday, fighting off a scrappy
challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the South Carolina
primary and catapulting their bitter struggle into big state
showdowns beginning with Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush rode to victory on a tidal wave of
GOP voters who turned out in record numbers across the
predominantly conservative piedmont region to overwhelm McCain's
less-than-expected support among many non-Republican voters who
could legally vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was projected on the basis of interviews
conducted by Voter News Service as voters left their polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   By winning here in a southern state that has voted reliably
Republican in eight of the last 10 presidential elections, Bush
energized a campaign that had been stunned by McCain's upset
victory in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. The Bush win helps him
allay campaign donors' anxieties, stem threatened defections by
worried Republican office holders and stun McCain's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had hoped to parlay his come-from-behind victory in
New Hampshire into a second upset here, came away from the contest
with ample evidence that he appeals to the independents and
Democrats who can vote in 16 of the next 24 GOP presidential
primaries. McCain vowed to carry on with his populist insurgency at
least until Super Tuesday, March 7, when New York, California and
Ohio join 13 less populous states to hold primaries and caucuses
that could settle the struggle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's triumph in an 18-day slugfest stemmed in part from a
shift in strategy from being a tax-cutting ``compassionate
conservative'' who lost to McCain by 19 percentage points in New
Hampshire to becoming a ``reformer with results'' who ardently
courted the state's religious and social conservatives and
challenged McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at conservative Bob Jones University where
inter-racial dating is prohibited and he refused to challenge the
GOP platform's call for an absolute ban on abortions, even though
he favors exceptions to save the mother's life or to end
pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to the right risked alienating the
middle-of-the-road voters who often decide the outcome of the
industrial state primaries that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based Republican pollster who is not
working for any GOP presidential candidate, said the victory
enables Bush to retain ``the mantle of the front-runner,'' adding:
``It's a tremendous boost for Bush. It allows you to say that once
again, the nomination is Bush's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory is expected to help entice a sorely needed
infusion of campaign donations into a fast-spending juggernaut that
has already spent more than $50 million of the $68 million in
donations. He heads into Michigan where three-term Gov. John Engler
has vowed to deliver the state to Bush. Bush's hand is also
strengthened in follow-on contests in Virginia and Washington on
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said Bush's victory may be seen in hindsight as ``the
turning point that enabled Bush to go on to victory,'' adding:
``This is too big a victory for McCain to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan
Politics newsletter and a radio talk show host, said the magnitude
of Bush's victory in South Carolina could discourage turnout by the
independents and Democrats that McCain is counting upon to keep him
competitive in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude now might be 'Why bother to vote?''' Ballenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain showered South Carolina's 2.1 million registered
voters with more than $5.9 million worth of often hard-nosed
campaign ads during the longest presidential primary campaign in
state history. Previously, South Carolina held its primary just
four days after New Hampshire's.

</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a 20-year history of picking Republican
winners. The GOP winner in South Carolina has never failed to go on
and capture the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush built his win on a healthy core
Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of voters Saturday identified themselves as
Republicans. Among them, 68 percent said they voted for Bush and 26
percent said they voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did better than expected among independents, who along
with Democrats were free to cast ballots in the state's Republican
primary. Exit polls showed that fewer independents and Democrats
turned out than McCain had hoped for. Just 30 percent of the voters
were independents and 9 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to carry 35 percent of the independent voters _ a
far stronger showing among independents than Bush scored in New
Hampshire where he won only 19 percent of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said that McCain's reach for independents and Democrats
may have backfired. `McCain dropped any pretense of being a
Republican candidate for the Republican nomination,'' said Sabato.
`He went much too far in encouraging Democrats and independents to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``played to win rather than playing not to loose, like in
New Hampshire,'' said Ayres, adding that Bush had succeeded in
shifting voters' focus away from McCain's heroic biography as a
Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam to his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's agenda is much less compelling to Republican
audiences, whether its taxes or campaign finance reform,'' Ayres
said. ``This is going to buck up the Bush forces big time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained early in the day that state GOP officials had
failed to open many precinct-voting stations where Democrats and
independents lived, including 21 polling stations in Greenville
County. South Carolina law requires party officials to staff
polling places. Of the state's 1,700 polling places, 1,454 were
open _ twice the number that were open for the 1996 GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disappointing that anyone anywhere in South Carolina
is deprived of the ability to vote,'' McCain said. ``That's just
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials consolidated 21 polling places in Greenville
County at the last minute, requiring voters to travel to
alternative sites. ``From the reports we're getting everywhere,
everything is goingsmooth,'' said state GOP director J. Sam
Daniels.

 ANALYSIS: BUSH WON BY STEALING McCAIN'S MESSAGE  
(rk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Shortly after President George Bush lost his
re-election bid in 1992, George W. Bush told a friend that his
father ``should never have let Bill Clinton dictate the terms of
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, the younger Bush did not make the same
error. Having been trounced by Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the
New Hampshire primary, having been branded as the stick-in-the-mud
candidate, Bush came to South Carolina, recast himself as a
hard-nosed conservative, as an outsider and as a reformer who gets
results. McCain, the Texan and his surrogates suggested, was a bit
too liberal, too Beltway-bound and too flaky.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, in other words, stole McCain's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   He righted his campaign, regained the momentum he enjoyed before
New Hampshire and re-emerged as a strong favorite to win the
Republican presidential nomination. Severely wounded here, McCain
will have a chance to rebound in the voting on Tuesday in Michigan,
where the ideological coloration of the electorate may be more
favorable to him, and he has vowed to fight on in what could
develop into a drawn-out struggle, not unlike the one between
Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford in 1976. But the electoral calendar
grows more favorable to Bush as it moves through March.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, a survey of voters in Saturday's Republican
primary suggested, were seen as reformers, but when they were
pitted against one another, Bush was seen as the more effective one
_ precisely as he had portrayed himself in a late blitz of
television commercials here.
</P>
<P>
   Other commercials flailed away at McCain's advocacy of campaign
finance reform. Nearly half the voters said that the senator says
one thing and does another when it comes to campaign finance, and
they were mostly Bush backers. That was a second building block of
the governor's victory.
</P>
<P>
   A third was his apparent success in capitalizing on a major
error by McCain, an intemperate commercial in which he compared
Bush to President Clinton. By election day, voters were more likely
to see McCain than Bush as an unfair aggressor, even though McCain
had come into the state with a reputation as a proponent of cleaner
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's television blitz, which dangerously depleted his
treasury, appeared to have paid off among those who made their
voting decisions in the frantic final hours of the campaign here.
About a third of the voters told interviewers as they left the
polls that they made up their minds in the last week or so, and
most went to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the critical failure was an inability to broaden the
electorate sufficiently. Knowing that he was trailing Bush among
the state's unusually conservative Republican voters, he made an
unabashed appeal to Democratic and independent voters to cast
ballots in the Republican primary, hoping that the absence of a
Democratic primary would make it easier to attract those groups.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed last week to create ``a new Republican party'' in South
Carolina by bringing thousands of new voters into the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few Democrats crossed over. McCain got eight out
of ten of their votes, but they constituted less than a tenth of
the electorate, not enough to have a major impact. Likewise among
independents, who constituted about a third of those who cast
ballots Saturday. McCain took about twice as many of their votes as
his principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Republicans accounted for only a slightly smaller
percentage of the electorate than they did four years ago, marking
a signal lack of success for McCain's efforts. The electorate was
nearly all white, more than half male and older than most, with
four voters in ten over 60.
</P>
<P>
   One important element in the relatively modest crossover vote
was the decision by black voters, who form the backbone of the
modern Democratic Party in this state, to resist any suggestion
that they vote in the Republican primary. Only 1 percent of the
voters were black, in a state where blacks make up a quarter of the
electorate in general elections. They told interviewers earlier
this week that the two candidates' had forfeited any claim on their
support by refusing to condemn the flying of the Confederate flag
over the state capitol building in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his loss in New Hampshire, Bush boldly
announced that South Carolina was ``Bush country.'' His aides
calculated that the same party organization that carried his father
to victory in 1986, originally assembled by former Gov. Carroll
Campbell, would do the same for him. They proved prescient. Voters
told interviewers that they prefer a candidate who is loyal to the
Republican Party and has ties to its local leaders, and they
overwhelmingly saw Bush as embodying that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also succeeded in portraying himself as the more reliable
foe of abortion in a state where opposition to abortion is strong.
Nearly two-thirds of the most vehement anti-abortion voters went to
Bush; in New Hampshire, competing in a more crowded field, he got
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not gain the upset he had hoped for here, McCain
rode his New Hampshire victory to something approaching parity with
Bush in financial terms. Now, with only two days to campaign, he
will go after the conservative white voters known as Reagan
Democrats in the counties clustered to the north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has a long history of backing protest candidates and
insurgents, like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who won the 1988
Democratic caucuses here. Its Republicans are less conservative
than South Carolina's. And Gov. John Engler, who used to talk about
providing an asbestos wall there to protect Bush, has been sounding
a much different note lately.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Michigan, the governor said the other day, likes to be
taken for granted and to be told that one candidate is a certain
victor.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan is followed by a big group of primaries on March 7,
the most important of which, New York's and California's, are
effectively closed to all but Republican voters. Among the big
states voting on that day, only Ohio's is open _ a considerable
advantage for Bush. Then on March 14, Texas, his home base, and
Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, will cast their votes.
As the nation's second and fourth largest states, they will wield
considerable influence at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Had McCain won here, none of those details would have mattered
nearly as much. As he himself exulted this week, ``If we win here,
I don't see how we really can be stopped.'' But he could not bring
it off.

 &HT;     BUSH DEFEATS McCAIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, EXIT POLLS SHOW   
 &HT;     (EDS: New material in grafs 4-8, with McCain conceding defeat;
details of vote.)   (For use by New York Times News Service
clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLSTON, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively revived
his flagging front-runner campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, exit polls showed Saturday, fighting off a scrappy
challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the South Carolina
primary and catapulting their bitter struggle into big state
showdowns beginning with Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush rode to victory on a tidal wave of
GOP voters who turned out in record numbers across the
predominantly conservative piedmont region to overwhelm McCain's
less-than-expected support among many non-Republican voters who
could legally vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was projected on the basis of interviews
conducted by Voter News Service as voters left their polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment and I'm excited,'' Bush told reporters
shortly after 7 p.m. when the polls closed and exit polls projected
his win. ``This will have a very positive effect in Michigan.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a phone call from McCain at 7:08 p.m. conceding the
race. ``I'm very
</P>
<P>
   greatful for the phone call,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how far he has come since his defeat in the Feb. 1
New Hampshire Primary, Bush said: ``I fell down in the snow (in New
Hampshire, but) I knocked the snow off my suit and came down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that 9 percent of those voting Saturday
were Democrats. Of those, 82 percent supported McCain and 16
percent said they voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed that 31 percent of voters were
independents. Of those, 34 percent were for Bush and 61 percent
were for McCain. That's a much bigger-than-expected margin for
Bush. In New Hampshire among independents, McCain got 61 percent
and Bush got 19 percent. Among Democrats in New Hampshire, Bush got
10 percent and McCain got 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By winning here in a southern state that has voted reliably
Republican in eight of the last 10 presidential elections, Bush
energized a campaign that had been stunned by McCain's upset
victory in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. The Bush win helps him
allay campaign donors' anxieties, stem threatened defections by
worried Republican office holders and stun McCain's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had hoped to parlay his come-from-behind victory in
New Hampshire into a second upset here, came away from the contest
with ample evidence that he appeals to the independents and
Democrats who can vote in 16 of the next 24 GOP presidential
primaries. McCain vowed to carry on with his populist insurgency at
least until Super Tuesday, March 7, when New York, California and
Ohio join 13 less populous states to hold primaries and caucuses
that could settle the struggle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's triumph in an 18-day slugfest stemmed in part from a
shift in strategy from being a tax-cutting ``compassionate
conservative'' who lost to McCain by 19 percentage points in New
Hampshire to becoming a ``reformer with results'' who ardently
courted the state's religious and social conservatives and
challenged McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at conservative Bob Jones University where
inter-racial dating is prohibited and he refused to challenge the
GOP platform's call for an absolute ban on abortions, even though
he favors exceptions to save the mother's life or to end
pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to the right risked alienating the
middle-of-the-road voters who often decide the outcome of the
industrial state primaries that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based Republican pollster who is not
working for any GOP presidential candidate, said the victory
enables Bush to retain ``the mantle of the front-runner,'' adding:
``It's a tremendous boost for Bush. It allows you to say that once
again, the nomination is Bush's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory is expected to help entice a sorely needed
infusion of campaign donations into a fast-spending juggernaut that
has already spent more than $50 million of the $68 million in
donations. He heads into Michigan where three-term Gov. John Engler
has vowed to deliver the state to Bush. Bush's hand is also
strengthened in follow-on contests in Virginia and Washington on
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said Bush's victory may be seen in hindsight as ``the
turning point that enabled Bush to go on to victory,'' adding:
``This is too big a victory for McCain to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan
Politics newsletter and a radio talk show host, said the magnitude
of Bush's victory in South Carolina could discourage turnout by the
independents and Democrats that McCain is counting upon to keep him
competitive in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude now might be 'Why bother to vote?''' Ballenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain showered South Carolina's 2.1 million registered
voters with more than $5.9 million worth of often hard-nosed
campaign ads during the longest presidential primary campaign in
state history. Previously, South Carolina held its primary just
four days after New Hampshire's.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a 20-year history of picking Republican
winners. The GOP winner in South Carolina has never failed to go on
and capture the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush built his win on a healthy core
Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of voters Saturday identified themselves as
Republicans. Among them, 68 percent said they voted for Bush and 26
percent said they voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did better than expected among independents, who along
with Democrats were free to cast ballots in the state's Republican
primary. Exit polls showed that fewer independents and Democrats
turned out than McCain had hoped for. Just 30 percent of the voters
were independents and 9 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to carry 35 percent of the independent voters _ a
far stronger showing among independents than Bush scored in New
Hampshire where he won only 19 percent of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said that McCain's reach for independents and Democrats
may have backfired. `McCain dropped any pretense of being a
Republican candidate for the Republican nomination,'' said Sabato.
`He went much too far in encouraging Democrats and independents to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``played to win rather than playing not to loose, like in
New Hampshire,'' said Ayres, adding that Bush had succeeded in
shifting voters' focus away from McCain's heroic biography as a
Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam to his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's agenda is much less compelling to Republican
audiences, whether its taxes or campaign finance reform,'' Ayres
said. ``This is going to buck up the Bush forces big time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained early in the day that state GOP officials had
failed to open many precinct-voting stations where Democrats and
independents lived, including 21 polling stations in Greenville
County. South Carolina law requires party officials to staff
polling places. Of the state's 1,700 polling places, 1,454 were
open _ twice the number that were open for the 1996 GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disappointing that anyone anywhere in South Carolina
is deprived of the ability to vote,'' McCain said. ``That's just
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials consolidated 21 polling places in Greenville
County at the last minute, requiring voters to travel to
alternative sites. ``From the reports we're getting everywhere,
everything is goingsmooth,'' said state GOP director J. Sam
Daniels.

 &HT;    Champion begins quest for repeat with respect, confidence and a
revamped crew.
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The post-race victory lap around Atlanta
Motor Speedway was pleasurable. So was the special red-carpet tour
of New York City. He appeared on the David Letterman show and was
the keynote speaker at the NASCAR banquet in front of a national TV
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But winning the 1999 Winston Cup championship didn't really sink
in with Dale Jarrett until he was lying on his couch on a lazy
Sunday afternoon in January. Jarrett, a self-proclaimed golf
fanatic, was in awe watching Tiger Woods in the middle of his
remarkable winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, Tiger is great'' Jarrett said to his wife during a
commercial break. ``Wouldn't it be an incredible feeling to be on
top of your game and on top of your sport like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Several seconds of silence followed at the Hickory, N.C.,
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dale . . . ,'' Kelley Jarrett said slowly, ``You are in
your sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it took Jarrett nearly two months to comprehend his
celebrated accomplishments of last year. The Ford No. 88 driver had
such a dominating run that by mid-August most Winston Cup drivers
had given up on trying to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the trophy as champion of stock-car-racing's top circuit
was long overdue. Jarrett was the second-oldest NASCAR driver to
capture the title at age 42. He and his father, Ned Jarrett, a
two-time champion himself, joined Lee and Richard Petty as the only
father-son pairs to win Winston Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett finally was able to revel in the achievement during the
last month, but everything changes today when the engines are
cranked at the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of a strange feeling,'' Jarrett said. ``Everything
we accomplished and as good as we were last year, none of that
makes a difference anymore on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only difference now is that other people look at
us differently. Heck, we look at ourselves a little differently. We
walk with a little higher kick in our step and a little bit more
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jarrett has bagged the elusive title, the big question
is: Can he repeat as Winston Cup champion?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to win a championship every year, and it's really
hard to do it two years in a row,'' said Terry Labonte, who won
titles in 1984 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've seen a few guys who were able to do it two and
three years in a row, like Dale (Earnhardt) and Jeff (Gordon).
There is no reason Dale (Jarrett) can't do it, because they have
got a great team.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jarrett's championship run last year ended Gordon's
two-year streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've won a championship, you have to deal with a lot
more responsibility,'' Gordon said. ``You have got a lot of eyes on
you and your team. But at the same time, you've got a championship
team that knows how to win a championship, because they have done
it before.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates Racing, owner of the No. 88 team, has refused to
rest on last year's success and made a couple of bold moves to keep
the operation moving forward at full speed. Yates hired veteran
Ricky Rudd to drive the No. 28 Ford, with Rudd expected to be an
ideal teammate for Jarrett in knowledge and experience. Rudd is a
proven winner, even though his streak of at least one victory per
season for the past 16 years ended last season.
</P>
<P>
   In an even bigger move by Yates, he worked quietly behind the
scenes to hire away five members of Gordon's famed ``Rainbow
Warriors'' pit crew.
</P>
<P>
   So can Jarrett, who turned 43 during the offseason, repeat? ``I
think our chances are very good to repeat in 2000,'' crew chief
Todd Parrott said. ``But the competition is incredible, and it is
just going to get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett says there are 15 drivers capable of winning this year.
He thinks he is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success (of last season) has bred us into wanting more
success,'' Jarrett said. ``Once you have tasted it, you want more
of it. I told the people at R.J. Reynolds that I wasn't going back
to New York (if I didn't repeat). It wouldn't be any fun if you
didn't win.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Top teams in the Eastern and Western conferences
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. New Jersey: The Devils lost only twice in a span of 14 games
amid stories of the team being sold and possibly moved. We assume
this means coach Robbie Ftorek will not be fired after all.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto: Finally hit a slump (four-game losing streak). But
better that the young Leafs go through this now than when the
playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia: General manager Bobby Clarke has added Keith
Primeau and Gino Odjick. But one player keeps this team from being
a powerhouse: goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   4. Florida: Goalie Trevor Kidd is on the verge of returning to a
team few have been able to slow down. If Kidd regains form,
Panthers will challenge for the conference lead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ottawa: The Senators jumped to an 11-4-1 start and have been
a .500 team since. There is no indication they will try to move
holdout Alexei Yashin before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   6. Washington: The Capitals may have been on the verge of being
dismantled until their recent run. After a 3-1 loss to the
Thrashers on Jan. 6, the Caps went 14-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pittsburgh: Ivan Hlinka will replace Herb Brooks, who
replaced Kevin Constantine, who may resurface in Minnesota. Jaromir
Jagr may be great but Penguins aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   8. N.Y. Rangers: They began playing up to their talent level
(nine wins in 10 games) about the time coach John Muckler was
supposed to get fired, but they've had two bad games since the
break.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis: Continuing to win despite the absences of injured
stars Pierre Turgeon and Al MacInnis. The Blues have a league-best
19-8-2 road record after winning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   2. Detroit: Reason to be nervous: Goalie Chris Osgood is only
8-8-2 since returning from a broken hand. But general manager Ken
Holland said to forget about the trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dallas: Considering this team's injury problems, it's amazing
the Stars have one of the league's five best records. Dallas is 9-2
since a 3-1 loss at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   4: Colorado: Injuries to Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic and Co. have
resulted in only 25 goals in a 12-game span (3-6-3) before a 5-5
tie with New Jersey on Thursday. But Forsberg is back.
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix: A familiar problem has returned to the Coyotes:
goal-scoring. But that's what happens when Keith Tkachuk sprains an
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   6: Los Angeles: After fast start, the Kings dropped to .500 last
month and looked like they were destined for also-ran status. But
they've won six out of seven.
</P>
<P>
   7. Edmonton: How does Glen Sather keep doing it with a
shoestring budget? The Oilers went 3-0-2 on a recent trip,
including a win vs. the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   8. San Jose: Sharks are sinking fast. They've won only four of
14 _ those against the Mighty Ducks, Lightning, Thrashers and
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   _ Mighty Ducks winger Teemu Selanne: He had a 12-game
point-scoring streak (seven goals, 14 assists) entering the weekend
for Anaheim and passed the 700-point plateau last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Islanders forward Mariusz Czerkawski: Something positive on
Long Island. He has seven goals, 12 assists and 41 shots on goal
during a 12-game point streak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo: Unbeaten in his past six starts
and has allowed two or less goals in eight of his past nine.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton's Alex Selivanov: He has two goals in his past 54
games and was lectured by coach Kevin Lowe last week for lackluster
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kings defenseman Aki Berg: Los Angeles general manager Dave
Taylor went to great lengths to sign the free agent from Finland in
the offseason. But Berg's play has been erratic and coach Andy
Murray even has made him a healthy scratch of late.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the kind of game typical of a New Jersey-Colorado
meeting. But the teams played to a 5-5 tie Thursday night in New
Jersey in the game of the week _ something for tie-knockers in the
league office to take note of. ``It was the kind of game you don't
see too often in the league any more,'' Peter Forsberg said. ``It
was a great game to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING

   Dallas' Jere Lehtinen's most recent surgery on his ankle means
he won't return until April 2 at the earliest. But Stars general
manager Bob Gainey denies he is pursuing either Mark Messier or
Doug Gilmour to fill a hole up front.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you call playing for a contract: Kirk Mueller was
signed by Dallas for a base salary of only $190,000 _ exactly 10
percent of what he earned last season ($1.9 million). But he will
earn more than $200,000 in playing time incentives and has been
signed to a $750,000 extension. ``We brought him in on kind of a
let's-see-what-you've-got left-in-the-tank tryout,'' assistant GM
Doug Armstrong said. ``Obviously, there's quite a bit left.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur, on trade rumors that have the
Devils moving Brendan Morrison, Lyle Odelein or others and
importing Teemu Selanne: ``(GM) Lou (Lamoriello) has built an
empire here. If it's not going to make us better, he's not going to
move guys just to move them or get a big-name player. When you're
going good the way we are, it's hard to judge and say you have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Tucker, traded from Tampa Bay to Toronto, should cash in
several incentive bonuses he never would have reached with the
Lightning. They include: $40,000 for finishing third in the
conference up to $90,000 for first; $15,000 to $100,000 for each
playoff round won, leading up to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour on the Stanley Cup hangover: ``Everyone
knows how short the summers are for a Stanley Cup champion team and
guys don't train too much in the summer. There's a lot of
celebrating. So I think when we come to training camp, most of us
aren't too motivated. Sometimes it can lead to a slow start. We got
off to a slow start and, adding to that, we had all of the
injuries. It took us a while to get back in the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   _ The Flames, who built an improbable winning record because of
their overtime success (10-0-1), have lost four in a row in
overtime and were winless in 10 consecutively overall (0-9-1)
</P>
<P>
   _ Rangers coach John Muckler tried to play three defensemen
every time Florida's Pavel Bure was on the ice, with Brian Leetch
shadowing the Russian star. But Bure scored anyway and the Panthers
won easily 3-0. Bure said: ``I was just trying to pull Leetch out
of the zone to create more room for my teammates. Calgary played
against me the same way in the 1994 playoffs. It basically became a
four-on-four game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kings' Luc Robitaille scored his 545th goal moved him past
his boyhood idol, Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard into 18th on the NHL's
career list. Robitaille's immediate reaction: ``This will never
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   _ Nashville defenseman Jan Vopat might be forced to retire
because of a rash that players have nicknamed ``The Gonk.'' The red
blotches on Vopat's skin, which have baffled doctors, bring
swelling, itching and bleeding. ``It's very frustrating,'' Vopat
said. ``It's one thing if you break your leg because you say, `OK,
I'll be back in a couple of months.' But with this, I can just hope
that it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida, which talked to the Thrashers about defenseman Darryl
Shannon before passing on him, is now focusing on Vladimir
Malakhov, who is out of favor in Montreal. Malakhov was suspended
briefly by the Canadiens after skiing when he was supposed to be
rehabbing from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Panthers goalie Trevor Kidd, coming back from a dislocated
shoulder, will start his minor-league conditioning assignment today
with a start for Louisville (AHL) in Hershey, Pa. It will be his
first start since Dec. 11, before he was injured in a skills
competition. His first start likely will be at Carolina on
Thursday. ``I told him going down is for the peace of mind for
himself and for me,'' GM Brian Murray said. ``It's just different
than practice.''

 &HT;    In Michigan, McCain campaign urging primary cross-over to punish
governor
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Two separate efforts _ one by Sen. John McCain's
presidential campaign committee _ have begun in Michigan urging
Democrats to cross party lines and vote for McCain against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dayton Daily News obtained a post card the McCain
campaign in Michigan sent to a registered Democrat here in Flint,
urging Democrats to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III, a black Democratic
lawmaker from Detroit, is helping lead an effort to persuade
Democrats to vote for McCain to punish Republican Gov. John Engler,
leader of Bush's Michigan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the GOP primary and Democratic and
independent voters are considered crucial to McCain's efforts to
defeat Bush. Polls have shown Bush leading among likely Republican
voters, but McCain with a lead among all likely voters, including
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Democrats will chose their national convention
delegates in caucuses March 11 and neither Vice President Al Gore
nor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is on Tuesday's primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The post card sent to Democrats by the McCain committee says,
``The Democrats are not holding a presidential primary in Michigan.
But you can still make your vote count by voting in the Republican
primary on Tuesday, Feb.22.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your voice heard by voting for the one candidate
committed to reform. John McCain will reform the current
disgraceful and corrupting system of financing campaigns,'' the
card continues.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John J.H. Schwarz, a Battle Creek Republican and
McCain's Michigan chairman, said that the cards are consistent with
McCain's invitation to ``Republicans, independents and like-minded
Democrats'' to support him
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said that he did not know how many of the cards have
been mailed. He also said that he hoped that the cards would help
counter some of the Bush campaign's negative ads targeting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that Engler, a third-term governor, has mistreated
Democrats, particularly Detroiters. He cited Engler's role in
replacing Detroit's elected school board with an appointed board
among other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our chance to retaliate,'' Lemmons said. ``We
(Democrats) are in a minority. African-Americans are in a double
minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that fliers are being sent to Detroit-area churches
in predominantly black neighborhoods urging people to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Responding specifically to questions about Lemmons' campaigns,
Susan Shafer, Engler's deputy press secretary, said that they would
only re-energize the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks read these kind of things, it re-energizes them and
rejuvenates them as Republicans. We are deciding who are candidates
are going to be, not Democrats and independents. This is a
Republican primary,'' she said.

MICHIGAN THE FIRST REAL TEST FOR GOP HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ With a two-day burst in the Midwest, the
competition between Texas Governor George W. Bush and Arizona
Senator John McCain shifts to the first major industrial state of
the campaign with a population that dwarfs both South Carolina and
New Hampshire and a diverse economy that ranges from rust belt
industries to the market-makers of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   It is Michigan, the state that was supposed to be ``the
firewall'' where Bush would secure his nomination if anything went
wrong in earlier states. Now it may be McCain who must look to
Michigan for a saving win, a place to prove himself once again and
give new energy to his insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Michigan will take place against a backdrop of
idiosyncracies and internecine disputes peculiar to Michigan. And
the sheer size of the state and the limited time until Tuesday's
primary is likely to change the style of the campaign if not its
increasingly pugilistic tone, forcing the candidates to rely more
on television and less on the intimate, town meeting style that
McCain made famous in New Hampshire and that both candidates
transplanted to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain's New Hampshire victory, he has been leading Bush
in the polls in Michigan, though recently by narrowing margins. The
critical quantity is how, in the brief interval until Tuesday,
voters will digest what has happened in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a state that depends on other states to tell them
how to vote,'' said Del Chenault, Bush's state director. ``If
Michigan took its cues from other states, we'd have a President
Tsongas and a President Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Republican primary, which comes on the same day as
Arizona's, is open to all voters, regardless of party affiliation.
And because there will be no Democratic names on the ballot, many
people who might have voted for Al Gore or Bill Bradley may instead
weigh in on the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a golden opportunity for McCain,'' said Rhodes Cook,
an expert on the presidential nominating process, pointing to the
run of early states _ from New Hampshire to South Carolina to
Michigan, Washington state and Virginia _ that allow anyone to vote
in the GOP primary. ``It does make it a very intriguing situation
the Republican establishment probably didn't think it would be
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Bush campaign is hoping that Democrats and
independents stay out of the Republican fight. Governor John
Engler, who is leading the Bush effort in Michigan, recently sent
out a letter to Republican voters telling them that ``Al Gore and
the Labor-ites are trying to hijack our primary,'' according to
Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats voting in a Republican primary is probably not a
good thing, only because there's too much at play here that allows
the devil to do his handiwork,'' warned Ron Kaufman, a Bush
supporter who served as President Bush's political director in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, Engler, and other Bush partisans suspect some
Democratic groups and a few unions of organizing their members in
order to cause mischief.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a group calling itself ``D.O.G.G.-Engler,'' or
``Detroiters Out to Get even with Governor (John) Engler,'' is
urging pastors to tell their congregations to vote for McCain,
since the governor backs Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Engler and his Republican cohorts have not missed an
opportunity to meddle in the internal affairs of the city of
Detroit to the detriment of its citizens,'' the group said in a
letter to local ministers. ``Since turnabout is fair play, it's
about time that Detroiters meddle in the internal affairs of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   And Geoffrey Feiger, the flamboyant attorney who used to
represent Dr. Jack Kevorkian, has launched a radio campaign against
Bush and Engler, focusing on Bush's call for tort-law overhaul. The
spot is sponsored by Feiger's political action committee, Citizens
Against Dumb and Dumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John Engler and George W. Bush talk about lawsuit abuse,
they really mean they helped their friends in the insurance
industry and denied all of us access to the courts,'' the 60-second
ad says. ``Big businesses have contributed millions to Engler and
Bush. That's why Engler and Bush have protected these
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad concludes: ``Supporting Republican tort reform is dumb.
Now Engler wants you to support George W. Bush. That's dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot is running on Detroit-area radio stations. Feiger, who
ran for governor against Engler in 1998, is planning to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   These anti-Engler, anti-Bush vendettas have the Bush camp loudly
crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, in order to win in November, we want to be able to
attract conservatives and centrists Democrats and moderates and
independents,'' said Ralph Reed, a Bush adviser. ``We welcome them
to our banner. What does concern us is the extent to which there is
more systematic efforts by Democratic organizers and leaders to
come into the Republican primary with motives other than what's
best for our party.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain says those complaints are ignoring the larger point:
Republicans are in the minority and need to reach out to Democrats
to win back the White House, to hold onto Congress, and to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone in. Inclusion,'' he said, citing Ronald
Reagan's governing coalition that was made famous in Michigan with
the support of blue-collar, union, working, conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is, hold onto your principles and philosophy and
attract others to it,'' McCain said. ``Don't compromise your own
fundamental core beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush will also square off in Arizona on Tuesday.
Hoping to embarrass McCain on his home turf, Bush poured about $2
million into the state for advertising and organization. Arizona
Governor Jane Hull supports Bush, but McCain is sure to win the
state, along with its 30 delegates to the Republican convention.
Michigan sends 58 delegates, apportioned by congressional district,
to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving South Carolina Saturday night, the Republican
candidates entered a two-week, mad dash that will take them to
Washington and Virginia prior to their Feb. 29 primaries and
culminating on the March 7 ``Titanic Tuesday,'' with more than a
dozen primaries and caucuses from New York to California.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, which holds its Republican primary Feb. 29
and where polls indicate a very close race, the McCain campaign has
located its headquarters in West Seattle, home to mostly
independent and Democratic voters. The Bush people tend to work
from Bellevue, which is solid Republican country.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Bush campaign issues reams of news releases
touting the local and state officials who have endorsed the
governor's candidacy, the McCain campaign recently held a news
conference to present independents and Democrats voting for the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole campaign is geared toward Republicans,'' said
Ralph Munro, Washington's secretary of state and the McCain
chairman here. ``Our whole campaign is geared to Republicans,
independents, and Democrats. We're not ashamed of that.''

KNICKS BEAT PACERS, 87-73  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just the cellophane-thin Reggie Miller, but
upon the slightest contact, Chris Childs' upper body suddenly and
violently buckled out like a question mark, his head snapped back
and he hit the floor in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   A whistle cut in, and a foul was called on Miller. As the
Madison Square Garden crowd mocked its favorite foil from Indiana
Saturday, Childs bounced to his feet and all but cried out,
``Makeup!'' He had just out-acted one of the greatest flops on
Broadway, just upstaged the theatrical Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a call he normally gets,'' Childs said. ``He got a
taste of his own medicine on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one isolated moment of a third quarter, just one
more time when a crafty and undaunted team completely unnerved the
Pacers to such an extent that they never recovered as the Knicks
overwhelmed them, 87-73. It was a reminder of Game 6 from the
Eastern Conference finals last year, a flashback to when the
short-handed Knicks were held together with rubber bands and glue
but managed to hitch a ride on Allan Houston's supernatural touch
to advance to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was happening again. The makeshift Knicks, playing without
Charlie Ward and Marcus Camby, leaned on Houston as he turned a
7-point game at the half into a blowout by the end of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After a quiet half buried beneath foul trouble, and after making
the Knicks' big backcourt look less than threatening, Houston began
to exploit his mismatch with Indiana's Mark Jackson and defy Miller
to guard him as he let the jumpers fly. He hit his first five shots
of the third quarter and scored 13 of his 19 points during a 22-10
run the Knicks used to take a 70-53 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had no way to counter. Miller was being chased by
Childs _ who gave the big lineup a break and pushed the Knicks to
perform better _ and came unglued. Instead of his usual comeback,
Miller was shaken by how the officials had turned on him. All the
while, Houston kept demoralizing the Pacers, just as he did last
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get going like that, it just feels like you can pick
your shot,'' said Houston, who finished 9 for 14 from the field and
had 3 turnovers as the part-time point guard. ``You just don't feel
like you're going to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   As spectacular as Houston was on offense, the Knicks' defense,
leaning on the craftiness of Childs and the interior presence of
Patrick Ewing, were able to hold the Pacers to their lowest point
total of the season and held them to 34.2 percent from the field.
Perhaps if Rik Smits had played, the outcome would have been
different. But the Knicks simply built a lead and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Knicks had lost big leads in the fourth
quarter. And on Christmas Day in Indiana, they blew a lead early.
This time, the Knicks (31-19) held firm in one of their most
impressive victories of the season and pulled into a tie with Miami
for the Atlantic Division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just want to keep up with them,'' said Latrell
Sprewell, who was partly responsible for keeping Miller to a quiet
16 points. ``We want to leave Miami behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks found the matchups they wanted with the big lineup at
the start of the game but, incredibly, their bulky size lacked
rebounding. With Smits out with a sore back, the 6-foot-9 Austin
Croshere was left to start against Ewing, and Dale Davis was
lurking around Kurt Thomas. Somehow, Croshere and Davis found their
way to every loose ball and gave their team a stream of
second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was over for the first half. Houston was in foul
trouble and the flow was out of sync, so a change toward tradition
was made. With 4 minutes 51 seconds left in the first quarter and
the score tied, Childs came into the game and showed how efficient
a point guard can be. With 6 assists in 17 minutes, Childs led the
Knicks to a 46-39 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the coach wants,'' said Childs, who had nine assists
off the bench. ``By no means am I happy with a big lineup, but I'll
do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even take up acting.
</P>
<P>
   The second half gave the big lineup another chance. And Houston
erupted for 13 third-quarter points as he exploited his size over
Jackson in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had no answer for Houston. All Miller could do was
get Sprewell in foul trouble midway through the quarter. Even then,
the Knicks had Childs to turn to. Houston was cloaking Jackson,
Childs was chasing Miller and Davis couldn't make up for the
offensive void left by Smits' absence.
</P>
<P>
   The ragged Pacers, slow to recover in defensive transition,
watched as Larry Johnson turned a fast-break layup into a 3-point
play by finishing his shot and giving the Knicks a 68-52 lead with
1:34 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Childs drew the foul on Miller by flopping on
contact, the Pacers came unglued as the crowd got into it. The
Pacers, who scored only 3 points in the last six minutes of the
third quarter, found themselves in an unlikely hole, 70-53, at the
end of the period. Miller just shook his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Childs was taking him. Although Childs is not as solid and
error-free as Ward, he plays tougher defense and can push the ball
to Sprewell's liking. When Childs walked on the floor in the first
half, he took over the tempo of the game and guided the Knicks on a
22-9 run.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Miller, Croshere and Jackson weren't on the floor
during most of the Knicks' second-quarter run. Once they began
trickling into the game, the Pacers, who had scored only a single
field goal in six minutes, started finding their offense. Miller,
jumping and leaning into Sprewell and Houston, went to the
free-throw line, and the Pacers were quickly within 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   Childs wasn't flustered. He kept pushing the ball and creating
opportunities for the Knicks and himself, hitting a 3-pointer with
4:31 to put the Knicks back up by 10 points. But in another letdown
to end the first half, John Wallace, who picked up the offense, was
beaten in transition for two layups by Rose as a part of a 9-0 run
by the Pacers.

ON BASKETBALL COLUMN: A SHOOTING STAR AND A FALLING STAR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During player introductions at the All-Star Game last
week, Allan Houston walked through a pillar of smoke and under a
scaled-down model of the Golden Gate Bridge. He emerged on the
other side to a loud and prolonged ovation. It was the type of
applause reserved for perennial All-Stars, not first-time party
crashers. Houston looked at his teammates sheepishly, offering up a
``Who, me?'' shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised by it, but then you remember that we
were on TV last year during the finals and people got to know us a
little better,'' the Knicks shooting guard said Saturday afternoon.
Someone surmised Latrell Sprewell's counterculture following may
have pushed many fans to embrace Houston nationally, a good cop-bad
cop dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be it, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reception for Reggie Miller, meanwhile, was measured and
lasted perhaps a few seconds. Miller has always done the
incarnation of evil proud, playing the villain to the hilt. But it
wasn't about that. Instead of respecting his longevity, the crowd
at the Arena in Oakland seemed to be contemplating the merits of
Miller, as in, Reggie is still considered among the game's great
players? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the power of television, which kept showing those replays
of Houston's jump shot sailing over Miller in the Eastern
Conference finals last June. Maybe it's a combination of one
player's emergence as a prime-time force and another's decline in
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, sometime over the last year Houston became the premier
shooting guard in the conference and maybe all of the National
Basketball Association. And Miller time expired. Somewhere between
New York's pulsating Game 6 victory and Saturday afternoon at
Madison Square Garden, NBC wanted to talk to Allan instead of
Reggie.
</P>
<P>
   Like last June, the game belonged to Houston and the Knicks
after halftime. They won 87-73, closing the gap for best record and
home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference. They won because
Houston got off 14 shots with ease, and exerted his presence in the
third period _ and because Miller worked hard to take 11 shots and
could not steal New York's spirit like he once did routinely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie ain't 30 no more,'' Larry Johnson said. ``You just have
to know. You ain't 30. What is he, 33, 34?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is 34. Houston, 28, found a rhythm in the third quarter
not unlike the rhythm Miller once knew. He made a couple of long
jumpers, and suddenly felt like he was shooting by himself in an
empty gymnasium. He spliced his smooth release in with a strong
drive to the basket, releasing a pretty floater over the Pacers
front line that never touched the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tried to front him. Jalen Rose tried to sag off and give
him space. Mark Jackson tried to bang him. And he kept scoring,
until the Knicks had a 15-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, they think they're throwing me off by
putting different people on me,'' he said. ``The way I look at it
is, it gives me confidence. If three different people are guarding
me at different times, it means I'm giving them trouble. That's
just inspires me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley recently said Houston may be the best shooting guard
in the game now that you-know-who is gone. Eddie Jones and Ray
Allen can argue and compare numbers. Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant
have more talent, even though shooting guard is often not their
natural position.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no argument when it comes to his counterpart in
Indiana. Miller is still capable of scoring in bunches, getting to
the free throw line because he knows more about positioning and
pushing off than anyone still active that does not live in Utah.
Reggie is still a money player, one of greatest of his era.
</P>
<P>
   But in stature and performance, Houston keeps creating a
distance between himself and a guy who once loved to tweak him by
saying, ``John Starks is still the best shooting guard the Knicks
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit 6 of 7 shots in the third quarter for 13 of his game-high
19 points. When he finished rising up over his defenders, the
Knicks had run away from Larry Bird's Pacers just as they had last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it comes from a strong belief in yourself,'' he said.
``Sometimes I feel, nobody is going to be able to stop me if I have
that kind of belief. No matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   It all looked so familiar Saturday. Houston faces up Miller on
the left wing. Stares him down. Squares. Fires. Scores.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if Saturday felt like Game 6 at all. ``A little
bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit? A lot. Saturday could mean nothing and everything
in a few months. Who's to say where the Knicks and Pacers go from
here. Yet there is no denying one ongoing development: With each
arching jump shot, Allan Houston has become the player Reggie
Miller used to be.

CONCERN GROWS OVER RISING GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Robin Gant of
Leavenworth, Kan., recently pulled his Lincoln Town Car into a gas
station, he had a pretty good idea of what he was about to see.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure enough, he was right. The price of super unleaded gasoline,
the grade he prefers, had hit $1.50 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time I turn around the price is going
up,'' Gant said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. According to a survey released Friday by the
AAA Automobile Club of Missouri, the average Kansas City area price
of regular unleaded gas _ the most popular grade _ had soared to
$1.36 a gallon. gallon. In fact, it equals the record price set in
1981, when an oil embargo drove prices up.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some effects of higher fuel prices are rippling
through the economy. But this is not 1981. Adjusted for inflation,
a gallon of gas that cost $1.36 a gallon in 1981 would go for $2.42
today.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economy and consumers today are in better
financial shape. In 1981, 5 percent of household budgets were
devoted to buying motor fuel. That percentage has since dropped to
about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not as big a deal for the economy as it was 20 years
ago,'' said Dave McDermott, regional economist for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if current gas prices hold, it will cost an extra $300
annually to fuel the average vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't blame people for being upset,'' said Mike Right, a
spokesman for AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to reduce production 7.5 percent. Since then OPEC
members and other oil-producing countries have shown remarkable
discipline in hewing to the cuts, driving crude oil prices from
about $12 per barrel to more than last week's price of $30.
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC ministers decide next month to boost oil production,
then gas prices are expected to decline. If they do not, some
analysts predict, gas could reach $1.70 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effects of higher gas prices have already cropped
up, and more are likely if prices stay at these levels or go
higher. For example:
</P>
<P>
   - Several airlines and trucking companies now have fuel
surcharges to recoup the higher fuel costs. Others are considering
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   - Independent truckdrivers have been hit hard. Unable to pass on
the increasing fuel costs, many have simply stopped taking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   - State highway departments are beginning to see higher bids for
repaving roads because of price increases for asphalt, a
petroleum-based product. If that continues, some road projects
could be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   - The company that operates Kansas City's largest cab fleet and
shuttles to Kansas City International Airport plans to make a
decision in the next month about whether to boost fares because of
higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   - Even Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, expressed concern
last week that high oil prices could hinder efforts to hold the
line on prices of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   For average drivers the price increases have already gotten
their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, the Leavenworth resident, commutes to his job in Kansas
City and has to fill his car's fuel tank twice a week. His weekly
gas bill has increased more than $20, and he's not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the government step in and do something,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles have been
particularly hard- hit by higher prices. If you own a Ford
Expedition with a 10-cylinder motor, for example, it will cost you
more than $20 extra to fill its 44-gallon tank.
</P>
<P>
   If gas prices do not decline, says AAA, expect to see some
drivers curtailing vacation plans this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of some tourist destinations say that gas prices have
their attention even though they are hoping that prices will
decline by the time summer vacations begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a topic under discussion here,'' said Lisa Rau, a
spokeswoman for Silver Dollar City, near Branson.
</P>
<P>
   Although higher gas prices are having some effect, they do not
come close to wreaking the havoc they did 20 years ago, many
economists say. In part, that is because oil simply does not play
the central role in the economy that it once did.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 oil accounted for about 9 percent of expenditures in the
Gross Domestic Product of the U.S. economy. In today's increasingly
information-age economy it is 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Keeton, senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in
Kansas City, said one concern was that increases in gas prices
would ultimately fuel broad-based price increases in a wide range
of other products.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, then inflation is a worry. But factors such as
continued improvements in worker productivity so far are mitigating
the effect that gas prices are having on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no sign this is happening,'' Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices rose a sizable 1 percent in January, the Labor
Department reported Friday. But the surge in gas and other energy
costs such as heating oil was blunted by the steepest decline in
clothing prices in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, inflation at the consumer level rose a mild 0.2 percent
in January. Still, some economists are bracing for fuel-driven
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the lull before the storm,'' said Donald
Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic
forecasting project. ``There's no question that February's numbers
will be eye-openers.''
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of businesses are on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Lukas, owner of Lukas Liquors Superstore in Overland Park,
said that if gas prices stayed at current levels, he would not be
surprised if brewers tried to reduce their discounts on beer.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers also are monitoring sales of sport-utility vehicles.
Inventories of unsold sport-utilities have begun to build, although
the reason may have more to do with too many models competing for
the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wolfe, president of Wolfe Automotive Group, said a few
customers were asking about fuel economy. That could change for the
worse by this summer if prices do not decline, he said, but so far
it has not had much effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty insignificant'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been more noticeable on companies that rely more
on motor fuel for their operation.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines are adding a $20 surcharge to round-trip tickets
to cover the extra fuel costs. (Vanguard Airlines of Kansas City
has not added the surcharge, saying it is relying on conservation
measures.)
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Corp. of Overland Park, Kan., has added a surcharge to
freight bills to cover the higher costs of diesel fuel it uses in
its trucks. Currently the surcharge adds 4 percent to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   `We're not happy about taking this step, but it's a reasonable
solution,'' said Roger Dick, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent truckers have gone so far as to turn their rigs
back over to the finance company, said Todd Spencer, executive vice
president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association in
Grain Valley, which has 47,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the drivers are just going home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's group would like to see a law that would allow
independent truckdrivers to automatically add fuel surcharges when
diesel prices escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they expect fuel prices to go down in the next
few months. OPEC ministers will meet next month to considering
boosting oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Lee, a senior analyst at the London-based Center for
Global Energy Studies, expects a production increase. OPEC does not
want to risk an economic slowdown in Western countries that would
dampen oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking to produce oil for those countries into the
distant future,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   If production is not increased, consumers can expect to see an
effect that will go beyond the additional cost of filling gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Missouri Department of Transportation recently opened
bids for some repaving projects, two came in over budget because of
the rising cost of asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   The department has not had to curtail any projects yet. But if
oil prices do not decline this year and bids continue to come in
over budget, the department may have to rethink some projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously could have some effect'' said Dale Ricks,
assistant district engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses say they are at a critical point in deciding
whether to raise prices to reflect the higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill George Jr., president of Metropolitan Transportation
Services Inc., said his company had already raised rates for
out-of-town bus trips. In the next month the company will decide
whether to raise rates on other services to reflect the higher fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company also operates taxicabs, shuttles to KCI and a
limousine service. The company uses a million gallons of fuel a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious issue for us,'' George said.

KANSAS CITY MAN TAKES CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE LAST GREAT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It would have been
easy for David Straub to stay in Kansas City, where his friends and
relatives lived, where he worked for the family business. But his
heart was not in it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His thoughts were of sled dogs and a great race thousands of
miles away. And so, four years ago, he left the comfortable and the
familiar and moved to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Straub, 39, will stand on a sled drawn by 16 dogs and
live his dream by competing in the Iditarod.
</P>
<P>
   The Iditarod, which some call the last great race in the world,
has become Straub's purpose, his passion. His dogs have become his
love, and a one-room cabin his home.
</P>
<P>
   The journey has not been easy. He lives a solitary life, working
as a carpenter in the summer and training dogs in the winter. He
trains them as long as 17 hours a day, rotating dogs on small teams
every few days.
</P>
<P>
   He depends on propane for heat and light, and a generator for
electricity. His visits back to Kansas City are limited to
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   He has overcome an accident in which three of his dogs were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tough times,'' he said. ``I just held (the dream)
close to me and kept after it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ernie Straub Jr. of Shawnee, Kan., is more surprised
than anyone that his son would grow up with a dream to race dogs
across Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't knock it. I've got to give him credit for his
fortitude,'' the elder Straub said. ``I'd be miserable living in a
shack just one day without utilities and no shower, but power to
him. He does without a place to live, clothing, and every modern
convenience. Every nickel and dime he makes goes to the dogs. He
does without himself.'' A dream begins
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, David Straub bred dogs for show, and he traveled
around the Midwest to competitions where he could show off his
Samoyeds and an Alaskan husky _ both breeds used in sledding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start working with sled dogs and after a while you just
start reading about the Iditarod. We started tooling around.'' He
hooked his dogs up to a three-wheeled cart and rode around
Westport.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Bishop Miege High School, he worked for
veterinarians to learn more about dogs. He eventually joined the
family business, Straub Construction, as a carpenter, but spent his
spare time working with his dogs. He sneaked away at lunch to read
the newspaper's latest Iditarod update.
</P>
<P>
   When city living became too cramped, he moved his dogs to rural
Warrensburg, Mo. But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always talking sled dogs, and it was a little funny
when somebody was talking sled dogs in the middle of July,'' said
David De Feo, a Merriam, Kan., veterinarian and former employer.
``I remember one of his dogs died, and I thought we were going to
lose David. He was a walking zombie for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   He developed a four-year plan to move north, but it became a
three-month plan when his father got wind of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father took me out to lunch, and he said if I wanted to
move to Alaska, there was no use waiting four years, to put my
place on the market and go,'' Straub said. ``It was pretty great to
have somebody's support.''
</P>
<P>
   Now his father says he has never seen his son happier, despite
the hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's persevering and paying a terrible price, in my way of
thinking, to live his dream, but he's got to do what he wants. He's
got to be happy. As a parent, you've got to want whatever makes
your children happy,'' his father said. A tragic turn
</P>
<P>
   Straub's most difficult day came in December.
</P>
<P>
   His team was traveling a familiar trail alongside the highway
when the young lead dogs guided the group up and onto the road.
Straub used voice commands to stop the team, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same split second an 18-wheeler rolled through the
middle of the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed three of his dogs and injured a fourth, and
it almost broke his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He lost Mickey, a veteran lead dog who was to have guided the
team through the Iditarod. Straub had opted to place Mickey farther
back in the team that day to train younger lead dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do was drag everybody off the highway and ask for
a rescue,'' he said. ``It's hard to take a deep breath and go on
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Months afterward, when he talks about the accident, his voice
still shakes and the tears still flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shook up everybody,'' he said, referring to the dogs.
``It's like coming up to a red light and everybody runs it.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the accident rippled through Alaska and prompted mushers
from the area to offer him their extra dogs. Straub, however,
decided that if he was to continue, he would have to promote one of
the 32 dogs he had raised from pups. The reshaped team finished two
races, the requirement to qualify for the Iditarod. Once mushers
complete an Iditarod, they are qualified forever.
</P>
<P>
   Straub signed up for the race even before he had qualified; in
June 1999 he was the first to arrive at the race headquarters with
his $1,750 check, earning him the No. 1 position on the entry list.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean his team will leave Anchorage first. Instead,
it is considered prestigious because he will be the first to draw
for position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's demonstrative of his enthusiasm and commitment to this
race, to physically come here to Iditarod headquarters and camp
here for a couple of days,'' said Stan Hooley, executive director
of the Iditarod Trail Committee. ``He's one of the wide-eyed folks
that's living out a dream, and we commend him for that.'' An Alaska
legend
</P>
<P>
   The Iditarod is large in Alaskan lore.
</P>
<P>
   The route dates to 1929, when Nome was hit by a diphtheria
outbreak. Supplies of serum were back in Anchorage, and the only
two planes in Alaska had been disassembled for the winter.
Volunteers using dog sleds rushed the medicine from town to town
until they reached Nome.
</P>
<P>
   Their route is, for the most part, the same route used for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Teams travel at their own paces, and mushers set their own
schedules. If it's hot _ 30 degrees _ they may choose to race at
night.
</P>
<P>
   While training, Straub's dogs start the day with a warm broth.
Every hour they stop and get an ``ice cookie,'' a bite of frozen
broth. After three or four hours they get chunks of meat _ usually
lamb, beef or turkey. They go another three or four hours with the
ice cookies, and at the end of the day they get more meat. Before
bedtime they get a warm stew made with meat and dry dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Their feedings in the race will be similar but will depend on
their strength during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs will guide Straub through the route using instinct and
smell. Along the route Straub will stop at 18 checkpoints where
veterinarians will ensure that the dogs are not being mistreated
and that mushers are following race rules. Straub also will pick up
1,400 pounds of meat for the dogs, dog booties, fresh straw and
other supplies that have been flown to the sites ahead of time. At
some checkpoints Straub will be offered sleeping shelter, but in
other areas he expects to sleep near the trail, next to his team.
</P>
<P>
   The perils are innumerable. In past years moose and other wild
animals have attacked dog teams. Temperatures dive as low as 60
degrees below zero. Strong winds can produce whiteouts for days,
and thin ice is always a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Hooley said 10 percent to 15 percent of the mushers will drop
out or be disqualified before they reach Nome. Those who brave the
elements to finish have historically been considered heroes in the
state of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iditarod is far and away the event that Alaskans enjoy the
most and support in a very big way. It's just a very exciting
time,'' Hooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Finish or not, Straub said, he'll come away with an even greater
respect for the race's history and the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a love for Alaska. When I'm out on these trails I just
imagine what it was like years ago,'' he said. ``It really feels
like home up here.''
</P>
<P>
   It also will be a time to grow closer to the dogs he loves and
considers his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I'll just be out camping with 16 of my best friends,''
he said. ``I'm pretty nervous, but there's no turning back.''

BIOLOGIST CRUSADES FOR RECOGNITION OF EXERCISE AS PREVENTIVE
MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ University of
Missouri-Columbia biologist Frank Booth calls it evidence of a
modern plague.
<TEXT>
<P>
   People dying of heart disease, up 37 percent since 1950. People
developing Type 2 diabetes, up 600 percent since 1958. Still more
people with backaches, with osteoporosis, with high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a common contributor to all these people's maladies,
Booth says. They are simply not getting enough exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Call it inactivity, sloth, inertia.
</P>
<P>
   To Booth, our sedentary way of life has become one of our
greatest health hazards. And it's time, he says, that doctors and
scientists rally to the cause of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology, Booth
and colleagues at the University of Texas have published a
manifesto for physical activity. It marshals the work of dozens of
researchers to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Inactivity is linked to at least 17 chronic diseases and other
health conditions, Booth found. And it is responsible for about
250,000 deaths each year in the United States. That is more deaths
than are caused by alcohol, firearms, illicit drugs and
motor-vehicle accidents combined.
</P>
<P>
   Only smoking, which kills 400,000 people a year, causes more
preventable deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of treating all these inactivity-related illnesses,
Booth estimated, approaches $1 trillion per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this going on? Why a sixfold increase in diabetes? Why
aren't people beating the walls to stop this? This should not be
happening in the United States,'' Booth said.
</P>
<P>
   Booth has started an advocacy group, Scientists Against
Inactivity-Related Diseases, to promote the study of maladies
caused by sedentary living.
</P>
<P>
   And he has started an Internet petition drive, gathering
signatures of scientists and physicians, to ask the National
Institutes of Health to finance more basic research on how physical
inactivity leads to disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it happens,'' Booth said. ``But we don't know how. We
need to know that in order to combat the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   To Booth, exercise is not just something extra you do to pump up
your muscles or to drop a few pounds. It is as essential to good
health as clean air, pure water and nutritious food.
</P>
<P>
   By not exercising, you are doing something bad to your body,
like smoking cigarettes or eating jelly doughnuts by the box.
</P>
<P>
   Booth traces our generally sedentary lifestyle back about 100
years. Before then most people stayed active at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   Machinery, however, has eased the burden of physical labor, cars
have eliminated the need to walk, television has kept us glued to
our couches. And computers have made many of the remaining
activities _ working, shopping, even mailing a letter _ no more
strenuous than a couple of clicks of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, about 22 percent of adults engage in any kind of
daily leisure-time physical activity. About 15 percent do vigorous
exercise, such as running, on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts recommend that adults get at least 30 minutes of
moderate exercise, equivalent to a two-mile walk, preferably every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors ought to urge their patients to exercise with the same
persistence they use to get them to quit smoking, Booth and other
exercise scientists say. But that is not happening often enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of commitment and understanding in the
health-care professions...to using activity as a preventive
strategy,'' said Kenneth Baldwin, professor of physiology and
biophysics at the University of California-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more focused on the disease and not the causative
factors involved. It's several steps removed, so it doesn't get the
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In his laboratory, Baldwin is trying to find out why muscles
grow when they are exercised and why they atrophy when they are not
used.
</P>
<P>
   He has discovered that training for a marathon changes runners'
muscle cells, allowing them to use more body fat as fuel, rather
than relying as heavily on carbohydrates. This change gives
marathon runners the added energy they need to run long distances.
</P>
<P>
   According to Booth, research demonstrating how exercise benefits
the human body at the most basic cellular level is key to
convincing health professionals and the public of the need for
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Booth has studied how exercise switches genes in muscle cells on
and off. When he put laboratory rats through their paces on a
treadmill, he found these changes in 71 genes of 3,000 he tested.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale University's Pierce Laboratory, biologist P. Darrell
Neufer just completed the first research demonstrating that the
same kinds of changes in gene activity occurred when people
exercised.
</P>

   Neufer helped develop a technique that allowed him to use minute
amounts of muscle tissue biopsied from the legs of cyclists shortly
after they exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Neufer said he thought such research would lead to an
understanding at the most fundamental level of how exercise kept
people healthy. From that might come ways to prevent heart disease
or to help diabetics control their blood sugar levels.

   Booth said he had been writing to the individual directors of
the National Institutes of Health, seeking their support. Each
institute finances research for a group of illnesses, such as
cancer, or a part of the body, such as the heart.
</P>
<P>
   So far, one institute director has told Booth there should be an
exercise-research initiative, and another has said he wants to talk
to Booth more about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take time to have an impact,'' Booth said, ``but most
people see the wisdom of what we're doing.''

 &HT;     BUSH DEFEATS McCAIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, EXIT POLLS SHOW   
 &HT;     (EDS: New material in grafs 6-7, with McCain defiant.)   (For

<P>
   CHARLSTON, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively revived
his flagging front-runner campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, exit polls showed Saturday, fighting off a scrappy
challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the South Carolina
primary and catapulting their bitter struggle into big state
showdowns beginning with Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush rode to victory on a tidal wave of
GOP voters who turned out in record numbers across the
predominantly conservative piedmont region to overwhelm McCain's
less-than-expected support among many non-Republican voters who
could legally vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was projected on the basis of interviews
conducted by Voter News Service as voters left their polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment and I'm excited,'' Bush told reporters
shortly after 7 p.m. when the polls closed and exit polls projected
his win. ``This will have a very positive effect in Michigan.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a phone call from McCain at 7:08 p.m. conceding the
race. ``I'm very
</P>
<P>
   greatful for the phone call,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how far he has come since his defeat in the Feb. 1
New Hampshire Primary, Bush said: ``I fell down in the snow (in New
Hampshire, but) I knocked the snow off my suit and came down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the size of his loss, McCain struck a defiant tone in
his concession speech before flying to Michigan. He vowed to go
forward with his reformist crusade, ``to offer voters a choice
between a record of reform and an empty slogan of reform, a choice
between experience and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished Bush ``a good night's rest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``He's going to need it, my friends, for we have
just begun to fightt. And I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that 9 percent of those voting Saturday
were Democrats. Of those, 82 percent supported McCain and 16
percent said they voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed that 31 percent of voters were
independents. Of those, 34 percent were for Bush and 61 percent
were for McCain. That's a much bigger-than-expected margin for
Bush. In New Hampshire among independents, McCain got 61 percent
and Bush got 19 percent. Among Democrats in New Hampshire, Bush got
10 percent and McCain got 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By winning here in a southern state that has voted reliably
Republican in eight of the last 10 presidential elections, Bush
energized a campaign that had been stunned by McCain's upset
victory in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. The Bush win helps him
allay campaign donors' anxieties, stem threatened defections by
worried Republican office holders and stun McCain's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had hoped to parlay his come-from-behind victory in
New Hampshire into a second upset here, came away from the contest
with ample evidence that he appeals to the independents and
Democrats who can vote in 16 of the next 24 GOP presidential
primaries. McCain vowed to carry on with his populist insurgency at
least until Super Tuesday, March 7, when New York, California and
Ohio join 13 less populous states to hold primaries and caucuses
that could settle the struggle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's triumph in an 18-day slugfest stemmed in part from a
shift in strategy from being a tax-cutting ``compassionate
conservative'' who lost to McCain by 19 percentage points in New
Hampshire to becoming a ``reformer with results'' who ardently
courted the state's religious and social conservatives and
challenged McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at conservative Bob Jones University where
inter-racial dating is prohibited and he refused to challenge the
GOP platform's call for an absolute ban on abortions, even though
he favors exceptions to save the mother's life or to end
pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to the right risked alienating the
middle-of-the-road voters who often decide the outcome of the
industrial state primaries that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based Republican pollster who is not
working for any GOP presidential candidate, said the victory
enables Bush to retain ``the mantle of the front-runner,'' adding:
``It's a tremendous boost for Bush. It allows you to say that once
again, the nomination is Bush's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory is expected to help entice a sorely needed
infusion of campaign donations into a fast-spending juggernaut that
has already spent more than $50 million of the $68 million in
donations. He heads into Michigan where three-term Gov. John Engler
has vowed to deliver the state to Bush. Bush's hand is also
strengthened in follow-on contests in Virginia and Washington on
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said Bush's victory may be seen in hindsight as ``the
turning point that enabled Bush to go on to victory,'' adding:
``This is too big a victory for McCain to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan
Politics newsletter and a radio talk show host, said the magnitude
of Bush's victory in South Carolina could discourage turnout by the
independents and Democrats that McCain is counting upon to keep him
competitive in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude now might be 'Why bother to vote?''' Ballenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain showered South Carolina's 2.1 million registered
voters with more than $5.9 million worth of often hard-nosed
campaign ads during the longest presidential primary campaign in
state history. Previously, South Carolina held its primary just
four days after New Hampshire's.

</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a 20-year history of picking Republican
winners. The GOP winner in South Carolina has never failed to go on
and capture the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush built his win on a healthy core
Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of voters Saturday identified themselves as
Republicans. Among them, 68 percent said they voted for Bush and 26
percent said they voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did better than expected among independents, who along
with Democrats were free to cast ballots in the state's Republican
primary. Exit polls showed that fewer independents and Democrats
turned out than McCain had hoped for. Just 30 percent of the voters
were independents and 9 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to carry 35 percent of the independent voters _ a
far stronger showing among independents than Bush scored in New
Hampshire where he won only 19 percent of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``played to win rather than playing not to loose, like in
New Hampshire,'' said Ayres, adding that Bush had succeeded in
shifting voters' focus away from McCain's heroic biography as a
Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam to his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's agenda is much less compelling to Republican
audiences, whether its taxes or campaign finance reform,'' Ayres
said. ``This is going to buck up the Bush forces big time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained early in the day that state GOP officials had
failed to open many precinct-voting stations where Democrats and
independents lived, including 21 polling stations in Greenville
County. South Carolina law requires party officials to staff
polling places. Of the state's 1,700 polling places, 1,454 were
open _ twice the number that were open for the 1996 GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disappointing that anyone anywhere in South Carolina
is deprived of the ability to vote,'' McCain said. ``That's just
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials consolidated 21 polling places in Greenville
County at the last minute, requiring voters to travel to
alternative sites. ``From the reports we're getting everywhere,
everything is goingsmooth,'' said state GOP director J. Sam
Daniels.

 &HT;    Garth trades his guitar for a baseball bat
 &HT;    EDS: MOVING ON SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT WIRES
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ If nice guys really do finish last, then
Garth Brooks is way deep in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Best-selling country singer and all-around good guy Brooks
traded in his black cowboy hat for a New York Mets baseball cap and
his guitar for a black bat Saturday as he began five weeks of
spring training with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But he brought his country fans with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you, Garth,'' chimed a quartet of female admirers as
he fielded ground balls at third. Several hundred fans lined the
fences of Thomas J. White Stadium to see Brooks play out Year 2 of
his baseball fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to embarrass major league baseball or the New
York Mets,'' said the 38-year-old singer/third baseman/first
baseman before beginning a 2 1/2 hour workout.
</P>
<P>
   He booted only one at third and, while playing first, flipped
several ground balls with his glove to pitchers playing first.
``Ooooh,'' said the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average,'' pronounced longtime Mets fan Pat Lowe, wearing a
fisherman's hat festooned with dozens of Met pins and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a wannabe. It's a little fantasy camp for him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing No. 1 on his back, Brooks stepped into the batting cage
after slugger Mike Piazza had ripped several over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw him to the wolves right away. We're gonna
find out,'' teased Mets coach John Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging right-handed, Brooks missed the first pitch, took the
second and drilled the third hard on the ground between shortstop
and third base.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks wasn't ready for the next pitch and mumbled, ``Sorry.'
Then he dribbled one foul and said, ``My fault.'' A few pitches
later, ``My fault'' again.
</P>
<P>
   His new teammates scolded him for apologizing. The pitcher let
up a bit and Brooks rocketed a few shots to the fence. Then he took
a turn left-handed. He tired quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, dude,'' said catcher Todd Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to peak out early,'' said Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that about 8 this morning,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Superfan Lowe re-assessed her opinion: ``Not bad at all. Pretty
good for a country superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before wind sprints, Brooks paused against a fence to sign
autographs, shooing photographers away. He stayed an hour, signing
balls, rosters and baby bibs, long after most of the Mets had gone
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the best manners of any player I've ever seen,'' said
Mets General Manager Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But manners isn't what brought Brooks to camp. Brooks''
2-year-old Touch 'Em All Foundation, which provides money to
children's groups, will benefit from the singer's stay in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are donating $100,000, which is being matched by
eSuperstars.com, an Internet charity auction site represented by
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine. Players also make donations based on
their performances. Last year the charity raised $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets wouldn't have gone along had not players like
Robin Ventura and Al Leiter encouraged it, and had not the San
Diego Padres, where Brooks spent spring training last year, been
convinced it wasn't merely a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal here is that people see my respect for the game
is unequaled, and my love for the game is equal to any fan's on the
other side of the fence,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   His second goal is to improve last year's spring batting average
of .045 (1-for-22). ``I probably will strike out more this year
because I'm going to be swinging. I'm trying to be a ballplayer
this year, instead of trying just not to strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't want to be a distraction to the players.
Saturday's workout brought fans who didn't know Piazza from pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Moore and her sister-in-law Debbie Beck left Coral
Springs at 5 a.m. so they could be there in the Thomas J. White
Stadium parking lot when Brooks arrived in his blue Chevy king cab
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was friendly,'' Moore said. ``He said, 'Hi,''' which was
remarkable since Brooks arrived in town at 3:30 a.m. Saturday after
finishing the score for a new movie. The film, ``Frequency'',
features a fantasy sequence involving the '69 world champion Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shot two rolls of film already,'' Moore said, ``most of
them butt shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been to six Brooks concerts and zero major league
games. Until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Mets Manager Valentine assess Brooks' performance?
``Garth brought a lot of energy. He seemed to enjoy it and he
seemed to fit in,'' the manager sit diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a stand-up guy that sings a song. Maybe some of that
goodness rubs off. It's probably good for the other guys to see how
that works.''

<P>
   ``We love you, Garth,'' chimed a quartet of female admirers as
he fielded ground balls at third. Several hundred fans lined the
fences of Thomas J. White Stadium to see Brooks play out Year 2 of
his baseball fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to embarrass major league baseball or the New
York Mets,'' said the 38-year-old singer/third baseman/first
baseman before beginning a 2 1/2 hour workout.
</P>
<P>
   He booted only one at third and, while playing first, flipped
several ground balls with his glove to pitchers playing first.
``Ooooh,'' said the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average,'' pronounced longtime Mets fan Pat Lowe, wearing a
fisherman's hat festooned with dozens of Met pins and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a wannabe. It's a little fantasy camp for him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing No. 1 on his back, Brooks stepped into the batting cage
after slugger Mike Piazza had ripped several over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw him to the wolves right away. We're gonna
find out,'' teased Mets coach John Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging right-handed, Brooks missed the first pitch, took the
second and drilled the third hard on the ground between shortstop
and third base.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks wasn't ready for the next pitch and mumbled, ``Sorry.'
Then he dribbled one foul and said, ``My fault.'' A few pitches
later, ``My fault'' again.
</P>
<P>
   His new teammates scolded him for apologizing. The pitcher let
up a bit and Brooks rocketed a few shots to the fence. Then he took
a turn left-handed. He tired quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, dude,'' said catcher Todd Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to peak out early,'' said Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that about 8 this morning,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Superfan Lowe re-assessed her opinion: ``Not bad at all. Pretty
good for a country superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before wind sprints, Brooks paused against a fence to sign
autographs, shooing photographers away. He stayed an hour, signing
balls, rosters and baby bibs, long after most of the Mets had gone
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the best manners of any player I've ever seen,'' said
Mets General Manager Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But manners isn't what brought Brooks to camp. Brooks''
2-year-old Touch 'Em All Foundation, which provides money to
children's groups, will benefit from the singer's stay in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are donating $100,000, which is being matched by
eSuperstars.com, an Internet charity auction site represented by
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine. Players also make donations based on
their performances. Last year the charity raised $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets wouldn't have gone along had not players like
Robin Ventura and Al Leiter encouraged it, and had not the San
Diego Padres, where Brooks spent spring training last year, been
convinced it wasn't merely a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal here is that people see my respect for the game
is unequaled, and my love for the game is equal to any fan's on the
other side of the fence,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   His second goal is to improve last year's spring batting average
of .045 (1-for-22). ``I probably will strike out more this year
because I'm going to be swinging. I'm trying to be a ballplayer
this year, instead of trying just not to strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't want to be a distraction to the players.
Saturday's workout brought fans who didn't know Piazza from pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Moore and her sister-in-law Debbie Beck left Coral
Springs at 5 a.m. so they could be there in the Thomas J. White
Stadium parking lot when Brooks arrived in his blue Chevy king cab
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was friendly,'' Moore said. ``He said, 'Hi,''' which was
remarkable since Brooks arrived in town at 3:30 a.m. Saturday after
finishing the score for a new movie. The film, ``Frequency'',
features a fantasy sequence involving the '69 world champion Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shot two rolls of film already,'' Moore said, ``most of
them butt shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been to six Brooks concerts and zero major league
games. Until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Mets Manager Valentine assess Brooks' performance?
``Garth brought a lot of energy. He seemed to enjoy it and he
seemed to fit in,'' the manager sit diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a stand-up guy that sings a song. Maybe some of that
goodness rubs off. It's probably good for the other guys to see how
that works.''

 &HT;    McCain campaign urging primary cross-over in Michigan
 &HT;    (EDS: fixed headline)
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Two separate efforts _ one by Sen. John McCain's
presidential campaign committee _ have begun in Michigan urging
Democrats to cross party lines and vote for McCain against Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dayton Daily News obtained a post card the McCain
campaign in Michigan sent to a registered Democrat here in Flint,
urging Democrats to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III, a black Democratic
lawmaker from Detroit, is helping lead an effort to persuade
Democrats to vote for McCain to punish Republican Gov. John Engler,
leader of Bush's Michigan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the GOP primary and Democratic and
independent voters are considered crucial to McCain's efforts to
defeat Bush. Polls have shown Bush leading among likely Republican
voters, but McCain with a lead among all likely voters, including
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Democrats will chose their national convention
delegates in caucuses March 11 and neither Vice President Al Gore
nor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is on Tuesday's primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The post card sent to Democrats by the McCain committee says,
``The Democrats are not holding a presidential primary in Michigan.
But you can still make your vote count by voting in the Republican
primary on Tuesday, Feb.22.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your voice heard by voting for the one candidate
committed to reform. John McCain will reform the current
disgraceful and corrupting system of financing campaigns,'' the
card continues.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John J.H. Schwarz, a Battle Creek Republican and
McCain's Michigan chairman, said that the cards are consistent with
McCain's invitation to ``Republicans, independents and like-minded
Democrats'' to support him
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said that he did not know how many of the cards have
been mailed. He also said that he hoped that the cards would help
counter some of the Bush campaign's negative ads targeting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that Engler, a third-term governor, has mistreated
Democrats, particularly Detroiters. He cited Engler's role in
replacing Detroit's elected school board with an appointed board
among other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our chance to retaliate,'' Lemmons said. ``We
(Democrats) are in a minority. African-Americans are in a double
minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that fliers are being sent to Detroit-area churches
in predominantly black neighborhoods urging people to vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Responding specifically to questions about Lemmons' campaigns,
Susan Shafer, Engler's deputy press secretary, said that they would
only re-energize the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks read these kind of things, it re-energizes them and
rejuvenates them as Republicans. We are deciding who are candidates
are going to be, not Democrats and independents. This is a
Republican primary,'' she said.

BUSH COASTS TO EASY WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND CURTIS WILKIE AND  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ George W. Bush capitalized on an outpouring
of Republican support Saturday to win the South Carolina primary by
a decisive margin, dashing Senator John McCain's dream, after his
New Hampshire victory, that his reformist appeal would trigger a
huge turnout of Democrats and independents here.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls and early returns suggested that Bush's victory
margin would be 10 percentage points or more. McCain called Bush
shortly after the polls closed at 7 p.m. to concede defeat. And he
sought to buck up his disappointed army of supporters: ``We have
just begun to fight, and I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   The see-sawing Republican nomination battle now shifts to the
Michigan primary on Tuesday, with the pressure on McCain to run
strongly there, and in his home state of Arizona on the same day.
It was a dramatic turn of events after McCain upended the GOP race
with his landslide win in New Hampshire, which enabled him to
arrive here tied in the polls with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm relieved, but relief is not the right word,''
Bush told reporters. ``I'm excited and energized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did we win, we did so in convincing fashion,'' Bush
added. ``It's an embrace of a message that's conservative and
compassionate and an embrace of a messenger who is a reformer who
has gotten positive results and will do for America as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The yawning 18-day gap between New Hampshire and South Carolina
slowed McCain's march and gave Bush time to regroup and retool his
strategy. In the end, Bush was saved by the much-discussed South
Carolina ``firewall,'' kept aflame by the Republican Party base
that listened to the Texas governor's argument that McCain was
spending too much time appealing to Democrats. After all the talk
about Democratic crossover voters, McCain was hurt by the small
size of the Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that 61 percent of the vote came from
Republicans, 30 percent from independents and only 9 percent from
Democrats. While McCain was strong among independents and
Democrats, he could not overcome the flood tide of Republicans,
two-thirds of whom backed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's overt appeal to Democrats may have backfired,
motivating many conservatives to turn out against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was also hurt by other factors. The black voter turnout
was only 1 percent. And McCain, who made much of his days as a
Vietnam prisoner of war, barely won the veteran vote, by 49 percent
to 47 percent, according to the exit poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who lost in New Hampshire with what aides described as a
soft, lackluster effort, won here after waging a much tougher kind
of campaign, blasting McCain with harsh advertisements that
questioned the senator's conservative credential and accused the
Arizonan of trying to take away tax breaks for contributions to
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk show host Alan Keyes was running a distant third
place as the early returns poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the television networks and the
Associated Press showed that Bush won the vote of self-described
religious conservatives by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were not for the massive negative campaign run against
us, primarily in the religious conservative community, we would
have carried the state,'' McCain campaign manager Rick Davis told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Bush ads that said McCain's tax plan would
limit the deductibility of church contributions, a charge refuted
by McCain. But McCain has long had trouble with religious
conservatives, with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson
saying that McCain was unfit to be president because his campaign
finance plan would hurt organizations such as antiabortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Voting was marred early in the day by reports that some polling
places in black neighborhoods were not open. McCain political
director John Weaver vowed to ``raise hell''' with a formal
complaint about the poll closings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain barely had time to digest the outcome of the
race before moving early Sunday to Michigan, which along with
McCain's home state of Arizona holds its primary on Tuesday. Then
the campaign will unfold rapidly, with elections in Virginia and
Washington on Feb. 29 and many states on March 7, including New
York, California, and Massachusetts. McCain has said he will
participate at least through those contests.
</P>
<P>
   The key to McCain's success has been his ability to attract
non-Republicans, but that effort fell short in South Carolina, a
state heavily populated with veterans. McCain said several weeks
ago South Carolina was a ``must win.'' But more recently, McCain
has said South Carolina only has to be close and perceived as a
win, enabling him to raise money and continue the march to Super
Tuesday. Saturday's outcome left both those goals uncertain at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's day unfolded in contrast with his New Hampshire
experience. Senior advisor Karl Rove, who had delivered the bad
news about the New Hampshire exit polls, Saturday arrived with good
news from the first wave of exit polls just after 1:30 p.m. Bush
later went for a 5-mile run and took a nap.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, Bush aides were confident the early
indicators had proven true, and jubilantly heralded the numbers as
evidence the ``retooled'' Bush strategy had worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think South Carolinians and Republicans in general learned a
lot about Bush'' after the New Hampshire primary, Rove said.
``People in this state saw him fight for what he believed in, and
saw him stand by his convictions. And they appreciated that,'' Rove
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, when it was clear voters had turned out in
droves, Bush campaigned in Spartanburg before returning to his
hotel in Columbia. ``That is good news,'' he said of the high
turnout. ``Our whole focus has been on increasing the turnout,
convincing Republicans and like-minded Democrats to come out and
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the polls closed, Bush appeared ebullient. After
meeting with voters Saturday morning at a polling place in
Spartanburg, the Texas governor told reporters: ``I'm enthused
about my chances. . . . I'm going to come out of this state feeling
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged a few days ago that his campaign had
spent much of the $70 million he raised in contributions last year,
Bush said he was satisfied fund-raising would pick up again on the
strength of a strong showing in South Carolina. ``People like to
back a winner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue windbreaker and accompanied by his wife, Laura,
Bush said he made adjustments in South Carolina following his
defeat in New Hampshire 18 days ago. ``I got defined somehow as the
insider,'' he said of McCain's antiestablishment campaign. ``I told
people coming down here I wasn't going to let that happen'' in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   During the intense struggle here, Bush began portraying himself
as a ``reformer with results'' and hammered McCain with a barrage
of combative commercials that called attention to the Arizona
senator's Washington connections.
</P>
<P>
   Election day had a bizarre start for Bush. After eating pancakes
and bacon and greeting breakfast customers at the Ham House outside
Spartanburg, Bush was being interviewed by a TV reporter outside
the cafe when a dump truck pulled alongside him. Ignoring a police
officer's order to move, the driver dumped a large load of manure
nearby. After donning a pig's mask and shouting, ``Meat is murder!
Pork is death!'' the man was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   He was believed to be an animal rights activist rather than a
McCain partisan.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspect was led away, Bush said, ``I sure am glad I had
my bacon for breakfast this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, McCain expressed confidence that he would win,
appealing to the Veterans of Foreign Wars spring meeting in
Greenville to commit ``to one more mission'' in turning out the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   As the polls opened at 7 a.m., McCain officials said they were
disturbed by reports, coming from poll-watching volunteers in
Greenville County, that polling places in predominantly Democratic
African-American neighborhoods had not opened and voters were being
directed to a less convenient location. Republican officials later
said that more than a score of polling places that lacked
volunteers were closed and ``consolidated'' with other venues.

 &HT;     BUSH DEFEATS McCAIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, EXIT POLLS SHOW

<P>
   CHARLSTON, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively revived
his flagging front-runner campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, exit polls showed Saturday, fighting off a scrappy
challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the South Carolina
primary and catapulting their bitter struggle into big state
showdowns beginning with Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush rode to victory on a tidal wave of
GOP voters who turned out in record numbers across the
predominantly conservative piedmont region to overwhelm McCain's
less-than-expected support among many non-Republican voters who
could legally vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was projected on the basis of interviews
conducted by Voter News Service as voters left their polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment and I'm excited,'' Bush told reporters
shortly after 7 p.m. when the polls closed and exit polls projected
his win. ``This will have a very positive effect in Michigan.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a phone call from McCain at 7:08 p.m. conceding the
race. ``I'm very
</P>
<P>
   Grateful for the phone call,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how far he has come since his defeat in the Feb. 1
New Hampshire Primary, Bush said: ``I fell down in the snow (in New
Hampshire, but) I knocked the snow off my suit and came down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the size of his loss, McCain struck a defiant tone in
his concession speech before flying to Michigan. He vowed to go
forward with his reformist crusade, ``to offer voters a choice
between a record of reform and an empty slogan of reform, a choice
between experience and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished Bush ``a good night's rest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``He's going to need it, my friends, for we have
just begun to fight. And I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that 9 percent of those voting Saturday
were Democrats. Of those, 82 percent supported McCain and 16
percent said they voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed that 31 percent of voters were
independents. Of those, 34 percent were for Bush and 61 percent
were for McCain. That's a much bigger-than-expected margin for
Bush. In New Hampshire among independents, McCain got 61 percent
and Bush got 19 percent. Among Democrats in New Hampshire, Bush got
10 percent and McCain got 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CNN projected turnout at 600,000, more than double the 276,000
who voted in the 1996 South Carolina Republican Primary.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives went for Bush 3-1, exit polls showed.
Unlike New Hampshire, Bush tailored his South Carolina message to
fit ``the pro-life agenda,'' said Randy Tate, former executive
director of the Christian Coalition now with Voter.com, a
politics-oriented website. ``These are the issues that motivate the
grassroots activists to walk the precincts,
</P>
<P>
   and bring the Reagan Democrats out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning here in a southern state that has voted reliably
Republican in eight of the last 10 presidential elections, Bush
energized a campaign that had been stunned by McCain's upset
victory in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. The Bush win helps him
allay campaign donors' anxieties, stem threatened defections by
worried Republican office holders and stun McCain's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had hoped to parlay his come-from-behind victory in
New Hampshire into a second upset here, came away from the contest
with ample evidence that he appeals to the independents and
Democrats who can vote in 16 of the next 24 GOP presidential
primaries. McCain vowed to carry on with his populist insurgency at
least until Super Tuesday, March 7, when New York, California and
Ohio join 13 less populous states to hold primaries and caucuses
that could settle the struggle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's triumph in an 18-day slugfest stemmed in part from a
shift in strategy from being a tax-cutting ``compassionate
conservative'' who lost to McCain by 19 percentage points in New
Hampshire to becoming a ``reformer with results'' who ardently
courted the state's religious and social conservatives and
challenged McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at conservative Bob Jones University where
inter-racial dating is prohibited and he refused to challenge the
GOP platform's call for an absolute ban on abortions, even though
he favors exceptions to save the mother's life or to end
pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to the right risked alienating the
middle-of-the-road voters who often decide the outcome of the
industrial state primaries that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based Republican pollster who is not
working for any GOP presidential candidate, said the victory
enables Bush to retain ``the mantle of the front-runner,'' adding:
``It's a tremendous boost for Bush. It allows you to say that once
again, the nomination is Bush's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory is expected to help entice a sorely needed
infusion of campaign donations into a fast-spending juggernaut that
has already spent more than $50 million of the $68 million in
donations. He heads into Michigan where three-term Gov. John Engler
has vowed to deliver the state to Bush. Bush's hand is also
strengthened in follow-on contests in Virginia and Washington on
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said Bush's victory may be seen in hindsight as ``the
turning point that enabled Bush to go on to victory,'' adding:
``This is too big a victory for McCain to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan
Politics newsletter and a radio talk show host, said the magnitude
of Bush's victory in South Carolina could discourage turnout by the
independents and Democrats that McCain is counting upon to keep him
competitive in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude now might be 'Why bother to vote?''' Ballenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain showered South Carolina's 2.1 million registered
voters with more than $5.9 million worth of often hard-nosed
campaign ads during the longest presidential primary campaign in
state history. Previously, South Carolina held its primary just
four days after New Hampshire's.

</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a 20-year history of picking Republican
winners. The GOP winner in South Carolina has never failed to go on
and capture the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush built his win on a healthy core
Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of voters Saturday identified themselves as
Republicans. Among them, 68 percent said they voted for Bush and 26
percent said they voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did better than expected among independents, who along
with Democrats were free to cast ballots in the state's Republican
primary. Exit polls showed that fewer independents and Democrats
turned out than McCain had hoped for. Just 30 percent of the voters
were independents and 9 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to carry 35 percent of the independent voters _ a
far stronger showing among independents than Bush scored in New
Hampshire where he won only 19 percent of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``played to win rather than playing not to loose, like in
New Hampshire,'' said Ayres, adding that Bush had succeeded in
shifting voters' focus away from McCain's heroic biography as a
Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam to his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's agenda is much less compelling to Republican
audiences, whether its taxes or campaign finance reform,'' Ayres
said. ``This is going to buck up the Bush forces big time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained early in the day that state GOP officials had
failed to open many precinct-voting stations where Democrats and
independents lived, including 21 polling stations in Greenville
County. South Carolina law requires party officials to staff
polling places. Of the state's 1,700 polling places, 1,454 were
open _ twice the number that were open for the 1996 GOP
presidential primary.
</P>

   ``It's just disappointing that anyone anywhere in South Carolina
is deprived of the ability to vote,'' McCain said. ``That's just

   State GOP officials consolidated 21 polling places in Greenville

ANTSY TEAMS READY TO DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA's trade deadline is Thursday, and despite the
blockbuster Toni Kukoc deal, most of the major activity is supposed
to commence this week.
</P>
<P>
   So let's take a look around the league, and see which phone
lines are burning as GMs try to improve before the playoffs, or
just get rid of players they can't stand.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest player - literally - on the block is Hawks center
Dikembe Mutombo, and the Suns are more than interested.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has reportedly offered forwards Tom Gugliotta, Shawn
Marion and overpriced center Luc Longley for Mutombo. Phoenix
players, including Jason Kidd, have gone on record against the
breakup of the team, but the Suns need a center and management may
not be able to pass up Atlanta's desire to clean house.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are also seriously considering releasing troubled
guard J.R. Rider, who has worn out his welcome in half a season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are also growing testy after the knee injury to
Marcus Camby, and have called Boston about Danny Fortson, who has
already been traded to Toronto and returned to the Celtics this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Another player on the Boston roster the Knicks would like is
point guard Kenny Anderson, especially with Charlie Ward injured.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for New York is that outside of Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell, few teams are interested in their roster, and
Houston is considered untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   There's also more than a few GMs thinking that Kukoc could still
end up elsewhere by Thursday. The Sixers appear genuine in their
desire to re-sign Kukoc after the season, but plenty of teams are
still making calls to gauge the possibility of getting the veteran
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers might fit that profile, except Kukoc cannot deal.
Players who are traded cannot be dealt again in a three-way deal
for at least two months. And the Sixers don't want free-agent-to-be
Glen Rice, who wants to play in a warm-weather city.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves remain interested in Kukoc, and are also trying
to grab John Starks from the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are also trying to find a big man, and are offering
guard Kendall Gill and center Jamie Feick. Miami offered Duane
Causwell for Gill last week, but New Jersey isn't giving players
away.
</P>
<P>
   And just when everyone seemed to be on the block, the Cavs began
shopping Shawn Kemp. Rumors of him becoming a Laker are ridiculous,
given his salary, weight and attitude, but the Hawks and Sixers are
considering taking a chance on the moody forward.
</P>
<P>
   Washington center Ike Austin should also find a new home this
week, with the Pistons and Bucks (for Robert Traylor?) the two main
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Big bust: The Grizzlies are believed to be shopping center
Bryant Reeves, once considered the cornerstone of the organization.
But with guards Mike Bibby and Michael Dickerson flourishing and
Shareef Abdur-Rahim a bona-fide star, Reeves has seen his role -
and playing time - reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby and Dickerson are also going to need new contracts soon,
and Reeves' $10 million per season is viewed as a hindrance for the
cash-strapped Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why I think you're going to see this team
maybe take a step backwards before it can go forward,'' forward
Doug West said. ``Both Michaels will demand the maximum (money) and
the question becomes, how do you keep them?''
</P>
<P>
   Paper trail: Kukoc knew he was about to be traded after finding
a piece of paper in the Bulls' locker room outlining the potential
trade scenarios facing Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a writer wrote down all of the trade possibilities on
paper, and Bulls coach Tim Floyd circled the legitimate offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting right away after that,'' Kukoc said, ``and
the paper was there (as evidence).''
</P>
<P>
   Next big move: Wizards president Michael Jordan is getting ready
for another change in the organization, according to Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan ``is itching to oust the notoriously awful Wizards
dancers,'' according to sources close to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine quoted Jordan telling a source at a recent Wizards
game: ``Getting the right players is hard. Finding cheerleaders who
can count on time shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers, who are paid around $50 per game, have heard the
rumors and expect to be fired soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired (former coach) Gar (Heard) after a big win. They'll
probably fire us after one of our better performances,'' said one
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic bust: It's business as usual when Seattle players are
fighting with coach Paul Westphal, but things got bizarre when the
players' agents began trading jabs.
</P>
<P>
   The agent for Sonics reserve forward Rashard Lewis said Seattle
should trade starting forward Ruben Patterson for the long-term
future of the Sonics and Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben is playing great basketball, but Rashard has a greater
upside than Ruben,'' agent Carl Poston said. ``That is untapped
talent. You want to give it every opportunity. It is not a
criticism of Ruben, but with the kind of future they have with
Rashard, maybe a trade of Ruben is better. Rashard could be around
for the next 10 or 12 years. It's time for that egg to hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Patterson's agent, Dan Fegan, to fire
back: ``We are talking about the agent who advised Rashard to forgo
college and enter the draft because his egg was ready to hatch. As
I recall, Rashard was drafted in the second round, so I guess that
egg speaks for itself.''

ON EVE OF BURUNDI TALKS, REFUGEES TELL OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUKOLE REFUGEE CAMP B, Tanzania _ This is the story Hamu
Ncongera tells.
</P>
<P>
   He was collecting firewood in the forest near his village,
Murama, in northeastern Burundi on Feb. 12 when soldiers of the
Tutsi-led army arrested his father and two of his brothers. The
Ncongeras were accused of killing Tutsi. Last Sunday, Hamu's mother
tried to bring food to her husband and sons in prison. She was too
late. They had already been executed. The boys were 18 and 12 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Hamu, 15, and his only remaining brother, Salvadore, 19, arrived
at this refugee camp last Monday. Their mother was captured as they
fled into Tanzania. They fear the worst. The younger brother looks
bewildered, the older one angry.
</P>
<P>
   Hamu's story is not unique. Nor is it insignificant to a region
rent by the chaos of overlapping wars.
</P>
<P>
   As Nelson Mandela, Africa's elder statesman, jumpstarts
Burundi's stalled peace process Monday, refugees trickling into the
string of camps on Tanzania's western frontier tell of escalating
ethnic violence and persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacks by soldiers are happening every day,'' Hamu said,
standing under a blue UN tarpaulin during an afternoon hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are critical. The deterioration in Burundi mirrors a
serious breakdown of the peace process in neighboring Congo, where
several foreign armies and splintered rebel groups are fighting
either for or against the government, and could fan the flames of
war into Tanzania and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the urgency of the crisis, President Clinton plans
to address the Burundi talks, to be held in Arusha, Tanzania, via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as rebels operating from inside eastern Congo think
they can overthrow Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi by war, they won't
talk peace,'' said Jan van Eck, a consultant to the Arusha talks
from the Center for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town. ``Burundi is
increasingly becoming subject to what is happening in the region.''
Congo and its allies want ``to mount a rebellion in Burundi to
force the war into Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly larger than Massachusetts, Burundi shares the same
combustible ethnic politics as its northern neighbor, Rwanda, where
militant Hutu killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsi in a swift
genocidal spree in 1994. In both countries, Hutu make up about 85
percent of the population, Tutsi about 14 percent. The other 1
percent are pygmies.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi has battled to overcome ethnic violence since
independence in 1962, but never more so than during the past seven
years, after Tutsi army paratroopers raided the presidential palace
in October 1993, and rounded up and killed several prominent Hutu
politicians, including President Melchior Ndadaye. Hundreds of
thousands of Burundians have fled or been killed in continuous
ethnic attacks since, as both groups have struggled for power and
built territorial strongholds throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders launched a peace initiative in 1996 with former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere as mediator. That process
sputtered along inconclusively until Nyerere died last October. The
talks were beset by the repeated splintering of parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela now breathes vital new life into the talks. Gathering
the 18 recognized negotiating parties to an initial meeting last
month, the former South African president made it clear he would
hear all, but tolerate no bickering. ``The daily slaughter of men,
women, and children is an indictment against each and every one of
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the first round of formal talks, Mandela has
already made one significant structural change by inviting
previously excluded armed rebel factions to participate. Those
groups undermined a June 1998 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is Burundi's devastated economy. The country
faces massive poverty and popular discontent partly because of
Nyerere's insistence that donor countries disengage from Burundi
until a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government groups, as well, say there can be no peace
without punishment of those guilty of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   A UN Security Council resolution on Burundi, adopted Jan. 19
after Mandela addressed the body, reiterated those concerns by
condemning attacks against civilians; calling on neighboring states
to stem border insurgencies and arming of rebel factions. The
resolution also encouraged donor countries to resume economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stumbling block, however, remains the war in Congo,
where Zimbabwe and Angola have backed President Laurent Kabila in
quashing a rebellion sponsored by Rwanda and Uganda. Initially,
Kabila and his allies said the 19-month war would end when they had
pushed Rwandan and Ugandan troops out of Congo. Now they talk with
increasing vehemence about toppling the ``Tutsi regimes'' of
Burundi and Rwanda, as well as ``Tutsi-supporting'' Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its denials, there is strong evidence, van Eck said,
that Zimbabwe is funneling arms to Burundian rebels inside Congo,
dealing a significant blow to a faltering cease-fire signed last
July by the belligerents. Meanwhile, the United Nations is
considering plans to deploy 500 observers to salvage the
cease-fire, protected by 5,000 UN troops.
</P>
<P>
   With foreign soldiers preparing ethnic-based rebel movements for
war, the outcome of Mandela's talks this week on Burundi may
indicate whether there is still hope of averting a humanitarian
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that everyone in Burundi is expecting that the
whole war in the region will engulf all of Burundi,'' van Eck said.
``The antagonism between the countries fighting in Congo is such
that an escalation of the war is probable.''

EGYPTIAN LEADER PAYS SURPRISE VISIT TO BEIRUT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the first visit of an Egyptian president here in
nearly a half-century, Hosni Mubarak Saturday made a surprise call
on his Lebanese counterpart to offer support for the fight against
Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark expression of support followed the escalation of
the conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border, the last Arab-Israeli
warfront.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat here described Mubarak's visit as ``symbolism, but
important symbolism'' aimed at expressing a unified opposition
among Arab leaders to Israel's avowal last week to strike at
civilian infrastructure if Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon kill
any more Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Israel staged punishing airstrikes on
Lebanon, destroying three power stations and wounding 20 civilians
in retaliation for Hezbollah attacks on its soldiers occupying
southern Lebanon. Hezbollah guerrillas have killed seven Israeli
soldiers in a series of attacks since Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon maintains that Israel's retaliatory strikes, which
knocked out power to half the nation and prompted angry protests in
Beirut's streets, violated a 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, which followed a large-scale Israeli air war in
which more than 100 civilians were killed, established rules for
the conflict that ban attacks on civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing attempts by Israel to ignore this understanding
will not lead to changing it but will lead to an unlimited
escalation,'' Mubarak and Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has defended the attacks and vowed to continue them,
saying Hezbollah is operating out of civilian areas, which would
also be a violation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak and Lahoud ``stressed the right of the resistance to
fight the Israeli occupation until liberation and said the
resistance is a result of the occupation and not a reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their statement also emphasized the urgency of reviving
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which were suspended in January. It
expressed support for Damascus's demand that Israel return the
occupied zone in Lebanon and the Golan Heights, which it captured
from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   There is a delicate web of diplomacy between Israel, Lebanon,
and Syria, which has 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to honor last year's campaign
promise to pull Israeli forces out of the 9-mile deep ``security
zone'' inside Lebanon by July. Many analysts in the region said
that for an Israeli pullout to be successful it must be
accomplished in the context of an Israeli-Syrian agreement on the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak and Lahoud called the Israeli return of the occupied
zone and the Golan Heights a ``primary foundation of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's visit was the first of an Egyptian president since
Lebanon gained independence in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons have much to do with strained relations between
Egypt and Lebanon and Lebanon's long, tortured history of civil
unrest through the decades, including its 1975-90 civil war. The
last visit to Lebanon by an Egyptian leader was in 1952, although
Gamal Abdel Nasser met with Lebanon's president six years later in
a tent between Syrian and Lebanese border posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mubarak's visit to Lebanon is a sign of our solidarity with
the Lebanese people,'' Mubarak political adviser Osama Baz told
Reuters. ``But also, Mubarak is sending a message to the government
of Israel to respect Lebanon's sovereignty and the security of its
people. He is telling them, enough is enough.''

JUST WHAT THE CLIPPERS NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - To the watchdogs of timing and incongruity, the
Clippers' hiring of ex-Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for
tutorial work may seem as strategically twisted as recruiting
Richard Petty to change a tire on your tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday reactionaries probably wonder why if low-post wisdom is
required wasn't the NBA's all-time leading scorer hired sooner?
That one's easy. Abdul-Jabbar wasn't hired earlier, because
teaching Michael Olowokandi and his seemingly disinterested cronies
was the responsibility of Chris Ford. Now Ford's a goner.
</P>
<P>
   Through the vapor of Ford's departure, we salute Clips GM Elgin
Baylor for bringing in Kareem and Dennis Johnson as potentially
enlightening influences on the Clippers' itchy young talent.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for Abdul-Jabbar, a Hall of Famer with six
championship rings? The opportunity to stick his tootsie through
the NBA's coaching door. Why did it seem so difficult for one of
the game's greatest players to cross that coaching threshold? Maybe
the reluctance to take up Abdul-Jabbar on his frequent
sideline-seeking overtures had something to do with a
well-established and vigorous allegiance to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But his commitment to teaching the sport he frequently
transcended was validated when Abdul-Jabbar spent a season on a
reservation, coaching Native American players at the high-school
level. He has written a book, done the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of that teaching experience,
``it was more about life than basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have had something to do with the approach of the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was full,'' he said of his post-retirement existence.
``It wasn't like I was pining away for basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   His eager return has been motivated, in part, by a
disintegration of the sport's on-court integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals aren't being translated,'' Abdul-Jabbar
pointed out. ``The game has lost something. It's the money in the
pro game. Kids don't stay in college and learn the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killing the college game and hurting the pro game at the
same time. Hopefully, through teaching, I can be part of the
solution. We've got to figure a way to get that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even trickier is his gig with the Clippers, who hope
Abdul-Jabbar can replicate something they've never had.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry-mandering
</P>
<P>
   Most barstool sharpies in the City of Big Mikes regard Jerry
``Crumbs'' Krause as a man with a plan - and a donut.
</P>
<P>
   If we postpone its trip into Jerry's jowls for a few moments,
our donut can represent the points Krause usually scores with
cry-hard Chicago fans.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan shows promise. The plan has legs. The plan has
invited the Windy City to inhale and pause since the biggest Mike
of all bagged his last jumper in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the plan: Just demolish it (team) and they (free agents)
will come.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Krause - personnel dictator of the Chicago Bulls - hardly
cuts a romantic path to rival the rah-rah theatrics of Kevin
Costner. If he chose to wear a helmet through this minefield of
criticism, the funny, little rascal (Krause, not Costner) could use
a hammock as a chin strap.
</P>
<P>
   But Krause also should receive some applause for dragging the
Bulls back to the curb of eventual contention.
</P>
<P>
   Krause will have enough cap room this summer to handle Siamese
twins and has banked four first-round selections in the next two
drafts. One of those was acquired from Golden State in last week's
three-cornered deal that sent Toni Kukoc to Philly. The pick
originally was linked to Michael Jordan's Washington Wizards, who
will keep it if the selection falls among this season's top three.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Bulls have it - without restrictions -
for the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that it could be the No. 1 pick in the 2001
draft,'' said Krause, taking a big swing at MJ's rebuilding skills
while speaking at last Wednesday's Goodbye Kukoc press conference.
</P>
<P>
   As for the seduction of two top-shelf free agents to team up
with hot rookies Elton Brand and Ron Artest, Krause said. ``We will
be out there (market) and out there with force. We plan to sell
free agents on the fact that Chicago is the greatest sports city in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Center isn't Noah's Ark, but it does know how to
handle reign.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Commish Isiah Thomas spent part of Friday in nearby Gary, Ind.,
where he plans to create another franchise for his beloved CBA. The
Gary Steelheads would be the 10th CBA team, although Thomas - who
purchased the other nine for $10 million - is attempting to buy the
USBL and IBA in his plan to create a baseball-style minor league.
... ``I always promised Toni (Kukoc) that I'd never trade him to a
bad team,'' said Krause, who dangled the 6-foot-11 forward in front
of the Clippers before the draft last summer. ... The Detroit
Pistons' main bargaining chip in their bid to acquire inside help
before the Feb. 24 trading deadline has been starting point guard
Lindsey Hunter. ... University of Minnesota sophomore center Joel
Przybilla (7-1) was suspended last week over academic
transgressions, and has been scouting for an agent to steer him
into the lottery. Przybilla, an accomplished shot-blocker with very
raw ball skills, had 33 points and 14 rebounds in his last Gopher
appearance - a victory over Indiana. ...
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``next Shaquille O'Neal'' is Eddy Curry, a 6-11,
270-pound junior at Thornwood High in Chicago's south suburbs.
According to one NBA scout, Curry ``is an almost frightening
package of strength and agility, when his age is considered.''
According to the hoop grapevine, Curry may skip college and declare
for the draft after his senior year. ... Clippers assistant coach
Dennis Johnson said younger brother Joey, a skywalking legend in
his days at Banning High, had a 52-inch vertical. If you're
skeptical, it only means you never saw Joey play.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush pronounced himself the
victor in the South Carolina primary Saturday, reclaiming his spot
as the unmistakable front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain called Bush Saturday evening to concede the
race. But the senator vowed to persevere as his advisers insisted
that the governor's conservative stands would not play as well in
the states ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a record primary turnout, Bush rallied Republicans across
the state, undermining McCain's efforts to attract independents and
Democrats like those who helped McCain win convincingly in New
Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited and energized,'' Bush said in his hotel suite.
``This is a big victory. This campaign ignited and united the
Republican base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was wide and deep; he captured the majority of
nearly every demographic group. Most significant, Republicans
rallied to him in large numbers. And the reformer mantle that Bush
appropriated from McCain after the senator's stunning triumph in
New Hampshire 19 days ago paid off. Voters told pollsters Saturday
that they liked Bush's reform message and they suggested that
McCain was too much of an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had staked his prospects on the expectation that
independents and Democrats would flood to the polls and support him
overwhelmingly. In fact, estimates based on surveys of voters found
that turnout was heavy, and may have doubled the 276,000 who voted
in the primary here four years ago. And independents and Democrats
did turn out in larger numbers than in 1996, and those who did
largely backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people heard my message loud and clear,'' a jubilant Bush
said in an interview Saturday night with CNN. Conceding that his
campaign in New Hampshire was lackluster, he said, ``I did better
as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain had called to congratulate him. ``He was
gracious,'' he said. ``After tonight, it's going to be a good
contest. I think I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls closed, a jubilant and no doubt relieved,
Bush attributed his victory to his belief that his reform message
had sunk in. ``Early in the primary season, I got defined,'' he
told reporters. ``I told people I wasn't going to let that happen
in South Carolina.'' He added, ``My message, that I'm a reformer
with results, has taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was particularly welcomed by Bush because before New
Hampshire he was as much as 20 points ahead of McCain in polls
here, but more recently the race was neck and neck, with the
senator even outpacing Bush in some surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's advisers, already looking to the next contests,
asserted that Bush's hardline conservative message in South
Carolina would put off voters as the race turns quickly on Tuesday
to primaries in Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ought to be
congratulated,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director.
``He ran the kind of campaign he needed to win in South Carolina.
But that's not the kind of campaign you need to win the nomination
_ and certainly not the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a telling concession, Rep. Lindsey Graham, McCain's
most prominent supporter in this state, lamented how poorly the
senator had performed among Republicans. ``Our base just fell
apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By appearing to win comfortably here, Bush is better positioned
in Michigan and Arizona, the senator's home state. McCain now faces
enormous pressure to show that his win in New Hampshire was not an
anomaly. But the voting here was particularly distressing for
McCain because South Carolina was one of the few remaining states
where independents and Democrats could vote in the primary. Now,
most of the voting is in states where only Republicans can
participate; and in many of those states Bush has the backing of
the governors.
</P>
<P>
   Though he limped out of New Hampshire, Bush engineered a
comeback here by displaying a scrappy determination to work for the
nomination that was never apparent in the earlier contests.
Throughout last year, Bush swamped his rivals in the polls _
effortlessly it seemed _ and forced most of them to quit the race.
Had McCain won South Carolina, that might have given him an
important lift that could have led some Bush backers to begin to
defect. Yet Bush's conquest came at a price: He overwhelmed McCain
by pouring more than $3 million in an advertising blitz, and in so
doing continued to deplete what had been a flush treasury. McCain's
threat also forced Bush to abandon his long-promised posture of
never stooping to attack commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And, in appealing to conservatives in this state on issues
ranging from abortion to whether the Confederate flag should fly
over the state Capitol, Bush took a sharp turn to the right. He
abandoned his strategy of hewing to the middle of the road, a move
that McCain's advisers were quick to note Saturday night could
haunt the governor in a general election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed clear that his barrage of commercials worked to
Bush's advantage. Of the voters who were interviewed Saturday by
the Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and the
Associated Press, about a third said they waited until the last
week or so to decide who to vote for, and most of them backed Bush.
Voters were more likely to say that McCain had unfairly attacked
Bush than they were to say that Bush was the one attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartening sign to Bush as the voting moves to a more
varied electorate, Bush won the majority of support of nearly every
demographic group, including men, women, rich and poor, young and
old. Even veterans _ whom McCain had targeted in an all-out turnout
drive _ split their vote between McCain and Bush. More than a third
of voters said they considered themselves members of the religious
right, and more than two-thirds of those voters backed Bush. If
religious conservatives were removed from the mix, McCain would
barely have won.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Bush's drumbeat of reform and
leadership, as well his emphasis on moral values, meant a lot when
voters decided who to support.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush and McCain were viewed as reformers, Bush was seen
by voters as more of one. Voters were not convinced that McCain has
been true to his word on the issue of campaign finance, a subject
Bush hammered McCain on in his advertising. Nearly half the voters
said McCain says on thing but does another on campaign finance _
and they voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what issue played the greatest role in their decision,
voters said it was moral values, and they mostly backed Bush. Among
those who cited Social Security and Medicare, McCain was more
popular. But the issue of tax cuts was low on the list of voters'
priorities, even though Bush made it a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush succeeded in being portrayed as a reformer, McCain
was viewed as a man who stands up for his beliefs. That is the
character trait that voters said they cared most about, and more
than have of those voters backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, voters said they considered Bush more of a leader _ and
a more potent rival against the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, attributed the results
Saturday to a return to the roots of 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
when Bush talked about reforms he favored _ and spoke in specific
terms. He also said voters were impressed with a tougher, more
assertive Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these guys are going to come out of here with roughly
equivalent positives and negatives, and yet Bush is going to come
out of here with a substantial win,'' Rove said. ``And I think it's
because people looked at him and saw how he handled adversity, saw
how he passed through this test, and liked what they saw.'' He
added, ``People wanted to see, if you care about something, are you
somebody who is going to fight for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of voters in the primary were white, more
than half were men and more than four in 10 were over the age of
60. Nearly half said they had college degrees; three in 10 served
in the military. Blacks were virtually nonexistent in the voting,
even though in general elections in 1996 and 1998 they made up a
quarter of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The voters here are more conservative than most; nearly a
quarter described themselves as very conservative, and another four
in 10 called themselves somewhat conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six in 10 of the voters Saturday want abortion to be
against the law to varying degrees and they voted heavily for Bush.
Nearly six in 10 said they wanted abortion to either be always
illegal or mostly illegal, and nearly two-thirds of them voted for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After his most spirited, jam-packed week on the campaign trail
to date, Bush made only two public appearances Saturday, dropping
by Tommy's Country Ham House in Spartanburg for breakfast and then
visiting a nearby polling site at an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come out of this state feeling great,'' Bush said
to a dense huddle of reporters who surrounded him outside the
elementary school before the polls closed. ``When you win a state
like South Carolina, you get a bump.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter reminded Bush that he had also voiced optimism
before New Hampshire, he said, ``I was optimistic in New Hampshire.
``I'm really optimistic today.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's extremely good cheer was reflected in a slightly
different answer he gave minutes later to the question of what he
felt about the outcome in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my gut,'' Bush said, ``I feel three pancakes and bacon.''
That was what he had eaten at his previous stop at Tommy's Country
Ham House. Inside, Bush mingled merrily with voters.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a different kind of experience outside the
restaurant. A protester with the People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, who was dressed as a pig, drove by in a white dump
truck and deposited a pile of cow manure on the street near Bush,
and was then carted off by the police as he shouted, ``Meat is
murder!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of the protest group, Bush said, ``I'm
glad I had my bacon for breakfast.''

GORE SEES SOUTH CAROLINA AS VICTORY FOR DEMOCRATS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ Even before results of the South Carolina
primary were known, Vice President Al Gore declared the day a
victory for Democrats, saying that Gov. George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain had badly hurt each other in the hotly contested
Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that they have done a lot of damage to one
another,'' Gore said at a news conference after a
town-meeting-style campaign event here.
</P>
<P>
   He also harshly criticized the two Republicans for not
supporting the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the
South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of the two major Republican candidates had the guts to
take on bigotry and call for the removal of the Confederate flag,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brushed aside questions about his Democratic opponent,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, whose campaign has been stumbling lately,
and instead used the interest in the vote in South Carolina to hit
the Republicans on abortion, education and the environment.

 &HT;    A nap, a run and a victory for Bush
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Judging from his grin, Gov. George W. Bush's
key political adviser, Karl Rove, knew it was all over five hours
before the polls closed in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone glued to his ear, Rove walked into a restaurant at
the Columbia Sheraton, leaned over a table of reporters grabbing
lunch and dropped the first exit polls numbers: 52 percent Bush, 42
percent McCain.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, the Sheraton, ground zero for the Bush
campaign, buzzed with the heady sensation of victory. The
jubilation was large part relief, an expression of how deep the
worry had been and how much was riding on this primary. Would Bush
emerge with his frontrunner crown golden or would he see it all
topple, one domino at a time, as voters here and in upcoming
primary states decided he wasn't born to win the White House after
all?
</P>
<P>
   If Bush was anxious, he didn't show it. He made a prediction in
the morning that would ring overwhelmingly true hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to win,'' he told reporters trailing him
through Tommy's Country House, in Greenville. ``The last couple of
days there's been an unusual amount of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm was palpable hours later in the Sheraton ballroom
where the victory celebration included three fully- stocked bars, a
hot buffet (main course, hot dogs) and a country band. Brown County
Commissioner Steve Adams was one of the revelers. He arrived in
Columbia Tuesday and joined a band of about 30 Texans here to help
get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built signs,'' he said. ``We were waving them out at
intersections. They've used us about as good as you can use help
and it's working out. These numbers are incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   David Miner, a North Carolina state representative and Bush
Pioneer _ one of the fundraisers who has netted at least $100,000
for Bush _ didn't want to use the word relieved to describe how he
was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that the governor will be the nominee of the
Republican party and that he will go on to defeat Al Gore in
November,'' he said. ``The only concern was the 18-point deficit we
had in New Hampshire and the coverage McCain was getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush got the news that his chances looked good at about 1:40
p.m., when Rove came to see him in his suite. Rove said his boss
was in bed ``in near total darkness,'' getting ready to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Great, will they hold?''' Rove told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   Assured that victory was likely, Bush said, ``I'm going to take
my power nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he went running along the Congaree River with media
advisor Mark McKinnon and resumed the work on his victory speech
begun earlier that day. Speechwriter Mike Gerson and policy chief
Josh Bolten had emailed ideas in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Communications director Karen Hughes was taking a nap when the
phone rang and she was summoned to Bush's suite. There she found
Bush, still red-faced from his run, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt
with a towel draped around his neck. Also there were Laura Bush,
Rove, aides Ari Fleischer and Mindy Tucker and finance chief Don
Evans, the man most responsible for Bush's record-breaking $70
million in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was steady,'' Hughes said. ``He was just as gracious in
victory as he was in defeat in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe he knew he wouldn't have to face defeat again _ at
least not in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   At a local pancake house Bush spent about 45 minutes shaking
hands, holding babies and signing his name to everything from
folded newspapers, scrap paper and waitresses' order pads. Then he
sat down to a breakfast of pancakes with butter and syrup, bacon,
coffee and orange juice. Laura Bush had grits and a biscuit,
scrambled egg and ham sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   He later called the unusually high voter turnout, ``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole focus has been on increasing the turnout, convincing
Republican and like-minded Democrats to come out and support us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush pronounced himself the
victor in the South Carolina primary Saturday, reclaiming his spot
as the unmistakable front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain called Bush Saturday evening to concede the
race. But the senator vowed to persevere as his advisers insisted
that the governor's conservative stands would not play as well in
the states ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a record primary turnout, Bush rallied Republicans across
the state, undermining McCain's efforts to attract independents and
Democrats like those who helped McCain win convincingly in New
Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited and energized,'' Bush said in his hotel suite.
``This is a big victory. This campaign ignited and united the
Republican base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was wide and deep; he captured the majority of
nearly every demographic group. Most significant, Republicans
rallied to him in large numbers. And the reformer mantle that Bush
appropriated from McCain after the senator's stunning triumph in
New Hampshire 19 days ago paid off. Voters told pollsters Saturday
that they liked Bush's reform message and they suggested that
McCain was too much of an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had staked his prospects on the expectation that
independents and Democrats would flood to the polls and support him
overwhelmingly. In fact, estimates based on surveys of voters found
that turnout was heavy, and may have doubled the 276,000 who voted
in the primary here four years ago. And independents and Democrats
did turn out in larger numbers than in 1996, and those who did
largely backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people heard my message loud and clear,'' a jubilant Bush
said in an interview Saturday night with CNN. Conceding that his
campaign in New Hampshire was lackluster, he said, ``I did better
as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain had called to congratulate him. ``He was
gracious,'' he said. ``After tonight, it's going to be a good
contest. I think I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls closed, a jubilant and no doubt relieved,
Bush attributed his victory to his belief that his reform message
had sunk in. ``Early in the primary season, I got defined,'' he
told reporters. ``I told people I wasn't going to let that happen
in South Carolina.'' He added, ``My message, that I'm a reformer
with results, has taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was particularly welcomed by Bush because before New
Hampshire he was as much as 20 points ahead of McCain in polls
here, but more recently the race was neck and neck, with the
senator even outpacing Bush in some surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's advisers, already looking to the next contests,
asserted that Bush's hardline conservative message in South

to primaries in Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ought to be

 &HT;    Bush gains momentum with key victory in South Carolina
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C _ In the most critical win of his political
career, Texas Gov. George W. Bush reinvigorated his presidential
campaign Saturday by sacking Arizona Sen. John McCain in South
Carolina's GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on the big win _ exit polls indicated about a
14 point margin _ to help him regain momentum sapped from his
high-dollar campaign by McCain's surprise landslide victory in the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Alan Keyes finished a distant third and was not a
significant factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited and energized,'' Bush said as he watched election
returns in his hotel room where McCain called to concede eight
minutes after the polls closed. ``This campaign ignited and united
the Republican base.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, Bush, just before his afternoon nap and run,
was told by top strategist Karl Rove that South Carolina has
performed as the ``firewall'' Bush was counting on to block the
McCain surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now won four of the five contests: Iowa, Alaska,
Delaware and South Carolina, and it puts us in good shape now,''
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   University of South Carolina political scientist Blease Graham,
who has been watching politics here since 1970, was surprised by
the ease of Bush's victory. ``McCain might keep running, but I
really think this makes an uphill battle even steeper for him,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain camp believes Saturday's victory by Bush, which
included a heavy boost from religious conservatives, will be
hard-pressed to re-create in Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether he can run as a Dixiecrat in Michigan,
but we'll find out,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate Governor Bush on his victory here and wish him
a happy celebration and a good night's rest,'' McCain said at a
post-election rally. ``He's going to need it, my friends, for we
have just begun to fight and I cannot wait for the next round. I'm
going to fight with every ounce of strength that I have, but I'm
going to keep fighting clean. I'm going to keep fighting fair. And
I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, McCain raised concerns about the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation of Republican primary polling places across South
Carolina caused voter confusion and prompted McCain to demand an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign complained that precincts that were supposed
to be open were closed. The Arizona senator demanded ``a full
investigation'' after discovering the Pond Branch voting precinct
in Greenville was closed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said representatives
of the civil rights group had received complaints Saturday morning
that some polling places in heavily black areas were closed. He
said he would send a representative to South Carolina to
investigate the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take a look at these complaints to see if any
violations occurred,'' Mfume said at the NAACP's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes the win in South Carolina _ a state that has
backed the eventual nominee since it began holding primaries in
1980 _ will relegate New Hampshire back to its traditional role as
political freak show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down in the snow,'' Bush said of his New Hampshire
loss. ``I knocked the snow off my suit and came down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory will face quick tests. Voters in Michigan and Arizona
go to the polls Tuesday. While McCain is favored in his home state,
a Bush win in Michigan could deeply tarnish the sparkle of his sole
remaining real challenger for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates had reason to expect good things for them in
South Carolina, where 37 delegates were up for grabs. For Bush,
it's a state that traditionally goes with the establishment
candidate and where his father always ran well.
</P>
<P>
   For war-hero McCain, it's a state with a high veteran population
and a GOP primary open to all, with no Democratic primary. In New
Hampshire, Democrats and independents were a major part of the
McCain coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service exit polls here showed that 30 percent of the
voters identified themselves as independents, and McCain was backed
by 61 percent of them. But Bush built up a huge advantage (68
percent to 26 percent) among Republicans, as well as 67 percent
among those identifying themselves as members of the ``religious
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's big turnout was seen as a potential boost for McCain.
But, according to early results from exit polls, Bush picked up a
third of the Democratic and independent vote, a much better result
than he had in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling also showed 61 percent of the voters viewed Bush as
the ``real reformer,'' compared to 54 percent who said McCain
deserves that tag.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's primary was only the second contest between Bush and
McCain. The Texas governor won the Iowa caucuses and Delaware
primary, but McCain campaigned in neither state. McCain won big _
by 19 points _ in the New Hampshire primary that stripped Bush of
his prohibitive frontrunner status and wiped out his lead in South
Carolina polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's camp says it will now take the fight to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, told reporters, ``We'll
be up and running hard when we wake up in Michigan. Clearly, we're
going to have to sell really hard and really fast our reformer's
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding McCain's defeat, Davis told reporters, ``If it were
not for the massive negative campaign run against us, primarily in
the religious conservative community, we would have carried the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush disagreed. ``I think it's more than social conservatives''
that carried the day in South Carolina,'' he said. ``I united the
party. I brought elements of the party together. I convinced the
people of this state that I have an agenda that is positive and
hopeful and that I'm a reformer who has good results when given a
chance.''

 &HT;    S.C. Bush supporters seek to limit who votes
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Republican state legislators angered by John
McCain's appeal to Democratic and independent voters are pushing a
bill to end open primaries in South Carolina. Most of the sponsors
of the legislation in the state's House are supporters of George W.
Bush. An identical bill was also introduced in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong with the process,'' said GOP state Rep.
Harry Cato, a sponsor of the bill introduced Wednesday amid growing
concern by Bush strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's backers accused Democrats of encouraging party members to
vote for McCain, figuring he'd be an easier opponent in November
for likely Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The active Republicans and the active Democrats have always
respected one another's primaries,'' said Cato, a Bush supporter.
``That way, the independents out there can vote either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do not think I've seen that in this primary,'' he said.
``Each party ought to be able to nominate its candidate without
interference.''
</P>
<P>
   But another of the bill's sponsors, Republican Tracy Edge, said
the partisanship that spurred the bill will probably make it a hard
sell in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush were getting the (Democratic and independent) votes,
nobody would be crying foul,'' said Edge, a McCain supporter.
``There is some hypocrisy going on.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's GOP adopted the open primary 20 years ago at
the urging of Republican strategist Lee Atwater. He convinced
leaders that they could build the party in South Carolina and
bolster its national importance by holding an open primary earlier
than other states.
</P>
<P>
   It worked in 1980, as Democrats and independents helped
Republicans elect Ronald Reagan as president. But McCain's adoption
of the strategy drew criticism from Bush's backers, prompting
charges of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   In a Saturday editorial, The State newspaper in Columbia, which
has endorsed Bush, called open primaries ``an important tool for
building the Republican Party in South Carolina. It is hypocritical
to say they are a bad idea now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hendrix, executive director of the South Carolina Election
Commission, said he believes voters would resist legislation
requiring them to register by party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is that it is not anybody's business whether they
are a Republican, Democrat, independent or whatever,'' Hendrix
said.
</P>
<P>
   University of South Carolina political scientist Blease Graham
said he believes that sentiment will hurt the bill in the
Legislature. ``The open primary speaks to the sense of the South
Carolina voters being recognized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What core Republicans have to do is build a coalition with
independents,'' Graham said. ``While that may wreck the unity of
the South Carolina Republican Party, it probably a good tactic
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, voters expressed mixed views Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as an independent, Stanley Dubinsky said he
felt entitled to vote in the Republican primary. He voted for
McCain, but said he's not sure whether he'd vote Republican or
Democrat in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like free trade,'' Dubinksy, 47, said as he left
the polling place. ``The more open the process, the healthier it is
for everybody involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Moore, a Republican supporter of Bush, said he favors
an end to the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the validity of having a Republican primary
or a Democratic primary if you are allowing crossovers,'' he said.

 (REPEATING for all needing) 
CHARLESTON, S.C.: general election. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it seemed clear that his barrage of commercials worked to
Bush's advantage. Of the voters who were interviewed Saturday by
the Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and the
Associated Press, about a third said they waited until the last
week or so to decide who to vote for, and most of them backed Bush.
Voters were more likely to say that McCain had unfairly attacked
Bush than they were to say that Bush was the one attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartening sign to Bush as the voting moves to a more
varied electorate, Bush won the majority of support of nearly every
demographic group, including men, women, rich and poor, young and
old. Even veterans _ whom McCain had targeted in an all-out turnout
drive _ split their vote between McCain and Bush. More than a third
of voters said they considered themselves members of the religious
right, and more than two-thirds of those voters backed Bush. If
religious conservatives were removed from the mix, McCain would
barely have won.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Bush's drumbeat of reform and
leadership, as well his emphasis on moral values, meant a lot when
voters decided who to support.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush and McCain were viewed as reformers, Bush was seen
by voters as more of one. Voters were not convinced that McCain has
been true to his word on the issue of campaign finance, a subject
Bush hammered McCain on in his advertising. Nearly half the voters
said McCain says on thing but does another on campaign finance _
and they voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what issue played the greatest role in their decision,
voters said it was moral values, and they mostly backed Bush. Among
those who cited Social Security and Medicare, McCain was more
popular. But the issue of tax cuts was low on the list of voters'
priorities, even though Bush made it a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush succeeded in being portrayed as a reformer, McCain
was viewed as a man who stands up for his beliefs. That is the
character trait that voters said they cared most about, and more
than have of those voters backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, voters said they considered Bush more of a leader _ and
a more potent rival against the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, attributed the results
Saturday to a return to the roots of 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
when Bush talked about reforms he favored _ and spoke in specific
terms. He also said voters were impressed with a tougher, more
assertive Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these guys are going to come out of here with roughly
equivalent positives and negatives, and yet Bush is going to come
out of here with a substantial win,'' Rove said. ``And I think it's
because people looked at him and saw how he handled adversity, saw
how he passed through this test, and liked what they saw.'' He
added, ``People wanted to see, if you care about something, are you
somebody who is going to fight for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of voters in the primary were white, more
than half were men and more than four in 10 were over the age of
60. Nearly half said they had college degrees; three in 10 served
in the military. Blacks were virtually nonexistent in the voting,
even though in general elections in 1996 and 1998 they made up a
quarter of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The voters here are more conservative than most; nearly a
quarter described themselves as very conservative, and another four
in 10 called themselves somewhat conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six in 10 of the voters Saturday want abortion to be
against the law to varying degrees and they voted heavily for Bush.
Nearly six in 10 said they wanted abortion to either be always
illegal or mostly illegal, and nearly two-thirds of them voted for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After his most spirited, jam-packed week on the campaign trail
to date, Bush made only two public appearances Saturday, dropping
by Tommy's Country Ham House in Spartanburg for breakfast and then
visiting a nearby polling site at an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come out of this state feeling great,'' Bush said
to a dense huddle of reporters who surrounded him outside the
elementary school before the polls closed. ``When you win a state
like South Carolina, you get a bump.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter reminded Bush that he had also voiced optimism
before New Hampshire, he said, ``I was optimistic in New Hampshire.
``I'm really optimistic today.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's extremely good cheer was reflected in a slightly
different answer he gave minutes later to the question of what he
felt about the outcome in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my gut,'' Bush said, ``I feel three pancakes and bacon.''
That was what he had eaten at his previous stop at Tommy's Country
Ham House. Inside, Bush mingled merrily with voters.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a different kind of experience outside the
restaurant. A protester with the People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, who was dressed as a pig, drove by in a white dump
truck and deposited a pile of cow manure on the street near Bush,
and was then carted off by the police as he shouted, ``Meat is
murder!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of the protest group, Bush said, ``I'm
glad I had my bacon for breakfast.''

 (REPEATING for all needing)  
 ANALYSIS: BUSH WON BY STEALING McCAIN'S MESSAGE  
(rk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Shortly after President George Bush lost his
re-election bid in 1992, George W. Bush told a friend that his
father ``should never have let Bill Clinton dictate the terms of
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, the younger Bush did not make the same
error. Having been trounced by Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the
New Hampshire primary, having been branded as the stick-in-the-mud
candidate, Bush came to South Carolina, recast himself as a
hard-nosed conservative, as an outsider and as a reformer who gets
results. McCain, the Texan and his surrogates suggested, was a bit
too liberal, too Beltway-bound and too flaky.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, in other words, stole McCain's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   He righted his campaign, regained the momentum he enjoyed before
New Hampshire and re-emerged as a strong favorite to win the
Republican presidential nomination. Severely wounded here, McCain
will have a chance to rebound in the voting on Tuesday in Michigan,
where the ideological coloration of the electorate may be more
favorable to him, and he has vowed to fight on in what could
develop into a drawn-out struggle, not unlike the one between
Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford in 1976. But the electoral calendar
grows more favorable to Bush as it moves through March.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, a survey of voters in Saturday's Republican
primary suggested, were seen as reformers, but when they were
pitted against one another, Bush was seen as the more effective one
_ precisely as he had portrayed himself in a late blitz of
television commercials here.
</P>
<P>
   Other commercials flailed away at McCain's advocacy of campaign
finance reform. Nearly half the voters said that the senator says
one thing and does another when it comes to campaign finance, and
they were mostly Bush backers. That was a second building block of
the governor's victory.
</P>
<P>
   A third was his apparent success in capitalizing on a major
error by McCain, an intemperate commercial in which he compared
Bush to President Clinton. By election day, voters were more likely
to see McCain than Bush as an unfair aggressor, even though McCain
had come into the state with a reputation as a proponent of cleaner
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's television blitz, which dangerously depleted his
treasury, appeared to have paid off among those who made their
voting decisions in the frantic final hours of the campaign here.
About a third of the voters told interviewers as they left the
polls that they made up their minds in the last week or so, and
most went to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the critical failure was an inability to broaden the
electorate sufficiently. Knowing that he was trailing Bush among
the state's unusuallrvative Republican voters, he made an
unabashed appeal to Democratic and independent voters to cast
ballots in the Republican primary, hoping that the absence of a
Democratic primary would make it easier to attract those groups.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed last week to create ``a new Republican party'' in South
Carolina by bringing thousands of new voters into the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few Democrats crossed over. McCain got eight out
of ten of their votes, but they constituted less than a tenth of
the electorate, not enough to have a major impact. Likewise among
independents, who constituted about a third of those who cast
ballots Saturday. McCain took about twice as many of their votes as
his principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Republicans accounted for only a slightly smaller
percentage of the electorate than they did four years ago, marking
a signal lack of success for McCain's efforts. The electorate was
nearly all white, more than half male and older than most, with
four voters in ten over 60.
</P>
<P>
   One important element in the relatively modest crossover vote
was the decision by black voters, who form the backbone of the
modern Democratic Party in this state, to resist any suggestion
that they vote in the Republican primary. Only 1 percent of the
voters were black, in a state where blacks make up a quarter of the
electorate in general elections. They told interviewers earlier
this week that the two candidates' had forfeited any claim on their
support by refusing to condemn the flying of the Confederate flag
over the state capitol building in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his loss in New Hampshire, Bush boldly
announced that South Carolina was ``Bush country.'' His aides
calculated that the same party organization that carried his father
to victory in 1986, originally assembled by former Gov. Carroll
Campbell, would do the same for him. They proved prescient. Voters
told interviewers that they prefer a candidate who is loyal to the
Republican Party and has ties to its local leaders, and they
overwhelmingly saw Bush as embodying that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also succeeded in portraying himself as the more reliable
foe of abortion in a state where opposition to abortion is strong.
Nearly two-thirds of the most vehement anti-abortion voters went to
Bush; in New Hampshire, competing in a more crowded field, he got
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not gain the upset he had hoped for here, McCain
rode his New Hampshire victory to something approaching parity with
Bush in financial terms. Now, with only two days to campaign, he
will go after the conservative white voters known as Reagan
Democrats in the counties clustered to the north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has a long history of backing protest candidates and
insurgents, like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who won the 1988
Democratic caucuses here. Its Republicans are less conservative
than South Carolina's. And Gov. John Engler, who used to talk about
providing an asbestos wall there to protect Bush, has been sounding
a much different note lately.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Michigan, the governor said the other day, likes to be
taken for granted and to be told that one candidate is a certain
victor.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan is followed by a big group of primaries on March 7,
the most important of which, New York's and California's, are
effectively closed to all but Republican voters. Among the big
states voting on that day, only Ohio's is open _ a considerable
advantage for Bush. Then on March 14, Texas, his home base, and
Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, will cast their votes.
As the nation's second and fourth largest states, they will wield
considerable influence at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Had McCain won here, none of those details would have mattered
nearly as much. As he himself exulted this week, ``If we win here,
I don't see how we really can be stopped.'' But he could not bring
it off.

   (UPDATES with complete rewrite)

<P>
   OAK GROVE, S.C. _ The sidewalk leading to the Oak Grove Civic
Club is about 30 feet long, and at 7 a.m. it was packed with people
waiting for the doors to open so they could vote. Unfortunately for
Sen. John McCain, most of them were there to vote for Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Election workers at this suburban Columbia polling place, and at
many others around the state, said they had never seen such a heavy
turnout for a Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   That large number of voters was supposed to benefit McCain,
because of his support among independents and Democrats. What had
not been widely predicted, however, was that the turnout would be
so great in polling places like this one, a heavily Republican
suburb that cast twice as many votes for Bob Dole in 1996 as for
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People here said they showed up in such large numbers not
because they dislike McCain, but because they wanted to nominate a
man they saw as having the best chance of defeating Vice President
Al Gore, who they assume will be the Democratic nominee, and whom
they generally despise.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is a decent, moral man, and he can win,'' said
Margie Coker, who was wearing a T-shirt that said, ``Yes, I believe
in God.'' Elizabeth Whitehead, a friend, added, ``He'll make the
best president of the bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of the precinct's 2,681 registered voters
showed up to vote Saturday, said Grady Merritt, the Republican
chairman of the precinct, who said he could not recall a similar
turnout in a primary. That kind of enthusiasm was spread throughout
the state, where there were long lines at hundreds of polling
places _ mostly in the heavily Republican areas where Bush did
best.
</P>
<P>
   J. Sam Daniels, the executive director of the state Republican
Party, said the overall turnout was unprecedented, possibly as much
as 400,000. Exit polls suggested the number could even approach
500,000. In the 1996 primary, 276,000 people voted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire predictions of Bush supporters, the throng of
voters was not due to Democrats causing political mischief. Surveys
of voters showed that fewer than 10 percent were Democrats, about a
third independents, and about 60 percent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain clearly succeeded in adding attention and excitement to
the race _ nearly a third of those who voted said they had never
before participated in a Republican primary. But he was not able to
draw enough crossovers to counterbalance an enormously heavy
turnout of Republican Party regulars.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear, for example, in Forest Acres, a suburb of
Columbia that is mainly Republican but has large numbers of
independents and Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout there was so heavy early in the day that nearly a
quarter of the 1,600 registered voters in one neighborhood had
voted by 10:20 a.m. But most of the people standing in line at
midday said they were voting for Bush. A neighborhood like this was
crucial to McCain's hopes, but not enough Democrats or independents
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lawsuit brought earlier this month by Democrats,
who charged that the Republican Party had closed many polling
places in black and other Democratic areas in 1996, there were
hundreds more polling places open this year than ever before. The
suit was settled earlier this week when the Republican Party agreed
to provide volunteers or pay state workers to open every possible
polling place. But the large number of inexperienced poll workers
caused problems throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, a conservative bastion of Bush support, 21
polling places were closed because volunteers failed to show up,
Daniels said. Infuriated members of the McCain campaign said some
of the precincts were in Democratic areas and charged that they had
been deliberately kept closed to suppress McCain votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought the court had clearly dictated that all polling
sites should be open,'' McCain said on his bus Saturday morning.
``I believe there should be a full investigation. I don't know what
to say. It's so disappointing to hear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said only three of the closed polls were in black or
Democratic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Greenville, however, there were few reports of
problems. In Lexington County, a suburban area west of Columbia,
voting was substantial even in Democratic areas. At the Brookland
United Methodist Church in West Columbia, a traditionally
Democratic area, workers had anticipated about 139 voters for the
whole day, based on past turnouts in Republican primaries. But by
noon, there had already been 120 voters.
</P>
<P>
   At the North Bamberg precinct 50 miles south of Columbia, Ronny
Maxwell, the Republican volunteer poll manager, said at 1 p.m. that
nearly 300 people had voted, but he only had enough ballot slips
for 399 voters. He had to call the countyan to deliver 100
more ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was much lower in black areas, although there was a
trickle of voters in the community center in Martin Luther King Jr.
Park near downtown Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   According to polls, only 1 percent of the voters in the state
were black, although black voters constitute about 25 percent of
the state's electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said they were excited by all the attention given
the race, and the sense that their decision could make or break
either of the two leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a change, it got a little exciting around here,'' said
Jerry Bradley, a builder who voted Saturday afternoon at Oak Grove
accompanied by his young daughter. ``I never really felt like I had
much of a choice before.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he enjoyed thinking about it for a while, and then
settled on Bush.

FORD FRICTION CREATES HEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ As much as they like to disagree, drivers
of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix seem to be in
accord about one thing: Sunday's 42d running of the Daytona 500 is
not going to be a fair fight against the Fords.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since pole-sitter Dale Jarrett and outside pole Ricky Rudd
dominated qualifications in their Ford Tauruses, the General Motors
camp has complained long and loud about NASCAR's new shock/spring
rule.
</P>
<P>
   It claims the rule, implemented to smooth out the rough ride at
superspeedway venues through mandated shock and spring settings,
puts its cars at a competitive disadvantage against the Fords. Dale
Earnhardt, the seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion, was incensed
about the way his car handled in traffic in his 11th-place finish
in Thursday's Gatorade Twin 125s; he fumed that Ford's box-to-wire
victories in both qualifiers ``was the worst racing I've seen at
Daytona in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   GM drivers fear Sunday's race will be a complete drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an unbalanced field right now,'' said Richard
Childress, Earnhardt's car owner. ``We told (NASCAR officials) all
along this car has a lot of drag on it. We went to them and asked
them, and they've made their decision. We're just going to have to
go with what we've got. I've been in this business 30-something
years, and you're not going to overcome drag. The only thing that
will overcome drag is horsepower. We've got restrictor plates and
you can't get the horsepower through the restrictor plates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer, said NASCAR
was not about to make any changes to the shock/spring rule before
the Daytona 500, ``because we don't want to create a moving
target,'' he said. Further, they pointed to the racing that took
place in last Sunday's Bud Shootout as proof positive that Chevys
and Pontiacs could compete with the Fords.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have front springs, swaybar, trackbar, there are a lot of
things you can do to still help your car if it's not driving right,
so I really don't understand their complaint,'' said Jarrett, who
dented a rear bumper in a mishap during a Happy Hour practice
session Saturday. ``Half of it, it seems like they're blaming us
for their car having a lot of drag and, the last I checked, we
didn't build their cars. They submitted them. We worked on our cars
and made a good car.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin led for much of the Shootout and was challenged
by Jeff Gordon, the defending Daytona 500 champion. But it was
Jarrett, who won the 25-lap qualifier in a runaway, who came from
the back of the pack with the aid of drafting help from Pontiac
driver Bobby Labonte to win on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars ride better, they're softer and bounce around,''
Gordon said. ``They're nothing like they were when they were
beating us up. They've gone from one extreme to the next. We need
to be somewhere in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Chevys and Pontiacs are unable to negotiate
corners at full speed because of a push and, as a result, are
forced to lift on the throttle. When the GM cars are relegated to a
single-file draft, making it difficult to move up in the field, it
enables Fords to make a clean breakaway from the pack, such as the
one Bill Elliott made in his victory in the Twin 125s.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 20 laps into the race, the handling goes away where you
can't turn,'' Gordon said. ``The track warms up and the tires warm
up. You're just hanging on, and you have to lift. You just go up
there and wait for the car to run and try to keep your momentum and
try to stay on the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time Daytona turns into a handling racetrack, you're going
to see a poor race.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, some would say, an unfair fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind going to a gunfight if you've got a Colt .45, but
I've got a .22 revolver,'' said Felix Sabates, the head of Team
Sabco. ``I figure, with my .22, I'm going to be able to get you
anyway. If you go to a gunfight and guys have bazookas and you've
got a wooden knife, that's not too good. Basically, they've got
bazookas and we've got wooden knives.''

OLAZABAL REKINDLES DRIVE AND SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The situation was desperate enough in late 1999 that he took
himself out of the lineup at the Ryder Cup, but perhaps not as
severe as it was a few months earlier, when, he said, ``I was maybe
hitting three or four fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, said Jose Maria Olazabal, things were not very good
in late 1998, either, unless you compared it with 1995-96, when he
couldn't play and wasn't sure he would ever walk again. That was
the low point.
</P>
<P>
   For the proud, determined Spaniard, physical and mental
challenges have made this difficult game even tougher, though his
spirits have never dimmed. He draws strength from within, from the
countless friends who have encouraged him, and from four glorious
days in Augusta, Ga., last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memories of hard times, what I had to go through in my
life. To be able to talk about this and be in position to do what I
like to do most _ play golf _ is very, very special,'' said
Olazabal, who overcame two years of foot problems and an inability
to drive the ball straight to win his second Masters in 1999. In
tribute to his courage, Olazabal was voted the Ben Hogan Award for
overcoming serious injury to contribute to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget that my entire life,'' he said. ``From the
very bottom of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his Masters win in 1994 was special (``It is always
tougher to win that first major''), but the '99 triumph was more
enjoyable. And quite shocking. ``I was not playing very well and
was not confident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Champions Dinner before the tournament, Gary Player
sensed something was wrong and approached Olazabal. Olazabal told
the truth: He wasn't playing well, and his confidence was low.
</P>
<P>
   Player, a three-time champion at Augusta and one of the true
sporting marvels of our time, is a man of many qualities, intensity
being near the top. He told Olazabal to trust his swing because it
was a great swing, and to believe in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was spontaneous,'' said Olazabal, ``like you have a little
chat. Not long. Perhaps three to five minutes. But it was the way
he said it. Like he was a man on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal opened with a 70, then shot a 66, and everything seemed
to click.
</P>
<P>
   ``Player had built confidence in me, and it changed my
approach,'' said Olazabal, whose third-round 73 kept him in the
lead. When he went bogey-bogey-bogey starting at the third hole of
the final round, Olazabal turned to his caddie and said, ``I think
we're throwing this tournament away.'' Again, he dug deep. Again,
he overcame adversity.
</P>
<P>
   A birdie at the par-3 sixth stopped the bleeding. He got to the
turn with three straight pars, then shot 33 on the back for a
two-shot win. When Greg Norman rolled in an eagle putt at the 13th
to threaten Olazabal's lead, the Spaniard never blinked. He knocked
down his birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the turning point,'' said Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal rode out of Augusta with another green jacket, but some
old problems accompanied him. He played badly in ensuing weeks,
broke his hand in frustration at the US Open, then perhaps
exercised poor judgment by rushing back for the British Open. Never
a great driver, he got even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no confidence. I just couldn't hit a fairway,'' he said,
at one point calling his Masters triumph ``an oasis in the
desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The woes plagued him throughout the rest of the season, and at
33, he still has much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were resigned to a career of bad driving, he said,
``I will never accept that. I think I am pointed in the right
direction now. I have made a couple of changes in my swing, with my
grip. There is no reason why I cannot be a good driver.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Olazabal has played twice in Australia. His driving
wasn't bad, but his irons, he said, were awful. This week he will
be in Carlsbad, Calif., for the Andersen Consulting World Match
Play event, then he will play in the Dubai Desert Classic. Warmups
at The Players Championship and the BellSouth Classic will usher
him into Augusta, which should help rekindle his spirited game.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to the challenge
</P>
<P>
   For now, it will be the victory that ended Tiger Woods's streak,
but Phil Mickelson's effort at the Buick Invitational may go down
as the turning point in his career. As gifted as any player who has
come into the game in the last 25 years, Mickelson had lost much of
the spotlight to three players who arrived on the stage after he
did _ Woods, David Duval, Justin Leonard _ and increasingly he was
being asked not about his successes but his failures. Mickelson won
on Tour as an amateur in 1991 and through 1996 had nine victories.
And though he knocked off four more wins in 1997-99, Mickelson took
a back seat to Leonard (three wins, including a British Open and
TPC), Duval (11 wins, including a Tour Championship and TPC), and,
of course, Woods (15 wins, two majors). Unlike those players,
Mickelson had to face questions about his inability to hold it
together down the stretch, particularly in big events. His
final-round scoring average in 1999, for instance, was 72.5, 134th
on Tour, which prompted a reporter to ask Mickelson if there were
any reasons for it. ``I don't know, and I don't care,'' he snapped.
Much was made of his closing 65 at the NEC Invitational last
August, but overlooked was the fact that Mickelson bogeyed two of
the final three holes to lose by one to Woods. He also shot these
final-round numbers at marquee events in 1999: 78 at the Mercedes,
80 at Phoenix, 82 at TPC, 77 at the PGA Championship, 78 at the
American Express. Two weeks before the Buick, Mickelson led the
Phoenix Open standing on the 10th tee of the final round, then
proceeded to shoot 40 and tumble to T-10. Indeed, Mickelson had to
play with those thoughts in his head down the stretch at San Diego,
in addition to matching whatever Woods did in front of him, but he
was equal to the challenge and deserves credit. He conceded his
work ethic slipped a bit in 1999, but a more devoted practice
schedule ushered him into the new year, one he hopes can push him
back into the stifling spotlight to which he is accustomed . . .
Arnold Palmer on Woods: ``I marvel (at his) ability to release
through the ball. I have not seen a player _ maybe Nicklaus, maybe
Player, but I'm not sure if I've ever seen anyone _ release the
club through the ball with the clubhead speed that Tiger does.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast to coast
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the Doral Open signaled the start of the PGA
Tour season, back when events out West were bypassed because of
their desert locales, celebrity fields, and small purses. That has
changed. The Buick Invitational had a decent field, and this week's
Nissan Open is jam-packed with the game's best. PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem said recently he used to be asked all the
time about ideas for getting better players out West, but now he
faces questions about improving the first two stops in Florida _
the Doral and the Honda Classic. The best American players are
skipping the Doral, so the attractions will come from an
international pool, including defender Steve Elkington, Norman,
Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Bernhard Langer, Nick
Price, and Retief Goosen, the South African who will be making a
rare start in the United States. Doral officials announced that
Nicklaus and John Daly are also committed, though most top
Americans are resting for the Bay Hill-TPC-Masters run . . . Part
of the problem, of course, is having so many options. Last week,
the Buick Invitational in San Diego attracted a nucleus of big
names, but so did the Australian Masters (Norman, Stuart Appleby,
Sergio Garcia, amateur sensation Aaron Baddeley), and the Malaysian
Open (Langer, Goosen, Padraig Harrington, Per-Ulrik Johansson) . .
. It isn't often that you shoot 82 and still make the cut, but
Robin Byrd did just that at the Australian Masters in Melbourne. He
got through the 36-hole cutoff with a 69, but fell back with a
74-75 weekend . . . While most of Europe's big names (Olazabal,
Harrington, Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Paul Lawrie, Miguel Angel
Jiminez) are either in the United States or preparing to be here
for the Andersen Consulting World Match Play event that starts
Wednesday, the Algarve Portuguese Open is going on with a field
devoid of stars. Ian Woosnam is one noteworthy entrant, and another
that raises interest is Ronan Rafferty. The Northern Irishman is
attempting a comeback at age 36 after missing nearly two years with
a variety of thumb and wrist problems . . . Onetime PGA Tour player
Bob Lohr had his own woes at last week's Buy.com event. The night
before the final round, he injured his right hand. He would have
withdrawn, but he would not have earned a paycheck if he did. So
Lohr basically played one-handed, shot 98, and finished last.
Still, he earned a check, and even though it was for just $1,200,
every penny counts in today's pro golf world.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blocks
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lendzion, the longtime pro at the Quechee Club in Vermont,
made a nice splash in his debut as a card-carrying member of the
Senior PGA Tour by finishing T-17 to earn $17,050 at the Royal
Caribbean Classic. Last week, Lendzion opened with a 76 and never
recovered at the Ace Group Classic in Naples, Fla., finishing 20
shots behind the winner, Lanny Wadkins . . . With the Women's
Australian Open on deck, some top LPGA Tour players skipped this
week's Hawaiian Ladies Open in favor of arriving Down Under a few
days earlier. Kelly Robbins, for one, wasn't crazy about what she
discovered when she got to the Yarra Yarra course in Melbourne: a
layout of just 5,938 yards. ``It's playing a little short right
now,'' said Robbins, who needed her driver only a few times. A
particular annoyance is a par 5 that measures but 422 yards.
``You're seeing courses shortened by choice, not because of the
weather.'' . . . The University of Rhode Island finished sixth in a
16-team field at the recent Bridges All-American Intercollegiate
tournament in Bay St. Louis, Miss. Senior Michael Sims opened with
a 69 and led URI with a 218 total for 54 holes, finishing sixth in
the individual race. Josh Hillman of Greenfield (223), Jim
Salinetti of Stockbridge (224), Mike Carbone of Brewster (231), and
Justin Thompson (241) rounded out the URI scoring . . . James
Dodson, who has authored a couple of must-read books if you are a
golf fan, will be guest speaker March 9 when the Massachusetts Golf
Association holds its 38th annual spring conference. Dodson, a
columnist for Golf Magazine who lives in Maine, wrote ``Final
Rounds,'' which so impressed Winnie Palmer that it led to ``A
Golfer's Life,'' Dodson's collaboration with Arnold Palmer. The
conference will be held at the Westin Copley Place Boston; for
information, call 781-449-3000 . . . Bob Ruszala of Hickory Ridge
in Amherst is the new president of the Golf Course Superintendents
Association of New England. He becomes the first president in 30
years from the western end of the state . . . Joe Concannon, a
colleague who died at age 60 last week, was a man of modest desires
but extravagant generosity. For some 30 years, he wrote about golf
for the Globe, and it was a perfect fit _ a man of dignity and the
most honorable of sports. That he died too young is a given; that
he gave everything he had to his profession and to his countless
friends is what should be remembered.

BRUINS HAVE FROZEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slightly more than three weeks remain before the NHL's March 14
trade deadline, and it looks like the Bruins will remain in ``Stand
Pat'' mode during what little time is left of the season.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so let me ask, is that all there is to a fire? I mean, the
whole thing goes up in flames and everyone _ that especially means
you, fans of Hub hockey _ is supposed to sit around here and wonder
what next cool gimmick will pop up on the Vault's Jumbotron?
</P>
<P>
   Is that where we are in 2000? Everyone thinking, ``Sure, it
stinks, but so what?'' If so, the Boston hockey fan has become
nearly as faceless and apathetic as the product.
</P>
<P>
   Great Game. Good Guys.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadful Results.
</P>
<P>
   What, and no one cares?
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns remains behind the Boston bench, despite owner Jeremy
Jacobs shaking down the thunder a few weeks ago from Buffalo. A
remark of equal significance that got little media attention was
captain Ray Bourque's recent support of Burns. To fire Burns now
would be wrong, noted Bourque, saying, ``Believe me, you can bring
anyone in here and they can't do a better job than Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   That says the captain believes the product, as constituted here
in February 2000, just isn't good enough. That would make Burns the
right coach but the Bruins just a bad, untalented team, factoring
in all the variables (holdouts, injuries, bad trades, bad bounces,
poor acquisitions, etc).
</P>
<P>
   Is that stating the obvious? Sure. But at some point the paying
customers will recognize what's before them _ just as they did when
they vacated Foxborough in the pre-Parcells days _ and that could
leave Causeway Street just a lonely pothole at the edge of the Big
Dig (don't get me started).
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the Bruins trying to market a club that missed the
playoffs for a second time in four seasons and no longer has
Bourque on the back line. Tough sell. No one knows for certain
whether Bourque will retire after this season, but why, other than
money, would he want to subject himself to such frozen water
torture one more time? What a 40th birthday party that would be in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Could the waves of boos that cascaded in the Vault last Saturday
night, in the late stages of a 5-1 humbling at the hands of the
Panthers, be the recognition that vox populi finally is getting,
shall we say, edgy?
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly 28 years that have passed since the Bruins won the
Stanley Cup, there have been bad teams here, but never so bad and
so unentertaining with such little promise. That's the horror.
They've now crossed into Celtic-like insignificance, just a bunch
of suits with familiar logos, filling up arena dates, their best
games ending in (yahoo!) ties. They don't even have a towel-wagging
M.L. Carr type to whip the crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night in New York, a 5-2 loss had some momentary
tension and competitiveness in the second period. But by and large,
it was a classic ho-hum mail-in job that would bring tears even to
that Fred Creighton-led team of 1979-80 (no barnburner itself).
That team at least had gumption, brothers Milbury, McNab, and
O'Reilly jumping into the MSG stands for a rumble because a fan had
the audacity to yank Stan Jonathan's stick out of his hands. Now
they go into MSG, get mugged by the ``Czechmates'' (Petr Nedved,
Radek Dvorak, and Jan Hlavac), and everyone in Black and Gold acts
like a New York tourist _ just glad to escape alive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Messrs. Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell have taken
their ``Stand Pat'' approach to new heights. While the product has
chugged and sputtered along to 18 wins _ fewest in the Northeast
Division and more than only the Islanders, Lightning, and Thrashers
_ the front office hasn't done a single thing to add to the product
since the Dec. 7 acquisition of Marty McSorley. Nothing, for almost
three months.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, prior to the All-Star Game, I thought
they might deal for help on the penalty-killing unit (Coach
Jacobs's stated sore spot) and provide Burns &AMP; Co. with the
slightest booster shot to make a run at a playoff spot. But,
nothing. Meanwhile, the Bruins have gone 0-2-2 since the All-Star
break, and it's taking on the look of the post-Thanksgiving 3-12-8
massacre and that 0-5-4 start in October.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine for Jacobs to criticize the product. Ownership has its
privileges. Jacobs writes the checks. However, when he pinpointed
the PK as the single most troubling issue, and flogged the coaching
staff, then Sinden and O'Connell owed it to Burns and, more
important, the fans to find some help.
</P>
<P>
   True, Burns was slow to alter his approach, finally implementing
a slightly upbeat forecheck only after weeks of horrible results.
But it has been clear here since at least early December that the
front office has had to add to the roster. Burns was slow. The
front office was stationary.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell and Sinden decided to stand pat, leave the coach _ and
the roster _ in place, and the result is a bizarre, struggling, and
often inept product.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket to ride
</P>
<P>
   Michal Grosek, Buffalo's Cam Neely wannabe, is the Sabre most
likely to be ditched as the trade deadline approaches. Head coach
Lindy Ruff benched Grosek for one game and suited him up against
the Oilers last Sunday only because Curtis Brown had the flu. But
Ruff didn't give Grosek a shift against the Oilers _ reminiscent of
the Neely-Kevin Stevens incident here . . . The Buffalo front
office continues to snuff out rumors that Dominik Hasek will be
dealt, even after his recent decision to play at least one more
year. But for a small-market club that could lose $12 million or
more this season, one that lost in the Cup finals last year even
with Hasek, the Sabres no doubt will be peppered with proposals
over the next three weeks. Philadelphia could come calling with an
offer too good to refuse . . . If Bob Corkum's salary demands
hadn't been so high last summer, the Rangers would have signed him
before ex-Bruin Tim Taylor. But Corkum, formerly of UMaine, balked
at the Blueshirts' offer of $1 million-plus per year, allowing
Taylor to jump to the head of the line. Corkum ultimately landed in
LA for a two-year hitch worth $700,000 this year (pro-rated) and
$800,000 next year _ only a touch better than the $675,000 he made
in Phoenix last season . . . He's 35 now, but Brian Bellows, last
seen with the Capitals last season (17-19_36), might be a help to
someone down the stretch. According to his agent, ex-Bruin Brian
Lawton, Bellows is home in Minneapolis, remains in shape, and is
looking for offers . . . The Neely Foundation, run by brothers Cam
and Scott Neely, opened a new wing at the New England Medical
Center last month for cancer patients and their families. Since
opening its doors in August 1997, the foundation has hosted
500-plus families. Donations to the Neely Foundation can be sent to
30 Winter Street, second floor, Boston 02108 . . . The Rangers
moved defenseman Brian Leetch up front on the Nedved-Dvorak line
against the Panthers last week, in hopes of neutralizing Pavel Bure
. . . Isn't it about time for Esa Tikkanen to show up on an NHL
roster? Tikk is back in Finland playing for Jokerit with ex-Bruin
Dmitri Kvartalnov . . . Ivan Hlinka, head coach-to-be in
Pittsburgh, might recruit old pal Thomas Gradin, once a teammate in
Vancouver, as an assistant coach with the Penguins. Gradin is now
the Canucks' chief scout in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   No deal with the Devil
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Devils will make a deal or two, but one won't be
the acquisition of Teemu Selanne from the Ducks. ``That's so out of
whack, it has to be addressed,'' said Anaheim GM Pierre Gauthier,
responding to the rumor. ``That's a total fabrication.'' . . . Word
around Phoenix is that the Coyotes will deal little-used blue liner
Deron Quint, ex- of Tabor Academy and the 30th pick overall
(Winnipeg) in the '94 draft . . . The Stars had a lot to work with,
but Dallas management, after purging the roster of veterans Dave
Reid, Pat Verbeek, Benoit Hogue, and Craig Ludwig, did some
admirable on-the-run patching after realizing some rookie
shortcomings. To wit: the additions of Kirk Muller, Dave Manson,
Scott Thornton, and Sylvain Cote. Muller's good work earned him a
boost in this year's salary and a guarantee for next season. He
jumped from a pro-rated $300,000 this year to a pro-rated $650,000
and he picked up an added year at $750,000 . . . Brett Hull
returned to the Dallas lineup wearing a full shield after surgery
on his broken nose. Stuck at 603 goals, the Golden Brett needs
seven more strikes to reach his dad's total of 610. Brett,
comparing his style with Bobby's: ``I just lumbered around the ice,
so I kind of developed a style, a stealth mode, I guess I'd call
it. I would just weave my way in and out of holes. My dad gave me a
piece of advice very early. He said, `The farther you think you are
out of the play, that is when you are the closest to it.' I said
that to Wayne Gretzky one time and he agreed wholeheartedly with
it. We are different that way, but in the same sense I think that
the personality I got from him helps you score goals because you
have to know you can score.'' . . . Hard, hard times for hockey
lovers, losing both Charles M. Schulz and his beloved ``Peanuts''
gang last weekend. I know he wouldn't fit the classic definition,
but Schulz would be a fitting inductee for the Hockey Hall of Fame.
The Elmer Ferguson Award _ bestowed upon the (Lawrence)
Eagle-Tribune's Russ Conway last year _ is given ``in recognition
of distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words
have brought honor to journalism and to hockey.'' Now, find me a
more honorable character than Woodstock, hockey stick in hand,
twirling around his frozen birdbath. Good grief, stickhandling was
an art in those days, wasn't it?

US BOOTED OUT OF GOLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Colombia gained some revenge. And most of the failings
of the United States national soccer team development system were
exposed in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia eliminated the US on penalty kicks, 2-1, after playing
to a 2-2 tie over 120 minutes in 85-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia was seeking to compensate for a disastrous World Cup
'94 elimination by the US, and succeeded because of a spectacular
left-footed Gerardo Bedoya drive from 25 yards that zipped past
Brad Friedel's outstretched hand in the 82d minute to tie the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   On penalty kicks, Andres Mosquera and Gonzalo Martinez beat US
goalkeeper Brad Friedel, while Eddie Lewis was the only one among
five Americans to convert.
</P>
<P>
   The US squandered the lead twice, but Colombia coach Luis Garcia
simply outmaneuvered US coach Bruce Arena with substitutions. Arena
should not take all the blame, though, since he had no one on the
bench to match Colombia reserves Mayor Candelo and John Wilmar
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   After Jovan Kirovski departed in the 27th minute with a broken
foot, the US midfield play dropped off. And, though the US remained
dangerous on the wings with Cobi Jones and Lewis crossing to Brian
McBride and Eric Wynalda, the team simply did not have enough
variety to unbalance Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The US defense, led by Robin Fraser, contained Faustino Asprilla
after he scored in the 24th minute to match McBride's 21st-minute
header. But Fraser, Jeff Agoos, and Eddie Pope had to work much
harder than the Colombian defenders. This allowed Garcia to refresh
the Colombian midfield with creative players. And, by the second
half and 30 minutes of extra time, Colombia's ability to control
possession and keep the US off balance was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   This was the earliest elimination of the US from the continental
championship since the tournament was relaunched in 1991 as the
Gold Cup. The US has a 16-3-2 record in the Gold Cup and had failed
to reach the finals only on 1996, after falling to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose the game, and it's certainly not the end of the
world,'' Arena said. ``But we lost two leads and we should be able
to protect the lead with 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roster limits were low for some strange reason. You can't
play a tournament like this with 18 players, and with the gate
receipts from these games they should be able to pay for two more
players. It must have been 85 degrees out there and we don't have
the fitness right now because our league is not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians were committed to attack in the first half, and
Bonner Mosquera caught Friedel off his line with a 40-yard blast
off the bar in the sixth minute. Asprilla pressured Friedel and
blocked his clearance wide of the net five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But the US had chances, mostly thanks to Jones's threatening
runs on the left side. Bedoya, the Colombian left back, matched up
well with Jones, and when in doubt, simply felled Jones just
outside the penalty area. And the US nearly capitalized on Lewis's
free kicks, one of which was nearly headed in for an own goal and
another was tipped over the bar by Miguel Calero.
</P>
<P>
   The US took the lead as Wynalda found Jones on the right and
Jones chipped a perfect ball for McBride to head past Calero from
15 yards. Three minutes later, Bedoya slammed down Jones. And the
Colombians, seemingly inspired, scored soon after as Frankie Oviedo
found Hector Hurtado with a 40-yard through ball, and Asprilla
finished Hurtado's square ball.
</P>
<P>
   The US's Richie Williams hit the post five minutes into golden
goal extra time, and Asprilla's free kick hit the post in the 108th
minute.

`COPS' GOES FOR RIDE ON `X-FILES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything looks and sounds familiar _ the ``Bad Boys'' theme
song, the police and suspects racing around on videotape, the car
chases, the digitized faces, Mulder and Scully . . .
</P>
<P>
   What? Mulder and Scully, our favorite paranormal-investigating
FBI snoops? Wait a second, which Fox show is this, ``Cops' or ``The
X-Files?''
</P>
<P>
   To its everlasting credit, if it weren't for the opening credits
and commercial lead-outs, you'd never know. (Well, that and the
stars.) The 150th episode of ``The X-Files'' isn't just a parody or
homage to ``Cops.'' It IS ``Cops.'' Except that it's really ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Whatever the case, it's fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got voted down for union rules and whatnot, but I wanted not
to even have ``The X-Files'' logo on it anywhere,'' said Vince
Gilligan, the co-executive producer who wrote the episode. ``I
wanted it to be a one-hour episode of ``Cops'' with nothing but the
``Cops'' identifiers on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got pretty close. You want realism? With three exceptions,
every officer shown in the episode is a real Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: Although I love ``The X-Files,'' I hate
``Cops.'' I've always thought the only people who watch the show
are those who hope one day to appear on it (and I don't mean in a
police uniform).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a big fan of the show `Cops,' '' Gilligan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it ever since it was first on,'' he continued. ``It
struck me about three years ago, `Wouldn't it be cool to have
Mulder and Scully be on ``Cops?'' It sort of went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot is basic ``X-Files'' : Someone _ or something _ is
killing people. The authorities suspect gang activity. Mulder, of
course, has other ideas. Although Scully resents the ``Cops'' crew
following them around, Mulder welcomes the opportunity to prove to
the world that the paranormal exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sat down to write it, I was like, `Man, I've got myself
into a corner, because Mulder can't win in this one,' '' Gilligan
said. ``We can't even see the monster in this one, because if we
saw the monster, it's like a national audience is seeing the
monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly Mulder (would be) a world hero. He's the most famous
guy in the world for showing America a real honest-to-God werewolf,
or whatever the monster may be.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for sad-sack Mulder. The opposite is true. On a
normal ``X-Files'' episode, shot on film with creepy lighting and
ominous music, Mulder's crackpot theories and Scully's skepticism
play as high drama. Shown in the cold, glaring ``Cops'' style _
shot on tape, with no background music _ they come off a little
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems even nuttier,'' Gilligan said. ``She just doesn't
want to be on tape. I guess that makes her seem a little
unfriendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan is being diplomatic. Mulder seems like a real whack
job; when she addresses the camera, Scully is scarier than any
monster the duo might turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's a fan, Gilligan's script pokes fun at ``Cops'' as
well. Guest star Judson Mills does a great job capturing the barely
concealed machismo and wannabe star attitude the officers on the
real ``Cops'' exude (as does David Duchovny, as Mulder).
</P>
<P>
   Unless Duchovny changes his mind, this will be the last season
of ``The X-Files.''Good timing for Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' he said, ``if the show does end this season, I was
lucky to get to do this one.''
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky, too. &QL;

HOUSTON'S CASSERLY STARTING FROM SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you hail from New Jersey and matriculate at Springfield
College, you can end up many places, but one of them is not usually
atop a Brahma bull.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Casserly tried his best to avoid that fate this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The new general manager and director of football operations for
the Houston Whatever They End Up Being Called, has been in Texas
for a little more than a month trying to create an organization
that will turn Bob McNair's huge investment into an NFL franchise
worthy of his massive commitment. But before Casserly had time to
do that, there was a bull to deal with first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the rodeo,'' said the former general manager of
the Washington Redskins. ``My family is coming in (from Virginia)
and we're the grand marshal of the parade, so I've got to go out
and buy some Western gear. I have no idea what that entails, but
they're taking me to a Western shop and the manager is supposed to
help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I could ride on a horse, a bull, or in a covered
wagon. I voted for the covered wagon. I told them unless they
wanted me to have the shortest tenure of any general manager in NFL
history, they better put me in the wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins the latest chapter of an NFL management career that
began in 1977 in an $8-a-night room at the YMCA in Alexandria, Va.,
a place Casserly ended up after Redskins coach George Allen took
him up on an offer he made to all 28 NFL teams. Unable to move from
a high school coaching job in Massachusetts to the college ranks,
he would work in any capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As an unpaid intern, Casserly went to the Redskins and didn't
leave for 22 years, working in the scouting department under Bobby
Beathard that built the heart of Washington's first Super Bowl
team. Eventually he became assistant general manager in 1982 under
Beathard and took over in 1989 after Beathard moved to San Diego.
He built a team that won Super Bowl XXVI in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In good years and bad, the Redskins remained a Casserly creation
until Daniel Snyder took over last year, buying the team from the
estate of Jack Kent Cooke. Although loyal to the Redskins, Casserly
knew his days were numbered once Snyder took over, but he put
together a draft day trade that landed Champ Bailey and enough
first-round picks over the next couple of years to allow the new
owner to rebuild into a champion again.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been easier had Casserly been retained, but he
was not and spent the past season out of the league for the first
time in three decades. Because McNair is a smart businessman,
Casserly didn't stay out long.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the NFL Jan. 19 after weighing job possibilities,
but now that he's back, what will he do for a team that won't begin
play for two years?
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined the BLESTO scouting combine and I brought in Mike
Maccagnan as our scout for them until we can switch him to pro
scouting (which he did for Casserly in Washington for six years)
and hired Chuck Banker as director of pro scouting (also from
Washington),'' Casserly said. ``We brought Chuck in sooner than I
expected, but Carolina had offered him a job so we did it ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us will be at the combine later this month. We're
getting boxes of tape and ordering our video equipment so we can
look at player tape by March as well. Then we'll bring in a salary
cap analyst because, even if we're without players, we have to keep
up with the (cap) trends.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five weeks and for the foreseeable future,
Casserly's biggest job will be visiting training facilities
throughout the league. He's designing his team's practice complex,
which will adjoin the state-of-the-art stadium McNair is building
in downtown Houston. For a guy who has spent most of his life
evaluating talent, evaluating architecture and design is a bit of a
change. For the moment, that is Casserly's job, and it's better
than bull riding.
</P>
<P>
   In the end though, his job in Houston will be what it was in
Washington: finding players he can win with. According to Casserly,
it's a job that will begin long before his team takes its first
snap in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be scouting, but not picking players,'' Casserly said,
``because we'll have a shot at 70 percent of the players in April's
draft. That many will be cut in four years or in the expansion
draft or become free agents. You make your decisions on players on
their history, not on one year, so we'll be able to have three
years of scouting on a lot of guys by the time we're in the
business of selecting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll reconstruct this year's draft and by the time we're
done, we'll have a college report on every player so when we're on
the clock in 2002, we'll have a full three years of scouting
reports to evaluate players on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the thought of that moment two years down the road that
led Casserly to Texas in the first place. To have taken a job with
an existing NFL team would have been to inherit problems not of his
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the jobs available to me were interesting, but what I
appreciated about Houston was we're starting from scratch,''
Casserly said. ``It's the challenge of building from nothing that I
liked. You have the chance to hire all your own people and build a
team in a town where football is king. Everybody here is a football
fan, so there's no question we can sell out every week if we can
give them a team that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Casserly's job, one he did with regularity in
Washington. Now he's in an unfamiliar town in an unfamiliar job _
trying to find football players. That isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``What problems we have we will have created ourselves,''
Casserly said. ``I do think the climate for an expansion team has
changed dramatically from when Carolina and Jacksonville came in.
Teams do a much better job now of keeping their own players. I know
when I looked at the (expansion) list Cleveland had to draw from,
there wasn't a lot of talent there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is your foundation. That means it takes 3-5 years to
build a team, but that, in the end, will be our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is, McNair's Houston team has its cornerstone in the guy
who'll be doing the draft _ as long as they can keep him off those
bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Stat Pack
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made in Green Bay of the fact that the Packers had
a 1,000-yard rusher, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 4,000-yard
passer. While that may be true, it doesn't reveal a more important
statistic. In five of the Packers' eight division games, they
scored only one offensive touchdown. ``So much for stats,'' said
general manager Ron Wolf. The Packers expect tight end Mark Chmura
to be back at full strength, which should come as good news to
Brett Favre. The quarterback relied on Chmura to get his offense
out of trouble . . . You have to hand it to Georgia Frontiere,
because she certainly did to Dick Vermeil. The departing Rams coach
was given a $2 million farewell bonus, which will be paid at
$500,000 a year for the next four years. In exchange, Vermeil will
serve as a consultant, if asked. Actually, it's a good deal for the
Rams. If St. Louis fired Vermeil, it would have cost $3.9 million
to buy him out. Instead, the Rams get a Super Bowl trophy and save
$1.9 million for rewarding a good guy who earned the money . . .
Rams right tackle Fred Miller had more than the 24 million reasons
to sign with Tennessee. He had the memory of six false starts and
two holding penalties against the Titans' Jevon Kearse last Oct.
31. Miller made $429,000 last season, which means he just got a
raise of more than 10 times last year's pay . . . You've got to
give Frank Gansz credit. He quit the Rams last week because at 61
he was tired of living in St. Louis while his wife was raising
their three grandchildren in Atlanta. He lived alone in St. Louis
for three years, commuting to Atlanta when he could. Reportedly, he
told assistant coach Jim Hanifan the day he quit, ``Simply stated,
this is not a way to live.'' Gansz had been offered a contract
extension but never signed. Some felt he was looking for work.
Actually, he just wanted to go home . . . Mike McCarthy must have
done a hell of a job last week. Seven days after being hired by Jim
Haslett as the Saints' quarterbacks coach, he was promoted to
offensive coordinator. It was a promotion that came six weeks after
he was fired as part of Ray Rhodes's staff in Green Bay. McCarthy
has never been an offensive coordinator in 13 years as a coach. He
will run the West Coast offense similar to the way the Broncos use
it with Terrell Davis . . . Speaking of Denver, sportswriters there
have to be in mourning now that loquacious Shannon Sharpe has
landed in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A good spread
</P>
<P>
   Despite arbiter Sam Kagel's ruling that Barry Sanders must repay
the Lions $5.58 million of an $11 million signing bonus, it will
have little impact on Detroit's salary cap. If Detroit spreads the
money out, as Kagel suggested, the Lions would be hit with $3.83
million (because of a $1.75 million payment already made) this
year, but would have an additional $1.913 million in cap room in
2001 and $1.83 million the following two years . . . Is it
fraternization to coach in the Pro Bowl? Only 10 days after the
Tampa Bay staff handled the NFC team, Vikings center Jeff Christy
jumped ship and signed with the Bucs for $17.5 million over five
years. That means the end for Tony Mayberry, whom the Patriots
tried to lure years ago when he was a restricted free agent . . .
Apparently, Dan Rooney likes to get his employees from close to
home. He replaced ex-Steeler ballboy turned director of football
operations Tom Donahoe with Kevin Colbert, who went to a local
Pittsburgh Catholic school whose alums include Rooney and his
former boss with the Lions, Ron Hughes. Colbert was the Lions'
director of pro scouting the last 10 years . . . A week to the day
after naming defensive tackle Norman Hand its franchise player, the
Chargers removed the tag last week. Hand now may find that the
Chargers' original offer of just under $4 million a year is more
than he can get elsewhere. If it works out, Beathard would have
made a brilliant business move by stalling Hand for a week, saving
$4.73 million on the cap, then freeing him when it was too late to
get the $5 million a year he hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   It's elementary
</P>
<P>
   Just before he signed a deal with the Panthers, Atlanta pass
rusher Chuck Smith flatly stated what he had to offer. ``They need
defense,'' Smith said. ``That's where I come in. I bring another
element to the table.'' Apparently Carolina agreed because it
handed him a five-year, $21 million contract a day later . . . Some
guys don't think too clearly. Detroit pass rusher Robert Porcher
reportedly turned down a five-year, $35 million deal that included
a $12 million signing bonus from the Lions. So what happened next?
Detroit slapped the franchise tag on him, meaning he gets $4.25
million next year, the average of the top five defensive ends. ``No
way I can play for that,'' Porcher said. He should go talk to Joey
Galloway . . . Every year you say free agency can't get any
nuttier, and then a guy like Phillip Daniels is signing with the
Bears for $24 million, which included an $8 million signing bonus,
the highest in Chicago history. What has the 26-year-old Daniels
done to justify the cash? He had a career-high nine sacks last
season. He has averaged barely five sacks in four years in the NFL.
Maybe he's ready to blossom. The Bears had better hope so, or
somebody is going to pay, and it won't just be the guy writing
Daniels's check. But that's not the half of it. Ever hear of
Orpheus Roye? He just jumped from Pittsburgh to the Browns for a
reported five-year, $25 million deal after a four-sack season. The
Browns say he's an emerging player. He'd better emerge into Reggie
White to justify that cash. ``How many guys who get these contracts
play better for their new team?'' asked Titans executive Jeff
Diamond. The answer is not many. But they never learn.

GAMACHE PLAYS MATCHMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fortunately for Joey Gamache, Jimmy Glenn's bar isn't far from
HBO's offices.
</P>
<P>
   One day last August, the two-time world champion happened to be
walking into the joint in Manhattan owned by his trainer when he
noticed HBO's building just up the block, and on the spot he
announced he was going in to see HBO Sports executive Lou DiBella.
What came from that unscheduled meeting was one last chance for a
tough battler from Maine to climb into boxing's big-time.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gamache will step into the ring at Madison Square
Garden against another former champion down on his luck, Arturo
Gatti. The difference is that Gatti has become the darling of HBO
because he produces ratings. The fact that Gamache understood why
he produced those ratings is what landed him the fight in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over to HBO's office and Lou said he'd see me,''
Gamache recalled. ``I told him me and Gatti would make a great
fight. It's two guys who cut and bleed and fight like hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was a perfect matchup of a boxer against a
slugger. Lou said he'd see if he could make it, but he told me
Gatti had to beat Reyes Munoz first. I told him a guy I just beat
in April knocked Munoz out in two rounds. Gatti took care of him in
one, so here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite that easily. First Gamache returned to Maine,
where he still works putting up drywall when he's not on the road
boxing in some of the sport's more obscure outposts. Once there, he
sent HBO a tape of one of his most recent wins, followed up with a
second trip to New York when he didn't manage to see DiBella, then
sent another letter and tape along with one more assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he wouldn't be sorry if he gave me the
opportunity,'' the 33-year-old Gamache said. ``I wasn't embarrassed
to do it. These days in boxing, you've got to rely on yourself. I
got a good manager (New York legend Johnny Bos), but I was the one
who could leave the lasting impression. I couldn't blame them if
they'd given the shot to someone else because there are plenty of
fighters deserving of it, but I stayed after DiBella and he gave me
the shot. I respect that. I wasn't embarrassed to go ask for the
fight. I needed them to know I wasn't finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamache appeared to be just that two years ago, after he lost a
bloody battle with Julio Cesar Chavez and announced his retirement.
He said if he could no longer compete at the elite level of the
sport, there was no point in going on. But after a seven-month
layoff and a failed restaurant venture in Maine that cost him a lot
of money he'd earned with his blood, Gamache decided to let Bos
take him on the road for one last try at the bright lights. After
nine straight wins, he has landed such a night at Madison Square
Garden, which will be rocking with Oscar De La Hoya fans and
attract a large cable television audience.
</P>
<P>
   But more than the number of people who will see him fight,
Gamache knows it is what he does in that ring that will determine
what future he has left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win this, there's no tomorrow,'' Bos said. ``This
is the seventh game of the World Series for Joey. But he's made for
Arturo's style. It's the right fight. Funny thing is, if we win
easy it's not as good for Joey as if we win close. Beat him close
and we get a rematch and Joey can get paid. Beat him easy and who
wants to watch it again?''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the dilemmas of boxing, a sport in which you can
penalize yourself if you're too dominant almost as much as you can
if you're dominated. Gamache understands that, because the sport
has been his life for more than 20 years, yet when he thinks of
Gatti (30-4), he thinks not of style points or future paydays.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks of winning and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely there's no tomorrow for me if I lose,'' said
Gamache (55-3). ``Gatti's not an easy fight. He turns everything
into a war, and I've been known to bleed. You have to be careful
with him because he's so easy to hit you can find yourself drawn in
and hitting him longer than is wise and then he gets you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the final chapter of my career. But I wanted to
come back for one more chance to go out the right way. If I win,
that would do it. Or maybe I'd fight once more.''
</P>
<P>
   They all do until there has been one too many nights, and
Gamache knows he is approaching that evening whether he wins Friday
or not. But he fought his way back to the main stage from places in
which the halls are small and the money smaller. He fought for one
thing. He fought for this night with a guy who bleeds as much as he
does and knows how to make you bleed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay to see him bleed, not to see him box,'' Gamache
said. ``He doesn't fight off his skills, he fights off his
emotions. Because I can box and still have good legs, it gives me a
good chance if I don't get caught up in things. I think most people
are saying, `If Joey has anything left, this is a winnable fight.'
That's all I was looking for _ a chance to get back there one more
time.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance comes in six days. What Joey Gamache does with it is
anyone's guess, but win or lose he knows this. He got there. One
more time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz No. 1 at being No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea heavyweight John Ruiz got unexpected good news last week
when it was announced that he'd been elevated to the No. 1 ranking
by the World Boxing Association, thus making him Lennox Lewis's
mandatory challenger in two of the three major organizations. Ruiz
already holds the World Boxing Council's No. 1 ranking.

   Ruiz (35-3, 26 KOs) now is entitled to the next title shot at
Lewis if the champion successfully defends his crowns against
Michael Grant April 29. Ruiz would likely get that shot in July,
probably in England, because the winner must defend the WBA title
next. Lewis had refused to do so because Henry Akinwande, whom he
already defeated in stinker of a match, had been long kept in the
top spot for no reason. The WBA finally came to its senses and
elevated Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield is No. 2 in both organizations, and rumors
continue to float that Ruiz and Holyfield could fight later this
spring on Showtime in a boxoff to determine the true No. 1
contender. Ruiz's manager, Norman Stone, would rather force Lewis
to fight Ruiz before Grant, but that simply will not happen. The
rules says he's entitled to, but business says it's Grant-Lewis at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruiz is where he could only dream he might get one day.
He's six months from becoming the first New England heavyweight in
decades to fight for a world title.
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   The reason Junior Jones didn't get the shot with Prince Naseem
Hamed supposedly is that he wanted 10 first-class air tickets to
London. Another source said that although Hamed was willing to pay
Jones the $500,000 he wanted, ``it was a rough contract.'' That
means that if Jones won, it tied him up like a mummy. Hence no
fight . . . It now seems more and more likely that Mike Tyson will
journey to Milan to fight Lou Saverese in April. New Jersey wanted
the fight for a while, but word is Italian promoters have gone over
the top for it . . . Tyson would still like a June or July fight
with Shannon Briggs before going after a big-money bout . . . Among
the Olympic hopefuls in Tampa last week was a most unusual story.
In 1992, Joseph Pastorello was a fullback at Air Force Academy who
was Most Valuable Player in the Liberty Bowl. Personal problems led
him to leave school after three years, but the 27-year-old
Pastorello decided to give boxing a try in 1995. Four years later,
he was named to the US team for the Pan-Am Games and he finished
second in the US Challenge this year to reach the Olympic trials.
Unfortunately, his story ended there when he failed to qualify for
the boxoffs in two weeks . . . Derrell Coley seemed pretty
confident last week, although one has to wonder why. Coley will be
in the ring with De La Hoya at Madison Square Garden, and few think
he'll come out a winner. Many, in fact, believe he may come out
early. Yet Coley said blithely, ``De La Hoya says he's going to
make it a rumble, but I seriously doubt it. Everything he says he's
going to do, he doesn't.'' . . . De La Hoya fired 77-year-old
training adviser Gil Clancy, effectively blaming him for the Felix
Trinidad loss, and then tried to claim he wanted to retain Clancy
but the rest of his ``corner'' outvoted him, 4-1. Since when does
the guy signing the checks get outvoted?

YATES'S TEAM BUILT FOR SPEED

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The garage area at Daytona International
Speedway was bustling last Thursday as race teams prepared for the
start of the Gatorade Twin 125s. But the scene was a little more
subdued at the Robert Yates Racing camp, where everyone on Dale
Jarrett's crew seemed to go about their business with an aura of
quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a NASCAR Winston Cup championship does that for you. It
breeds confidence. It brings a new sense of respect from your
peers. And ultimately, it leads to a higher level of expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, there's another neat perk: preferred parking for your
hauler in the NASCAR Winston Cup garage.
</P>
<P>
   But those were hardly the reasons Robert Yates, owner of
Jarrett's No. 88 Ford Quality Care Taurus and Ricky Rudd's No. 28
Texaco Havoline Ford, invested so much blood, sweat, and tears in
winning his first championship last year with Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   It had more to do with a desire to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was drag racing at Shuffletown Dragway in Charlotte,
N.C.; building Ford engines for several NASCAR teams; or striking
out on his own as a car owner in 1988, when he bought the
Ranier-Lundy Racing team, Yates has never strayed from that
principle.
</P>
<P>
   In 370 starts on the Winston Cup circuit, Yates has accumulated
42 victories, 26 poles, 173 top five finishes, 237 top 10 finishes,
and $32,866,394 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of pinching ourselves that we had a good team the
first couple of years,'' Yates said of his partnership with
Jarrett, which resulted in a Daytona 500 victory in 1996. ``We sort
of took it for granted at first. We've always been serious, but
we're even more focused on it now. We like that feeling of being in
the hunt all the time for a championship and winning races.''
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Yates, 56, took measures to ensure that
his team became even more formidable. When Jarrett and Rudd won the
pole position and outside pole, respectively, to give Yates a
front-row sweep for Sunday's 42d Daytona 500, it was evidence that
the best had gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the luckiest guy here,'' Yates said. ``I'm very
fortunate. All my life, Daytona has been like the big deal and
still is. Daytona is where you came and showed your new cars, your
power, and who did their homework during the winter months. There's
all this anxiety, and then you show up here and, boom, you're on
the front row.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates rescued Rudd after the veteran driver lost his Tide
sponsorship and was forced to liquidate his Rudd Performance
Motorsports team.
</P>
<P>
   When Rudd brought crew chief Michael McSwain along with eight
other employees to the Yates team, they were astounded at what they
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential of this team is unbelievable,'' Rudd said. ``I
feel like we are prepared better than I've ever been prepared on
any race team I've been on in many, many years. The chemistry is
there to do great things. We might have had one first-stringer (on
the pit crew), but the Yates organization has first-stringers at
every position, not only with the pit crew but the guys hanging the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates knew he made a good move when he brought in Rudd to
replace Kenny Irwin in the 28 car. Many drivers _ from Robby Gordon
to Ernie Irvan to Irwin _ have failed to live up to the potential
of its original occupant, the late Davey Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy, a good family man,'' Yates said of Rudd, for
whom he built engines during their days together on the defunct
DiGard Racing team. ``I've known him and worked with him, and he's
certainly the guy I've always scanned on my (radio) scanner,
because every season he's always a threat to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the opportunity to hire somebody like that, you
know that if you don't win it's not the driver, and we needed that.
We needed that so we could sort of rule out what the problem was.
Kenny was certainly learning, and we put a lot of work and,
sometimes, heartache into it. I'm sure he'll have a good career and
create a lot of excitement for the fans, but the 28 team needs to
win some races.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, addressing an area of need on the 88 team, Yates bolstered
Jarrett's pit crew by luring away five members of Jeff Gordon's
``Rainbow Warriors.'' He continued his oversight of the Yates
engine program headed up by his son, Doug, and developed the
redesigned 2000 Ford Taurus into a rocketship that launched Jarrett
to victory in last Sunday's Bud Shootout and Rudd to a triumph in
his 50-lap heat in the Twin 125s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think we'd be extremely lucky if we won a championship
with the 28 team, but I'd like to believe over time _ over a short
period of time _ we can get to where we feel like we can,'' Yates
said. ``I think it's just a matter of time and getting some
positive results. I'm excited about it and I'm looking forward to
it, but this deal here with the 88 team is pretty polished.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the pieces are in place, is Robert Yates Racing capable
of becoming a championship-caliber team year in and year out? Can
it make a dynastic run?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you mention it, that's what we're really trying to
do,'' Yates said. ``I remember the Wood brothers and Pettys. I
remember working for Junior Johnson, and we didn't have a dynasty
going, but we created one. I left there to go to DiGard, and we won
one-third of the races and had a real strong deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the people you work with or attract or align
yourself with. I'd like to think we have the makings of that kind
of dynasty with (crew chief) Todd Parrott and Dale Jarrett. I'd
like to have the 28 team be in that same elite status. But it's
tough to have that now, because the money's so equal.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the DiGard and Petty days, shoot, they had
everybody outclassed,'' Yates said. ``I remember when you couldn't
go in the garage and see a Wood brothers manifold. You couldn't
look and see if they were running the right cubic inches. Now it's
hard to get a monopoly or a dynasty going, because you can't
establish a competitive advantage over anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Jarrett on the throne as defending Winston Cup champion
and Rudd riding shotgun as a proven veteran, and both in
Ford-powered mounts, Yates appears to have his team poised to
become great.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you beat us, you're going to have to run awfully good,''
said Jarrett. ``I think we have the total package now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explained why everyone was working so feverishly
elsewhere in the garage: Yates Racing has given people a lot of
catching up to do.

FENCE SAVED DAY AND DAYTONA FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It is the worst nightmare of every race
promoter and track operator: a spectator fatality.
</P>
<P>
   When Geoffrey Bodine was involved in a horrific 13-truck crash
midway through Friday's inaugural NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
race at Daytona International Speedway, there were initial fears
that Daytona had joined Michigan International Speedway and Lowe's
Speedway in Charlotte, N.C., in the sad fraternity of tracks struck
by fan fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a CART race at Michigan was marred by three
spectator deaths and six injuries when a tire and wheel assembly
were sent flying into the stands. Last year, three fans were killed
and eight injured in a similar accident at an Indy Racing League
event at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Both were open-wheel racing events.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's accident involved trucks, which have no exposed
suspension parts. And that may have been Daytona's saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   When Bodine's truck catapulted into the catchfence near the
trioval, it sent a ball of flame and small debris spraying into the
grandstands. There's no telling how many fatalities there would
have been had major truck parts been involved, but a major
catastrophe was averted when the fence prevented Bodine's truck
from careening into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Nine spectators were treated for injuries, and five were taken
to a local hospital, including two who were admitted for surgery
(for a facial laceration and a fractured arm). That was relatively
small damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the systems did their job,'' said track
president John Graham. ``The vehicle systems did their job and
prevented serious, serious injury to the driver, and the fence
system did its job and kept the accident on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the accidents at Michigan and Charlotte prompted
Daytona officials to review their fencing systems, but they
determined that no changes were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, amazingly, survived the crash. He suffered a concussion,
a mid-back fracture, multiple lacerations and bruises, and a
fracture, laceration, and burns to his right wrist. He remained in
intensive care Saturday, in serious but stable condition, at
Halifax Medical Center. No surgery is expected.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the good news that allowed track officials
to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep _ not the fact that, as Graham
intoned so callously, the track staged what it considered to be a
successful inaugural truck event on its high-banked superspeedway
before 80,000-100,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike track officials at Michigan and Charlotte, Daytona should
consider itself lucky that it didn't have to bury any of its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Power shared
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mike Helton was appointed NASCAR's chief operating
officer and introduced as Bill France's hand-picked successor to
take over day-to-day duties of the sanctioning body. It was a
significant move in that France, president of NASCAR since 1972,
appeared to finally delegate some of his authority. More important,
it was the first time in NASCAR history that responsibility was
bestowed upon someone outside the France family.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, questions have arisen about the health of the
66-year-old France. He disclosed at the end of last season that he
was undergoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. And
while the news of France's illness was certainly distressing to
NASCAR's hierarchy, it has not put a damper on the future of the
sport, which kicks off its 2000 season with Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is poised to reach out to new markets, sponsors, and fans
when its $2.47 billion television package with NBC, Fox, and Turner
Sports kicks in next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy year, and I'm not sure if it's just because I
ended up being chief operating officer or it's just the fact it's
been a busy year,'' said Helton. ``I do know it's been rewarding
from learning a deeper part of the business and understanding all
the business elements has been rewarding for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the challenges of '99 didn't necessarily come from me
being chief operating officer as much as it was the TV package,
because that effort was consuming a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always love, personally, getting to keep my hand in the
garage area and being involved in the competition side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Building his business
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Holigan, star of his own syndicated TV show on
house construction, agreed to a three-year deal to sponsor the No.
25 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet driven by Jerry Nadeau. It
represented a breakthrough of sorts in NASCAR sponsorships: the
dot.com company. Holigan, who caught the racing bug when one of his
TV sponsors, DuPont, invited him to a NASCAR race at Texas, saw an
opportunity to enhance his business. Holigan plans to bring
together vendors, suppliers, and merchandisers of home building
materials with home builders, developers, and general contractors
in a big event-type setting and expose them to a new trade matrix
he is designing with a major computer design company that will
bring online builders and their suppliers. ``This year I'm going to
entertain 4,000 builders and they're going to represent almost
200,000 housing starts across the nation,'' Holigan said. When he
brought his partners to meet with Hendrick Motorsports
representatives to discuss the price of a sponsorship, which
Holigan said ranged from $10 million to $12 million, ``They
immediately tried to justify the price by explaining how the money
would be spent. But one of my partners, who is a part-owner in the
Texas Rangers, turned to me and said, `Hey, that's what we pay a
mediocre pitcher.' With this new TV deal, I can already see that
we'll be getting a return on our investment and I predict that,
before the end of my three-year sponsorship, I will start a two-car
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flare
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon to be cutting each
other any breaks in Sunday's Daytona 500. The two drivers were
involved in a tussle in the garage area Wednesday afternoon.
Stewart, who claimed his Pontiac was pinched by Gordon into the
grass, clipped Gordon's rear and sent him spinning during a
drafting run. When Gordon approached Stewart in his garage stall,
the two exchanged words. Stewart then gave Gordon a dismissive wave
and punctuated it with a push, which prompted Gordon to retaliate.
The drivers were separated by Stewart's crew members, one of whom,
Jason Shapiro, was fined $2,000 by NASCAR officials for being a
detriment to the sport when he shoved Gordon and struck the driver
in the chin . . . Scott Ford, an 11-year-old from North Reading,
Mass., got an unexpected bonus when he showed up for Friday's truck
race at Daytona and was chosen in a random drawing as the honorary
grand marshal of the race . . . The CART FedEx Series was dealt a
huge blow when car owner Tony Bettenhausen Jr., 48, was killed in a
plane crash last Monday near Leesburg, Ky., along with his wife,
Shirley, and two other team members, Russ Roberts and Larry Rangel,
while en route to Indianapolis. ``This tragedy comes as an absolute
shock to everyone in the CART community,'' said CART CEO Andrew
Craig. ``Tony and Shirley were deeply intertwined in the fabric of
CART racing and their loss is even more profound because of the
fact that along with them perished two individuals of equal
character and integrity.'' The Bettenhausens leave two teenaged
girls . . . Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, which has won the last four
CART titles, announced that it will field entries for defending
CART champion Juan Montoya and Jimmy Vasser for the 2000
Indianapolis 500. ``Racing in the Indy 500 is a dream for any owner
or driver,'' Chip Ganassi said. ``It's disappointing for us and for
our fans we haven't been here in four years, but it's good to be
back. I'm just excited to give Jimmy, Juan, and Target the
opportunity to race at the Brickyard.'' Defending IRL champion Greg
Ray, who was at Daytona participating in the IROC series opener
Friday, said he welcomed Target-Ganassi Racing's return to Indy.
``I think it's going to be exciting,'' he said. ``I think whenever
you compete in a race of that magnitude you want the world's best
drivers to be there.''

 &HT;    Victory may be sweet, but it comes at a cost
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Any judgment of the price George W. Bush paid
to win the South Carolina Republican primary has to be tempered
with the realization that this was a contest he couldn't afford to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less than a solid victory would have been a disaster
for Bush, who came here with his back to the wall after his
stunning loss to Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire. But for Bush,
who turned the tables on McCain Saturday, this was still a costly
victory.
</P>
<P>
   To win this contest for 37 convention delegates, Bush threw open
his campaign coffers, went negative and mimicked his rival's
rhetoric and platform. He put out a quickly cobbled together
campaign finance reform plan that will be subjected to heavy
scrutiny down the line.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks of frenzied campaigning, he uttered enough
malapropisms to give comedians material for months: Expect to hear
a lot of cracks about ``raising the pie higher.'' He embraced the
religious right, which could incur more costs in future primaries
such as that in Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most troubling for his long-term prospects, his campaign
here left the implication that independents and Democrats _ whose
votes he would need to win in November _ weren't welcome in this
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did, however, slam the brakes on the steadily rising
expectations that had built around McCain since New Hampshire. He
not only won, he did so with the sort of heavy turnout that was
supposed to work in McCain's favor. And his margin of victory was
almost as surprising as McCain's in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said many times in the past couple of weeks that the
American people were getting the chance to see how he performed
under pressure. Now there will be an opportunity to watch how
McCain behaves under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The two words McCain will regret most from this campaign are
``like Clinton.'' He probably would have faced a harsh attack even
if he hadn't run the controversial ad comparing Bush to the
Democratic president. But he momentarily lost the moral high
ground, and when he unilaterally disarmed, as he put it, he did so
in the face of an awesome arsenal of negative media still aimed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can McCain afford to make another switch in strategy in the
primaries ahead. He has put himself squarely on the high road, and
for better or worse he can't afford to take another detour.
</P>
<P>
   While it got far less attention, Steve Forbes' decision to drop
out after the Feb. 8 Delaware primary was also a heavy blow to
McCain's prospects. Almost all the extra air time Bush purchased in
the past two weeks had been originally reserved by Forbes. Forbes
probably would not have siphoned off enough conservative votes to
deny Bush a victory, but he would have shaved off enough to make it
less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, McCain's campaign may have erred in putting its entire
stake back on the table after his New Hampshire victory. This state
was always a long shot for him, and he may suffer from allowing the
impression that anything else was the case.
</P>
<P>
   What impact Bush's win has on Tuesday's primaries in Michigan
and Arizona remains to be seen. But for next month's races in
Georgia, Florida and other Southeastern states it has huge
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Atwater is gone, but his old friends Warren Tompkins and
former Gov. Carroll Campbell helped deliver an Atwater-style
victory: not very pretty, but deadly effective.

HUMOR US WITH AN EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Jimy Williams is beginning his fourth season
managing the Red Sox. If you want perspective for that statement,
think of ``Cats'' and its lengthy run on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Really, did you expect Williams to be here this long? He is a
member of Boston's Coaching Class of 1997, which also includes Rick
Pitino, Pat Burns, and Pete Carroll. In '97, a lot of people
guessed Williams would be the group's first casualty. Now it's just
the opposite: He should be given a four-year contract extension
immediately. I would consider him for a three-year deal based
solely on his comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The man is an amazing mimic of comedian Jonathan Winters. I
think the similarities, beyond the initials ``J.W.,'' are more than
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Winters: He once parked in a handicap parking space and
a woman said, ``Hey, you're not handicapped.'' He replied, ``Madam,
can you see inside my mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Williams: Saturday, he was asked if he is one of those
managers who sits around and draws up potential lineups on napkins.
``I don't ever use napkins,'' he said. ``I always wear old clothes
when I eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The dry humor is not the only reason Williams's one-year
contract should be extended. If you ever want to evaluate a manager
or coach, ask yourself the following introductory question: How
does he/she handle talent?
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a master at this. The Sox have made the playoffs in
back-to-back seasons. They hadn't done that since Babe Ruth had a
locker at the four-year-old Fenway Park. Williams lost Mo Vaughn
from his lineup last year _ for nothing _ and still squeezed 94
wins out of his team. Sometimes he is like your best friend; he can
keep a secret. Sometimes he is like your sensitive neighbor; he
complains when the music is blaring and orders players to use
headphones in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It would be naive to think that all of his players agree with
his rules. But most understand that he is not trying to be their
buddy. He doesn't take credit for Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro
Martinez. He doesn't care if his image is not featured prominently
on a game telecast.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that the clubhouse he runs is similar to the
very professional one in Atlanta. His friend, Bobby Cox, has said
that the Sox should give Williams a five-year deal. Even I wouldn't
go that high. Five years? That's an NBA contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm OK,'' Williams said when asked about his contract
Saturday. ``I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   When a radio reporter spoke highly of him, he said, ``You should
be my agent.'' Another reporter rattled off his accomplishments and
told him he had ``leverage'' because of them. Williams said he
never thought of using his leverage.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Dan Duquette could argue that there is no reason to
extend Williams more than a year. Maybe he believes that the
current system has worked fine, and that changing it would disrupt
the flow as well as cost the Sox more money. Duquette knows that
Bob Kraft is still paying Carroll, even though Bill Belichick is
the Patriots' coach. He knows the power of Pitino's contract.
Against that backdrop, why reward Williams with a multiyear deal?
</P>
<P>
   That leads to another important managing/coaching question: How
do they match up with their contemporaries? I think we all have to
agree that the best manager in the game is Joe Torre. You can talk
about the excessive Yankee payroll if you want, but I have a hard
time arguing with three World Series titles in four years. Williams
is not Torre, but he is a notch above Tony La Russa and Lou
Piniella. No one would have suggested this 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But based on what I've seen of Williams, I think he would find a
way to make the playoffs if he had Ken Griffey, Alex Rodriguez,
Edgar Martinez, and Randy Johnson as part of his core. (Piniella's
Mariners had just that in 1997 and most of '98.) I think he would
do fine with Mark McGwire's 65 home runs, Ray Lankford's .306
average, and Kent Bottenfield's 18 wins. (That's what La Russa had
last year.)
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric man doesn't like it when people talk about him
this way. He says he doesn't hit, throw out runners, or throw
strikes. He's just another guy, he tells you. So you switch the
subject and ask about his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he gained a few pounds,'' you say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, maybe he's been lifting aluminum foil all winter,''
Williams replies.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what that means? Who knows where Winters got the idea
of portraying a middle-aged alien ``baby'' on TV? Williams is a
Winters fan. The more you see the manager's work and the more you
hear of his stories, the more you understand. Additional years of
his quirks? That would be a good thing.

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ These are giddy times for the Red Sox. The
American League Manager of the Year, Cy Young Award winner, and
batting champion, all under the same dugout roof. Applause,
applause for Jimy Williams, Pedro Martinez, and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   A big winter's trade landed Carl Everett, a switch-hitting
center fielder who can run and hit and throw and has
middle-of-the-order power.
</P>
<P>
   The farm system is spitting out prospects, Japanese and Korean
pitchers (Tomo Ohka, Sunny Kim, and Jin Ho Cho), Dominican third
basemen (Wilton Veras), and catchers from Peabody (Steve Lomasney).
</P>
<P>
   A native son, Carlton Fisk, is going into the Hall of Fame, a
quarter-century after starring in perhaps the greatest World Series
ever played, while another native son, Rick Asadoorian, pride of
Whitinsville, Mass., was their No. 1 pick in the amateur draft and
already is hearing his name linked to the young Tony C.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales are reported to be booming, even at 45 bucks a pop,
the radio shows and chat rooms are already humming with Sox talk,
and kids and their grandparents are ticking off the days to Opening
Day.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette, architect of the first Sox team to
make back-to-back postseason appearances in 83 years, is back to
being a smart guy again. So is CEO John Harrington, who last July
hosted the best All-Star show ever, though right now he could use a
little help with his pet stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't been in a World Series since 1986. They haven't
won one since 1918, the year Ted Williams was born. Teddy Ballgame,
like Red Sox Nation, is still hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, when they were still called the Boston Americans, the
Sox became a charter member of the new American League. Now, in
their 100th season, comes that all-too-familiar cry: ``Could this
be the year?''
</P>
<P>
   Well . . . maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are still the Yankees, aiming to become the first
team since Dick Williams's fighting Oakland A's of the mid-'70s to
win three pennants in a row. For once, George Steinbrenner kept a
pat hand, though the Boss is sure to swing into action at the first
hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, humiliated by the Sox in October, have beefed up
their pitching. Seattle lost Junior Griffey but has better balance.
Texas loaded up on lefthanders. Toronto has the next great closer
in Billy Koch. And nobody laughs at Oakland anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave the Sox, who have won 92 and 94 games
in the last two seasons? The view in February, as pitchers and
catchers assemble Sunday morning under Jimy Williams for their
first official workout of spring, is that they have the talent to
make another run at a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   But here are 10 things that have to go right:
</P>
<P>
   1. Pedro must stay healthy. It all begins and ends on his skinny
right shoulder. Martinez took more time off this winter to rest
after a year in which he broke down once in midsummer, again in
October, and still had a season for the ages. Can he do it again?
Of course he can. All the great ones do. But there's a reason
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan gives him a blow as often as he can.
With an extra day's rest last season, Martinez was 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   2. Older brother Ramon has to be healthy, too. Ramon Martinez's
importance to the staff becomes even greater in the absence of Bret
Saberhagen, who claims to be ahead of schedule in yet another
comeback from shoulder surgery but cannot be counted on for even
the modest 119 innings he gave the Sox last season. Ramon turns
just 32 next month, and while the odometer has been turned back
once on his shoulder, he could be a dominant force in this league
if healthy. The guess here is that he is.
</P>
<P>
   3. Derek Lowe cuts it as closer. His credentials as a setup man
were impeccable and he thrived down the stretch as closer. There's
little wiggle room for the Sox if Lowe falters. Rod Beck has the
credentials but also a creaky elbow. And the rest of the bullpen
has to step up and close down the opposition in the seventh and
eighth innings the way Lowe did.
</P>
<P>
   4. Everett doesn't need a season to acclimate to the American
League. He's played only in the National League, for the Marlins,
Mets, and Astros, and leaves Houston with considerable reluctance.
Even with Houston's Killer B's, Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, a
lot of folks (including former ace Mike Hampton) say Everett was
the team's MVP when it won the NL Central last season. He could
make a similar impact on the Sox lineup.
</P>
<P>
   5. There's a safety net in place if Brian Daubach stumbles. The
Belleville Basher delivered huge hits all last summer, and came
through with two home runs in the playoffs, too, but his slump from
mid-August to the end of the season has raised some alarms. It
should help that with Everett here, he'll be hitting lower in the
order, but if Daubach is overmatched early, the Sox might have to
accelerate Dernell Stenson's timetable to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   6. The Sox have a fallback plan if Jeff Fassero washes out.
Fassero had elbow surgery to remove bone chips in '98 and followed
that with the worst season of his career, a 5-14 record and a 7.20
ERA. That ERA was the highest among pitchers with 150 innings since
Jim Walkup (7.36) in 1937. Another year of rest and a reunion with
Kerrigan may help, but Duquette is clearly in the market for
another starter. The Twins' Brad Radke would be a great fit.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Sox do a better job of catching the ball. They made 127
errors last season, and while Jose Offerman proved better than
expected at second base, he still had trouble turning the double
play. One scout warned last summer that Garciaparra would get
crushed out there if Offerman doesn't give him more timely and
consistent feeds. With Mike Stanley (11 errors) and Daubach sharing
first base, the right side of the infield is no bargain.
</P>
<P>
   8. John Valentin shows up for the regular season. Valentin was
awesome in October, driving in 17 runs, but he was a .250 hitter
from April to September for the second straight season. He has had
his knee cleaned out and is the type to respond to the challenge
posed by Veras, but it wouldn't be a shock if he were traded.
</P>
<P>
   9. One (or more) of the kid pitchers steps up. Brian Rose is as
strong as he's ever been, Juan Pena is supposedly over his shoulder
miseries, Ohka was unbeaten (15-0) in the minors with a big-league
splitter, and Kim dominated in the Arizona Fall League. At least
one pitcher in this bunch has to deliver, and don't be surprised if
Duquette uses some of the surplus _ along with a tradeable Scott
Hatteberg _ to land a veteran pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   10. Williams keeps the same clubhouse karma that has been here
the last two years. The surprise last season was how well this club
kept its focus after losing Mo Vaughn. There remains a good mix of
strictly-business veterans (Stanley, Darren Lewis, Ramon Martinez)
and old-school younger players (Garciaparra, Jason Varitek, Trot
Nixon).

BIRD BUYS IDEA OF OWNING CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Larry Bird has heard about all the back-to-Boston
stories that have surfaced in the last week since he said he wasn't
going to stick around Indiana. He gets a kick out of them.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one scenario that hasn't been mentioned that Bird
said would have him back in Boston in a nanosecond: as the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could get people together to buy the team in a day,'' Bird
said. ``I could get it done tomorrow. Let's get the ball rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, consider it done. (It is kind of strange to hear Bird
talking in high-finance terms. This is, after all, the same person
who didn't leave a tip after his first meal in New York because he
thought it was overpriced.)
</P>
<P>
   Bird does own a piece of the Pacers, but he said he would gladly
sell if he were able to front a group to buy the Celtics. You can
probably assume commissioner David Stern would love to have Bird
involved in Boston ownership, and Bird made it clear that if it
ever did happen, he would be more like Michael Jordan (active) than
Magic Johnson (investor).
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had hoped Bird would move into its front office next
season, and the invitation still stands. But Bird surprised his
bosses when he said last week in Boston he'd be going to Florida
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I'm not really interested in
(Indiana's front office) right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he won't return to Boston under the current
ownership, which hardly comes as a shocker. He threw some darts at
chairman of the board Paul Gaston in his last book, and he threw a
few more last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kills me,'' he said, ``is that (Rick) Pitino is taking
all the hits there. Yeah, he's made some moves that didn't work
out. But the reason they're in the state they're in is because of
the owner. He's the one who put M.L. (Carr) in there. When we had a
championship team in 1984, those owners (Gaston's father and two
others) did only one thing over the next five years _ they brought
in DJ (Dennis Johnson). They got (Bill) Walton, too, but he called
them. They knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird spent five unfulfilling years as a Celtic ``consultant''
under Dave Gavitt and Carr. Versions differ as to why he left the
team in 1997 to coach the Pacers. Gaston, who became the Celtics'
head honcho in 1992, said Bird always had an open invitation to run
the show. Bird said if that was the case, he never knew about it.
He also said his suggestions and advice were continually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston was traveling over the weekend; efforts to reach him were
unsuccessful. (He's also smart enough to know you don't get into a
verbal skirmish in Boston with Larry Bird.) He has said in the past
that while he fields many inquiries to sell the Celtics, the team
is not for sale. Last week, he said his objective is to make the
team competitive while running it like a business, adding, ``I know
of no other way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird laughed at that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like the Clippers to me,'' he said. Gaston's
Celtics, Bird said, have ``been a cash cow there for years. He
wants people to buy tickets, get good crowds, and make $8
million-$10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that the owner of the Celtics wanted to win a
championship, not just be competitive. Tell him I'm ready to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on Sixers
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks (Charlie Ward, Marcus Camby) and the Heat (Dan
Majerle) each missing key people, the team to watch in the Eastern
Conference may well be the 76ers. They made a huge deal in getting
Toni Kukoc, and they are not that far off the pace, assuming Kukoc
embraces the move and doesn't go into a sulk. ``In the short run,''
said Nets GM John Nash, ``Philadelphia gets a player who will help
them in the playoffs. He can stretch defenses, and it will be
interesting to see how it works out because he might not be the
defensive player they're accustomed to having at the position.''
They'll get a good test Sunday afternoon from the Lakers. Nash and
his Boston counterpart, Chris Wallace, each think the deal benefits
all three teams. The Warriors got Larry Hughes and Billy Owens (for
a second go-around), while Chicago got a free agent (John Starks)
and a high draft pick. ``Golden State doesn't have its own pick, so
in getting Hughes, they get a guy with two years in the league
who's a talent and ahead of the learning curve,'' Wallace said.
``He's a guy who can make plays and goes to the basket.'' The Bulls
get even more cap room and undoubtedly will spend on someone. The
risk for Philly is re-signing Kukoc. ``I'm not sure Europe is as
big for him as it was for Dino Radja,'' Wallace said. ``From what I
understand, his kids are in school here, and he's a big golf fan.
And while he is a good player, I don't think that the teams
accumulating cap room are doing it necessarily with an eye on
him.'' . . . Just in case you were wondering, statistics guru
Harvey Pollack keeps track of players who have shots blocked the
most, and Antoine Walker was only 15th last year. The stats are not
up to date for this year, however. Walker had 51 shots rejected
last season, according to Pollack's data, well behind league leader
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who had 106 swatted away . . . Rony Seikaly
has just started jogging and shooting in his attempt to make a
comeback at the age of 34. Seikaly played only nine games for New
Jersey last season and was waived in August. He said he was waived
not because he couldn't play, which was the Nets' contention, but
because he was injured. A grievance is scheduled to be heard early
next month on the matter. Seikaly is working out in Florida and,
according to his agent, Steve Kauffman, wants to get back ASAP.
``He definitely wants to play,'' Kauffman said. ``I know the
perception has been that he doesn't really care, but that is not
true. He's an incredibly competitive person, and he wants to play
badly. He wants to show those people that think that that they're
wrong.'' Kauffman said he's heard from ``a bunch of teams,''
although they know Seikaly is a long way away from being ready to
play NBA basketball. He had a very complicated foot injury _
Kauffman said it's most often associated with ballet dancers _ that
has taken time to heal . . . Going into the weekend, Bird had a
winning percentage of 70.8 in his two-plus seasons as Pacers coach.
That would rank second only to Phil Jackson on the all-time list.
Is there any wonder why Indiana keeps hoping Bird will change his
mind? (He's also third all-time in playoff winning percentage.)
</P>
<P>
   Canada is Carter country
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice if Vince Carter at least appeared in a
playoff game before we coronate him as Michael II? Yes, he's a very
nifty player, but let's face it, his popularity comes from the fact
that he's a spectacular dunker. When Carter passed through Boston
last month, a bunch of reporters waited for him after the
shootaround to talk about many things, including the upcoming
Slam-Dunk competition. Carter blew them all off and was insistent
on not talking about the Slam Dunk. Well, on the night of the
competition last weekend, he had Canadian TV viewers riveted,
drawing ratings that approximated those for a Stanley Cup game. The
competition produced the highest rating for any basketball event
ever shown on TSN (the Canadian equivalent of ESPN), with an
average of 610,000 viewers, including a staggering 852,000 during
the final round. To put those numbers in perspective, a normal
Raptors game on TSN usually attracts about 130,000 viewers. ``For
us, anything close to a million viewers is huge,'' said TSN's Chris
Doyle. The largest viewership in TSN's 15-year history came 13
months ago, when 1.8 million tuned in to see the Canadians battle
the Russians in a world junior hockey tournament. The Slam Dunk
competition outdrew even the Calgary-Phoenix hockey game . . . It
didn't take Nets president Michael Rowe long to back off his
promise to travel to all road games so he could ``interface''
better with the team's basketball people. He was not on the
traveling roster for Sunday's nationally televised game in
Minnesota. The game, New Jersey's only NBC appearance this season,
not only will mark Marbury's first return to his beloved Twin
Cities (he has since called the place basically unlivable) but also
will be played on his 23d birthday. ``It's like, let me have a bad
birthday,'' Marbury said . . . Bird's favorite Pacers lineup: Jalen
Rose, Reggie Miller, Austin Croshere, Dale Davis, and Derrick
McKey. ``That's a hell of a lineup,'' he said. ``They can defend
and score.'' Bird said he's glad he won't have to deal with Rose's
impending free agency, but said of Croshere, ``I thought he'd be
this good last year.'' . . . The Mavericks did indeed sell out for
Dennis Rodman's debut. But in the second home game, the one in
which Rodman was ejected, the Mavs drew 11,912 to see Milwaukee.
Undaunted, would-be owner Mark Cuban predicted a much bigger crowd
for Thursday's game with the Pistons, a prediction made prior to
Rodman's suspension. The crowd: 16,241. The Mavs won, as well. They
were 0-2 in their first two games with Rodman . . . Speaking of
anemic support, the Cavs had a shade over 12,000 for their game
against the Nuggets Thursday, extending their non-sellout streak to
26. How bad has it been? The eight lowest crowds in the six-year
history of Gund Arena have come this season . . . Amid swirling
rumors that the Suns are hot after Dikembe Mutombo, both Jason Kidd
and Tom Gugliotta pleaded with the bosses to keep the team intact.
The Suns are starting to get it done at both ends of the floor and
have their roster intact for the first time in a while. Kidd,
however, acknowledged the obvious: ``It's up to the men upstairs.
They're the ones who call the shots.'' Gugliotta has a 15 percent
trade kicker on top of his hefty $8.5 million salary. He has been
mentioned as the major player in the Mutombo rumor . . . The
Nuggets had lost 15 straight road games against Western Conference
opponents until beating the Timberwolves in overtime Tuesday. The
Wolves then had one of those delightful back-to-backs, having to
fly to New York for a Wednesday game. They lost that one, too . . .
The Rockets were fined $5,000 for allowing the halftime ceremony
honoring Clyde Drexler to go for 36 minutes.

   PHOENIX _ If John McCain becomes the next president of the
United States, the person most responsible will be McCain's mentor,
archetype and political guru _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the mirror sequence from ``Duck Soup'' has come to
life, with Harpo McCain mimicking every move of Groucho Clinton,
making two men who have little in common appear exactly alike. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton was a Democrat running as a Republican; McCain is a
Republican running as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton came from a small state and wasn't given a chance;
McCain is from a small state and wasn't given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton pretended to be an outsider; McCain pretends to be an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton had a bus; McCain has a bus.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton was a fun guy whose opposition was a stiff; McCain is a
fun guy whose opposition is a stiff.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton's checkered past was ignored; McCain's checkered past
is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton claimed to be bucking the Democratic establishment;
McCain claims to be bucking the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton didn't; McCain isn't.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get to be the chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, like McCain, if you're ``anti-establishment.'' That's
why the rich guys whose industry he regulates give McCain so much
money.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you're a third-term member of the most exclusive club
in the world, the U.S. Senate, you ARE an insider, no matter what
you say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did the same thing. He also realized that outside of
Arkansas, no one cared about his past problems. McCain understands
this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember what Charles Keating, poster boy for the savings
and loan disaster that cost taxpayers billions, said about the
politicians to whom he'd donated truckloads of cash?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. Just as you don't remember the $112,000 McCain
took from Keating, along with vacation trips to the Bahamas and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said, ``One question . . . raised in recent weeks had to
do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several
political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most
forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   How about this?
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the study done by ``Congressional Quarterly'' in
1997 that showed McCain voting with Clinton 70 percent of the time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Clinton and McCain have agreed on normalizing
relations with Vietnam, on campaign finance reform, on anti-tobacco
legislation and other showy issues that can mask a politician's
true colors.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton talks like a moderate but is a liberal; McCain talks
like a moderate but is a hard-core conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, McCain told ``The Republic's'' Jeff Barker, ``There are
mavericks that are outside the pale of their party, and they're
always just throwing darts. I have a legislative record. I think if
you look at my voting record, it fundamentally has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that stuff matters. Clinton and now McCain have proved
the old proverb wrong: Words DO speak louder than deeds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has patterned his 2000 campaign after what Clinton did in
1992 and 1996, and it just might work.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain's hero status, it's overplayed. Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska is a Medal of Honor recipient, a bigger hero, but he
couldn't get elected president. McCain, like Clinton, has something
better going for him.
</P>
<P>
   _The media loved Clinton; the media REALLY love McCain. &QL;

   Kyle McLaren, who was on the last Bruins team that didn't make
the playoffs (1997), says the current edition, which is in a
struggle for its postseason life, bears no resemblance to the sad
sack club that finished as the worst Boston team in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no similarities at all,'' he said. ``It's a
different team, different style, different coach. It's totally
different. There's nothing the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLaren and the rest of the Bruins have had a hard time
putting their finger on what has caused this team to go 18-24-16 as
it prepares to take on the Vancouver Canucks Monday night in the
first of a four-game road trip. To a man, they all thought they
would be in significantly better shape at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if we'd be first or second in our division, but
I thought we'd be there battling it out and making sure we make it
to the playoffs,'' said McLaren. ``It still frustrates me. I still
wonder why we're not there. The bottom line is we haven't played up
to expectations from ourselves or anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every day I wonder what's going on, especially when
you're 4 points out of a playoff position. It's hard not to think
about what's going on and what we can do to change this thing
around. Every day you come up with new answers, but the bottom line
is we have to win. If you win, it takes care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But with this team, the victories have been few and far
between. They've managed but one strong streak and that lasted a
month, back in late October and November. The rest of the time,
it's been too few wins, too many losses, and a boatload of ties.
That makes this trip _ half in Western Canada, the rest on the East
Coast _ more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing as well as we'd like to,'' said McLaren.
``It's a time to come to jell together and play together; we have
to. Everyone is saying it's a big time for us, and it is. It's one
of the biggest trips we've taken so far this year. We need the
points. We need them worse than anybody we're playing against.''
</P>
<P>
   As time has gone on, McLaren said, he isn't sure if the reasons
for their struggles have become any clearer. He said it's more
prudent to deal in cold, hard numbers than in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes down to less wins,'' he said. ``You have to
win games to get into the playoffs. We have 16 ties and 18 wins. If
you turn those 16 ties into five ties and turn the others into
wins, we're right in the hunt. Maybe that's a small answer right
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play hard and the work ethic is there, we just can't finish
the games. It's been a roller coaster season and this is the part
where you want it to go up and keep going up until April.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the wish of players, coaches, and management alike, but
too often with this team, it hasn't equaled the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the lineups from team to team and we should beat
teams,'' said McLaren. ``There's no lack of effort or lack of skill
to not beat those teams. We have got to be greedy. We have to hate
every team we play against. We've seen it with some teams, Buffalo
and Carolina. But it has to be there on a more consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have the killer instinct to bury teams when we have
the chance, and sometimes we can't or we don't. It's not for lack
of trying; we've tried. The bounces have not gone our way this
whole entire year. Other teams have had bunches, dozens.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McLaren said, there's no question that the
sense of urgency can be greater. McLaren realizes what it's like to
sit out the postseason and doesn't want to go through it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jobs are on the line every night, especially when you're
not in the playoffs,'' he said. ``You don't know who's staying or
who's going at the end of the year. Anything can happen. If we
don't make the playoffs, there are more changes than not.''
</P>
<P>
   With 24 games remaining, McLaren won't concede that the team is
in an impossible situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're in trouble,'' he said, ``but we are
fighting for a playoff spot. I don't think you can write us off. We
realize where we are, and we know we have to pick it up. It's do or
die.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively revived
his flagging front-runner campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, exit polls showed Saturday, fighting off a scrappy
challenge by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the South Carolina
primary and catapulting their bitter struggle into big state
showdowns beginning with Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush rode to victory on a tidal wave of
GOP voters who turned out in record numbers across the
predominantly conservative piedmont region to overwhelm McCain's
less-than-expected support among many non-Republican voters who
could legally vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
   With one-third of the vote counted, Bush had 74,083 votes, or 53
percent to McCain's 58,787, 42 percent. Alan Keyes ran a faraway
third at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was projected on the basis of interviews
conducted by Voter News Service as voters left their polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory statement at a hotel rally about two hours after
the polls closed, Bush said he was ``honored and humbled by this
huge victory. South Carolina has spoken, and tonight there are only
263 days more to the end of Clinton-Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a phone call from McCain at 7:08 p.m. when the Arizona
senator conceded the race. ``I'm very grateful for the phone
call,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how far he has come since his defeat in the Feb. 1
New Hampshire Primary, Bush said: ``I fell down in the snow (in New
Hampshire, but) I knocked the snow off my suit and came down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the size of his loss, McCain struck a defiant tone in
his concession speech before flying to Michigan. He vowed to go
forward with his reformist crusade, ``to offer voters a choice
between a record of reform and an empty slogan of reform, a choice
between experience and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished Bush ``a good night's rest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``He's going to need it, my friends, for we have
just begun to fight. And I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that 9 percent of those voting Saturday
were Democrats. Of those, 82 percent supported McCain and 16
percent said they voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed that 31 percent of voters were
independents. Of those, 34 percent were for Bush and 61 percent
were for McCain. That's a much bigger-than-expected margin for
Bush. In New Hampshire among independents, McCain got 61 percent
and Bush got 19 percent. Among Democrats in New Hampshire, Bush got
10 percent and McCain got 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CNN projected turnout at 600,000, more than double the 276,000
who voted in the 1996 South Carolina Republican Primary.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives went for Bush 3-1, exit polls showed.
Unlike New Hampshire, Bush tailored his South Carolina message to
fit ``the pro-life agenda,'' said Randy Tate, former executive
director of the Christian Coalition now with Voter.com, a
politics-oriented website. ``These are the issues that motivate the
grassroots activists to walk the precincts,
</P>
<P>
   and bring the Reagan Democrats out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has won four of five Republican contests _ Alaska,
Iowa, New
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire and South Carolina. McCain has won one, New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   By winning here in a southern state that has voted reliably
Republican in eight of the last 10 presidential elections, Bush
energized a campaign that had been stunned by McCain's upset
victory in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. The Bush win helps him
allay campaign donors' anxieties, stem threatened defections by
worried Republican office holders and stun McCain's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had hoped to parlay his come-from-behind victory in
New Hampshire into a second upset here, came away from the contest
with ample evidence that he appeals to the independents and
Democrats who can vote in 16 of the next 24 GOP presidential
primaries. McCain vowed to carry on with his populist insurgency at
least until Super Tuesday, March 7, when New York, California and
Ohio join 13 less populous states to hold primaries and caucuses
that could settle the struggle for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's triumph in an 18-day slugfest stemmed in part from a
shift in strategy from being a tax-cutting ``compassionate
conservative'' who lost to McCain by 19 percentage points in New
Hampshire to becoming a ``reformer with results'' who ardently
courted the state's religious and social conservatives and
challenged McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at conservative Bob Jones University where
inter-racial dating is prohibited and he refused to challenge the
GOP platform's call for an absolute ban on abortions, even though
he favors exceptions to save the mother's life or to end
pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to the right risked alienating the
middle-of-the-road voters who often decide the outcome of the
industrial state primaries that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based Republican pollster who is not
working for any GOP presidential candidate, said the victory
enables Bush to retain ``the mantle of the front-runner,'' adding:
``It's a tremendous boost for Bush. It allows you to say that once
again, the nomination is Bush's to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory is expected to help entice a sorely needed
infusion of campaign donations into a fast-spending juggernaut that
has already spent more than $50 million of the $68 million in
donations. He heads into Michigan where three-term Gov. John Engler
has vowed to deliver the state to Bush. Bush's hand is also
strengthened in follow-on contests in Virginia and Washington on
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of
Virginia, said Bush's victory may be seen in hindsight as ``the
turning point that enabled Bush to go on to victory,'' adding:
``This is too big a victory for McCain to spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the influential Inside Michigan
Politics newsletter and a radio talk show host, said the magnitude
of Bush's victory in South Carolina could discourage turnout by the
independents and Democrats that McCain is counting upon to keep him
competitive in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude now might be 'Why bother to vote?''' Ballenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain showered South Carolina's 2.1 million registered
voters with more than $5.9 million worth of often hard-nosed
campaign ads during the longest presidential primary campaign in
state history. Previously, South Carolina held its primary just
four days after New Hampshire's.

</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a 20-year history of picking Republican
winners. The GOP winner in South Carolina has never failed to go on
and capture the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush built his win on a healthy core
Republican turnout.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of voters Saturday identified themselves as
Republicans. Among them, 68 percent said they voted for Bush and 26
percent said they voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did better than expected among independents, who along
with Democrats were free to cast ballots in the state's Republican
primary. Exit polls showed that fewer independents and Democrats
turned out than McCain had hoped for. Just 30 percent of the voters
were independents and 9 percent were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to carry 35 percent of the independent voters _ a
far stronger showing among independents than Bush scored in New
Hampshire where he won only 19 percent of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``played to win rather than playing not to loose, like in
New Hampshire,'' said Ayres, adding that Bush had succeeded in
shifting voters' focus away from McCain's heroic biography as a
Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam to his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's agenda is much less compelling to Republican
audiences, whether its taxes or campaign finance reform,'' Ayres
said. ``This is going to buck up the Bush forces big time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained early in the day that state GOP officials had
failed to open many precinct-voting stations where Democrats and
independents lived, including 21 polling stations in Greenville
County. South Carolina law requires party officials to staff
polling places. Of the state's 1,700 polling places, 1,454 were
open _ twice the number that were open for the 1996 GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disappointing that anyone anywhere in South Carolina
is deprived of the ability to vote,'' McCain said. ``That's just
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP officials consolidated 21 polling places in Greenville
County at the last minute, requiring voters to travel to
alternative sites. ``From the reports we're getting everywhere,
everything is goingsmooth,'' said state GOP director J. Sam
Daniels.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ If John McCain becomes the next president of the
United States, the person most responsible will be McCain's mentor,
archetype and political guru _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the mirror sequence from ``Duck Soup'' has come to
life, with Harpo McCain mimicking every move of Groucho Clinton,
making two men who have little in common appear exactly alike. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton was a Democrat running as a Republican; McCain is a
Republican running as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton came from a small state and wasn't given a chance;
McCain is from a small state and wasn't given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton pretended to be an outsider; McCain pretends to be an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton had a bus; McCain has a bus.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton was a fun guy whose opposition was a stiff; McCain is a
fun guy whose opposition is a stiff.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton's checkered past was ignored; McCain's checkered past
is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton claimed to be bucking the Democratic establishment;
McCain claims to be bucking the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton didn't; McCain isn't.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get to be the chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, like McCain, if you're ``anti-establishment.'' That's
why the rich guys whose industry he regulates give McCain so much
money.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you're a third-term member of the most exclusive club
in the world, the U.S. Senate, you ARE an insider, no matter what
you say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did the same thing. He also realized that outside of
Arkansas, no one cared about his past problems. McCain understands
this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember what Charles Keating, poster boy for the savings
and loan disaster that cost taxpayers billions, said about the
politicians to whom he'd donated truckloads of cash?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. Just as you don't remember the $112,000 McCain
took from Keating, along with vacation trips to the Bahamas and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said, ``One question . . . raised in recent weeks had to
do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several
political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most
forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   How about this?
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the study done by ``Congressional Quarterly'' in
1997 that showed McCain voting with Clinton 70 percent of the time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Clinton and McCain have agreed on normalizing
relations with Vietnam, on campaign finance reform, on anti-tobacco
legislation and other showy issues that can mask a politician's
true colors.
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton talks like a moderate but is a liberal; McCain talks
like a moderate but is a hard-core conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, McCain told ``The Republic's'' Jeff Barker, ``There are
mavericks that are outside the pale of their party, and they're
always just throwing darts. I have a legislative record. I think if
you look at my voting record, it fundamentally has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that stuff matters. Clinton and now McCain have proved
the old proverb wrong: Words DO speak louder than deeds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has patterned his 2000 campaign after what Clinton did in
1992 and 1996, and it just might work.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain's hero status, it's overplayed. Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska is a Medal of Honor recipient, a bigger hero, but he
couldn't get elected president. McCain, like Clinton, has something
better going for him.
</P>
<P>
   _The media loved Clinton; the media REALLY love McCain. &QL;

SUTHERLAND LEADS, BUT WOODS IS LURKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES with results of 3rd round) 
 (rk) 
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ It was difficult enough to dodge the
bumps, footprints and spike marks that made every green at Riviera
Country Club a potential three-putt for bogey or worse. Now, the
leaders of the Nissan Open have another yet familiar factor to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods moved into the passing lane during Saturday's third
round, carding a 2-under 69 that easily put him within striking
distance of a seventh victory in his last eight PGA Tour
tournaments. Woods finished at 6-under 207 and trailed by three
strokes. He came perilously close to shooting himself out of
contention, but was helped by two late birdies and opponents who
could not take the lead lower than 9-under 204.
</P>
<P>
   David Sutherland, a journeyman who will celebrate his 34th
birthday on Sunday while searching for his first PGA Tour victory,
grabbed first place with a birdie at No. 17, sneaking past a crowd
of marquee names. Among six players at 8-under 205 were Jesper
Parnevik, who shot a second straight 67, and Rocco Mediate, who
fired a 64 and climbed the leader board after surviving the cut by
one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam continued at 7-under, where 12 players settled after
54 holes. Included were two-time U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen (69),
Fred Couples (68) and Scott Hoch (69).
</P>
<P>
   But the buzz was about Woods, who shook off a poor start that at
one stage put him eight strokes behind. He four-putted at No. 13
for a double bogey _ from 12 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods pieced together his putting stroke and made five
birdies, including three on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all right just to hang in there,'' Woods said. ``It all
depends on the weather conditions. The forecast is supposed to be
ugly. If that's the case, I just need to be patient, make a lot of
pars, hit a lot of solid shots and take my opportunities when I
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woods: ``Other than that, it's not rocket science out
there. I just need to give myself a lot of chances to make some
putts.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast was for rain and some wind. Another
forecast might call for a duel down the stretch between Woods and
Parnevik, the No. 1 and 2 players on this year's tour money list,
who were paired together in Saturday's third round. Both already
own victories. Woods won the Mercedes Championships and AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am, and Parnevik won the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, Parnevik four-putted a hole, the par-3 No. 4. His
birdie attempt from 25 feet hit the hole, but spun away, leaving
him a four-footer for par. Parnevik missed his next two tries and
took double bogey. Like Woods, he recovered, sinking short birdie
putts on the next three holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a couple of guys to go low tomorrow, including
myself,'' Parnevik said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he, too, will be watching Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's playing, he could pretty much shoot zero around
here,'' Parnevik said. ``But anybody who's in the lead isn't going
to be comfortable because you've got so many people near the
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods began the third round five shots behind. Despite his
rally, he only made up two shots, although it was enough to raise
the other players' attention significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't physically throw him down in the fairway and beat
him that way,'' said Brandel Chamblee, who was one shot from the
lead and will be one of those players looking in his rearview
mirror for Woods. ``But I'm going to do everything I can to beat
him or whoever's up there. I've seen his game, I know what he can
do. Every time you see it, you think there's no way he can do that
again. And then he does it the next week. I'd like to be the one
he's trying to do it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee will have to get in line. Of 71 players in the
tournament, 29 are within three strokes of Sutherland. The crowd at
the top resulted from unpredictable rolls on the greens, where the
mysteries of poa annua grass led to frayed nerves, especially on
short putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are a little bit doggy,'' said Parnevik, who also
three-putted No. 15 from about 15 feet. ``They're soft and bouncy,
so you have to be firm with your putts, but then you'll get a
little too aggressive and have a bunch of four-footers to look at.
You have to really die the ball in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, who split time between the regular tour and what was
called the Nike Tour for most of his 10-year career, stayed away
from taking extra putts. Neither of his two bogeys were caused by
miscues around the hole, instead resulting from poor approach
shots. He was in trouble at No. 2, but made a clutch eight-foot
putt to save bogey. His hit a wayward tee shot at the par-3 sixth
hole and failed to chip up and save par. Sutherland carded five
birdies, including a 10-footer at par-5 17th that gave him the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly Tiger Woods,'' Sutherland said. ``I led a
tournament once and finished second, so I did OK. I've never been
in this position in a tournament of this stature. I won't look at
the leader board until the back nine, about the 16th green.
Hopefully, I'll see something good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain today begin two days of intensive campaigning that will
provide the first real test of their presidential appeal in a
populous, diverse state that mirrors the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are scheduled to arrive in Michigan early this
morning after leaving South Carolina, which held its Republican
primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in today's Detroit News shows Bush and McCain
in a virtual tie in Michigan, with McCain at 40 percent and Bush at
38 percent. The survey had a 4 percent margin of error and was
conducted with 600 likely voters inclduing Republicans, Democrats
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Michigan chairman, state senator John Schwarz, said the
negative attack strategy that Bush used in South Carolina won't
work in Michigan. ``Voters here in Michigan expect a thoughtful,
issue-based discussion not a Dixie mud brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Michigan chairman, Gov. John Engler, said ``It's a very
good night for George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He said South Carolina results showed Bush's broad support and
he expects that to continue in Michigan but there'll be no let up
in campaigning. ``This is a very strong win coming back from New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Arizona have Republican contests Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight delegates are at stake in Michigan's Republican
presidential primary, the biggest single-state prize so far. Three
delegates will be selected from each of the state's 16
congressional districts, with the winner taking all in each
district. Ten additional delegates will be awarded to the candidate
who receives the most votes statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Republican primary, which also includes
conservative activist Alan Keyes, is open to all voters, much like
South Carolina's vote Saturday. The ballot also includes a
Democratic ticket, but lists only perennial fringe candidate Lyndon
LaRouche. Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley have chosen to participate in the closed caucuses being run
by the state Democratic Party on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Secretary of State Candice Miller, a Bush supporter,
projects a turnout of 950,000, 14 percent of the registered voters,
up from the 746,000, 11 percent turnout of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain last week slugged it out in South
Carolina, Bush backers here, including his father, former President
George Bush, have concentrated on getting as many Republican voters
as possible to the polls, while McCain supporters openly wooed
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign even sent postcards to Democrats urging them
to vote for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the McCain campaign, Democratic opponents of Gov.
John Engler, head of the state's Bush campaign, are urging
Democrats, particularly black voters in the populous Detroit area,
to embarrass Engler by voting for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Engler, who's mentioned as a possible vice presidential
candidate or a Bush cabinet member, worked to put the Michigan
primary at the beginning of the nominating process in an attempt to
help Bush and to provide a ``firewall'' for the Texas governor in
case he faltered in the early states.
</P>
<P>
   A loss here would be a major ``embarrassment'' for Engler said
James Penning, a political science professor at Calvin College in
Grand Rapids. ``He has a big stake in this. He endorsed Bush early.
He worked hard to change the primary system. ...That's now looking
like a questionable move.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins here would have bragging rights as the candidate
with the broadest appeal as the campaign moves to other major
states, including Ohio, New York and California, for primaries and
caucuses on March 7, which has been dubbed Titanic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michigan voters are pretty much a microcosm of the
voters nationwide,'' Penning said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaign has reflected the changing nature of
Michigan's Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   William Milliken, a moderate Republican governor in the late
1970s and early '80s, has endorsed McCain. As governor, Milliken
engineered George Bush's win over Ronald Reagan in the 1980
Michigan Republican primary in which the elder Bush was considered
the moderate alternative to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning here last week, former President Bush said it was
his 1980 victory in Michigan that prompted Reagan to choose him as
his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren, Irene Hammond, 65, a retiree from the K-Mart Corp.,
said she voted for the elder Bush twice for president but hasn't
decided whether to back his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say it is tough,'' she said. ``Both men are very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who survived five years as a prisoner of war after his
Navy plane was shot down over North Vietnam, is impressive, she
said. ``You can't take away his real life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, she still is irked by Engler's role in the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Engler but I don't like to have anything shoved down my
throat,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Nearon, the Republican chairman in MaComb County,
northeast of Detroit, said she is solidly behind Bush. ``I think
he's more conservative,'' Nearon said.
</P>
<P>
   The county is home to many of the so-called Reagan Democrats who
helped Republicans win three straight presidential elections
beginning in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   At a Lincoln Day Dinner in Flint later on Thursday, the
Republican establishment's support for the Texas governor was
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Genesee County Republican Party, host of the
dinner, is officially neutral, President Bush delivered a campaign
speech for his son and Bush campaign material was distributed. Not
all the dinner guests had decided to back the Texas governor,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Stokes, an engineer for General Motors, described
himself as a ``conservative independent'' who hadn't made up his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like McCain's war record. It really showed lots of
sacrifice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Coons, a grocery store employee, described himself as a
``conservative Christian'' and said he favored Bush. ``Neither one
was my first choice,'' said Coons, 49.
</P>
<P>
   Nor his second.
</P>
<P>
   He first backed former Vice President Dan Quayle and then
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go with the most conservative candidate who can
win,'' Coons said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state in Lansing, Jerry Roe, 63, said McCain's
campaign had given hope to Republican moderates, who seldom have
been heard of during Engler's 10 years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Roe, now a community college professor of political science, was
the state party's executive director when Milliken and George
Romney served as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't that be awful to have a presidential candidate who
could get independent and Democratic votes?'' Roe asked
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to gauge how many Democrats will come out
Tuesday, particularly if the snow that hit Friday were to return.
</P>
<P>
   In Flint, however, Democratic activist Hal Lawson, a retired
broadcaster and college professor, got his postcard from the McCain
campaign on Friday and has decided to vote for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by the man. It's really got Bush worried,''
said Lawson, 75, a World War II Army veteran.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, state Rep. LaMar Lemmons III, a Democrat, said the
campaign he's leading to get Democrats to support McCain really is
directed at Engler.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has treated Democrats, particularly those in
Detroit, unfairly, said Lemmons. He cited Engler's role in
replacing the city's elected school board with an appointed board.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Engler flyers are being distributed at churches in
predominantly black neighborhoods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The support for McCain, if he were nominated, would not carry
over to the general election, said Lemmons, 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be Democrats the next day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these efforts, controversial Democratic lawyer
Geoffrey Fieger, who represented suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian,
reportedly has created a political action committee that will run
an ad blasting Engler and Bush for their positions on lawsuit
reform. Fieger lost the 1998 gubernatorial election to Engler.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Shafer, Engler's deputy press secretary, said the governor
doesn't take such efforts personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in this game too long to take it seriously,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has ``a great campaign'' in Michigan with ``great
grassroots support'' all across the state, Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   Candice Miller, the secretary of state and Bush supporter, said
she does not think the turnout among non-Republicans will be of
``great proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Swift, a self-described moderate Republican who is
coordinating McCain's efforts in Lansing, said he's never seen
anything like McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an office. We don't have a phone. We don't have
a dime,'' said Swift, 70, an attorney. ``I have 27 voice mails this
morning. They want yard signs. They want bumper stickers. They want
to know how they can help. It's a real fever pitch.''

CUP IDEAS OVERFLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Paul Cayard got some sand between his
toes in the past couple of weeks, and also a bit of hope about his
future in the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After his 5-4 loss to Prada with AmericaOne in the challenger
finals, Cayard took off with his family to see some of New
Zealand's vacation spots, and now is back among the tens of
thousands of racing fans in Auckland watching the start of the
America's Cup, a spectacle anticipated in this South Pacific port
for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Cayard wanted to be sailing his boat in the match,
but he got nipped in an excruciating series by Italy's Prada.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, Cayard sounded bitter. He complained that
a lack of funding early in the campaign, coupled with Prada's $55
million war chest _ flush early, when it counts _ was too much to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there were so many US challengers (including two
from his home city of San Francisco) spread the money and talent
too thin and ``kept our country from putting its best foot
forward,'' said Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   So, no America in the America's Cup. It never happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's emotions have settled down, but he still believes in
his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without adequate funding from the very beginning, it's
pointless to try and make a commitment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Cup ended for him, Cayard says the responses to
his feelers on keeping AmericaOne going ``give me a lot of
confidence to dig in, though nothing will jell until this (Cup) is
over, or perhaps up to three months.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to get private donors lined up.
They can act more quickly than corporations, which make such
decisions at the boardroom level.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of the last campaign, Cayard, who tried to be
both syndicate manager and skipper, knew he was spread too thin.
The reason he had to handle both ends of ``an incredibly complex
organization'' was simple. It's what everything about the Cup comes
back to: money.
</P>
<P>
   The result: ``I just wasn't the sailor this time around that I
was in '92 or '95,'' he said. ``I had not put in enough time
sailing, with everything else that needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Prada campaign got rolling in 1998 with full funding
that gave the team a fast start, Cayard still was sailing the
Whitbread Round-the-World race _ which he won.
</P>
<P>
   Prada's founder and bankroller, Patrizio Bertelli, was able to
offer sailors decent money and, perhaps more important, at least
two years of security.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli already had signed Francesco de Angelis, once with
Cayard's Whitbread campaign, to be Prada's skipper. But two other
key members of the Cayard team also defected _ longtime friend
Steve Erickson, and Laurent Esquier, a veteran of eight America's
Cups and now Prada's chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people are huge,'' said Cayard, who at the time had
nothing to offer but his dream of a Whitbread/America's Cup double.
``Especially when we got into the finals, those people might have
made the difference. Losing them was a big negative for us and a
big positive for Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   Having enough start-up money also allows a campaign to sign on a
top designer and gather the materials necessary to start
construction. The best example of the latter is perhaps the Cuben
Fiber sailcloth, an exotic ``bulletproof'' lightweight material in
limited supply.
</P>
<P>
   Prada was able to corner the market on Cuben Fiber, at least in
the Cup. Hence, Prada had much better spinnakers than AmericaOne,
which was a great weapon in downwind duels.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's vision is to be manager of his syndicate, which will
race the Volvo (formerly Whitbread) and then be ready for the next
America's Cup. Cayard says he will not try to fill both roles, as
skipper and manager, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love sailing,'' he said, ``but if I do it, I have to focus
on it, like (New Zealand skipper) Russell Coutts.''
</P>
<P>
   But managing a complex syndicate also has its appeal. ``I really
like that game,'' Cayard said. ``I have a lot of experience and I
get some satisfaction from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard believes the US interests in the Cup would be best served
by just two, perhaps three syndicates, rather than the five that
came to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you can't legislate it, but, from my point of view,
getting started earlier is the way to deal with the competition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His pick in the America's Cup? ``It makes me smile when I hear
people make predictions,'' he said. ``No one knows better than we
do, especially about Prada. And I don't have a clue.''

BRYANT'S BIG BURDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Coming home hasn't been the most enjoyable
experience for Kobe Bryant the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who attended high school here at Lower Merion before
jumping to the NBA in 1996, enjoys plenty of support from old
friends and family when the Lakers play here. But the last two
visits have both ended in Laker losses to the 76ers and
lightening-quick Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had the burden of guarding Iverson last year, and watched
him zip around screens to take 36 shots from the field and score 41
points in a 105-90 Sixers victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson hasn't divulged who will defend
Iverson today - Bryant, veteran Ron Harper or Derek Fisher, who was
assigned to speedy Darrell Armstrong of the Magic on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant would welcome the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care. I look forward to any challenge, whether
it's guarding Al or guarding whoever,'' he said. ``When I'm on him,
I'm just going to play him. Yeah he's a big challenge, because he's
so little and he's quick. But y'all know me, you know I don't give
a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's mind, Iverson is not one man's burden to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a team challenge, is what he is, not just an individual
challenge. He challenges the whole team,'' Jackson said. ``He's
very talented, he's resilient, he's determined, he's dogged about
scoring. He's unafraid. There are a lot of things about his game I
like. I don't like his style of play particularly, but that's what
they have to do to make themselves a potent team, and they do a
good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson leads the league in scoring at 31.2 points per game and
is also tops in field-goal attempts, 26.4 per game. He might be
able to ease up a bit, now that the Sixers have acquired former
Jackson pupil Toni Kukoc from the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who beat the Bulls on Tuesday, a day before the
trade, face Kukoc for the second time in six days. He scored 14
points on 4-of-14 shooting in the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm glad we had one opportunity to get used to him,''
said Jackson. ``And the next time around, maybe we'll do a little
better job, although we did a pretty good job that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal trails only Iverson in the scoring
race but isn't concerned with catching him. O'Neal won a scoring
title in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really tried to be the leading scorer,'' he said.
``I've got that little trophy at the house. I just play team ball.
He's a phenomenal player. Whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting words: Jackson unwittingly started a feud with Orlando
when he casually referred to it as a ``plastic city'' last week.
The Orlando Sentinel picked up on the comment and stripped a story
about it across the top of Friday's sports section. Jackson was
duly booed during pregame introductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that all about?'' Jackson remarked about the story.
``Is this a redneck town or something, they have to start a fight
like this?... That's really pretty low stuff, journalistic-wise, if
you ask me. If that's what they need to do to have the fans
respond, that says even more about Orlando than I thought I made a
comment about.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 2:30 p.m., First Union Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (40-11) update: With three wins to open this six-game
road trip, the Lakers are now 16-2 against the Eastern Conference
and 7-1 on the road against East teams. They've lost three straight
to the Sixers, however, including a 105-90 loss here last season.
</P>
<P>
   76ers (28-23) update: They have been typically inconsistent and
are 4-3 in February. Allen Iverson leads the NBA in scoring (31.2
points per game) but is taking a league-leading 26.4 shots per game
to get it.

 McCAIN VOWS TO FIGHT ON  
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Hardly bowed by his double-digit defeat in
South Carolina, a defiant Sen. John McCain vowed Saturday night
that his ``crusade grows stronger'' and pledged that ``we have just
begun to fight and I cannot wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, fists clenched and sounding new themes that are likely
to get stronger as the bitter Republican primary battle moves on to
the big-state contests across the nation, McCain promised to keep
``fighting clean'' and drew an implicit but sharp contrast with
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends I say to you I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' he
said, ``I don't just say it, I live it. I am a real reformer. I
don't say it I live it. And I am a fighter for this country. And I
don't just say it I live it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this campaign moves forward, a clear choice will be
offered,'' he said. ``A choice between my optimistic and welcoming
conservatism and the negative message of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Having watched Bush successfully take from him the mantle of
reform here by changing from a ``compassionate conservative'' to a
``reformer with results,'' McCain began a battle to redefine his
opponent once more, this time on his own terms. The voters he said
have ``a choice between a record of reform and an empty slogan of
reform. A choice between experience and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain walked into a Charleston ballroom to give his concession
speech to the music from Star Wars. But the crowd was small and the
senator's supporters were stunned by the breadth and magnitude of
his loss here much as they were surprised by the broad-based nature
of his 19-point New Hampshire victory just three weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our base just fell apart,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
as exit polls showed that McCain had done dismally with members of
his own party who flocked to the polls for Bush. At the same time
he failed to draw out the same kind of outpouring of independents
that he had in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain flew on to Michigan Saturday night, hoping to recover his
footing in the larger states that now come center stage in the
Republican nomination struggle. Michigan and Arizona both hold
primaries on Tuesday. The senator's aides predicted his reform
message would have more appeal there and in later primary states
such as California, Washington, Ohio and New York, which do not
have South Carolina's concentration of Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign quickly started trying to paint Gov. George
W. Bush as the candidate of the Christian right. ``Ralph Reed, Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell are to be congratulated,'' said John
Weaver, McCain's political director. Referring to Bush, he said,
``We don't know if you can run as a Dixiecrat in Michigan, but
we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary results suggested that Republican voters had
believed everything Bush and his conservatives allies had told them
about McCain in a steady barrage of television and radio
commercials and mass mailings. The senator's supporters said he had
been caught in a bind _ weakened by his decision to stop negative
ads but in danger of losing his luster if he had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people don't unilaterally disarm is that generally
its tough to make it work,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford. But he added
``if you ever got down in the mud with the other guy elbowing as
hard as you could, then frankly you've lost the idealistic God,
country appeal that was the cornerstone of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said that despite McCain's vow to avoid negative
advertising throughout the entire primary season, that ``We will
set the record straight and you can do that in a way that's not
negative.'' In an instant sign of how the McCain campaign was now
prepared to fight, the senator's aides immediately distributed a
statement from McCain's Michigan chairman, state Sen. John Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Gov. Bush's negative attack strategy may have worked in
South Carolina,'' Schwarz said, ``Voters here in Michigan expect a
thoughtful issue-based discussion not a Dixie mud brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the last South Carolina campaign day began in
Greenville Saturday morning, there were hints that McCain knew he
was likely to fail in his attempt to draw Democrats and
independents into voting in the open Republican primary to counter
Bush's strength with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   His tones had a valedictory sound as he begged the veterans to
go out on ``one more mission'' for him and get out the vote. ``When
I'm very old down at the old soldiers home with the feet up on the
railing, I'm going to look back,'' he said. ``and say the South
Carolina experience was an incredible part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he flew into South Carolina propelled by his New
Hampshire victory, McCain had defied the conventional wisdom that a
Republican primary here is won on the right. At times in the past
few days, the senator's tones became so populist and
anti-establishment that he no longer sounded much like a Republican
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon at a jam-packed gymnasium of the College of
Charleston he didn't just proclaim a crusade, he said, ``We are
starting a revolution.'' Later that night, at an outdoor rally
under the neon lights of the NASCAR cafe in Myrtle Beach, he
shouted, ``We can eradicate evil. We can eradicate differences
between rich and poor''

   LANSING, Mich. _ Having won the Republican primary in South
Carolina, Gov. George W. Bush plans to spend Sunday and Monday
here, seeking to deal another blow to Sen. John McCain's
aspirations in this state's primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday night, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, an
early supporter of Bush, said the South Carolina victory will
provide additional momentum here, as he and his allies lead one of
the largest political mobilizations ever in the state. ``There's no
question it's going to be helpful,'' said Engler. ``The size of the
win is really opening eyes in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, McCain plans to spend the next two days furiously
campaigning across Michigan. But he has a low-budget operation here
and is relying heavily on media coverage and the Internet to get
his message out, in a showdown that pits the buzz of his popularity
against one of the most formidable political machines left in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Republican owners of small businesses say party officials have
asked to use their offices as phone banks to appeal for Bush
voters. County executives and other local party leaders have been
writing thousands of letters to get out the vote. And Republican
state legislators have been recording radio advertisements for Bush
in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Engler is hoping that his approach to politics still works. In
an interview last Thursday at his office here, across the street
from the state capitol he said, ``It's somewhat chilling, actually,
to see the McCain campaign be so obsessed with their press
relations and their media strategy that it overwhelms all of the
old, traditional political campaign aspects,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials say that 2,000 people have volunteered
over the Internet to help in Michigan, but they have set up only a
handful of phone banks and are hoping that most of the volunteers
will distribute pamphlets, put up signs and make phone calls from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll concede the organization battle,'' said Michael Hudome,
McCain's top adviser on the Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high here for Engler personally, too. Term limits
require him to leave office at the end of his current term, his
third. And because he has bee a top adviser to Bush there has been
much speculation that he would have a role in a Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Engler predicted on Thursday and again Saturday night that Bush
would win the primary here by four or five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say Bush is slightly ahead of McCain here, but that
the outcome will depend on turnout. In past Republican primaries
here, the turnout has tended to be 10 percent to 12 percent of
registered voters, about two-thirds of whom are in the party and
the balance of whom are Democrats, independents and Republicans who
vote only occasionally. McCain can win if he can increase turnout
to 15 percent _ close to one million people _ by attracting more
independents, Democrats and Republicans who vote infrequently, said
Ed Sarpolus, a pollster here at EPIC/MRA, which does polling for
media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 100,000 voters on Tuesday will be Republicans who seldom
vote in primaries but will vote for Bush at the request of the
Engler organization, Sarpolus estimated. That could be roughly
equal to the number of Democrats who vote in the Republican
primary, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A few liberal Democrats have urged their supporters to vote for
McCain to punish Engler for stripping Detroit of some its control
over schools and courts. But Michigan's Democratic leaders have
disavowed this tactic, and pollsters have predicted that the effect
would be statistically insignificant. Engler has tried to galvanize
his supporters by attacking the limited Democratic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will hold caucuses in Michigan on March 11.
Republicans in Arizona will, like those in Michigan, hold their
primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Engler has spent his 10 years as governor, as well as most of
the 1980s as president of the state Senate, assiduously attending
fund-raisers and other events for Republican chairmen in each of
Michigan's 83 counties. He is also a feared figure in state
politics, with a reputation similar to that of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York for remembering his friends and punishing his
enemies in budgets and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Engler has been using all his influence to make sure that
local Republicans organize the grass-roots effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the Engler machine, or establishment, kicks in,''
said L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County executive. ``We have
resources, I think, that McCain doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Cox, the chairman of a large law firm in Troy, Mich., said
that he had agreed to a request from Oakland County Republicans to
turn over the firm's headquarters this weekend to volunteers who
would make phone calls asking Bush supporters to make sure they
voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asked to do this for local races, but this is the
first time we've been asked for a presidential race,'' Cox, a
Republican, said. His firm, Cox, Hodgman &AMP; Giarmarco, represents
many Michigan cities in liability cases, including cities with
Democratic administrations. But Cox said that the decision to help
had been made, ``because it's a good thing for the community'' to
increase voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's secretary of state, Candice S. Miller, said she had
arranged for 560 volunteers to work this weekend in shifts on 300
phones at local businesses to get out the vote for Bush in Macomb
County in Detroit's northeastern suburbs, her political base.
``We're approaching this not as if this were a presidential
campaign but as though there were county commissioner campaigns all
over the place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the McCain campaign has 25 volunteers who will be
making calls from their homes in Oakland and Macomb Counties, two
of Michigan's three largest counties.
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for Engler's activity. William G. Milliken,
a moderate Republican who was Michigan's governor from 1970 to
1982, campaigned energetically at the last moment for Bush's father
in the Republican primary in 1980 and essentially cast the primary
as a referendum on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trailing Ronald Reagan in Michigan polls by up to 12
percentage points several days before the vote, Bush won the
primary by 25 percentage points. The victory helped him secure the
vice presidential nomination at the Republican convention eight
weeks later in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken, who remains one of the most popular politicians in the
state despite 18 years in retirement, endorsed McCain on Thursday.

BUSH GETS HIS POLITICAL SWAGGER BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ On the Sunday after Gov. George W. Bush limped
out of New Hampshire, two of his aides were deep into a telephone
conversation, searching for a new sales pitch that would put some
swagger back into their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Karen P. Hughes, turned almost instinctively to the
kind of alliteration she often favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reformer with results, Hughes said to Ari Fleischer, the
other aide, who liked what he heard.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, the phrase was emblazoned on banners, atop the
campaign's news releases and prominent in Bush's public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks later, as Bush and his advisers savored an
emphatic victory in South Carolina, they attributed much of their
success to this change of direction. The exit polls from Saturday's
Republican primary here affirmed that judgment, showing that more
South Carolinians thought of Bush as a reformer than they did
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that they had not simply co-opted McCain's
message of reforming government. They had found a slogan that
signaled that Bush could boast a record of the kind of
accomplishments so rare in the bitterly partisan halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded people of successful governors from outside the
Beltway,'' said Fleischer. ``There's no secret there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush folded variations on the word ``reform'' into his victory
speech Saturday night a half dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   He called his triumph ``the victory of a messenger who is a
reformer with results,'' Bush told hundreds of cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reform agenda,'' he added, ``stands in stark contrast to
the current administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers divined all sorts of good news not only in the
margin of Bush's victory, but also in the shape of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had beaten McCain handily among younger voters and women.
He had lost to McCain among independent voters by much less than he
had in New Hampshire. And despite a barrage of commercials harshly
criticizing McCain, more voters said that McCain had run a negative
campaign than said that Bush had.
</P>
<P>
   The data also held a piece of potentially bad news: that when
Christian conservatives, an enormously influential bloc of voters
in this state, were removed from the equation, McCain came out on
top.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his advisers were busy embracing an emotional high
that contrasted sharply with the depths they felt only two weeks
ago, when they were quickly retooling the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six days after New Hampshire, we were smiling, but we were
gritting our teeth,'' said Tucker Eskew, a spokesman for the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, the Bush campaign had completely recaptured
its confidence, and Bush was unequivocally guaranteeing victory
just hours after the polls opened.
</P>
<P>
   He was so calm that he had almost begun a midafternoon ``power
nap,'' as he called it, before his chief strategist, Karl Rove,
came into his fifth-floor suite at the Sheraton with the first exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' Bush told Rove, as Rove recalled. ``Will they hold?''
</P>
<P>
   Rove assured him they would.
</P>
<P>
   Rove then contacted Bush's father, the former president, in
Texas, who had been anxiously calling the governor's advisers all
day long.
</P>
<P>
   Bush woke before 3 p.m. and went outdoors to exercise: three
miles of running, two of walking. Advisers said that he was still
in his workout clothing, a white towel around his neck, when the
campaign's senior officials convened in his suite to sketch out his
victory speech.
</P>
<P>
   A band played the rock song ``Taking Care of Business'' as Bush
entered a ballroom to deliver those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come roaring out of South Carolina,'' Bush told the crowd,
``with a new energy in this campaign.''

 &HT;    76ers new talent is hard to beat
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA That noise you hear is from the quivering knees of the
Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks and Miami Heat. That trio of teams
had been expected to battle it out for the Eastern Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's acquisition of Toni Kukoc made the Philadelphia
76ers legitimate contenders _ and scary.
</P>
<P>
   Not so much because the Sixers have added a multi-talented, 6-11
forward with a championship pedigree. But because once Kukoc gets
acclimated to coach Larry Brown's scheme and playing with all-star
guard Allen Iverson, his presence will help exploit the other
clubs' weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, facing Philadelphia mostly required paying special
attention to Iverson, the NBA's No. 1 scorer. But with Kukoc
opening the floor with his perimeter game and creating for others
with his passing, look for Theo Ratliff to be more of a defensive
and rebounding force, for center Matt Geiger to assert muscle
inside _ for all of the 76ers' play to rise.
</P>
<P>
   That's the magnitude of a player who knows how to play. At the
same time, Kukoc makes the Pacers' depth less of an issue, the
Knicks' confidence less effective and the Heat's defense less
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the teams were seriously flawed. On any given
night, New York can perform like a group of stumblebums. Losses to
Boston, the Hawks and the Warriors are examples. Indiana has had
the experience and talent for the last three years but has found
,ways to lose. Last year's conference finals loss to the Knicks,
despite having home-court advantage and Patrick Ewing out injured,
is an example.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miami, it has grown weary of coach Pat Riley's strong-arm
tactics and lacks enough offense to be successful in the playoffs.
Last year's loss as the No. 1 seed to New York, the eighth seed, in
the first round, is an example.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 76ers have the reliable scorer to go with Iverson.
Larry Hughes was Iverson's partner, his ``Flight Brother.'' But
Hughes was a rookie who had flashes of spectacular play. Kukoc is a
cunning passer whose size creates mismatches no matter what
position he plays.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when the three-team deal was proposed, Hughes had to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trading for a player who has won championships and
played with the greatest players in the league (in Michael Jordan
and Scottie Pippen), his championship experience will help us
tremendously,'' Philly general manager Billy King said.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the deal for the Sixers is Iverson. He has to
accept Kukoc's talent and feed off of it. Iverson probably won't
have to hoist 30 or so shots while his teammates stand around and
watch. The quality of his attempts should increase, meaning that
his scoring average should not suffer, while the production of
others should increase, making the team better.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Allen Iverson, I think he is a very, very good
player,'' Kukoc said. ``His record speaks for itself. It's always
nice to have teammates around who can finish a play when you pass
to them. Allen is probably a player you could call an easy assist
because he is such an outstanding finisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I'm going to be a player who will try to
score, as well,'' Kukoc said. ``And Allen can help there, too,
because he can discourage a double-team when I go inside to try to
use my height advantage. It's always good to have an outside and
inside attack. The team itself is very talented and has a lot of
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc said he wanted to finish his career in Chicago, but he
could not hide his excitement about what being a Sixer could mean.
``I'm happy to be going to a much better team,'' he said. ``It's a
winning team that has an excellent chance not just to make the
playoffs but to advance deep into the playoffs. We'll just have to
wait and see what this deal does for all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides most concerned are Indiana, New York and Miami. And
they have every reason to be.

 &HT;    St. Louis on a Blue streak
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _You can't go anywhere without seeing a hat, T-shirt or
a pennant commemorating the St. Louis Rams' improbable run through
the NFL last season. Signs of the relocated franchise's first Super
Bowl victory are as obvious as the Arch.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to four months before the city's hockey team
learns if it can match the Rams' postseason success and win its
first Stanley Cup. But this much is certain: A Blues NHL title will
not create nearly the number of dropped jaws that quarterback Kurt
Warner did this season.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody already knows the Blues are solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built that club to the point now where they're a
legitimate contender for the Cup _ they've got everything,'' said
Thrashers coach Curt Fraser, whose team was drilled by the Blues
4-1. ``They're big, they're fast, they have guys who can finish
like (Pavol) Demitra and (Pierre) Turgeon. They have great guys on
defense like (Al) MacInnis and (Chris) Pronger. They're the total
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it through the Western Conference playoffs with Dallas,
Detroit and Colorado won't be easy. But the Blues have the best
record in the conference and, similar to the Stars and Red Wings,
are deep in forwards who play well at both ends of the ice. The
biggest question is how young goalie Roman Turek holds up as the
first-time starter of a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues last made the conference finals in 1986 (losing to
Calgary in seven games). They reached the Stanley Cup finals their
first three seasons, when all six expansion teams were placed in
one division, the West, and the winner faced the champion of the
East's ``Original Six.'' Montreal (twice) and Boston swept St.
Louis all three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Blues general manager Larry Pleau, in his third season after
eight years with the Rangers and 17 with Hartford as player, coach
and general manager, and coach Joel Quenneville both have gained
respect in the league. Pleau has built a team that sent five
players to the All-Star Game _ Demitra, Turgeon (who couldn't play
because of an injury), Turek, MacInnis and Pronger. Quenneville, an
aide on Colorado's Stanley Cup team in 1995-96, will get Canadian
Olympic team consideration if the NHL goes to Salt Lake City in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said last week, ``I think they'll
take a guy like Joel. He was in Colorado when they won. He built a
team up in St. Louis. They play hard every night. Any time you get
a team to play like he does, that's the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   There was foreshadowing for this season. The Blues upset Phoenix
in the first round last season and took Dallas to six games, losing
two of four overtime games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what to expect,'' Pleau said. ``Fortunately
some of the moves we've made have worked. We brought in a guy like
(Slovakian center) Michal Handzus, and he's been a piece of the
puzzle. We wanted to better ourselves in goal scoring, goaltending
and be more consistent, and we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   It has impressed the veteran MacInnis, who played on a Cup team
in Calgary and barely survived the Mike Keenan era in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great indication of the job Larry and Joel have done,''
he said. ``They came in with a game plan to build the organization,
build the assets and have a deeper team. We've had injuries, but
we've been able to stay on top of the standings.''

   BRADLEY AIDES DENY MARCH 7 IS A MUST
</P>
<P>
   Aides of Bill Bradley denied a story in Saturday's Washington
Post saying he is likely to abandon his campaign if he does not
achieve significant victories March 7, when 15 states and American
Samoa hold primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Post had quoted Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications
director, as saying that although she, too, expected good results
March 7, there would be little point in continuing if he fared
poorly. Polls show Bradley behind in every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the delegates will be chosen between March 7
and March 14,'' Dunn was quoted as saying. ``It would be hard to
draw a scenario where you did well on the back end of the week but
not on the front end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior adviser said Bradley would not pursue ``a suicide
strategy'' if his campaign was going nowhere, the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   GORE CHALLENGES GOP ON FLAG ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore accused both Republican presidential
campaign leaders Saturday of tolerating racial bigotry by refusing
to take a stand on removing the Confederate flag from South
Carolina's Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither ... has the guts to take on bigotry,'' he said during
a campaign stop in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain have said
the flag issue should be decided by South Carolinians. A Bush
spokesman said Saturday that Gore was engaging in ``the old-style
Washington politics ... that seeks to divide people.'' The McCain
campaign had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LADY, GORE IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore were scheduled to campaign
today in the same place at the same time for the first time this
year. Each is expected to speak at a church service in Albany,
N.Y., that is part of a gathering of the state Legislature's black
and Hispanic legislative caucus. Both Gore, who faces a March 7
primary contest in New York, and the first lady, who is running for
the U.S. Senate, feel they must step out of the shadow of President
Clinton. But aides said they have not intentionally avoided each
other.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW CANDIDATE JOINS RACE
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian Harry Browne last week announced his second bid for
the White House. The 66-year-old investment adviser from Nashville,
Tenn., proposes a 12-step program that eliminates income taxes,
Social Security, the war on drugs and federal welfare Browne
received 1 percent of the vote in 1996.MCCAIN'S RECORD MORE
CONSERVATIVE
</P>
<P>
   There have been increasing attacks on John McCain by some
Republicans for being a GOP moderate who compromises frequently
with Democrats, or even a ``closet liberal.'' But, says the Chicago
Tribune, those charges are not supported by the votes he cast
during his career in Congress. A Tribune examination of hundreds of
McCain's votes during the past 17 years leaves little doubt that he
does belong in the conservative camp.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY DEFENDS ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley told a crowd of 300 in Seattle on Saturday that
said the Clinton-Gore administration has not followed through on
pledges to protect rivers, oceans and clean air, and that
``protecting the environment is ... part of my core.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports spending $2 billion over 10 years to set aside
more parkland, paying for it with new mining royalties from federal
lands, and defends a Clinton administration order limiting logging
in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the administration has spent too little money from
offshore oil drilling royalties on protecting public lands and has
done little to rally the public behind the ``Kyoto Protocol''
climate change agreement. He said he fought as a New Jersey senator
for the Superfund law to clean up contaminated land and wrote the
law allocating more California water to environmental uses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's struggle to keep his
presidential campaign alive seems to hinge increasingly on this
state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Washington holds a nonbinding vote on Feb. 29 that will be the
only Democratic contest before the so-called Super Tuesday
primaries in 16 states on March 7. Having lost to Vice President Al
Gore in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and trailing badly in polls in
almost every state including Washington, Bradley views this state
as a critical proving ground where he must regain some of the
political momentum and media attention he has lost over the last
month, his advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens here if he beats Gore is that it will resonate
across the country that this is a race,'' said Mayor Paul Schell of
Seattle, who is helping Bradley here. ``This is where he's going to
make a stand. I think he's decided that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is planning to lavish his time and resources on
Washington in the coming week. He has also sent more than 20 aides,
including some of his most seasoned organizers, to the state. By
next weekend, his aides said, the full-time paid staff will
probably grow to 30 people.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes many of Bradley's top political aides from
Iowa and New Hampshire, including Mark Longabaugh, his state
director in New Hampshire, and Robert Becker, who was his political
director in Iowa. Two of Bradley's senior advisers, Margy Heldring
and Gretchen Crosby, have also moved to Seattle to talk about
Bradley's record and agenda, particularly his plan to extend
private health insurance to almost all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself is expected to spend most of the coming week
campaigning along the Pacific Coast and in heavily Democratic
cities like Tacoma and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also preparing an advertising campaign for local
radio stations and newspapers to promote his health care plan as
well as his endorsement by The Seattle Times, the state's largest
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Feb. 29 will not be used to select delegates to the
Democratic convention. That will be done on March 7 in party
caucuses, where Gore is expected to excel because he has the
support of most party officials and labor unions, groups that tend
to dominate the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's advisers are less concerned with delegates than
public relations, and they view Washington as one of their last
chances to reverse perceptions that the Bradley campaign is
foundering. A win here on Feb. 29, they say, could build the kind
of excitement they need to go into the March 7 primaries with some
sense of positive movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this state to be able to send a message to the rest of
the country,'' Bradley told a group of about 75 supporters Saturday
morning outside a health clinic in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has acknowledged that he must win some states on March
7, when New York, California, Ohio and 10 other states will select
30 percent of the Democratic delegates. But while Bradley once
talked of trying to contest Gore in almost every state, his
campaign is trying to focus its efforts on certain states to ensure
that he gains enough victories to justify staying in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers say that in addition to Washington, they are
counting on doing well in New England, particularly Connecticut, in
New York, where Bradley played pro basketball for 10 seasons, and
Missouri, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Victories in those states, combined with a strong second-place
showing in California, would help insulate Bradley against pressure
from other Democrats to drop out of the race. Performing well on
March 7 is also important because on March 14 the campaign turns
south, to Florida, Texas, Tennessee and several other states where
Gore is considered the heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers say they think he can do well in Washington
in part because independents _ a group he does better among than
Gore does _ are allowed to vote in the Feb. 29 primary. Thanks to a
booming high-tech economy, there is also a large population of
well-educated, higher income residents here, and polls have
consistently shown that such voters tend to support Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   During less than 24 hours in Seattle, Bradley focused on the two
issues his aides think are most important to Washington voters: the
environment and health care.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with more than 800 people on Friday, Bradley talked
proudly about his work on environmental issues in the Senate, which
earned him an 84 percent favorable voting record from the League of
Conservation Voters, compared with a 64 percent rating for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday morning, he appeared outside a health clinic to
promote his health care plan. ``I didn't come new to the health
care debate since I've been running for president,'' he said. ``In
16 years in the Congress, he did not introduce one health care
bill,'' he added, referring to Gore.

IRANIAN REFORMERS AHEAD IN CRITICAL VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Initial ballot counts Saturday in Iran's pivotal
parliamentary elections showed reformist candidates who back
President Mohammad Khatami poised for a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
   State television said results have been declared for 168 of the
290 seats, but it did not give the affiliations of the elected
lawmakers. But the official Islamic Republic News Agency said about
67 percent of those seats _ or about 112 _ went to reformists, 25
percent were won by hard-liners and the rest were taken by
independents.
</P>
<P>
   If the reformers win, Khatami would become the next speaker of
the Parliament. He would replace Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, who had so
few votes by Saturday evening that it appeared he could lose his
parliamentary seat.
</P>
<P>
   Results, however, were preliminary and an official count was not
expected for at least a week because ballots are being counted by
hand. A runoff is set for sometime in March.
</P>
<P>
   But the electric atmosphere in cosmopolitan Tehran, where the
core of Khatami's supporters live, suggested they expected his push
for greater freedoms and democracy to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic,'' said Mahmoud Motevalian, a journalist and
political commentator. He added that he hoped Khatami's Islamic
Iran Participation Front would dominate Parliament ``so we can have
some change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first election-related violence, meanwhile, two people
were killed and 15 injured Saturday in the southwestern town of
Shush, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started when one group accused the winning candidate
of bribing people to vote for him, IRNA reported. It was not clear
whether the conflict stemmed from political differences or local
tribal rivalries unrelated to the conservative-reformist struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas and bullets in the air to quell the
rioters, who set fire to cars and hurled stones, IRNA said. It
confirmed the 15 injuries but did not report any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear to which camp the victorious candidate, Jassem
Sayeri, belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic violence also was reported in the towns of Boroujen,
Boldaji and Gandoman in central Iran. Supporters of two losing
candidates burned tires and smashed windows of the governor's
office and shops, witnesses said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The election is seen as a critical juncture that could determine
the country's direction for a generation. Since his election in
1997, Khatami has tried to move Iran toward democracy and respect
for human rights and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, he has come up against powerful conservative rivals
who have tried to halt change. If reformers win the Parliament,
analysts have predicted, they could give Khatami the backing he
needs to confront the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movement from the grass roots up,'' said Habibollah
Peyman, a reformist. ``We believe that very soon this social
movement will win.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this election is the question of how much
influence Iran's Shiite Muslim religious clerics should maintain
over public life and to what extent the country should open its
borders to new ideas and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Young people fed up with the decade of the ``government of God''
telling them what to wear and what music to listen to have come out
in force behind Khatami's reformers. They hope to curb the
influence of the mullahs _ the clerics who control key aspects of
government _ and open up to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative voters worry that Western influence will corrupt
the morals of young people and entice them away from the strict
lifestyle of fundamentalist Shiite Islam that has guided Iran since
the mullahs overthrew Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the mullahs have become increasingly unpopular and
are blamed for driving the country into ruin _ and political
isolation. Iranians, conservative and reformist, cite Iran's
economy as one of their biggest grievances. Both camps also favor
importing products and ideas from the West, although conservatives
would rather limit this contact to science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, as one of the most visible supporters of the
conservative government, seems to have borne the brunt of much of
the public's wrath. Despite the fact that he heads a reformist
party that includes a few respected liberals, he is not well-liked.
</P>
<P>
   He is associated, foremost, with corruption, the killing of
several dissident writers and failing to put an early end to Iran's
eight-year war with Iraq. Many voters said they suspect his
reformist rhetoric is merely show.

<P>
   Following are excerpts from Gov. George W. Bush's victory speech
Saturday night in Columbia, S.C., as recorded by The New York
Times:
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has spoken. And tonight _ and tonight there are
only 263 days more to the end of Clinton-Gore ...
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration has squandered America's
strength and purpose in the world, causing low morale in the
military that is underpaid, undertrained and overdeployed. In stark
contrast _ in stark contrast I have a reform agenda to increase
pay, expand research and development and build the best hope for
peace and freedom in our world. And that hope is a strong military,
and a steady, peaceful presence of the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   This administration has played politics with Medicare and Social
Security. In stark contrast, I have a reform agenda and a proven
record of bringing people together to make sure that we save and
strengthen those important programs. Clinton-Gore have the
unfortunate legacy of the highest taxes in America since World War
II. In stark contrast, I understand clearly that today's surplus is
not government's money, it is the people's money...
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility begins with leaders who behave responsibly. I
will make sure when American parents and their children look at the
White House, they will see not an embarrassment, but an example of
which they can be proud.

MCCAIN'S CONCESSION SPEECH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from Sen. John McCain's concession speech
in Charleston, S.C., on Saturday night, as transcribed by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to fight with every ounce of strength I have, but I'm
going to keep fighting clean, I'm going to keep fighting fair, and
I'm going to keep fighting the battle of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   And my friends, we are going to win.
</P>
<P>
   I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land.
</P>
<P>
   I want the presidency in the best way, not the worst way.
</P>
<P>
   The American people deserve to be treated with respect by those
who seek to lead the nation. And I promise you, you will have my
respect until my last day on earth. The greatest blessing of my
life was to have been born an American, and I will never dishonor
the nation I love by letting myself _ I will never dishonor the
nation I love  &UR; or &LR;  myself by letting ambition overcome principle.
Never. Never. Never.
</P>
<P>
   My friends, I say to you I am a uniter, not a divider. I don't
just say it, I live it. I'm a real reformer. I'm a real reformer. I
don't just say it, I live it. And I'm a fighter for this country,
and I don't just say it, I live it.
</P>
<P>
   As this campaign moves forward, a clear choice will be offered,
a choice between my optimistic and welcoming conservatism and the
negative message of fear. Between Ronald Reagan's vision of
inclusion and the defeatist tactics of exclusion so cherished by
those who would shut the doors to our party and surrender America's
future to Speaker Gephardt and President Al Gore. A choice between
a record of reform and an empty slogan of reform. A choice between
experience and pretense.

BUSH NOTCHES A BIG WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ George W. Bush triumphed Saturday in the
hard-fought South Carolina Republican presidential primary,
reclaiming leadership in the battle for his party's nomination and
leaving suddenly testy insurgent John McCain to regroup for quickly
approaching contests.
</P>
<P>
   With three-fourths of the precincts counted, Bush, the Texas
governor, led with 54 percent to 41 percent for McCain, a senator
from Arizona. Alan Keyes, a former Reagan administration official,
was stuck at about 5 percent of what was clearly a record turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the polls closed, Bush declared he was ``excited
and energized.'' He later told supporters in a Columbia hotel
ballroom he was ``honored and humbled by the huge victory.'' He
barely mentioned McCain and targeted President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, the leading contender for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only 263 days more to the end of Clinton-Gore,''
Bush declared, returning his focus to the general election, where
it had been until a tightening Republican race, highlighted by his
loss to McCain in New Hampshire, diverted his attention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain quickly called Bush to congratulate him but then hammered
the governor in a statement to supporters in a North Charleston
hall. Without mentioning Bush by name, McCain caustically
criticized his opponent's hard-edged campaign in a combative
statement that contrasted with Bush's gracious concession speech in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not take the low road to the highest office in the
land,'' McCain said. ``I want the presidency in the best way, not
the worst way.'' In an obvious allusion to Bush's retooled claim to
be ``a reformer with results,'' McCain said he had ``a record of
reform'' not ``an empty slogan of reform.'' McCain contended that
he offered ``a choice between experience and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed no regrets about his aggressive campaign against
McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by what I did,'' Bush said in a CNN interview. ``I
defended myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush aide called McCain's concession ``a bitter speech.
You can learn a lot about a man in defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, signaled the task ahead:
``Clearly, we're going to have to sell really hard and really fast
our reformer's message.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hoped Bush would get a good night's sleep,
because ``he's going to need it, my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After their election night statements, Bush and McCain flew
immediately to Michigan for whirlwind tours in advance of the
campaign's first primary in an industrial state.
</P>
<P>
   Public-opinion polls taken immediately after New Hampshire gave
McCain an edge in Michigan despite Bush's backing by the Republican
establishment, including Gov. John Engler. But a new Detroit News
survey published Saturday showed the race a dead heat, with McCain
at 40 percent to Bush's 38 percent. A week ago, McCain led 43
percent to 34 percent in the same survey last week, indicating
definite movement toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain loses in Michigan, ``it would be the equivalent of
`Dead Man Walking,'`` said Randy White, former executive director
of the Christian Coalition. McCain would begin to ``completely
unravel'' and ``it would be very difficult for him to recover,''
said White, now director of Republican affairs for Voter.com, a new
political Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who remains the Republican front-runner in national
surveys, scored solidly across South Carolina with conservatives,
who backed him 2-1 over McCain, and with the religious right, who
favored him 3-1, according to exit polls for news organizations.
Self-identified Republicans backed Bush by more than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush split veterans about evenly with McCain, whose history as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam is at the center of his campaign
persona. McCain drew most strongly from independents, moderates,
Democrats and newcomers to the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting, in generally sunny, warm weather, was open to all
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was the 2000 campaign's first test in the South and
the first major confrontation for the principal candidates since
McCain electrified the Republican race as he drubbed Bush by 19
percentage points in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, South Carolina proved to be a firewall for a
hard-pressed favorite of the Republican establishment, much the
same function it served for Bush's father in 1988 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had earlier won caucuses in Iowa and Alaska and the primary
in Delaware, states where McCain chose not to compete actively.
McCain's sole success was in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had counted on a victory in South Carolina to propel him
through Tuesday's voting and to set the stage for a further assault
against Bush on March 7, when more than a dozen primaries are on
tap, including California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also holds a primary Tuesday with Michigan, and after
trailing Bush in polls last fall, McCain now shows a substantial
lead in surveys of likely voters in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained as voting progressed in South Carolina that
the state Republican Party, which administered the primary,
violated terms of a legal agreement by not advertising in advance
that some polling places in traditionally low GOP turnout areas
were to be merged with nearby precincts. A black Democratic state
legislator had challenged the GOP plan to keep some polling places
shuttered, and early last week a U.S. district judge approved a
merged-precinct plan provided notice was given.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would ask for ``a full investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina voting came after two weeks of attacks from
both major candidates, in which each compared the other to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was crowned with a finger-waving face-off Tuesday
night in which Bush and McCain, with only Keyes sitting between
them, accused each other of low blows, hypocrisy and childishness.
As throughout most of the weeks since the campaign moved south, key
issue differences on the tax system, federal spending and budget
surpluses were subsumed in often personal charges and
countercharges.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads filled the airwaves, harsh campaign calls poured
into homes and quickly retooled fliers landed in mail boxes and on
windshields outside politically active churches.
</P>
<P>
   McCain withdrew his negative television commercials for the
final week, but not before the campaign became one of the nastiest
in South Carolina history.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists fear that the South Carolina campaign may
be best remembered for the sniping video footage that it has
bequeathed to Democrats for use in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, shocked by his poor showing in New Hampshire, arrived in
South Carolina looking almost befuddled, an unaccustomed state for
the usually super-confident Texan. After a huddle two weekends ago
with top aides in Austin, he emerged as a combative competitor,
sounding on the stump like a circuit preacher. And he had a new
slogan _ ``A reformer with results'' _ intended to show that McCain
wasn't the only guy in the race with new ideas and that Bush was
the only candidate with a record of executive achievement as the
governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to prove he had fire in the belly,'' said White. ``He
had to show he had more than `inevitability.' The more clearly
George Bush got his message out there, ... the better he did.''
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates kept up their pleas for voters to turn out
even as the polls opened. Bush and McCain both predicted victory in
campaign-closing appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to win,'' Bush said as he breakfasted on
pancakes and bacon at Tommy's Country Ham House in Greenville, the
upstate hub of conservative Republicans at the heart of his South
Carolina campaign. ``The last couple of days, there's been an
unusual amount of enthusiasm.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush surged to victory in the
South Carolina primary Saturday, reclaiming his spot as the
unmistakable front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination. But Sen. John McCain vowed to persevere, warning that
if Bush was nominated, the Republicans would lose in November.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a record primary turnout, Bush rallied Republicans across
the state, overwhelming McCain's drive to attract independents and
Democrats like those who helped the senator in his stunning victory
in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprisingly combative concession speech here Saturday
night, McCain showed no sign of yielding as the race quickly turns
to contests in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. In a clear stab at
Bush and what he called a ``negative message of fear,'' McCain
declared that he would offer ``a choice between a record of reform
and an empty slogan of reform, a choice between experience and
pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech in Columbia about an hour later, Bush
looked right past the man who had threatened to unhinge his
campaign in New Hampshire nearly three weeks ago and set his sights
on Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina has spoken _ and tonight there are only 263
days more to the end of Clinton-Gore,'' he declared. ``My reform
agenda stands in stark contrast to the current administration.''
</P>
<P>
   His only mention of McCain came near the close of his speech,
when he thanked him for a tough fight and lumped him with Alan
Keyes, the former State Department official who also ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to commend two tough competitors, Senator John McCain
and Ambassador Alan Keyes,'' he said. ``I want to thank their
supporters for their hard work in fighting for a cause in which
they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of election districts reporting at 10:30 p.m.
Saturday, Bush had drawn 253,772 votes (54 percent); McCain had
194,728 (41 percent); and Keyes, 22,255 (5 percent). Bush's support
was wide and deep; he captured the majority of nearly every
demographic group. Most significant, the reformer mantle that he
appropriated from McCain after the senator's stunning triumph in
New Hampshire seems to have paid off. Voters told pollsters
Saturday that they liked Bush's reform message and they suggested
that McCain was too much of an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had staked his prospects on the expectation that
independents and Democrats would flood to the polls and support him
overwhelmingly. Officials estimated that that the turnout was
indeed huge, more than double the 276,000 who voted in the primary
here four years ago. And independents and Democrats did turn out in
larger numbers than in 1996, and they largely backed McCain. Still,
their numbers were not significant enough to carry McCain even
close to Bush, who locked up loyal Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The results were particularly welcomed by Bush because before
New Hampshire he was as much as 20 percentage points ahead of
McCain in polls here; for weeks, the race was neck and neck, with
the senator even outpacing Bush in some surveys. In his speech
Saturday night, McCain looked upbeat, but spoke the words of a
politician unwilling to yield. He even suggested Bush's advertising
barrage was out of bounds. ``I am going to keep fighting clean,''
he said. ``I am going to keep fighting fair.'' McCain's advisers
were even more blunt. They asserted that Bush's hardline
conservative message in South Carolina would put off voters in the
upcoming contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ought to be
congratulated,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director.
``He ran the kind of campaign he needed to win in South Carolina.
But that's not the kind of campaign you need to win the nomination
_ and certainly not the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a telling concession, Rep. Lindsey Graham, McCain's
most prominent supporter in this state, lamented how poorly the
senator had performed among Republicans. ``Our base just fell
apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By winning comfortably here, Bush is better positioned in
Michigan and Arizona, the senator's home state. McCain now faces
enormous pressure to show that his win in New Hampshire was not an
anomaly. But the voting here was particularly distressing for
McCain because South Carolina was one of the few remaining states
where independents and Democrats could vote in the primary. Now,
most of the voting is in states where only Republicans can
participate; and in many of them Bush has the backing of the
governors. Though he limped out of New Hampshire, Bush engineered a
comeback here by displaying a scrappy determination to work for the
nomination that was never apparent in the earlier contests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Throughout last year, Bush swamped his rivals in the polls _
effortlessly it seemed _ and forced most of them to quit the race.
Had McCain won South Carolina, that could may have given him an
important lift that could have led some Bush backers to begin to
defect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush's strong showing came at a price: He overwhelmed McCain
by pouring more than $3 million in an advertising blitz into this
state, and in so doing continued to deplete what had been a flush
treasury. McCain's threat also forced Bush to abandon his
long-promised posture of never stooping to attack commercials. And,
in appealing to conservatives in this state on issues ranging from
abortion to whether the Confederate flag should fly over the state
Capitol, Bush took a sharp turn to the right.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned his strategy of hewing to the middle of the road, a
move that McCain's advisers were quick to note Saturday night could
haunt the governor in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed clear that the barrage of commercials worked to
Bush's advantage. Of the voters who were interviewed Saturday by
Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and the
Associated Press, about a third said they waited until the last
week or so to decide who to vote for, and most of them backed Bush.
Voters were more likely to say that McCain had unfairly attacked
Bush than they were to say that Bush was the one attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartening finding for Bush as the voting moves to a more
varied electorate, Bush won the majority of support of nearly every
demographic group, including men, women, rich and poor, young and
old. Even veterans _ whom McCain had targeted in an all-out turnout
drive _ split their vote between McCain and Bush. More than a third
of voters said they considered themselves members of the religious
right, and more than two-thirds of those voters backed Bush. If
religious conservatives were removed from the mix, McCain would
barely have won.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Bush's drumbeat of reform and
leadership, as well his emphasis on moral values, meant a lot when
voters decided who to support. Although Bush and McCain were viewed
as reformers, Bush was seen by voters as more of one. Voters were
not convinced that McCain has been true to his word on the issue of
campaign finance, a subject Bush hammered McCain on in his
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the voters said McCain says one thing but does
another on campaign finance _ and they voted overwhelmingly for
Bush. Asked what issue played the greatest role in their decision,
voters said it was moral values, and they mostly backed Bush. Among
those who cited Social Security and Medicare, McCain was more
popular. But the issue of tax cuts was low on the list of voters'
priorities, even though Bush made it a centerpiece of his campaign.
Although Bush succeeded in being portrayed as a reformer, McCain
was viewed as a man who stands up for his beliefs. That is the
character trait that voters said they cared most about, and more
than have of those voters backed McCain. Even so, voters said they
considered Bush more of a leader _ and a more potent rival against
the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, attributed the results
Saturday to a return to the roots of 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
when Bush talked about reforms he favored _ and spoke in specific
terms. He also said voters were impressed with a tougher, more
assertive Bush. ``Both of these guys are going to come out of here
with roughly equivalent positives and negatives, and yet Bush is
going to come out of here with a substantial win,'' Rove said.
``And I think it's because people looked at him and saw how he
handled adversity, saw how he passed through this test, and liked
what they saw.'' He added, ``People wanted to see, if you care
about something, are you somebody who is going to fight for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of voters in the primary were white, more
than half were men and more than four in 10 were over the age of
60. Nearly half said they had college degrees; three in 10 served
in the military. Blacks were virtually nonexistent in the voting,
even though in general elections in 1996 and 1998 they made up a
quarter of the vote. The voters here are more conservative than
most; nearly a quarter described themselves as very conservative,
and another four in 10 called themselves somewhat conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's aides said his father, former President Bush,
was so nervous about the voting that he called them several times
to find out the latest intelligence. Rove said he alerted Gov. Bush
about the encouraging exit polls Saturday afternoon and then called
the candidate's father to brief him. The former president, Rove
said, uttered the word ``relieved.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

STAGGERED BUT DEFIANT, MCCAIN TAKES AIM AT MICHIGAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. _ John McCain was staggered by a hard
right to the chin in South Carolina, but he remained on his feet
Saturday as he headed to Michigan, where he needs to bounce back
Tuesday to keep his presidential hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding defiant, the Arizona senator vowed to continue his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulating George W. Bush on his victory, McCain also
advised the Texas governor to get a good night's rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to need it, my friends, for we have just begun to
fight, and I cannot wait for the next round,'' McCain told his
cheering supporters before leaving South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign had received a strong boost from his
decisive Feb. 1 victory over Bush in New Hampshire. But his loss in
this more conservative state, where his maverick style met stiff
opposition from religious fundamentalists and most of the
Republican establishment, transferred the momentum for the
Republican nomination back to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rediscovered political life also may rejuvenate his own
fund-raising and cool McCain's ability to raise cash before a rash
of key coast-to-coast primaries within the next three weeks,
beginning Tuesday in Michigan and McCain's home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has raised about $70 million, holds a huge lead in
fund-raising but already has spent more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) has to win decisively in Michigan. It can't be
close,'' said Jeffrey Tulis, a government professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Schwarz of Battle Creek, McCain's Michigan
chairman, welcomed the opportunity to help put the senator's
campaign back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Governor Bush's negative attack strategy may have worked
in South Carolina, Michigan is different,'' Schwarz said. ``Voters
here in Michigan expect a thoughtful issues-based discussion, not a
Dixie mud brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he flew north Saturday night for a
middle-of-the-night rally in Dearborn, Mich., McCain faced more bad
news. His once-strong lead over Bush in Michigan has evaporated,
and the two are now in a statistical tie, according to a poll
published in today's editions of the Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey showed McCain with a nine-point lead in
Michigan about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent poll indicated McCain has a huge lead in Arizona,
a state he also must win, mainly because he is expected to carry
his home state. But Bush has been endorsed by a number of Arizona
officeholders, including Republican Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Covington, a political science professor at the University
of Iowa, said a victory in Arizona wouldn't necessarily do McCain
much good but a loss in his home state could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Covington said a loss in Michigan, the most populous state yet
to hold a nominating primary, may not end McCain's campaign on the
spot but would be ``more of an indicator of how he's going to do on
Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Tuesday lineup March 7 includes primaries in numerous
states, including California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also predicted that his campaign would become
unstoppable if he won in South Carolina. But that wasn't to be,
thanks in large part to a heavy turnout of religious and social
conservatives, who, according to early exit polls, voted for Bush
by a 3-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   McCain indicated that he will deliver the same message in
Michigan, where the Republican establishment headed by Gov. John
Engler is strongly backing Bush, much like most of the Republican
powers in South Carolina supported the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Tulis, the UT Austin professor, said Michigan _ with its mix of
Republicans, Democrats and independents _ could prove particularly
important in deciding the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that veterans in South Carolina split their
votes between Bush and McCain, despite McCain's strong overtures to
former military people. The former Vietnam War POW urged a veterans
group in Greenville on Saturday to make ``one more mission for me''
and turn out their vote.

PRIVATE SCHOOL COMPANY IS BEING WATCHED ACROSS THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Tesseract Group calls its academically rigorous
and high-priced private schools ``Harvards for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents at the company's Ahwatukee campus say it has seemed more
like an impoverished inner-city school lately.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its nearly $8,000-a-year tuition, the 2-year-old school
hasn't had enough money for classroom supplies, parents told
Tesseract's top executive Thursday night at a sometimes emotional
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Money has been so tight that the school couldn't afford the
postage to mail report cards home recently.
</P>
<P>
   And the school has been operating all year without a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract's crisis is being watched closely nationwide for what
it says about the future of for-profit public schools and charter
schools, two of the biggest developments in education over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed. I'm truly embarrassed,'' John Golle, founder,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Tesseract Group, told
parents at Thursday's meeting. ``I promise that the problems will
be fixed immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Golle, the man credited with creating the for-profit school
industry, has been making a lot of promises and apologies lately.
</P>
<P>
   After $14 million in losses over the past two years, Tesseract
is selling assets and shedding staff. Its stock, which peaked at
$48.50 a share in 1993, is now worth pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of its 6,000 students are being assured that Tesseract's
private, charter and pre-elementary schools will stay open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tesseract is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we tried to grow too fast, too soon without
enough capital,'' Golle said. ``It didn't work. It was poor
management execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst may not be over: A change in state law will cost
Tesseract's charter schools $6 million in state funding, or 16
percent of the company's 1999 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, charter school supporters are skittish about
Tesseract's problems,'' said Mary Gifford, director of the center
for market-based education at the Goldwater Institute and a member
of the state Board for Charter Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said Arizona's charter school movement, the largest in
the nation, with more than 360 schools, ``is strong enough to
endure this.'' Ten percent of the charter schools are run by
for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mary Hartley, D-northwest Phoenix, said Tesseract's
problems foreshadow what's eventually going to happen to other
for-profit charter school companies in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They eventually are going to have the same experiences,''
Hartley said, adding that such schools have to cut corners to make
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale-based Tesseract, formerly based in Minnesota and
known as Education Alternatives Inc., shook up the education
establishment in the early 1990s when it was hired to manage
failing public schools in Dade County, Fla.; Hartford, Conn.; and
Baltimore. It was the first private, for-profit company to take
over a public school system. &QL; 
Tough industry
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was less than successful, however, and Tesseract
no longer has contracts to run traditional public schools. Even so,
the company's experience opened the door to a new industry that
continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen for-profit ``education management organizations''
operate traditional public schools and charter schools across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them also are losing money. Edison Schools, the largest
such company, lost $38 million last year and is projecting losses
of close to $60 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts and industry executives say the business is
capital- and labor-intensive and that profit margins are razor
thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of money to get these things started,'' said
Bill Coats, founder of the Leona Group, a privately held Michigan
company that runs charter schools in Detroit and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Coats, who plans to open a separate Arizona company soon to
oversee the Leona Group's 13 schools here, said his firm has
succeeded by growing slowly and watching its cash flow carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to generate as much cash as you spend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Bailey, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch who
follows Edison, said she doesn't expect Tesseract's problems to
hurt the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question there are some lessons to be learned from
a pioneer,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Merrill Lynch analysts are predicting that
for-profit companies could capture as much as 10 percent of the
$360 billion now being spent annually on public schools. &QL; 
Tesseract's future
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tesseract will be part of that growth is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financial problems stem from a variety of factors,
some of them out of the company's control, said Golle, who retired
as CEO three months ago only to return after a management shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spending spurt, including the purchase of the
Sunrise preschool chain for $13.5 million in 1997 and the opening
of several charter schools and two new private schools, contributed
to the tight finances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract poured $5 million into two new West Valley charter
schools last year, expecting to be reimbursed by the developer. But
the money never materialized, and one of the schools sits
unfinished, mired in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Golle said the company's delayed second-quarter earnings report,
which will be released this week, will show a positive cash flow at
all of its school sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is behind us,'' Golle said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Tesseract parents are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a comedy of errors,'' said Michael Chilton, who has
a daughter in fourth grade at the private Ahwatukee school. ``I
don't understand how they think the same people who caused the
problems are going to fix them now.'' &QL; 
More bad news
</P>
<P>
   There still are some storm clouds on the horizon. Tesseract's
state funding for its charter schools will decrease by nearly $6
million, about half of this year's state funding, after June 30,
when Arizona's formula for funding pupil transportation changes.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows charter schools that are sponsored by traditional
public school districts to charge the state up to $1.95 per mile
for transportation, either for busing students or reimbursing
parents for driving their own kids.
</P>
<P>
   But some schools have abused the system by giving parents as
little as 5 cents a mile while collecting the entire $1.95 from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract, whose charter schools are sponsored by the Snowflake
Unified District in northern Arizona, is collecting $6 million in
transportation funds this year, or about $4,400 a student.
</P>
<P>
   After June 30, charter schools will get a flat rate of $174 per
student for transportation funding. If their enrollment remains the
same, Tesseract's charter schools will qualify for just $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the impact is going to be,'' Golle said.

UCLA NO MATCH FOR ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - It was easy to see this coming, especially for
those who witnessed the final minutes of UCLA's practice Friday
afterno on at McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   The workout didn't so much end as fizzle. After shooting free
throws, several players wandered to nearby gymnastics equipment for
a few laughs. Jerome Moiso and Ray Young tumbled. Ryan Bailey tried
vaulting - he's no Mary Lou - and Dan Gadzuric howled.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Moiso was asked if the two-hour workout had
been productive.
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With preparation like that, it's little wonder UCLA committed 17
turnovers in the first half, played invisible defense and watched
No. 4 Arizona steam to a 99-84 victory before 14,532 Saturday in
McKale that was much worse than the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats jumped to a 21-point halftime lead and extended it
to 25 midway through the second half before play turned ragged.
They dominated with two reserves playing major minutes and without
center Loren Woods (back spasms), the leading candidate for Pac-10
player of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, UCLA appeared less prepared to face Arizona than it
did Arizona State, which beat the Bruins by 29 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get swept by 20 points in the desert, it works on
your character and it hurts,'' UCLA forward Rico Hines said.
``Nobody's used to losing. We're asking ourselves, `What's going
on? What's wrong?' We just have to go back to the basics when we
get to practice Monday. You begin to question how good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an easy answer for that: not very.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have lost six of their last seven games, their worst
skid since 1984, when they lost six of seven late in the year and
did not make the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They are two defeats from their first losing record in
conference play since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, they set a school record for most points allowed
in back-to-back games (203).
</P>
<P>
   And here's the biggie: at 13-11 overall and 4-8 in conference,
they must win five of their last six to reach the 18-victory
plateau that probably would secure an NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins still have a one-game margin for error, which means
they don't have to win at Stanford in two weeks. However, they must
beat the Oregon and Washington schools in Pauley Pavilion, then win
at Cal. Possible? Sure. Probable? Not the way they're playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to forget this loss and get four of our next
six or five of our next six,'' said forward Jason Kapono, who led
the Bruins with 27 points. ``We've got to squeak out some wins some
way.''
</P>
<P>
   First, they must find their passion. They didn't have it
Thursday and they didn't have it Saturday. They let Arizona reserve
forwards Justin Wessel and Luke Walton push them around in the low
post. They were beaten to loose balls. They were beaten up and down
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps losing seven games by 12 points or more has crushed
their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess losing all those games...they look kind of frustrated,
'' Arizona forward Michael Wright said. ``Some of them didn't seem
to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also must make better use of their practice time.
Instead of preparing for Arizona's offense, coach Steve Lavin
focused on correcting mistakes in Friday's workout. Whatever he
said didn't register, because the Bruins committed 17 turnovers in
the first half and took more bad shots than an intramural team.
Arizona turned both the bad shots and the turnovers into easy
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the first half is when we lost the game,'' Lavin said.
``We didn't have the necessary poise and composure. We had a lot of
unforced (turnovers). We turn the ball over at such a rapid rate
that we can't set our defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two biggest things are turnovers and shot selection. We
don't even get a chance to play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona devoted its 75-minute practice to UCLA's
attack. Coach Lute Olson instructed his players to overplay the
passing lanes, deny entry passes into the post and double-team UCLA
forward Moiso whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats executed perfectly, smothering Moiso (five points)
and intercepting passes all over the court. (Point guard Jason
Gardner had seven steals.) Quicker, tougher and better prepared,
Arizona never ne eded Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The coaches) said it was a 50-50 chance (Woods would play),''
said Arizona guard Gilbert Arenas, a Grant High alum who scored 23
points Saturday. ``We just thought we had to go out there and play
harder.''

S.C. MAY GIVE BUSH ARIZONA BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ George W. Bush's solid win in South Carolina could
give him a boost in Arizona's Republican primary on Tuesday, said
Jaime Molera, an aide to Gov. Jane Hull, Bush's top supporter in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this gives Bush a shot,'' Molera said. `But it will be
tough, no doubt,'' he added, noting McCain's comfortable lead in
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Sue Gerard, R-Phoenix, a McCain supporter,
acknowledged that she was disappointed by Saturday's result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought McCain would have a strong showing in South
Carolina,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard also said Bush ran so far to the right to win South
Carolina that he will lose support among the GOP mainstream in
other parts of the country as the primary season continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago, Bush was considered to be a moderate
Republican,'' Gerard said. Now he's far-right. It seems to me he's
just telling people what they want to hear. That's one of the
reasons I don't support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix public opinion pollster Earl de Berge said he didn't
think the South Carolina defeat will have a strong effect on
McCain's prospects elsewhere. He cited the ``intensely
conservative'' character of the GOP in South Carolina and the
strong role played there by the Religious Right, which came out
strong for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is always: Does it deter other people from voting,
will it make them think that they've lost and there is no point in
going forward,'' de Berge said. ``I don't see that coming out of
this. I think the troops will rally.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate President Brenda Burns said McCain should not be
discouraged by Saturday's result.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that so much support has turned toward John,
I expect he will have a strong showing here and that it will be a
great launching pad for him for March 7,'' said Burns, citing the
date of this year's Super Tuesday cluster of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush was the clear front-runner from the beginning, and John
was barely a recognizable name around the country,'' she said.
``Now, there is virtually no one who hasn't heard of him, and he is
generating a tremendous amount of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Molera said he expects Bush's surge will continue, in part
because of negative Republican reaction to the McCain campaign's
efforts to appeal to Democratic and Independent voters. Democrats
and Independents played a major role in McCain's double-digit
victory in New Hampshire on Feb. 1 and helped McCain in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are angry that McCain is using Democrats to try to
win Republican primaries,'' Molera said. ``I think they'll say,
`Wait a minute. We need a real Republican candidate to have a clear
choice against Gore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard called McCain's campaign good for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really exciting,'' she said, noting that until
recently it appeared inevitable that Bush would emerge from the
crowded primary field to carry the GOP standard in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone should ever be anointed,'' Gerard said.
``A few months ago, nobody thought McCain had much of a chance. But
now it's just Bush and MCain, and you don't hear those other names
any more.'' &QL;

MCCAIN FOCUSES ON MICHIGAN VOTE; VICTORY IN ARIZONA APPEARS
ASSURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ After spending most of his money in the New
Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, John McCain moves into the
relatively uncharted waters of Michigan, where George W. Bush has
an organizational armada lying in wait.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of what happens in Michigan, McCain's candidacy
has a life raft in the Arizona primary on Tuesday, the same day as
Michigan's.
</P>
<P>
   Because polls indicate McCain has a commanding lead in his home
state, he is concentrating instead on the Midwestern state.
</P>
<P>
   He was to fly to Michigan on Saturday night for a rally in
Dearborn after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will hold rallies and town hall meetings all over
Michigan, and he won't come to Arizona until Monday night. He will
remain in Phoenix for Tuesday's voting.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan may not be as conservative as South Carolina, and that
could help McCain because the newly re-established front-runner,
George W. Bush, has staked out the party's right wing. McCain
surged in the polls in Michigan after he beat Bush in New Hampshire
on Feb. 1, creating the prospect of a tight race, maybe the closest
one yet.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain will have to overcome a huge organizational
disadvantage by relying more than ever on his staples: positive
media coverage and lots of personal campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the endorsements last year of Michigan Gov. John
Engler, five of the six Republicans in the Michigan congressional
delegation (Steve Forbes won the other), and the lion's share of
the state GOP legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the task before McCain was evident in a visit last
year to Michigan: Not a single member of Congress or the state
Legislature was in his traveling party. During his travels, McCain
sat in the back of a sports utility vehicle with a couple of
advisers and some ham-and-cheese sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has since picked up a smattering of official GOP support,
and his poll numbers surged after New Hampshire, apparently because
Michigan voters believed he had a serious chance. It remains to be
seen whether McCain's South Carolina loss on Saturday will dampen
that enthusiasm for his candidacy in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up right now, so depending upon what happens after
today, we start in a very good position in Michigan'' because of
the success in New Hampshire, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis
told ``The Arizona Republic'' Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With only three days between primaries, McCain won't have the
luxury of being able to hold scores of town meetings as he did in
New Hampshire. Voters in that state got to know him intimately, and
his small-town political style worked well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis sees a positive side to the shortness of time
before the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that Bush doesn't have the time to put down the
kind of negative campaigning in Michigan that he has been
performing here (in South Carolina) for the past 18 days,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain stumbles in Michigan, he may be in danger of
stalling out just before the crucial California primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   A loss in Michigan would likely mean ``he is going to lose some
of the power in the argument that he can bring new people into the
party, that he can rebuild the Reagan coalition,'' said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont University in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an awful lot of establishment Republicans in
California who will be breathing a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the South Carolina primary, Bush motivated
Republicans to go to the polls by claiming that Independent and
Democratic supporters of McCain were trying to infiltrate the GOP
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp has also made that argument in Michigan, which
allows crossover votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be useful to Bush in that he can then go into Michigan
and make the same pitch: Don't surrender the Republican Party,''
Bebitch Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief architects of Bush's triumph in South Carolina
predicted that it will only strengthen the campaign's second line
of defense in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to boost him in Michigan. For that matter, it's
going to boost him in Arizona,'' former South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell said. ``I think you are going to now see McCain diminish
as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the only certain victory on the horizon is back
home, where the only question about Arizona's primary is the margin
of a McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
   In an ``Arizona Republic'' poll released Friday, McCain led by
23 percentage points. Unlike South Carolina and Michigan, Arizona's
primary is closed to crossover voters. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush surged to victory in the
South Carolina primary Saturday, reclaiming his spot as the
unmistakable front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination. But Sen. John McCain vowed to persevere, warning that
if Bush was nominated, the Republicans would lose in November.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a record primary turnout, Bush rallied Republicans across
the state, overwhelming McCain's drive to attract independents and
Democrats like those who helped the senator in his stunning victory
in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprisingly combative concession speech here Saturday
night, McCain showed no sign of yielding as the race quickly turns
to contests in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday. In a clear stab at
Bush and what he called a ``negative message of fear,'' McCain
declared that he would offer ``a choice between a record of reform
and an empty slogan of reform, a choice between experience and
pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech in Columbia about an hour later, Bush
looked right past the man who had threatened to unhinge his
campaign in New Hampshire nearly three weeks ago and set his sights
on Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina has spoken _ and tonight there are only 263
days more to the end of Clinton-Gore,'' he declared. ``My reform
agenda stands in stark contrast to the current administration.''
</P>
<P>
   His only mention of McCain came near the close of his speech,
when he thanked him for a tough fight and lumped him with Alan
Keyes, the former State Department official who also ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to commend two tough competitors, Senator John McCain
and Ambassador Alan Keyes,'' he said. ``I want to thank their
supporters for their hard work in fighting for a cause in which
they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of election districts reporting at 10:30 p.m.
Saturday, Bush had drawn 253,772 votes (54 percent); McCain had
194,728 (41 percent); and Keyes, 22,255 (5 percent). Bush's support
was wide and deep; he captured the majority of nearly every
demographic group. Most significant, the reformer mantle that he
appropriated from McCain after the senator's stunning triumph in
New Hampshire seems to have paid off. Voters told pollsters
Saturday that they liked Bush's reform message and they suggested
that McCain was too much of an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had staked his prospects on the expectation that
independents and Democrats would flood to the polls and support him
overwhelmingly. Officials estimated that that the turnout was
indeed huge, more than double the 276,000 who voted in the primary
here four years ago. And independents and Democrats did turn out in
larger numbers than in 1996, and they largely backed McCain. Still,
their numbers were not significant enough to carry McCain even
close to Bush, who locked up loyal Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The results were particularly welcomed by Bush because before
New Hampshire he was as much as 20 percentage points ahead of
McCain in polls here; for weeks, the race was neck and neck, with
the senator even outpacing Bush in some surveys. In his speech
Saturday night, McCain looked upbeat, but spoke the words of a
politician unwilling to yield. He even suggested Bush's advertising
barrage was out of bounds. ``I am going to keep fighting clean,''
he said. ``I am going to keep fighting fair.'' McCain's advisers
were even more blunt. They asserted that Bush's hardline
conservative message in South Carolina would put off voters in the
upcoming contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ought to be
congratulated,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director.
``He ran the kind of campaign he needed to win in South Carolina.
But that's not the kind of campaign you need to win the nomination
_ and certainly not the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a telling concession, Rep. Lindsey Graham, McCain's
most prominent supporter in this state, lamented how poorly the
senator had performed among Republicans. ``Our base just fell
apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By winning comfortably here, Bush is better positioned in
Michigan and Arizona, the senator's home state. McCain now faces
enormous pressure to show that his win in New Hampshire was not an
anomaly. But the voting here was particularly distressing for
McCain because South Carolina was one of the few remaining states
where independents and Democrats could vote in the primary. Now,
most of the voting is in states where only Republicans can
participate; and in many of them Bush has the backing of the
governors. Though he limped out of New Hampshire, Bush engineered a
comeback here by displaying a scrappy determination to work for the
nomination that was never apparent in the earlier contests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Throughout last year, Bush swamped his rivals in the polls _
effortlessly it seemed _ and forced most of them to quit the race.
Had McCain won South Carolina, that could may have given him an
important lift that could have led some Bush backers to begin to
defect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush's strong showing came at a price: He overwhelmed McCain
by pouring more than $3 million in an advertising blitz into this
state, and in so doing continued to deplete what had been a flush
treasury. McCain's threat also forced Bush to abandon his
long-promised posture of never stooping to attack commercials. And,
in appealing to conservatives in this state on issues ranging from
abortion to whether the Confederate flag should fly over the state
Capitol, Bush took a sharp turn to the right.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned his strategy of hewing to the middle of the road, a
move that McCain's advisers were quick to note Saturday night could
haunt the governor in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed clear that the barrage of commercials worked to
Bush's advantage. Of the voters who were interviewed Saturday by
Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and the
Associated Press, about a third said they waited until the last
week or so to decide who to vote for, and most of them backed Bush.
Voters were more likely to say that McCain had unfairly attacked
Bush than they were to say that Bush was the one attacking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartening finding for Bush as the voting moves to a more
varied electorate, Bush won the majority of support of nearly every
demographic group, including men, women, rich and poor, young and
old. Even veterans _ whom McCain had targeted in an all-out turnout
drive _ split their vote between McCain and Bush. More than a third
of voters said they considered themselves members of the religious
right, and more than two-thirds of those voters backed Bush. If
religious conservatives were removed from the mix, McCain would
barely have won.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Bush's drumbeat of reform and
leadership, as well his emphasis on moral values, meant a lot when
voters decided who to support. Although Bush and McCain were viewed
as reformers, Bush was seen by voters as more of one. Voters were
not convinced that McCain has been true to his word on the issue of
campaign finance, a subject Bush hammered McCain on in his
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the voters said McCain says one thing but does
another on campaign finance _ and they voted overwhelmingly for
Bush. Asked what issue played the greatest role in their decision,
voters said it was moral values, and they mostly backed Bush. Among
those who cited Social Security and Medicare, McCain was more
popular. But the issue of tax cuts was low on the list of voters'
priorities, even though Bush made it a centerpiece of his campaign.
Although Bush succeeded in being portrayed as a reformer, McCain
was viewed as a man who stands up for his beliefs. That is the
character trait that voters said they cared most about, and more
than have of those voters backed McCain. Even so, voters said they
considered Bush more of a leader _ and a more potent rival against
the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, attributed the results
Saturday to a return to the roots of 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
when Bush talked about reforms he favored _ and spoke in specific
terms. He also said voters were impressed with a tougher, more
assertive Bush. ``Both of these guys are going to come out of here
with roughly equivalent positives and negatives, and yet Bush is
going to come out of here with a substantial win,'' Rove said.
``And I think it's because people looked at him and saw how he
handled adversity, saw how he passed through this test, and liked
what they saw.'' He added, ``People wanted to see, if you care
about something, are you somebody who is going to fight for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of voters in the primary were white, more
than half were men and more than four in 10 were over the age of
60. Nearly half said they had college degrees; three in 10 served
in the military. Blacks were virtually nonexistent in the voting,
even though in general elections in 1996 and 1998 they made up a
quarter of the vote. The voters here are more conservative than
most; nearly a quarter described themselves as very conservative,
and another four in 10 called themselves somewhat conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's aides said his father, former President Bush,
was so nervous about the voting that he called them several times
to find out the latest intelligence. Rove said he alerted Gov. Bush
about the encouraging exit polls Saturday afternoon and then called
the candidate's father to brief him. The former president, Rove
said, uttered the word ``relieved.''

<P>
   &UR; WOMAN: An Intimate Biography &LR;  By Natalie Angier. Anchor, $15. A
Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer for The New York Times
conducts a rapturous tour of the female body and its intricate
workings, drawing on evolutionary theory, science, literature,
medicine and history. ```Woman' is a tour de force, a wonderful,
entertaining and informative book,'' Abraham Verghese wrote in The
New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST INTO UPPER EAST: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi &LR; 
By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Counterpoint, $14. These stories by a
connoisseur of divided souls, written over the last 20 years or so
and set in gilded Manhattan co-ops and expensive Indian villas,
focus on rootless characters whose inner longings are at odds with
their protective coloration. In 1998 the reviewer Deborah Mason
called the author ``a spellbinding urban fabulist'' and said ``each
story reveals Jhabvala's mastery of the form.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; OUT OF INDIA: Selected Stories &LR; 
($14), a collection of Jhabvala's early tales that explore the
domestic lives of middle-class Indians and the spiritual yearning
of Westerners who flock to often-bogus ashrams. In 1986 in The New
York Times Book Review, Rumer Godden said the stories display ``her
hallmark of balance, subtlety, wry humor and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FORTRESS AMERICA: The American Military and the Consequences of
Peace &LR;  By William Greider. PublicAffairs, $10. A journalist
searches for the ``peace dividend'' that was supposed to follow the
Cold War, and discovers instead a bloated military establishment
dedicated to building an increasingly chaotic and obsolescent
arsenal. This ``is the kind of book that leaves a reader agitated
and indignant, and should by all rights ignite an urgent national
debate,'' James B. Stewart wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG &LR;  By Andre Dubus III. Vintage
Contemporaries, $14. In this tale of good people gone crazy, three
characters collide in Pacific suburbia: an Iranian immigrant, a
California woman who loses her home to him in an auction, and a
deputy sheriff who comes between them. In 1999 the reviewer Bill
Sharp admired the novel's ``highly visual, descriptive language.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the
Quest for the Ultimate Theory &LR;  By Brian Greene. Vintage, $15. A
Columbia professor makes a case for string theory, which posits a
universe with 10 curled-up dimensions and melds quantum mechanics
with the general theory of relativity. ``In the great tradition of
physicists writing for the masses, `The Elegant Universe' sets a
standard that will be hard to beat,'' George Johnson wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEONS, BLACK HOLES, AND QUANTUM FOAM: A Life in Physics &LR; , by
John Archibald Wheeler with Kenneth Ford (Norton, $14.95), is an
account of the Princeton physicist's long career (he worked on the
Manhattan Project) and highly regarded theoretical work on atomic
nuclei and gravitation (he coined the term ``black hole'').
``Difficult concepts that defy common sense come briskly to life,''
Michael Riordan wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXTREMITIES: Stories &LR;  By Kathe Koja. Four Walls Eight Windows,
$13.95. In these unsettling tales, a survivor of a plane crash
changes into a bird and a woman transforms herself into a plant to
remain near her boyfriend. ``Koja's provocative story lines and
evocative prose combine reality with invention, the supernatural
with the everyday,'' Christopher Atamian wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP &LR;  By Michael Lesy. University of New
Mexico, $29.95. This 1973 chronicle of a rural Wisconsin town
ravaged by depression, madness and epidemic disease at the turn of
the century combines many haunting old photographs with local
newspaper accounts. ``The result is an impressive example of the
poetry of history,'' William H. Gass wrote. ``This original work
makes us deeply feel one form that misery has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALLAN STEIN &LR;  By Matthew Stadler. Grove, $12. A young teacher
visits Paris in search of information about Gertrude Stein's nephew
and becomes obsessed with a 15-year-old boy. ``Stadler demonstrates
that he is among the handful of first-rate young American
novelists, one with a wide reach and a quirky, elegant pen,''
Edmund White wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH OSSIE AND RUBY: In This Life Together &LR;  By Ossie Davis and
Ruby Dee. Quill/Morrow, $14. The actors reflect on their
childhoods, the black experience in American theater and the many
social causes they have championed during their more than 50 years
together. In 1998 the reviewer Victor Navasky called this ``a
conversation studded with anecdotes ... and also some inspiration,
wisdom and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MISTRESS &LR;  By Philippe Tapon. Plume, $12.95. Emile Bastien
is a French doctor living comfortably with his mistress in
Nazi-occupied Paris until his affair, his family and his livelihood
are threatened by betrayal and perilous wartime allegiances. Last
year the reviewer Liam Callanan called this ``a fine, wicked'' and
``altogether enjoyable'' novel.

BUSH TOPS MCCAIN IN S.C.; WIN HALTS SENATOR'S MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ With the help of religious conservatives, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush regained his political footing, brushing back
John McCain's challenge on Saturday with a 13-point victory in the
South Carolina GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decisive victory, which followed McCain's upset win in
New Hampshire on Feb. 1, didn't settle the outcome of the race by
any stretch, but it halted McCain's momentum heading into Tuesday's
Arizona and Michigan primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pumped his fist and told cheering supporters at a North
Charleston convention center that he would fight on and that ``you
don't have to win every skirmish'' to win the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But while his demeanor was upbeat, McCain's words _ indirectly
cutting at Bush _ suggested a belief that the Texan won by running
a dirty campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Without attaching Bush's name to his harshest accusations,
McCain variously sought to link his rival to ``the negative message
of fear'' and ``an empty slogan of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take the low road to the highest office in
the land,'' McCain said. ``I want the presidency in the best way,
not the worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has said his foreign-policy credentials and war
record make him the best qualified candidate, said the race
amounted to ``a choice between experience and pretense,'' adding
that ``I'm a real reformer . . . I don't just say it _ I live it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of McCain's speech stunned Bush's aides, who accused
McCain of demonstrating a ``lack of graciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager.
``The tone, the lack of graciousness. I think we saw the real
McCain tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who suffered an overwhelming defeat to McCain in New
Hampshire, badly needed to re-establish his credentials as the
front-runner with a victory in the Palmetto state.
</P>
<P>
   He did so by defeating McCain by 11 points, 53 percent to 42
percent. Alan Keyes received 5 percent. More than 600,000 people
voted, twice the number who have ever participated in the South
Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ignited a record turnout, a huge outpouring of Republicans
from all across the political spectrum,'' Bush told a packed
ballroom of supporters. ``Tonight is the beginning of the end of
the Clinton-Gore era.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully a third of GOP voters who went to the polls Saturday
called themselves part of the Religious Right, and Bush won
two-thirds of their votes. Bush also drew strong support from
another core GOP group, abortion-rights foes, who made up 60
percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the key elements of the McCain strategy
failed him. The Arizona senator split the veterans' vote down the
middle with Bush. McCain had been banking on a much stronger
showing in that group.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a majority in virtually every demographic group, with
McCain getting an edge only among those who described themselves as
liberals, low-income or over 75 years old. Democrats were eligible
to vote, but not as many showed up to vote for McCain as the
Arizonan had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we fell a little short tonight, our crusade grows
stronger,'' McCain said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   When the results came in, McCain called Bush to congratulate him
in a phone call that lasted less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides were also elated and relieved at the outcome,
thankful that the midcourse correction made by their candidate paid
off.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign manager attributed the South Carolina win in
part to the ability to make quick changes to counter McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about it endlessly, used the word reform endlessly,
and I think that was a big, big part of it,'' Rove said. ``The
second part of it was Bush saying, `I'm not going to allow myself
to be defined.' We didn't allow him to define us here (on Social
Security).''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate also ran ads responding to claims by McCain that
Bush would spend nothing to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at him and saw how he handled adversity. They
saw how he passed through this test and liked what they saw,'' Rove
said. ``I think they saw somebody who was willing to set the record
straight with regard to what he was proposing and what he was
advocating and willing to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said in an interview that
Bush's negative ads prevented South Carolina from seeing the real
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what they (South Carolina voters) got to see was the
negative campaign that George Bush ran. They had to cut through all
this smoke that Bush put out, and that was what obfuscated the view
of John McCain,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's team claimed that part of their victory could be
pinned on McCain's decision to go on the attack after weeks of
invoking the Republican party's 11th Commandment against negative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was telling (that) John McCain . . . said
something like, `When your enemy hits you, you hit him back even
harder to make them know there will be a price to be paid,' '' Rove
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the people of South Carolina, Republicans or
Americans in general, like this attitude that you treat your
political opponents or competitors as enemies. We've had seven
years of the politics of personal destruction where, if you oppose
somebody, they are your enemy.'' &QL;
