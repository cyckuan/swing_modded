ORIOLES DEFEAT METS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Sidney Ponson pitched a six-hitter to power the
Baltimore Orioles past Al Leiter and the New York Mets, 4-1, at
Camden Yards on Tuesday night. The 22-year-old right-hander also
prevented the Mets from pulling within two games of the first-place
Atlanta Braves for the first time since June 25.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another noteworthy fact: the complete game was
Ponson's fifth, which leads the American League. The Mets are still
looking for their first. They are the only team in the major
leagues without a complete game this season, and if that continues
it could prove quite taxing on their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get one, maybe just for our own psyche,''
Leiter said. ``We're the only one. But you never want to feel like
`you got to, have to' or `we need to' because when you think that
way you won't get it. And I've thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Leiter think about it before Tuesday night's start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly a year since the Mets' last complete game, by
Leiter last Sept. 4. Manager Bobby Valentine said late Monday
night, ``We're going to get one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking after the rookie right-hander Octavio Dotel fell
two innings short. Dotel, Valentine said, was a logical candidate
to toss the team's first complete game this year. So, Valentine
said, was Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   But not after it took Leiter 30 pitches to complete the first
inning on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those nights,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored a run in the first without a hit. Rich Amaral
led off with a walk, and Luis Lopez, who was making his first start
at shortstop since May 31, then froze on Mike Bordick's tailor-made
double-play ball. Lopez did not release the ball when he made a
throwing motion to second, and the Orioles had runners on first and
second with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (8-7) recovered to strike out B.J. Surhoff with the
runners in motion. Amaral easily beat Mike Piazza's throw to third,
but he never made it to the bag because Robin Ventura had blocked
it with his left leg. Amaral was livid nonetheless, and so was Ray
Miller, the Baltimore manager, who hurried out to argue and was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   With a man on second and two out, Leiter walked both Albert
Belle and Jeff Conine to load the bases. Then he hit Will Clark in
the side to force in a run. Only when Leiter struck out Charles
Johnson on a full-count pitch did the Mets escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson (9-6), meanwhile, was dealing a 97-mile-an-hour fastball.
With two outs in the third, Rickey Henderson lined a hit over a
leaping Clark at first base. Henderson saw Belle, the right
fielder, loping over for the ball and hustled to beat Belle's throw
for a double. Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a line single up the
middle, and Henderson scampered home to tie the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The run was the 2,062d of Henderson's career, tying him with
Willie Mays for fifth on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied it at 1-1 in the third, but Leiter kept
struggling; he needed to strike out Jerry Hairston Jr. to leave the
bases loaded in the third and preserve the tie. But Ryan Minor
blooped a single into short right-center field for his first hit of
the season to lead off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral followed with a single and Minor took third when Benny
Agbayani muffed the ball in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral stole second, and Bordick then lofted a sacrifice fly to
center to make it 2-1. After Amaral took third on Surhoff's
groundout, up stepped Belle, who had been lustily booed for his
outfield play and then before and after he popped out with a runner
on base in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Belle was booed again as he strode to the plate. The boos did
not last long. On an 0-1 pitch, Belle hit his 20th homer of the
season, and the Orioles led, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter finally made it through the fourth inning, he had
already thrown 98 pitches. After needing nine pitches to toss a
perfect fifth _ the only time he set the side down in order _
Leiter was finished at 107 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And Ponson was still going strong.

ARTHUR KATZ, 91, CREATOR OF CORGI CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Katz, whose Corgi brand of miniature cars thrilled a
generation of children, many of whom became collectors as adults,
died on June 25 near his home in London. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Before Katz introduced the Corgi line in 1956, most die-cast
metal toy cars were fairly crude. Many companies simply painted the
zinc-alloy forms that were pressed from molds and added wheels. But
Katz's engineers and designers added details like plastic
windshields and diamond-crystal headlights as well as gadgets and
gimmicks like spring-mounted wheels and doors and hoods and trunks
that opened.
</P>
<P>
   Corgi's best seller was a model of the sexy Aston Martin DB5
sports car, the auto driven by the James Bond character in the 1964
film ``Goldfinger.'' As in the movie, the Corgi model had rotating
license plates, a steel screen that sprang up to protect the back
windshield from bullets fired by hostile pursuers, hub caps with
Ben Hur-style tire slashers, machine gun turrets that popped out
from behind the headlights, and best of all, an ejection seat that
sent a tiny plastic passenger hurtling skyward through the car's
roof.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the early 1970s, Katz's company, Mettoy Ltd.,
employed 3,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to the factory in Swansea in South Wales,''
said Eugene McKeown, the director of sales at Reeves International
Inc. in Pequannock, N.J., which is the U.S distributor for Corgi.
``It was like General Motors. There were people creating thousands
and thousands of cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz retired in the mid-1970s. By the end of the decade, Mettoy
was in trouble. Britain's high inflation and the soaring value of
its currency had made the company's toys much more expensive than
those of Asian rivals. ``There was no way you could cut your costs
fast enough,'' said Peter Katz, Arthur Katz's son, who was Mettoy's
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Mettoy declared bankruptcy in 1983, as had several other famous
British toy makers, including its rival, Matchbox. A group of its
managers tried to resurrect the company, moving production to
China. They later sold the company to Mattel Inc., which, in turn,
sold it to another management group in 1995. It is now a private
company based in Britain called Corgi Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the demand for toy cars has shrunk, as
children's tastes have switched to action figures and videogames.
Corgi cars are now sold primarily in specialty shops. But there has
been a resurgence in demand among baby boomers the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Corgi cars that sold for $5 and $6 in the 1970s now retail for
$30 to $40 new, while originals from the 1960s and '70s in mint
condition can sell for several hundred dollars. ``Die cast is among
the hottest categories of collectibles right now,'' said Chris
Byrne, editor of Toy Report, a weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Katz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to German parents
in 1908. When he was 12, he and his mother moved to Nuremberg, then
the center of the German toy industry, after his father's death.
Upon completing his schooling and serving an apprenticeship at one
of the city's toy export companies, Katz joined Tipp &AMP; Co., a maker
of pressed-tin toys that was owned by Philip Ullmann, who was his
mother's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, after Hitler swept to power, Katz, who was Jewish and
held a British passport because he was born in South Africa,
emigrated to England. Ullmann joined him there, and together they
founded Mettoy.
</P>
<P>
   The company had a quick start but was soon diverted to war
production. After World War II, Katz began focusing on the export
market. ``He was an extremely good negotiator,'' Peter Katz said,
``which means that he was good at reaching agreements with people
whereby they felt comfortable with it, and the company felt
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Katz is survived by his third wife, Agnes, and
a daughter, Susan Wolff, all of London.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mettoy was never the largest British toy manufacturer,
Katz became the industry's leader, serving as head of the British
Toy Manufacturers' Association in the 1950s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He showed his devotion to his adopted country by naming the
Corgi brand after the breed of dog most favored by the British
Royal family. They, in turn, awarded him the Order of the British
Empire in 1961 and made him a Commander of the British Empire in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more curious episodes in Katz's life, he was
appointed a colonel in the British army in 1946 and dispatched to
Germany to see if there was anything Britain could salvage from
what remained of the German toy industry.
</P>
<P>
   He found little of value but did get the chance to return to
Tipp, which had been expropriated by the Nazis after Ullmann fled
to England.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the pleasure,'' his son recalled, ``of dismissing the
man appointed by the Nazis to run it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr. turned sharply away from
Martha's Vineyard before his plane began plunging toward the sea,
federal investigators said Tuesday, leading several authorities on
aviation to conclude that he had become lost or disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came on the fourth day of a search for the
wrecked plane and the remains of Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette _ a search
that has generated many questions here and in Washington about the
use of federal resources in what could be a fruitless search. In
part, as a result of the new radar information, investigators
warned Tuesday night that they might never find any large pieces of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Tuesday evening, Robert Pearce, who is leading the
investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board, said
radar records are filling in the harrowing details of the last
seven minutes of the flight as Kennedy, 38, and his 33-year-old
wife headed for a family wedding on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said that Kennedy had been headed straight toward
Martha's Vineyard, about 34 miles out and traveling at 5,600 feet,
when the plane began to descend at about 700 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The descent continued for about five minutes to 2,300 feet,
when the airplane was about 20 miles from the airport,'' Pearce
said. ``The airplane started a turn to the right and climbed back
to 2,600 feet. It remained at that altitude for about one minute on
a southeasterly heading. Thirty seconds into the maneuver, the
airplane started a turn to the right and descended at a rapid rate
of descent. The rate of descent may have been greater than 5,000
feet per minute. The last radar return was about 16 miles from the
airport and the altitude indicated 1,100 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kennedy was headed away from the airport when
the plunge began. Pearce would not characterize the information
beyond saying that Kennedy had been on the right path before he
began turning. ``Anything from that would not go to Martha's
Vineyard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barr, the director of the Aviation Safety Program at the
University of Southern California, a leading training center for
accident investigators, said Kennedy apparently lost his way after
making the first turn, then went into a dive as he tried to right
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this getting yourself in a square corner, when you run
out of ideas and experience at the same time,'' said Barr, who was
a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. ``He would have been
looking straight out at the dark ocean on a nearly moonless night.
He probably looked over his right shoulder for lights, then when he
started to sink, he would have been trying to get the nose back to
the horizon, get the wings level and find where he was, all at the
same time. Even for a good pilot, that could produce a death
spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts offered a similar assessment, while cautioning
that it may never be possible to know what happened in the cockpit.
Warren Morningstar, the director of media relations for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said the scenario
``suggests that the pilot was disoriented.'' He said a pilot might
intentionally turn away from his destination to reduce altitude,
but he said Kennedy had been at about the right altitude for his
approach before he began the turns.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could have affected Kennedy's handling of
the plane was his having recently broken an ankle. He had used
crutches for a while, and took a flight instructor on a trip
earlier in the week because he was having difficulty manipulating
the pedals.
</P>
<P>
   The new information is based on an analysis in Washington of
radar data that is being collected from stations along Kennedy's
flight path, including stations in New Jersey, New York,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. So far all the records
reviewed have been on paper, and Pearce said an even more complete
picture might emerge as specialists delve into computerized records
that are being sent to them.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of searching, investigators said no debris has
been salvaged from the ocean floor; the small pieces that have been
found were floating or washed ashore. Pearce said most are interior
cabin pieces, and the largest piece found so far is a three-foot
section of overhead molding. Asked about the likelihood if finding
sizable pieces of wreckage, Pearce said, ``I'm sure you could draw
a conclusion based on the debris that we've been bringing in, which
is fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the search itself, several officials said Tuesday that
the effort was the first to retrieve an aircraft other than for
public safety. While salvages of crashed planes, even at sea, are
common, they are almost always paid for by insurance companies or
by families, according to aviation officials and salvors.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a spokesman acknowledged the unusual nature
of the effort. ``We're taking some reasonable measures beyond what
we might normally do in this instance,'' said Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge
of air crash investigations, Lauren Peduzzi, a spokeswoman, said
that the board has in the past paid for salvage when the board had
an extraordinary reason to discover what happened.
</P>
<P>
   But aviation officials were clear in stating that they are not
undertaking this search because they expect to uncover a generic
flaw in Piper Saratogas of the type Kennedy was flying.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary circumstances the government does nothing to
retrieve such wreckage. The Federal Aviation Administration
provides radar data to help find a wreck, and the Coast Guard will
control marine traffic while private parties pay for salvage.
Airplanes that crash, whether they are operated by private
individuals, corporations or airlines, are almost always salvaged
by the insurance company that covered them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An exception was TWA 800, the Boeing 747 that went down off the
south shore of Long Island three years ago. The airline and its
insurer declined to recover the wreckage, but the National
Transportation Safety Board said the plane had to be raised to
determine the cause of the explosion and to help improve public
safety in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy search is using many of the same ships.
</P>
<P>
   But James O'Dell III, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said that
this was the first time he knew of that his agency had participated
in the salvage of a private plane.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in finding bodies poses an awkward dilemma as Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and other family members try to plan a
funeral or memorial service. The Kennedy family has not requested
that Kennedy be buried with his parents, at the eternal flame in
Arlington National Cemetery, a White House official said Tuesday
afternoon. ``We don't think they are going to ask,'' the official
added, citing informal contacts with members of the family. Because
Kennedy does not qualify for burial in the military cemetery,
interment there would require a presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   As the family waits in seclusion at Hyannis Port, two Navy
ships, two Coast Guard cutters and two research vessels from the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration are being
used in the effort to map the sea off of Martha's Vineyard, using
high-resolution sonar to detect objects with straight edges,
indicating they are manmade. Then 10 divers from the Massachusetts
State Police and 20 from the Navy use those maps to look for
wreckage. But many of the seemingly promising targets turn out to
be things like barrels or fishnets.

STAN DURWOOD'S DOWNTOWN DREAM LIVES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stan Durwood was a giant in the pantheon of Kansas City's
20th-century business greats. What separates the giants of commerce
and industry from the mere greats is that giants change the way the
world works.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Hall was a giant. So is Henry Bloch. Hall changed the way
Americans express their feelings and relate to one another. Bloch
changed the way they deal with their tax obligations. Durwood's
serendipitous discovery of the multiscreen theater concept changed
the way the world watches movies. It's said he helped save the film
industry in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Durwood was of two worlds. In Hollywood circles, the late
head of AMC Entertainment Inc. is considered to be to the
exhibition side of the movie business what such industry lions as
Jack Warner and Darryl Zanuck were to the production side. Many
Kansas Citians probably were unaware of Durwood's iconic Tinseltown
status until they read his posthumous tributes last week.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood never went Hollywood, however, preferring to live and
work in his hometown. The enduring irony of his life is that his
consuming vision for his hometown's downtown business district went
unfulfilled in his lifetime even as much of the growth of his
company was fueled by the spectacular expansion of suburban
America.
</P>
<P>
   His early efforts to keep downtown vibrant included offering
free parking to his patrons. As far as he knew, he was the only
theater operator in America willing to go this far to make downtown
an attractive entertainment venue.
</P>
<P>
   His vision went far beyond his role as an entertainment
impresario, though, which is why many Kansas Citians remember him
more as an aspiring developer than a movie mogul.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s Durwood's downtown dream began to take shape in
the form of what came to be known as the Crosstown Galleria
project. It was a bold plan to create a suburban-style mall in the
central business district.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the project had been viable, the timing was not
fortuitous. The '60s boom gave way to the sputtering economy of the
'70s. As time dragged on without progress, Durwood's critics said
his claim on the project area's development rights had done more
harm than good. The looming prospect of possible condemnation, they
said, discouraged business expansions and improvements in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after his Galleria vision took form, Durwood
relinquished his development rights for the area in a deal with
Executive Hills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown dream never died for Stan Durwood, though. Barely a
decade later, he was back with a $400 million dream for downtown
known as Centertainment. If it happens, it will fulfill Durwood's
vision by creating a complex encompassing entertainment, shopping,
office and residential components. So far, the project remains in
the planning and preparatory stages. With the passing of Durwood,
the question is whether his team will be up to transforming his
ultimate vision into a posthumous reality.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood's yet unfulfilled vision for a downtown renaissance in
his hometown aside, his revered place in film business history is
secure. He was a giant whose influence was global. Business giants
of his stature and accomplishment are rare hereabouts, and getting
rarer.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN DISPUTE OVER MARKETING OF COUNTRY CLUB
PLAZA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ J.C. Nichols will take over the marketing of
the Country Club Plaza in 2002 under a legal settlement with the
Plaza Merchants Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides decided they had bigger things to work on,'' said
Barrett Brady, vice president of Highwoods Properties Inc., which
last year bought Nichols. ``Both sides are glad to get this behind
us and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement concludes a legal battle that began last year
when the merchants filed a lawsuit to stop Nichols' plan to take
over the marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After the association's lawsuit was filed, Highwoods completed
its previously announced purchase of Nichols and its properties,
including the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Nichols will assume the job of marketing
the Plaza on Jan. 1, 2002, Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in the Jackson County, Mo., Courthouse do not
disclose the terms of the settlement. Judge Lee E. Wells signed the
order dismissing the case June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Rose, a lawyer hired by the Plaza Merchants Association,
was on vacation Tuesday and unavailable for comment. Beth Morrison,
executive director of the association, was also on vacation and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were still at odds in January when lawyers made
closing arguments in the case. Wells urged the sides to negotiate a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued through the spring before wrapping up in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols had planned to start a marketing fund in May 1998 that
it would use to advertise the Plaza and sponsor promotions such as
the Christmas lighting ceremony. Nichols planned to collect a fee
from the Plaza merchants to create the marketing program.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing the fund and its own marketing effort, Nichols
planned to assume the duties handled by the Plaza Merchants
Association, an independent group representing store owners in the
famed shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants contended that Nichols wanted to pay too little to
buy the association's Christmas lights and other assets. They added
that Nichols would seize control of $1.7 million in a Plaza gift
certificate account.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said Nichols wouldn't have to pay for the lights and gift
certificate program. In the meantime, Nichols will include a
provision for a marketing fund in its merchant tenant leases and
turn that money over to the association, Brady said.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This summer's Kansas wheat harvest is nearly
over.
</P>
<P>
   Harvesting of the state's hard red winter wheat essentially was
completed over the weekend at a pace just slightly behind that of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Department of Agriculture said the harvest was 99
percent complete as of Sunday, compared with 100 percent a year
ago. A few fields still too muddy for combines were the only ones
left to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Kansas harvest is expected to yield 423.2 million
bushels, compared with 494.9 million a year ago. Across the
country, wheat farmers are expected to harvest 1.7 billion bushels,
compared with 1.94 billion last year. The projections are based on
July 1 conditions. The department will next issue projections on
Aug. 12, based on Aug. 1 conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the leading producer of hard red winter wheat, which
is used for making bread, hamburger buns and similar products.
Texas and Oklahoma also are big producers.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' harvest this year started on schedule, but rain in June
left many fields too muddy to support combines, said Sherri Hand,
agricultural statistician for the Kansas Department of Agriculture.
Last year, farmers were able to begin harvesting earlier than usual
because of favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the quality of this year's Kansas wheat is down from
last year's, largely because of excess moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, a couple of districts have some pretty
sad wheat,'' Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the northeast district, which includes
Leavenworth and Wyandotte counties, none of the wheat crop was
ranked grade one, while 97 percent of the crop was ranked grade
two, Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas farmers, burdened by plummeting prices for wheat and
other grains, planted fewer acres of hard red winter wheat this
year, at 10.7 million. That's down from 11.4 million last year.
Because parts of this year's crop were lost to excess moisture and
hail damage, farmers will end up harvesting wheat from 9.2 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant supplies of wheat in storage bins and slack demand have
combined to drive down prices. The average price for hard red
winter wheat in Kansas has fallen to about $2.12 a bushel, down
from a high of $7 a bushel in May 1996, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is now shifting to corn, where a lack of moisture
recently has caused stress to the Kansas crop. At this point, the
corn crop has been rated 17 percent excellent, 62 percent good and
17 percent fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas soybean crop has been rated 12 percent excellent, 63
percent good and 22 percent fair.

YANKEES DEFEAT EXPOS, 9-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee fans haven't figured out yet what they think
of Roger Clemens, and he hasn't quite figured things out himself
this season. Certainly the Clemens of five Cy Young awards remains
elusive this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens produced another Yankee victory on Tuesday night _
granted, over the mistake-prone, light-hitting Expos _ and he ran
his record to 9-4. But the Yankees are merely 10-7 when he starts,
and it doesn't take much for him to hear boos _ a walk here, a
homer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's like this all year, if I've got to battle . . . well,
as long as we win,'' Clemens said following his seven-inning stint
in the Yankees' 7-4 victory at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had things my own way the last two years,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive Yankee runs were drilled home by Paul O'Neill's
bases-loaded double in the seventh inning, breaking a 4-4 tie. The
hit came against a tough left-hander, Steve Kline, who was brought
in for the starter Mike Thurman just to pitch to the
left-hand-hitting O'Neill, who had been batting under .200 against
left-handers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had his moments in his seven innings, although Manager
Joe Torre contended the facts don't always tell the story. This
time Clemens yielded seven hits, four runs (three earned) and three
walks with six strikeouts. Torre liked the fact that Clemens'
splitter, which had been flat in recent games (he had lost two
straight for the first time since last May), was sinking and
swerving.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the closer who had blown three of his last five
save chances, closed down the Expos in the ninth. He froze Orlando
Cabrera with a slider, got Wilton Guerrero on a groundout and sent
off Terry Jones swinging at air.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens never put together a dominating stretch, although he did
strike out four of the next six batters after the Expos got an
unearned run in the first. He tried to barehand a ball hit by Jones
after Wilton Guerrero had led off the game with a double. But
Clemens threw the ball away and Guerrero scored.
</P>
<P>
   The most evocative moments of the old Clemens were his
displaying that famed radar that seeks out opponents' heads.
</P>
<P>
   He threw one pitch _ a high, hard fastball _ that would have
been a beanball had not Jose Vidro spun out of the way in the third
inning. Later in the inning, Clemens threw a pitch to Orlando
Cabrera that he deflected with his bat in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Clemens nearly decked Vladimir Guerrero on a 1-0
pitch with two runners on. Again, the ball came in head-high.
Guerrero stumbled out of the way, then drew himself erect to his
6-foot-3-inch frame and glowered at Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens, who then walked him to load the bases, ended the
inning by getting Brad Fullmer on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemens struck out five batters in the first three
innings, he didn't strike out another until the seventh as the
Expos pecked away with four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wound up interleague play with a 9-9 record,
including three losses by Clemens. Last year they were baseball's
best team with a 13-3 record in interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second straight game the Expos played the Yankees
tough, hardly looking like the compliant outfit that was victimized
by David Cone's perfect game on Sunday for their sixth straight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, who entered Tuesday night's game with the National
League's second-poorest team batting average, at .263, took a 2-0
lead in the third inning as Vladimir Guerrero singled to score his
younger brother Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bunched three runs in the third, though, starting a
rally when Jorge Posada led off with the club's first hit. Scott
Brosius's double-play ball was mishandled at third by Shane
Andrews, putting two on. Posada scored when Derek Jeter's grounder
to the right side deflected off Thurman for a base hit. Bernie
Williams and Tino Martinez then produced run-scoring hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fought off more negative cheers in the fourth after
Andrews homered to right to tie the game. Even that blow did not
distress Torre, who pointed out it was to the opposite field. The
hitters, the manager contends, are not pulling Clemens's pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bad fielding by the Expos again helped the Yankees score in the
fifth. Jeter drilled a one-out single, and O'Neill's grounder was
bobbled at short by Cabrera, who got only get a force-out. O'Neill
then stole second as catcher Chris Widger's high throw sailed into
center field. O'Neill dashed home on a Bernie Williams single.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Clemens couldn't hold the lead. Fullmer led off the sixth
with a walk and scored on Andrews's sacrifice fly. In the next
inning, though, Clemens got out of a bases-loaded, two-out
potential trouble-maker.

THE DH SHOW IS FOR PEANUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What do you bring to a ballpark? I bring a
score-keeping pen, binoculars and cash _ and an ATM card if I'm
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   A hat and sunscreen on a bright day. A fielder's glove in St.
Louis, a parka in San Francisco, a flak jacket in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   What would you bring to Dodger Stadium on Thursday? That's a
little more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   A deck of cards, a good book, a well-stocked ice chest? A
unicycle, a sleeping bag, Twister? Because this will be no typical
day of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, for the first time in their 42 years in Los
Angeles, will play a day-night doubleheader Thursday against the
Colorado Rockies. The first game, at 1:10 p.m., was already on the
schedule. The second, at 7:10, is the makeup of an April 11
rainout.
</P>
<P>
   This will be unlike most doubleheaders, the twilight-night
variety in which the second game starts half an hour after the last
out of the first game and the paying customers get a 2-for-1
bargain to soothe their sore rear ends.
</P>
<P>
   This really will be separate events. Fans who plan to attend
both must pay two admissions. They also must leave the stadium in
between as cleanup crews sweep up peanut shells, and security
forces check the bathroom stalls for stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: Say the first game goes 15 innings and ends after
the gates are scheduled to open at 5:40 for the second game.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket office expects only 5 to 10 percent of the first
game's crowd _ largely made up of businessmen playing hooky and
kids from day camps _ to stay for the second even if you include
season-ticket holders. How will the stadium crew get one group out
and the next group in without causing a 10,000-car chain-reaction
collision at the parking gate?
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management has worked out the traffic patterns with
local officials, but in fact, stadium-operations director Doug
Duennes said of the 15-inning scenario, ``We hope it doesn't
(happen). Let's just say it'll be a little more challenging if it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: Say the first game goes a normal length or
shorter. It ends before 4 o'clock. That leaves thousands of fans
with more than an hour and a half to kill. In the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Wrigley Field, with bars and restaurants across the
street. Or Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, where downtown is a
pedestrian bridge away from the stadium. Or Coors Field in Denver,
another city with a downtown ballpark, walking distance from food
and drink and the nation's best bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Or Busch Stadium in St. Louis, offering your choice of two
shopping malls and a certain arch within walking distance. Or
Yankee Stadium in New York, where _ did I mention that bookstore in
Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Stadium stands alone, overlooking downtown but apart from
it, surrounded by park land, the Los Angeles Police Academy and
residential streets. A lot of nothing to do for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   You could drive out Elysian Park Avenue to one of the bars and
restaurants on Sunset Boulevard _ but then they're going to ask you
for another $6 to re-enter the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most places, people have somewhere to go,'' Duennes said,
acknowledging the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is so obvious, I wish I'd thought of it. One word:
pachyderms.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Ringling Bros. circus, the Dodgers plan to
present an elephant show between games in parking lot 37, near the
gas station beyond center field. Having put on a clown show for
much of the season, they certainly can stick to a theme.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the elephants, there are to be remote broadcasts
from the parking lot by KXTA-AM (1150) and KIIS-FM (102.7)
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The mere thought of a doubleheader at Dodger Stadium is unusual
enough. It hasn't happened since 1992, when games were postponed
because of the riots that followed the Rodney King police-brutality
verdicts, forcing the Dodgers to play four doubleheaders in six
days against Montreal and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   There hadn't been a rainout here for nearly 11 years until it
happened in April.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when a ``DH'' was something you'd see on a
schedule, not a lineup card, Dodger Stadium was the site of as many
as five ``twi-night'' doubleheaders in a season. Most were planned
before the season started.
</P>
<P>
   But average attendance at major-league games in general was
about half then what it is now. Ticket prices were a fraction of
today's bank-account-busting rates. A club didn't cost itself as
much money by giving away a gate.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, if a game was postponed and rescheduled as part
of a doubleheader, it wasn't hard to find seats for 15,000
raincheck holders alongside 15,000 advance-ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when attendance boomed in the '70s and '80s and
advance sellouts became routine at '90s ballparks like those in
Baltimore, Cleveland and Colorado. The modern rain-makeup
doubleheader is more likely to be a day-night event, like
Thursday's at Dodger Stadium, at twice the cost to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   It can feel more like a siege than a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the Giants needed 9 hours and 52 minutes to sweep the
Mets at Shea Stadium in a doubleheader featuring a 23-inning second
game. Juan Marichal won the opener, Gaylord Perry the nightcap,
which featured a triple play ensnaring Orlando Cepeda and Willie
Mays, so the 10,000 fans who were there at the end got a Hall of
Fame show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, I covered a Dodgers doubleheader in St. Louis that,
with rain delays and an extra-inning nightcap, ended with the
Cardinals winning at 3:04 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   That was a breeze compared to a late summer afternoon in the
Dodger Stadium parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials don't expect they'll have to use cattle prods
to get fans to leave the park following game one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let people enjoy the game, let the players
leave the field and let the highlights run (on the video screen)
before we ask people to step outside,'' Duennes said. ``We'll go
through the normal routine of clearing the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   And they promise food and drinks will be on sale outside. So
here's how to spend the spare time: Buy an elephant a bag of
peanuts.

GEORGE BRETT HAD FEW PEERS IN HITTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Brett called his good friend Robin Yount after hearing
that they both had been selected to take their place in the
pantheon of baseball greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laughing and saying, `Who the heck are we to be in the
Hall of Fame?' '' Brett said. ``Obviously it's something, when you
start playing, it's a dream that someday you'll make it, but you
really don't think that dream will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, American League pitchers tried in vain to find a
weakness in Brett. Finally, six seasons after his retirement, one
is revealed. Brett is too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it can give a modern-day player pause to realize that
he is about to join the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron
and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Brett deserves a place in the Hall,
if not a separate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire career playing for the Kansas City
Royals, finished with 3,154 hits, 13th all-time. He had 665
doubles, fifth in the history of the game. He hit .305 for his
career, and had 11 seasons of better than .300. He hit 20 or more
homers in eight seasons, including 30 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with .400 for most of the 1980 season before
finishing at .390. It was the highest since Ted Williams batted
.406 in 1941 and has been topped just once since, by Tony Gwynn's
.394 average in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the best hitter I ever played with,'' said former
Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who spent two of his 16 seasons as
Brett's teammate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think there was a lot of natural ability. He worked
pretty hard. But he didn't see himself as clear as it really was.
He had a great swing.'' No one-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the swing that launched a thousand accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and
hit a line drive,'' said John Schuerholz, former Royals and current
Braves general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could get good wood on an aspirin,'' former
Royals manager Jim Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said that about Brett during his three seasons in the
minors after the Royals drafted him _ as a shortstop _ in the
second round in 1971. He wasn't a slouch, hitting .291, .274 and
then .284 at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   But when he made it to the majors, he adopted the distinctive
style of batting guru Charlie Lau, hitting off his front foot with
the high, one-handed follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he expects to tear up when talking about Lau during
his induction speech, and with good reason. The two men were close,
and Brett credits Lau for turning him into a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lau's tutelage, Brett hit over .300 for the first time as
a pro in 1975. He then proceeded to do it as regularly as Nolan
Ryan won strikeout crowns. Brett batted over .300 in nine of the
next 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brett won batting crowns in 1976, with a .333 average, and with
the .390 average in 1980. He ``slumped'' in the last half of the
1980s, although most players would take his averages of .290, .290,
.306 and .282.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a league-leading .329 in 1990, becoming the
first player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the best player right there,'' Yount said. ``To me, he
was the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a knack for driving in runs. Juan Gonzalez has made
knocking in more runs than games played almost routine, but no one
had done it since Joe DiMaggio in 1948 when Brett drove in 118 in
117 games in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with 1,595 runs batted in, tied for 22nd with
Mike Schmidt, but Brett didn't have the raw power of his fellow
Hall of Fame third baseman. Brett hit his share of balls over the
fence, but his strength was line drives that found gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Brett's 212 hits included 42 doubles, 20 triples and 23
homers. Only four other players had put together 20-20-20 seasons
before that.
</P>
<P>
   The individual numbers _ which include three seasons of leading
the league in hits and triples, something only Ty Cobb accomplished
before or since _ are remarkable. They are why Brett was elected
with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth highest percentage ever
behind Tom Seaver (98.84), fellow '99 inductee Ryan (98.79) and
Cobb (98.23).
</P>
<P>
   MR. POSTSEASON: However, Brett was first and foremost a team
player. His grandest memory isn't of the .390 season, or the 1980
American League Most Valuable Player award. It's of winning the
World Series in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the mound and hugging Bret Saberhagen after an
11-0 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals to win our first world
championship ... I can wear this ring proudly and say I was a world
champion,'' he said. ``It's the one thing I shared with 24 guys,
from April to October, in the grind of the season every day. That
was an extraordinary bunch of guys. It wasn't one of the better
teams I played on, but it was one of the closest-knit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the hero of the '85 postseason, batting .348 with
three homers in the American League Championship Series against the
Toronto Blue Jays and .373 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing new, though. The Royals won the AL West six
times during Brett's career, and he excelled in the playoffs almost
every time. He holds ALCS records for highest slugging percentage
(.728), triples (4), home runs (9), extra-base hits (18), and total
bases (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this knack of focusing when the pressure was on,''
former teammate Jamie Quirk told the ``Kansas City Star''. ``He had
this amazing concentration. The rest of us, we have a thousand
things going on in our mind. We think about the situation or the
pressure, we think about our swing or we guess what pitch is coming
or whatever. George just saw the ball. That was it. Everything else
was gone. That's what made him great, I think. The rest of us saw
shadows. George saw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest postseason hit came in 1980, in the ALCS against the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had beaten the Royals the previous three years,
despite averages of .400, .300 and .389 by Brett. He hit just .273
with three hits in '80, but the final hit was a three-run homer off
closer Goose Gossage that put Kansas City into the World Series for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, finally winning, for us it was like winning the World
Series,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't come until five years later; the Royals lost to
the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image is of Brett charging toward the ump, a crazed
look on his face, seemingly intent on doing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it wasn't funny,'' said Brett, who later had the
home run restored when the league office ruled that Martin should
have protested before Brett used the bat. ``But now my oldest son,
Jackson, says, `Dad, let's put in that tape where you go berserk.'
So we fast-forward to that point in the tape and I have to explain
to him that's not the type of behavior I expect from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Brett and his son watch the tape, perhaps they
should fast-forward to the spot where Brett hits the home run and
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It was that swing, that churned out line drive after line drive,
that got Brett into the Hall of Fame. nn

</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, American League pitchers tried in vain to find a
weakness in Brett. Finally, six seasons after his retirement, one
is revealed. Brett is too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it can give a modern-day player pause to realize that
he is about to join the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron
and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Brett deserves a place in the Hall,
if not a separate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire career playing for the Kansas City
Royals, finished with 3,154 hits, 13th all-time. He had 665
doubles, fifth in the history of the game. He hit .305 for his
career, and had 11 seasons of better than .300. He hit 20 or more
homers in eight seasons, including 30 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with .400 for most of the 1980 season before
finishing at .390. It was the highest since Ted Williams batted
.406 in 1941 and has been topped just once since, by Tony Gwynn's
.394 average in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the best hitter I ever played with,'' said former
Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who spent two of his 16 seasons as
Brett's teammate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think there was a lot of natural ability. He worked
pretty hard. But he didn't see himself as clear as it really was.
He had a great swing.'' No one-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the swing that launched a thousand accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and
hit a line drive,'' said John Schuerholz, former Royals and current
Braves general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could get good wood on an aspirin,'' former
Royals manager Jim Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said that about Brett during his three seasons in the
minors after the Royals drafted him _ as a shortstop _ in the
second round in 1971. He wasn't a slouch, hitting .291, .274 and
then .284 at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   But when he made it to the majors, he adopted the distinctive
style of batting guru Charlie Lau, hitting off his front foot with
the high, one-handed follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he expects to tear up when talking about Lau during
his induction speech, and with good reason. The two men were close,
and Brett credits Lau for turning him into a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lau's tutelage, Brett hit over .300 for the first time as
a pro in 1975. He then proceeded to do it as regularly as Nolan
Ryan won strikeout crowns. Brett batted over .300 in nine of the
next 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brett won batting crowns in 1976, with a .333 average, and with
the .390 average in 1980. He ``slumped'' in the last half of the
1980s, although most players would take his averages of .290, .290,
.306 and .282.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a league-leading .329 in 1990, becoming the
first player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the best player right there,'' Yount said. ``To me, he
was the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a knack for driving in runs. Juan Gonzalez has made
knocking in more runs than games played almost routine, but no one
had done it since Joe DiMaggio in 1948 when Brett drove in 118 in
117 games in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with 1,595 runs batted in, tied for 22nd with
Mike Schmidt, but Brett didn't have the raw power of his fellow
Hall of Fame third baseman. Brett hit his share of balls over the
fence, but his strength was line drives that found gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Brett's 212 hits included 42 doubles, 20 triples and 23
homers. Only four other players had put together 20-20-20 seasons
before that.
</P>
<P>
   The individual numbers _ which include three seasons of leading
the league in hits and triples, something only Ty Cobb accomplished
before or since _ are remarkable. They are why Brett was elected
with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth highest percentage ever
behind Tom Seaver (98.84), fellow '99 inductee Ryan (98.79) and
Cobb (98.23).
</P>
<P>
   MR. POSTSEASON: However, Brett was first and foremost a team
player. His grandest memory isn't of the .390 season, or the 1980
American League Most Valuable Player award. It's of winning the
World Series in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the mound and hugging Bret Saberhagen after an
11-0 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals to win our first world
championship ... I can wear this ring proudly and say I was a world
champion,'' he said. ``It's the one thing I shared with 24 guys,
from April to October, in the grind of the season every day. That
was an extraordinary bunch of guys. It wasn't one of the better
teams I played on, but it was one of the closest-knit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the hero of the '85 postseason, batting .348 with
three homers in the American League Championship Series against the
Toronto Blue Jays and .373 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing new, though. The Royals won the AL West six
times during Brett's career, and he excelled in the playoffs almost
every time. He holds ALCS records for highest slugging percentage
(.728), triples (4), home runs (9), extra-base hits (18), and total
bases (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this knack of focusing when the pressure was on,''
former teammate Jamie Quirk told the ``Kansas City Star''. ``He had
this amazing concentration. The rest of us, we have a thousand
things going on in our mind. We think about the situation or the
pressure, we think about our swing or we guess what pitch is coming
or whatever. George just saw the ball. That was it. Everything else
was gone. That's what made him great, I think. The rest of us saw
shadows. George saw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest postseason hit came in 1980, in the ALCS against the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had beaten the Royals the previous three years,
despite averages of .400, .300 and .389 by Brett. He hit just .273
with three hits in '80, but the final hit was a three-run homer off
closer Goose Gossage that put Kansas City into the World Series for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, finally winning, for us it was like winning the World
Series,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't come until five years later; the Royals lost to
the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image is of Brett charging toward the ump, a crazed
look on his face, seemingly intent on doing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it wasn't funny,'' said Brett, who later had the
home run restored when the league office ruled that Martin should
have protested before Brett used the bat. ``But now my oldest son,
Jackson, says, `Dad, let's put in that tape where you go berserk.'
So we fast-forward to that point in the tape and I have to explain
to him that's not the type of behavior I expect from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Brett and his son watch the tape, perhaps they
should fast-forward to the spot where Brett hits the home run and
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It was that swing, that churned out line drive after line drive,
that got Brett into the Hall of Fame. nn

   George Brett called his good friend Robin Yount after hearing
that they both had been selected to take their place in the
pantheon of baseball greats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laughing and saying, ``Who the heck are we to be in

the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting image is of Brett charging toward the ump, a crazed
look on his face, seemingly intent on doing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time it wasn't funny,'' said Brett, who later had the
home run restored when the league office ruled that Martin should
have protested before Brett used the bat. ``But now my oldest son,
Jackson, says, `Dad, let's put in that tape where you go berserk.'
So we fast-forward to that point in the tape and I have to explain
to him that's not the type of behavior I expect from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Brett and his son watch the tape, perhaps they
should fast-forward to the spot where Brett hits the home run and
stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It was that swing, that churned out line drive after line drive,
that got Brett into the Hall of Fame. nn

GEORGE BRETT HAD FEW PEERS IN HITTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Brett called his good friend Robin Yount after hearing
that they both had been selected to take their place in the
pantheon of baseball greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laughing and saying, ``Who the heck are we to be in
the Hall of Fame?' '' Brett said. ``Obviously, it's something, when
you start playing, it's a dream that someday you'll make it, but
you really don't think that dream will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, American League pitchers tried in vain to find a
weakness in Brett. Finally, six seasons after his retirement, one
is revealed. Brett is too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it can give a modern-day player pause to realize that
he is about to join the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Aaron
and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Brett deserves a place in the Hall,
if not a separate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire career playing for the Kansas City
Royals, finished with 3,154 hits, 13th all-time. He had 665
doubles, fifth in the history of the game. He hit .305 for his
career, and had 11 seasons of better than .300. He hit 20 or more
homers in eight seasons, including 30 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with .400 for most of the 1980 season before
finishing at .390. It was the highest since Ted Williams batted
.406 in 1941 and has been topped just once since, by Tony Gwynn's
.394 average in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was the best hitter I ever played with,'' said former
Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who spent two of his 16 seasons as
Brett's teammate in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think there was a lot of natural ability. He worked
pretty hard. But he didn't see himself as clear as it really was.
He had a great swing.''
</P>
<P>
   NO ONE-HIT WONDER: Ah, yes, the swing that launched a thousand
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could roll out of bed on Christmas morning and
hit a line drive,'' said John Schuerholz, former Royals and current
Braves general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett could get good wood on an aspirin,'' former
Royals manager Jim Frey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said that about Brett during his three seasons in the
minors after the Royals drafted him _ as a shortstop _ in the
second round in 1971. He wasn't a slouch, hitting .291, .274 and
then .284 at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   But when he made it to the majors, he adopted the distinctive
style of batting guru Charlie Lau, hitting off his front foot with
the high, one-handed follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he expects to tear up when talking about Lau during
his induction speech, and with good reason. The two men were close,
and Brett credits Lau for turning him into a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lau's tutelage, Brett hit over .300 for the first time as
a pro in 1975. He then proceeded to do it as regularly as Nolan
Ryan won strikeout crowns. Brett batted over .300 in nine of the
next 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brett won batting crowns in 1976, with a .333 average, and with
the .390 average in 1980. He ``slumped'' in the last half of the
1980s, although most players would take his averages of .290, .290,
.306 and .282.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded with a league-leading .329 in 1990, becoming the
first player to win batting titles in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the best player right there,'' Yount said. ``To me, he
was the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a knack for driving in runs. Juan Gonzalez has made
knocking in more runs than games played almost routine, but no one
had done it since Joe DiMaggio in 1948 when Brett drove in 118 in
117 games in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with 1,595 runs batted in, tied for 22nd with
Mike Schmidt, but Brett didn't have the raw power of his fellow
Hall of Fame third baseman. Brett hit his share of balls over the
fence, but his strength was line drives that found gaps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Brett's 212 hits included 42 doubles, 20 triples and 23
homers. Only four other players had put together 20-20-20 seasons
before that.
</P>
<P>
   The individual numbers _ which include three seasons of leading
the league in hits and triples, something only Ty Cobb accomplished
before or since _ are remarkable. They are why Brett was elected
with 98.19 percent of the vote, the fourth highest percentage ever
behind Tom Seaver (98.84), fellow '99 inductee Ryan (98.79) and
Cobb (98.23).
</P>
<P>
   MR. POSTSEASON: However, Brett was first and foremost a team
player. His grandest memory isn't of the .390 season, or the 1980
American League Most Valuable Player award. It's of winning the
World Series in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the mound and hugging Bret Saberhagen after an
11-0 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals to win our first world
championship ... I can wear this ring proudly and say I was a world
champion,'' he said. ``It's the one thing I shared with 24 guys,
from April to October, in the grind of the season every day. That
was an extraordinary bunch of guys. It wasn't one of the better
teams I played on, but it was one of the closest-knit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett was the hero of the '85 postseason, batting .348 with
three homers in the American League Championship Series against the
Toronto Blue Jays and .373 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing new, though. The Royals won the AL West six
times during Brett's career, and he excelled in the playoffs almost
every time. He holds ALCS records for highest slugging percentage
(.728), triples (4), home runs (9), extra-base hits (18), and total
bases (75).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this knack of focusing when the pressure was on,''
former teammate Jamie Quirk told the ``Kansas City Star''. ``He had
this amazing concentration. The rest of us, we have a thousand
things going on in our mind. We think about the situation or the
pressure, we think about our swing or we guess what pitch is coming
or whatever. George just saw the ball. That was it. Everything else
was gone. That's what made him great, I think. The rest of us saw
shadows. George saw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest postseason hit came in 1980, in the ALCS against the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had beaten the Royals the previous three years,
despite averages of .400, .300 and .389 by Brett. He hit just .273
with three hits in '80, but the final hit was a three-run homer off
closer Goose Gossage that put Kansas City into the World Series for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, finally winning, for us it was like winning the World
Series,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't come until five years later; the Royals lost to
the Philadelphia Phillies in '80.
</P>
<P>
   In between World Series appearances, Brett had his most infamous
moment, the ``Pine Tar'' game.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in a regular-season game against the Yankees,
but New York manager Billy Martin protested that the pine tar on
the bat extended too far up the barrel. The umpires agreed, and the
homer was taken away.
</P>

IRWINDALE ADJUSTS SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE HUNT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Irwindale Speedway revised the schedule for
the second half of its inaugural season Tuesday, virtually
eliminating all Friday night racing from August through the
season-ending Thanksgiving Turkey Night Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the remaining 16 Friday night events were canceled so
speedway officials can focus on presenting what they bill as
``super spectacular'' Saturday night races. Ticket prices will
remain the same, $15 for adults and $5 for children 6-12, except
for special events such as the NASCAR Winston West Series 250 on
Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're combining the best of our Friday night and Saturday
night shows into one night of great racing action,'' said Ray
Wilkings, vice president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday nights are the best night for racing for everyone
concerned: fans, racers and sponsors. With our revised schedule we
expect to see substantially stronger car counts in all our racing
divisions and that will make it great for all our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkings said the schedule change does not signal the $10
million state-of-the-art speedway is having financial trouble.
Rather, he said it underscores one of Southern California's primary
problems -- traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale was the first race track in Southern California to
offer Friday night racing, but it proved a difficult sell to fans
and drivers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkings said Friday night attendance has been averaging about
2,000 persons, but Saturday's average has been 4,000. But he said
the drivers' difficulty in making Friday night events was of equal
or greater concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers right from the beginning had a problem getting here,''
Wilkings said, noting a trip that might take 30-45 minutes on
Saturdays was taking two hours on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a concern of mine, but it turned out to be a
bigger concern that we thought it would. Most race tracks around
the country are one-night tracks. We just thought we'd give it a
shot (at two nights). But it came down to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we were always preaching from the beginning was
location -- we're in the middle of 11 million people. But that
positive is a negative in one respect -- it's difficult to get here
on Friday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The speedway's Friday night events have been pretty much limited
to Late Model, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks, with an occasional
Grand American race. Nearly all of the drivers for those events
race just as a hobby. Some had trouble getting off work early
enough to get to the speedway. Some also complained that the
track's tire rules proved too costly to them.
</P>
<P>
   The fields for Friday night races had been dwindling since
Irwindale Speedway opened on March 27. The average Late Model field
attracted 15 drivers in April, but dipped to about 12 a month
later. Recently, those races had attracted only eight or nine
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gerrit Cromsigt, who regularly drives in NASCAR Late Model
races, recently talked about the difficulty of racing on Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss is understanding in letting me off early so I can get
here on time, or else I do my Friday work earlier in the week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Speedway officials provided a clue that
Friday nights weren't meeting expectations when they announced they
would replace the Aug. 13 racing card with a concert featuring
``The Ladies of Salsa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mechanix Speed Truck series also raced on several Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were taking a chance and they knew they were taking
a chance,'' series director Jay Rutherford said of Friday night
events. ``We rolled the dice and it just did not work out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the elimination of the 12 Friday cards, Wilkings
said some of the divisions will lose some races. ``But that is one
of the things the drivers wanted anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably start some of the racing before the dashes
Saturday night, between 6 and 7 p.m. Then we'll start the dashes at
7 p.m. Fans will see more racing on Saturday and I think we'll get
more people on Saturdays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speedway will continue to offer Friday night racing this
week and next week. But after that, the only two other Fridays with
racing will be Oct. 15 and Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The first of two ESPN-televised nights of USAC open wheel racing
will be Oct. 15, when the card features TQ Midget and sprint car
races, as well as Coors Silver Bullet Series qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The American Race trucks national finals come to Irwindale on
Nov. 12 and 13. The two-day finals will attract drivers from across
the nation. There also will be Speed Trucks and Pro-4 Modified
events on Saturday, Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkings said Aug. 14 will be ``Truckers Night.'' He also said
the track will continue its weekly car club ``Parking Lot Shows''
and will bring live bands to Irwindale's Backstage Bandstand in the
manufacturer's display area before every race, from 4:30 p.m. to 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what really goes, what works and what doesn't,'' said
Doug Stokes, the speedway's director of communications. ``I think
there will be much stronger shows. I think this is a very positive
move.''
</P>
<P>
   The 59th running of the Turkey Night Grand Prix, on Thanksgiving
night, Nov. 25, will conclude the track's inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the only race of the year where we sell
reserved-seat tickets,'' Stokes said. ``All the greats have raced
and won Turkey Nights _ A.J. Foyt, Benny Parsons, Billy Boat,
etc.''
</P>

YANKEES DEFEAT EXPOS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct score in headline) (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee fans haven't figured out yet what they think
of Roger Clemens, and he hasn't quite figured things out himself
this season. Certainly the Clemens of five Cy Young awards remains
elusive this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens produced another Yankee victory on Tuesday night _
granted, over the mistake-prone, light-hitting Expos _ and he ran
his record to 9-4. But the Yankees are merely 10-7 when he starts,
and it doesn't take much for him to hear boos _ a walk here, a
homer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's like this all year, if I've got to battle . . . well,
as long as we win,'' Clemens said following his seven-inning stint
in the Yankees' 7-4 victory at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had things my own way the last two years,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive Yankee runs were drilled home by Paul O'Neill's
bases-loaded double in the seventh inning, breaking a 4-4 tie. The
hit came against a tough left-hander, Steve Kline, who was brought
in for the starter Mike Thurman just to pitch to the
left-hand-hitting O'Neill, who had been batting under .200 against
left-handers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had his moments in his seven innings, although Manager
Joe Torre contended the facts don't always tell the story. This
time Clemens yielded seven hits, four runs (three earned) and three
walks with six strikeouts. Torre liked the fact that Clemens'
splitter, which had been flat in recent games (he had lost two
straight for the first time since last May), was sinking and
swerving.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the closer who had blown three of his last five
save chances, closed down the Expos in the ninth. He froze Orlando
Cabrera with a slider, got Wilton Guerrero on a groundout and sent
off Terry Jones swinging at air.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens never put together a dominating stretch, although he did
strike out four of the next six batters after the Expos got an
unearned run in the first. He tried to barehand a ball hit by Jones
after Wilton Guerrero had led off the game with a double. But
Clemens threw the ball away and Guerrero scored.
</P>
<P>
   The most evocative moments of the old Clemens were his
displaying that famed radar that seeks out opponents' heads.
</P>
<P>
   He threw one pitch _ a high, hard fastball _ that would have
been a beanball had not Jose Vidro spun out of the way in the third
inning. Later in the inning, Clemens threw a pitch to Orlando
Cabrera that he deflected with his bat in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Clemens nearly decked Vladimir Guerrero on a 1-0
pitch with two runners on. Again, the ball came in head-high.
Guerrero stumbled out of the way, then drew himself erect to his
6-foot-3-inch frame and glowered at Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens, who then walked him to load the bases, ended the
inning by getting Brad Fullmer on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemens struck out five batters in the first three
innings, he didn't strike out another until the seventh as the
Expos pecked away with four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wound up interleague play with a 9-9 record,
including three losses by Clemens. Last year they were baseball's
best team with a 13-3 record in interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second straight game the Expos played the Yankees
tough, hardly looking like the compliant outfit that was victimized
by David Cone's perfect game on Sunday for their sixth straight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, who entered Tuesday night's game with the National
League's second-poorest team batting average, at .263, took a 2-0
lead in the third inning as Vladimir Guerrero singled to score his
younger brother Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bunched three runs in the third, though, starting a
rally when Jorge Posada led off with the club's first hit. Scott
Brosius's double-play ball was mishandled at third by Shane
Andrews, putting two on. Posada scored when Derek Jeter's grounder
to the right side deflected off Thurman for a base hit. Bernie
Williams and Tino Martinez then produced run-scoring hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fought off more negative cheers in the fourth after
Andrews homered to right to tie the game. Even that blow did not
distress Torre, who pointed out it was to the opposite field. The
hitters, the manager contends, are not pulling Clemens's pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bad fielding by the Expos again helped the Yankees score in the
fifth. Jeter drilled a one-out single, and O'Neill's grounder was
bobbled at short by Cabrera, who got only get a force-out. O'Neill
then stole second as catcher Chris Widger's high throw sailed into
center field. O'Neill dashed home on a Bernie Williams single.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Clemens couldn't hold the lead. Fullmer led off the sixth
with a walk and scored on Andrews's sacrifice fly. In the next
inning, though, Clemens got out of a bases-loaded, two-out
potential trouble-maker.

VENTURA COUNTY'S COOL COURSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Looking to beat the summer heat? Try a seaside
golf excursion to the Ventura County courses at River Ridge in
Oxnard and Buenaventura and Olivas Park, both in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   All three are located within three miles of each other and
cooled by Pacific Ocean breezes _ which can gust up your scores but
are a lot less burdensome than the heat and sometimes smog of the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   River Ridge, the newest of the Ventura Country seaside trio,
opened in 1986 and hosts the annual Strawberry and Oxnard City
tournaments. It plays to 6,718 yards and a par of 72.
</P>
<P>
   The links-style layout includes rolling terrain, wide fairways,
large and quick greens, few trees _ most of them small _ and lots
of wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get two-club wind,'' said general manager Otto Kanny, who
has used a driver on the course's signature par-3 14th hole, which
plays 190 yards from the back tees to an island green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big island, but we still get a lot of balls in that
lake,'' Kanny said.
</P>
<P>
   Water is the second-biggest factor at River Ridge, a close
runner-up behind the omnipresent wind that will affect every
afternoon round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got eight acres of water out there,'' Kanny said of the
six lakes on the former landfill property. ``We average 1.1 balls
in a lake per round played.
</P>
<P>
   River Ridge also offers a unique front-nine look featuring three
par-3s, three par-4s and three par-5s. The best of these is the
par-5 ninth that has golfers hitting mostly into the wind, off
sloping fairways and over a large greenside lake.
</P>
<P>
   __ Buenaventura: Ancient trees offer a break from the wind on
this near-70-year-old course, located across the Santa Clara river
from River Ridge and barely two miles east of Olivas Park.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as Montalvo GC and a favorite golfing haunt of
the late Pulitzer Prize-winning sportswriter Jim Murray, the course
co-hosts (with Olivas Park) the annual Ventura city and county
championships.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA golf coach Brad Sherfy holds the Buenaventura course record
at 60, although area resident Gary Hitch recorded a 59 when the
course played to a different configuration 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its present state, Buenaventura offers excellent conditions
for a public course. It has a traditional look with fairly tight
fairways, plenty of tree trouble, quick, undulating greens and one
of the prettiest par-3 holes in the area _ the 145-yard 14th which
crosses water twice and plays into wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course definitely puts a premium on accuracy because of
the trees,'' said head pro Lee Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   __ Olivas Park: Harlow, who worked at Olivas Park before taking
of the head job at Buenaventura, rates length as the major factor
at 6,670-yard Olivas, which is more exposed to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Water also is a factor at Olivas, with lakes coming into play on
six holes. As with any of the three seaside courses, Olivas is
friendlier in the mornings, before winds that can gust to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Olivas also offers a driving range, which Buenaventura lacks,
and a practice chipping facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always asked what is the tougher course, Buenaventura or
Olivas Park,'' said Harlow, who has attempted to track scores in
city and county championships to determine an answer. His charting
tells him Buenaventura plays tougher for the single-digit
handicapper and Olivas Park plays tougher for those with an index
above 10.
</P>
<P>
   Scores aside, conditions on both are excellent, from
well-manicured fairways to challenging but smooth-rolling greens.
</P>
<P>
   But despite good course conditions, its the temperature that's
the biggest plus about Ventura seaside golf, especially in the
summer. Kanny puts it as the golf slogan of the area:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're tired of shooting in the 90s, try us. We're always
in the 70s.''

DIGITAL REVOLUTIONARIE WANT PC'S TO MAKE LIFE SIMPLER FOR HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A small group of subversives who want to eliminate
personal computers from every home in America has been meeting
quietly in Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the meeting, sponsored jointly by the University of
Washington and Microsoft, is to chart a path that will take us to
the day when your refrigerator decides when to order the milk or
your wristwatch does more than today's most powerful PC. Or other
things yet unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really want to do is get computers out of people's
way,'' said Gaetano Borriello, professor of computer science and
engineering at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to turn the computer on, log in and press
all these buttons to get it to perform a simple task,'' Borriello
said. Computers increasingly dictate human behavior, he said:
``It's totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Borriello and fellow insurgent Turner Whitted of Microsoft
Research are the ringleaders in this movement to help humans
triumph over computers.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by about 40 top scientists and engineers from other
seedbeds of intellectual unrest including the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley,
Georgia Tech, IBM, Xerox, Intel and Hewlett Packard, these digital
revolutionaries are meeting all week to explore ``Technologies of
Invisible Computing.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days of presenting individual ideas and discussing
obstacles at the UW, they move on Wednesday to the Inn at
Semi-ah-Moo, near the Canadian border, where smaller groups will
study the tasks necessary to rid the world of the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCs are general-purpose machines,'' Borriello noted. For that
reason, he said, they're good for many things, not excellent at any
one thing and way too complicated for most daily household or
office uses.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of stories, and ``Star Trek'' episodes,
that describe the concept of invisible computing. A few
technologies today give a glimpse of the goal _ the ``smart'' room
where lights and music turn on when a person enters or the personal
digital assistant with wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But all these examples, Borriello and Whitted say, are largely
based on the PC mentality in which users have to direct an
otherwise passive system to make something happen and the exchange
of information is still too complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want these devices to do things automatically, simply,''
Borriello said. ``They have to talk to each other, take in new
information and, in some cases, anticipate what you need and do it
without asking you about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't simply about how to improve computing,
Whitted said. ``It's about the movement of data,'' he said, about
moving it in completely new ways that won't depend upon people
having to learn new skills or change habits.
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for privacy concerns associated with computers
autonomously handling personal information, invisible computing
sounds fine and good. So what's the holdup?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting stuff, but to make it work is incredibly
difficult,'' said David Culler, a professor of computer science at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is information management, Culler said. If the smart
house of the future has 1,000 or so mini-computers each with
specific tasks, he asked, how will all this information be managed
_ sorted, turned on and off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without proper management, the world we're talking about will
be like those Furbees (toys) ... They keep talking and talking
until eventually you just lock them up in the closet to get them to
shut up,'' Culler said.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle often not considered in the trend toward
miniaturization in computing is the question of power sources,
Whitted noted. Each of these devices will need power, he said, and
nobody wants to change 1,000 tiny batteries in their house or wear
a device that generates too much heat.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Russell, from Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), said
it's important to think not so much about what's possible as what's
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Russell told a story about Porsche equipping its car with a
computerized sensor in its gas tank aimed at protecting the engine
from the damage of running on fumes. A driver went around a curve,
the gasoline sloshed to one side, the sensor said the tank was
empty and the car slowly shut itself down.
</P>
<P>
   After making some frustrated calls, Russell said, the driver
learned the only way he could restart the car was to reboot the
system _ something that could only be done at the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the user experience Porsche wanted the driver to
have,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about information management, power
sources and the ``user interface'' in invisible computing,
participants identified many other technical and social obstacles
that need to be hurdled before this vision becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Information transfer in most cases will need to be wireless, and
a number of experts said this will require innovative methods to
protect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Shih, a newly minted UW computer science and engineering
grad who is working at Microsoft before heading to MIT this fall,
said he's working on a system that uses the human skin's natural
electrical conductivity to transmit information through signals
that aren't broadcast but limited to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would aid in privacy,'' Shih said. ``The goal of all this
is make our lives simpler. Right now in computing, that's not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Starkweather, the man who invented the laser printer, said
the value of the UW/Microsoft Summer Institute on invisible
computing is in bringing together experts who don't normally
intersect _ software programmers with hardware designers,
networkers with operating systems gurus.
</P>
<P>
   Starkweather, who developed the laser printer while at Xerox and
who is now with Whitted at Microsoft Research, knows only too well
the value of getting people to think outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to develop something new within an engineering
organization in which people are mostly focused on improving on
what they've got and cutting production costs,'' he said. ``That's
why I got in hot water.''
</P>
<P>
   When Starkweather in 1967 presented his idea for laser printing,
his superiors at Xerox told him to ``stop fooling around and get
back to work.'' The idea went nowhere until 1970 when Xerox
launched its new research arm, PARC, to support creative research.
</P>
<P>
   Starkweather got a transfer to PARC and the laser printer was
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the exchange of new ideas and different
perspectives,'' he said. ``That's what this meeting is all about.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEMENS IS LOOKING FOR HIS KEYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting)   (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First came a morning schmooze with Regis and Kathie
Lee, and then came the key to New York, New York. At City Hall on
Tuesday, it occurred to an appreciative David Cone that maybe the
glad-handing had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming to hear the mayor announce that July 20 is
David Cone Day,'' Cone said. ``But I was thinking, `There's got to
be something else more important going on in New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there was. Roger Clemens, perhaps the key
to the Yankees' October, was back on the mound on Tuesday night,
searching for his old, breathless form to eradicate his more recent
unconfident air.
</P>
<P>
   Who last February would have predicted that Clemens, on July 20,
David Cone Day, would be booed at Yankee Stadium for the second
straight start as he sputtered, struggled and survived for a 7-4
victory over Montreal, the team Cone was perfect against two days
before? Clemens earned his ninth victory, but except for
well-spaced moments, he still didn't look like Cy Young, five times
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to win, but he has to dominate,'' Joe Torre
had said earlier. Instead, Clemens reversed the prescription,
allowing the Expos nine hits, including a home run to Shane
Andrews, a .215, No. 8 hitter, on a 3-2 fastball. He slithered out
of a bases-loaded, two-out squeeze in the seventh inning of a 4-4
game when Brad Fullmer got under an off-speed pitch and skied it to
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fastball is still big time, to me,'' Torre said, claiming
that the radar gun does not lie. The manager's explanation for
Clemens's 4.90 earned run average is in Clemens' mechanics, and
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wanted to come into Yankee Stadium and make his
mark,'' Cone said. ``It's bothering him that he hasn't done better,
really bothering him. But it's very difficult to come to New York
your first year.''
</P>
<P>
   More so this year. The Yankees sprinted for all of 1998,
stripped everything from a regular season they possibly could.
Clemens has brought his trademark game-day passion to a Yankee team
that appears to be driving monotonously toward the post-season, on
cruise control. Listening to Torre and Cone talk about Clemens, you
get the idea that he has pressured himself to dance as fast as he
can and in the process has forgotten which foot comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 36, a certain Hall of Famer who teaches us again that
there is apparently no career point of immunity to the misplacement
of belief. Back in Boston and again in Toronto, the Texan had
already gone through the process of reinventing himself. Whatever
he's really thinking about his power pitching, he's publicly
playing it cowboy cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not my first rodeo,'' he said. ``I've been down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre mentioned that the bar for Clemens is so high to begin
with, that 9-4 is not 4-9. But George Steinbrenner did not make
David Wells a bummed-out Blue Jay to have Clemens come here and be
a right-handed version of Andy Pettitte. Cone said he has told
Clemens that the Yankees need him to be their power pitcher, which
he knows is nothing Clemens hasn't told himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell how much he wants to do well, how much he wants
to be part of this whole thing,'' Cone said. ``He's always been a
hyper guy, almost unapproachable on game day.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone couldn't help notice how Clemens was one of the first
Yankees out onto the field Sunday, to lift him up by his shirt
sleeve. Cone said he appreciated that, and feels for Clemens
because he has been in the same place more than once. Cone, also
36, understands how the great aging pitcher straddles the line
between where he has long been and where he must inevitably go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You constantly have to prove yourself,'' Cone said. ``Each
start, each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone shocked everyone, including himself, by winning 20 games
last year along the way to Yankee championship No. 24. Clemens won
20 in Toronto, but those victories don't mean anything here in New
York. Wells also pitches now to an era of almost 5, but Yankee fans
only want to use 1998 as their basis for comparison. In the memory
of Ed Whitson, they boo, which may be a fan's right but, in the
scheme of things to come, makes no sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as Cone said, ``Ultimately, the big games, the
post-season, are going to define his first year as a Yankee, should
we make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will have to play unspeakably bad not to. By coming
to New York, Clemens bought a whole season to get into a New York
state of mechanics, and mind. He has two months to find the key
that unlocks 1999. &QL;

 Three brains, two persons, one car  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Some partners in crime get arrested when they
act as if they don't have a brain between them.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, two young men were arrested when police discovered
them with one more brain than they could lay claim to.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a Lawrence, Kan., officer stopped the two about 1
a.m. Sunday for a traffic violation and then arrested them after
finding what was suspected to be marijuana. The human brain _
preserved in a plastic jar _ was in the trunk when police searched
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody claimed the brain,'' Sgt. George Wheeler said. ``They
said they all had one somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The brain had been swiped last year as a senior prank at a
Coffeyville, Kan., high school, Wheeler said. Police and school
officials were discussing ways to return the $500 science-class
prop.

SPOTLIGHT ON PUBLIC HOUSING AT CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Brightly painted Guinotte Manor homes beckon
from their Columbus Park enclave to Interstate 35 passers-by. A
previously neglected stage at Theron B. Watkins now holds youth
performances. And Choteau Court residents invited their beat cops
to this year's Fourth of July celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, times are changing in Kansas City's public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come a long way,'' said Connie Flowers, the resident
council president.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City will get a chance to showcase its public housing
beginning today, the start of a four-day national conference that
will bring more than 3,000 housing experts, including top officials
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   In Bartle Hall, visitors will discuss topics from crime-stopping
techniques to public-private partnerships for affordable housing.
During tours around town, visiting officials will also get a chance
to see Guinotte Manor's yellow paint and white porches, Theron B.
Watkins' youth programs and the career center in Riverview Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   All exemplify a turnaround from the outside of Kansas City's
public housing to the tenants living in them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a federal judge wrested the Housing Authority of Kansas
City from local control because of its numerous problems and
mismanagement. A Boston-based receiver was tapped to operate the
agency under court supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, federal officials gave the once-failing agency a
high-performing rating, an overall 90.25 percent score for fiscal
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be under the spotlight to some extent,'' said
Jeff Lines, president of TAG Associates, the receiver operating the
housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   While physical upgrades have been made, resident leaders and
their Legal Aid attorney say other services _ such as youth
programs, job training and apprenticeships _ are still lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have landed some jobs through a federal requirement
that public housing contractors hire and train residents for
construction jobs, Flowers said. However, she said, authority
enforcement of that program has been spotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take advantage of every opportunity,'' Flowers
said. ``That's how welfare-to-work happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet dramatic improvements have been made since receivership
began. When Lines took over, the authority had millions of dollars
in unspent funds available for improvements, a mark of
mismanagement by the previous officials, said Michael Sturmer, the
current development director.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Sturmer said, the Housing Authority will have
spent roughly $105 million _ from that unused money and other
grants _ to build or renovate developments.
</P>
<P>
   Guinotte Manor's overhaul began with a $47 million grant.
Riverview Gardens was revamped with $17 million. Along the Paseo,
$13 million was poured into Theron B. Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   Funds for most improvement programs came from the Hope VI
program, which Lines co-wrote. A Clinton administration program,
Hope VI funds public housing in 50 cities while trying to train
tenants to eventual independence.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City now has about 1,600 public housing units. In two
years, Sturmer said, 610 more will be redeveloped or built. By
2001, he said, all public housing units will be new or redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a big accomplishment for any authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Developments are also safer. In recent years, the authority
started enforcing the zero-tolerance policy against violence and
drug-related crimes, said Public Safety Director Harry Pottinger.
Any offenders are evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is down. One homicide was reported last year, compared
with four in 1995. In 1995, there were 46 robberies and 80
residential burglaries. In 1998, those figures were about halved
with 24 and 33, respectively. Sixty auto thefts in 1995 dropped to
43 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pottinger conceded that some statistics could be the result of
construction and development vacancies. But the decrease has
allowed his staff to respond to quality-of-life complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they call about junk cars,'' Pottinger said, ``we go out
and tow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Resident screening also got tough. Extensive checks of criminal
records are now standard, said Eric Scott, who is charged with
Guinotte Manor's overhaul. An applicant's two previous landlords
are checked, and the current home is inspected. Said Scott: ``We
have pretty much the cream of the crop left.''
</P>
<P>
   Lines said authority department heads have also worked to
emphasize customer service and establish performance standards
among staff members. Standards are there so staff members can
notice _ and quickly address _ any downturns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now,'' he said, ``we have been in recovery mode.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a question: What will happen when the receivership
ends in a few years?
</P>
<P>
   Lines said formal talks and research into establishing
self-governance will begin later this year. ``I'm optimistic,'' he
said.

TACOMA CONFERENCE EXPLORES DILEMMA OF GAY EVANGELICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Michael Darling considers himself an evangelical
Christian, but don't expect to find him in the pews Sunday
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncomfortable when someone from the pulpit says that
homosexuality is a horrible, sinful thing, even though you have a
love of God, a belief in God,'' said Darling, a gay Seattle man.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the gulf between the disparate gay and Christian
communities are scores of believers like Darling. More than 200
homosexuals will gather in Tacoma this week for the 20th annual
conference of Evangelicals Concerned Western Region, a fellowship
of gays and lesbians. The event runs from Thursday through Sunday
at the University of Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering comes one year after a group of ``ex-gay''
Christians met in SeaTac, Wash., for a conference of Exodus
International, an organization at odds with Evangelicals Concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as either too evangelical or too pro-homosexual,
Evangelicals Concerned members find themselves criticized, if not
ostracized, by the gay and Christian communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looked on as suspect from both sides,'' said
Peter Benson, a Seattle antique shop owner and longtime member of
Evangelicals Concerned, which holds Bible studies and produces a
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals stress personal conversion through faith in Jesus
Christ, adherence to Scripture and proclaiming the Gospel message.
Ralph Blair, a New York psychotherapist who founded the national
group in 1975, said evangelicals who also are homosexuals keep a
low profile because they have few places to openly worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the churches that are more welcoming (toward gays and
lesbians) are not particularly all that evangelical,'' Blair said.
``And the more evangelical churches are not so welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Pilgrim Congregational Church/United Church of
Christ in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighbhorhood supports
Evangelicals Concerned ``in the sense that they are providing
spiritual homes for gays and lesbians who have been abandoned by
their evangelical roots,'' said the Rev. Mark Travis, who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   But his liberal church parts company with Evangelicals Concerned
on the critical theological issue of attaining eternal life. ``I
just don't believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to
salvation,'' Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christian churches teach that the Bible calls
homosexuality a sin, like adultery, drunkenness and greed.
</P>
<P>
   An evangelical is one who ``accepts the word of God as
authoritative,'' said the Rev. Joe Fuiten of Cedar Park Assembly in
Bothell. ``You can't be an evangelical and accept the authority of
Scripture and accept homosexual practice. To call yourself a `gay
evangelical' is an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scriptures cited as prohibitions against homosexuality
include Leviticus 18:22 in the Old Testament (``Do not lie with a
man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable'') and I
Corinthians 6:9-10 (``Neither the sexually immoral... nor
homosexual offenders... will inherit the kingdom of God'') in the
New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals Concerned refers to those and four other Scriptures
as ``clobber passages,'' saying the verses are used by Christians
to figuratively beat up homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe (those Scriptures) do not condemn gays and
lesbians,'' said Benson, a former board member of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals Concerned considers the Leviticus passage as a
reference to ritual uncleanliness, not a moral or ethical issue and
views the I Corinthians passage as an admonition against a man
having sex with a boy, and not a prohibition of sex between two
men.
</P>
<P>
   The group also believes God allows partners of the same sex to
have ``committed, monogamous, lifelong relationships,'' Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Darling, who is treasurer of Evangelicals Concerned,
acknowledges that those interpretations fly in the face of
traditional biblical understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are lots and lots of interpretations of the
Bible,'' he said. ``It's probably an argument that will not totally
be settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davies, executive director of Exodus International, a
Seattle-based coalition of 98 ex-gay ministries in the United
States and Canada, said those who grow up in the Christian church
have three options when they discover they are attracted to their
own sex:
</P>
<P>
   ``One is to dump your Christianity. The church teaches that
that's sin. Another reaction is to try to change your homosexuality
and continue with your Christian beliefs,'' which is the plan
promoted by Exodus International, a group criticized by
Evangelicals Concerned.
</P>
<P>
   A third option is to reconcile homosexuality and faith, the path
taken by Evangelicals Concerned. ``I personally believe that their
attempt to interpret what the Bible says about homosexuality is in
error,'' Davies said. ``It's a false resolution of the dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the criticism, some members of Evangelical Concerns
question whether even to raise the issue of their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far more important that persons we meet know that we are
Christians than it is they know we are gay.... So often the
emphasis is on our gayness rather than our faith,'' wrote Jeri M.
of Chicago in a recent Evangelicals Concerned newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals Concerned President Jan Rich of Renton addressed
the matter of the group's name in another newsletter. Some members
want to drop the word ``evangelical'' because they associate it
with negative stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus was evangelical,'' Rich said. ``He told the good news.
That's what we're all about: communicating the good news that Jesus
died for everyone, exclusive of sexual orientation and a myriad of
other things.''

RELIEVER HAD BIG FIRST HALF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif.  &UR; _ &LR;  It's been said that every dark cloud has its
silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark cloud hovering over the Anaheim Angels' 1999 season,
it could be argued that relief pitcher Mark Petkovsek qualifies for
silver lining status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a tremendous first half,'' said Angels manager Terry
Collins. ``You can't ask for any more than the job he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   That's saying a lot, considering Petkovsek, 33, was almost an
afterthought among the team's off-season acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Between November and December of 1998, the Angels signed free
agent first baseman Mo Vaughn to a six-year, $80 million package
and free agent starter Tim Belcher to a two-year, $10.2 million
deal. But the team also traded catcher Matt Garrick to St. Louis
for Petkovsek and his $800,000 annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the season, Belcher and Vaughn have had
unremarkable and injury-plagued seasons. Petkovsek, on the other
hand, has found his niche as a setup man and is having a stellar
year after a career marked by ups and downs as both a starter and a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   As 1999 wears on, Petkovsek continues to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to keep him as fresh as we could,'' Collins said.
``It's like every time he goes out he throws the ball over and
makes quality pitches. He keeps the ball down and doesn't beat
himself by throwing a lot of base on balls. He's done a tremendous
job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek, a right-hander, leads American League pitchers with a
1.74 earned run average. His 9-2 record is tops on the team.
Opponents are batting just .223 when they face him. He has 21
strikeouts, just nine walks and has allowed just 10 hits in 46 2/3
innings through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Matt Walbeck attributes that dominance to a variety of
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing a lot of strikes and getting the ball down in
the strike zone,'' Walbeck said. ``His mound presence has been
superb. He doesn't give in to hitters; he's not afraid of hitters.
He's had a great first half and you can't say enough about the job
he's done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Petkovsek, he's a bit modest about his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to help out the team. I have a role and the key
right now is to grind it out,'' he said in a soft south Texas
drawl. ``Check with me again in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Modesty aside, Petkovsek's appearance last Thursday night
against the Dodgers was a typical outing. With the score tied 6-6
in the top half of the ninth, Angels reliever Al Levine gave up a
single to Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Right away Collins was on the phone to the bullpen and calling
for Petkovsek. As a Jimi Hendrix song blasted through the Edison
Field public address system, Petkovsek jogged to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I take the same mental approach whether we're
leading by 10 or the other guys are up by five,'' Petkovsek said.
``When that phone rings I could be asked to go in there, so I've
got to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepared he was. Petkovsek faced six batters, gave up one hit,
recorded a strikeout and got the win after Vaughn singled home
Randy Velarde in the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of what I do is to get the team into a
position so we can win,'' Petkovsek said. ``It's been a challenge
and I've had my question marks, but it's a role that I'm getting
more and more comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to success in the big leagues proved to be a long one
for Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the majors after a collegiate career at the
University of Texas in which he compiled a 29-3 record. Fifteen of
those wins came in 1987, the year Petkovsek was chosen
All-Southwest Conference and signed as a free agent with the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek bounced around the minors. The 6-foot, 190-pounder
played in Charlotte (Single-A), Tulsa (Double-A) and Oklahoma City
(Triple-A) before making his major league debut with the Rangers in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the days of BYOG  &UR; _ &LR;  bring your own gum,''
Petkovsek recalled. ``But it's part of the whole process. You
appreciate the little things a lot, like gum in the dugout, when
you finally make it in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were a bit rocky for Petkovsek in those early years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he pitched just 9 1/3 innings for the Rangers but gave
up 16 runs on 21 hits and went back to Oklahoma City with a 14.46
ERA. In January 1992, Petkovsek was signed as a free agent by the
Pittsburgh Pirates and assigned to Buffalo. He was called up in
1993, appeared in 26 games and compiled a 3-0 record with a 6.96
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was on to Houston as a minor league free agent in
March 1994 and St. Louis as a minor league free agent in November
1994. Petkovsek's first full seasons in the big leagues came in
1997 and 1998. Over time he developed a reputation as a pitcher who
could be used in a variety of situations. Starter, closer, long
reliever, short reliever, set-up man  &UR; _ &LR;  Petkovsek did it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of enjoyed that as being my calling card,'' Petkovsek
said. ``I liked being available for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels, Petkovsek has found a niche. He's lost some
speed off his fastball, but gained control and confidence. And he's
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,'' Petkovsek said.
``I'm very fortunate that I'm doing something that I like to do.
Maybe that's why it took me so long to get up here to the big
leagues. I was just enjoying the game where ever I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``this is where you want to play.''

SWELTERING TEMPERATURES LEAVE RESIDENTS CRAVING RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ 'Tis the season _ to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. Summer has finally settled in with all its sunshine,
wilting humidity and blast-furnace heat. Tuesday, with a
temperature of 95 degrees, was one of the hottest days of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high in Kansas City is expected to reach 97 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, hot, dry weather, the hallmark of July, is going to
hang around for at least a week, said Pat Cooper, a forecaster at
the National Weather Service in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a stagnant weather pattern,'' Cooper said. ``We have
a ridge of high pressure, both at the surface and all the way
through the atmosphere, that's not untypical in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the jet stream in Canada, you can get a large area of
high pressure built up in the Midwest, and it can be stubborn to
move. This system is going to be here at least for the next week,
if not longer. It could even stay for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's heat index reached 96 degrees by 11 a.m. The index is
a measure that combines heat and humidity _ gauging the misery more
accurately than just mercury rising in a thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   And when the heat index reaches 95 degrees by 11 a.m. Kansas
City posts advisories, which means people should stay out of the
sun and limit activity.
</P>
<P>
   But Midwesterners are used to dealing with the heat. Some,
however, endure it better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's hot. So what?'' asked Andre Parks, a roofer,
applying shingles on top of a second-story house on 27th Street on
Tuesday afternoon. ``This is not unusual. This is just the way it
is....That's why they call this work.
</P>
<P>
   Parks added that ``sure, I'd love to go home and sit in the AC,
but pretty soon they'd turn off my electricity because I wouldn't
be makin' no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone may be feeling the heat, it's still not hot
enough to open area shelters, said Dan Lindholm, chairman of the
Kansas City Area Heat Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is far from the temperatures of a heat emergency
that would trigger the opening of air-conditioned shelters and
other measures to protect people at risk of heat-related illness,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting uncomfortable, but we're not experiencing
the extremes where we have morbidity (illness) and mortality,''
Lindholm said. ``Our people are very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a heat emergency is declared, one of three criteria must
be met:
</P>
<P>
   - The heat index reaches 105 degrees by 11 a.m. three days in a
row;
</P>
<P>
   - The nighttime temperature does not fall below 85 degrees; or
</P>
<P>
   - The heat index soars to 130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still about 10 to 15 degrees away from the levels of
heat intensity where we would be raising our red flags higher,''
Lindholm said. ``Actually, this is average for July. I'd like it to
be cooler. My utility bill would like it to be cooler, but this is
not surprising at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindholm is steering people who want out of the heat and into
air-conditioning to the Kansas City and Mid-Continent public
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross was prepared to take calls from people seeking a
place to cool off, but by late Tuesday afternoon hadn't received
any.
</P>
<P>
   A check of hospital emergency rooms Tuesday turned up only one
minor casualty of the heat. An 80-year-old woman passed out while
carrying her groceries home in the early afternoon sun. She was
taken to Baptist Medical Center where she was given fluids and then
released.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kansas City area has seen plenty of rain this year
_ 28.61 inches compared to a normal rate at 20.35 inches _ July so
far has been dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of midnight Sunday night, for this month we've had 0.39 of
an inch,'' Cooper said. ``Normally, for the month we should have
had 2.77.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of rain, however, city streets got a dousing
after extreme temperatures caused the ground to shift, snapping
water lines.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1:30 and 2 a.m. Tuesday, a 10-inch main broke at Seventh
and Main streets downtown and a 16-inch main snapped near Northeast
52nd Street and Gunn Avenue and North Topping Avenue in the
Northland.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so little rain, a lot of people are watering their yards,
putting a lot of demand on water pipes,'' said Colleen Newman, a
spokeswoman for the Water Services Department. ``Either watering or
heat was possibly the main culprits in two water main breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The break Tuesday marked the main's 100th rupture in 30 years
and sent thousands of gallons of water rushing into the streets.
One hundred to 150 homes were without water from 8 a.m. to about
1:30 p.m. while work crews replaced the 22 feet of ruptured pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said repairs on the pipes at Seventh and Main did not
disrupt service to several downtown buildings or the nearby Folgers
coffee plant.

ROCKETDYNE EMPLOYEES TELL HOW THEY HELPED POWER AMERICA'S GREAT
JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All they had to use were slide rules and some of
the best engineering minds in America _ but that was all they
needed to send men to the moon 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who made it possible _ and their successors _
gathered Tuesday at Boeing's Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power in
Canoga Park in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley to celebrate that
accomplishment, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, in my group there was only one guy with
a calculator. It couldn't even figure square roots,'' said Ronald
Urquidi, an engineer who began working on engines at Rocketdyne in
1962. The most advanced computer on the Earth was actually on the
lunar module.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Urquidi and the 22,000 other employees at Rocketdyne's peak
in the mid-1960s were able to create the six types of rocket
engines that sent Apollo astronauts into space, to the moon and
back. Examples of those were on display in the Rocketdyne parking
lot for the celebration, amid balloons and refreshments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great times. We were working 60 hours a week, and
really enjoying our work,'' said John Klea, 57, who worked on
sensors that measured whether the rockets were working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Klea was still attending Penn State University, just before he
came to work for Rocketdyne in 1962, when President John F. Kennedy
made his challenge to send a man to the moon by the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea I would be attached to a program that would make
that happen,'' he said. ``The moment they landed on the moon, I
thought my heart was going to jump out of my chest. The fantasy had
actually been accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirees and engineers with 40 years of service examined the
engines on display Tuesday _ machines identical to the ones used in
the Apollo missions, which themselves dropped into the ocean or
burned up in the atmosphere after their jobs were done.
</P>
<P>
   They talked with junior colleagues and gestured with rolled up
commemorative posters of Buzz Aldrin, pointing at pipes and hoses
and assemblies they helped perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Other employees milled about, munching chocolate and marshmallow
Moon Pies the company provided in honor of the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Some stood in the shadow of the massive F-1 rocket engine, which
can produce 1.5million pounds of thrust and is on permanent display
in the Rocketdyne parking lot. Five of the engines in unison lifted
the towering Saturn V rocket off the ground to begin the lunar
journey. Four decades after it was designed, the F-1 is still the
most powerful rocket engine in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The display also showed the SE-8 rocket engine _ smaller than a
loaf of bread _ six of which were used to maneuver the Apollo space
capsule so it wouldn't burn up re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And the systems these engineers created are still being used
today to launch communications satellites into Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the drawings I work on are older than I am. It's like
working on a piece of history or national heritage,'' said Cameron
Nosler, a 27-year-old engineer who has been with the company two
years and who works on Atlas and Delta rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers Julie Souders, 24, and Alfons Menanno, 23, took time
from their jobs in the company's kinetic energy weapons division to
examine the handiwork of colleagues laboring a decade before either
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the cool things about working here is the prestigious
past,'' said Menanno, whose father was a Rocketdyne engineer on the
Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could've been back there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even to be a fly on the wall,'' Souders added. ``It's
impressive to read the history behind it all. Every time the
Shuttle goes up, this company has a hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they recognize they're living and working in a different
age, in which most Americans take space travel for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was a kid, the Shuttle going up was a big
thing and it was always televised,'' Souders said. ``Now they don't
even televise it.''
</P>
<P>
   And during Apollo, she said, work at Rocketdyne was more driven
_ ``everything to get to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, money was no object. Now a project's cost is the primary
concern, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the change in philosophy and objective, they said
they're glad to have joined the lineage of engineers who powered
men to Earth's nearest neighbor in space, built the Shuttle's main
engines, build rockets that routinely push satellites into orbit,
devised the power system for the international space station under
construction above the atmosphere and are working on the engines
for the X-33, the Space Shuttle's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line,'' Menanno said, ``you still feel like you're
working on part of something big.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In baseball, you can't buy victories.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore
Orioles this season are prime examples. The teams rank second and
third in total payroll but are far from playoff contention and they
aren't very cost effective.
</P>
<P>
   A computer study of the payrolls of all 30 major-league teams
shows both the Dodgers and Orioles are spending more than $1
million per victory _ highest in the majors _ yet both clubs are
languishing in the depths of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a business predicated on talent judgments,'' said
Sandy Alderson, vice president in charge of operations for Major
League Baseball and former general manager of the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about probabilities. Sometimes you get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which examined the ratio between payroll and winning
percentage of all 30 teams projected through the rest of the
season, revealed that the Montreal Expos are baseball's most
efficient team, paying players $260,895 per win (the amount is
based on a team's total payroll divided by its current winning
percentage projected over a 162-game season.) That doesn't mean
they are successful, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, with baseball's best record, are paying
$680,616 per win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reflective of the game today,'' said former
Dodgers general manager Fred Claire. ``You really need to break it
down to how much you pay per win. In some ways, when you throw that
into the equation, you get a realistic look at what's taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary figures used in the computer study are those for the
830 major- league baseball players on opening-day rosters and
disabled lists. The figures are obtained annually from management
and player sources by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball payrolls have been steadily escalating since the
strike-shortened 1994 season. As payrolls have grown, the
competitive gap between teams in large markets such as Los Angeles
and New York and those in small markets such as Kansas City and
Montreal has also grown.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, it took a payroll of more than $48 million to make
the playoffs. The Yankees, who paid $65 million to assemble
baseball's best team of the 1990s, won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But paying top dollar isn't the surest way to success, noted
Claire. The secret lies in achieving some sort of balance between
multimillionaire veterans and lower-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have players making $250,000 or $300,000 on your team
performing in all-star fashion, that helps you balance out,''
Claire said. ``You must have youth coming into your team or you can
never get balance between performance and payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, with baseball's largest payroll, have 17 players
who will earn more than $1 million this season. But the team also
has six players making less than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dodgers, eight players on the team's opening-day
roster make less than $300,000. But the team also has 18 players
making more than $1 million, including baseball's richest player,
Kevin Brown, who will make $10.7 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among cost-effective teams in the study, the Oakland A's have 13
players making less than $300,000; the Cincinnati Reds have 10
players making less than $300,000 and only eight making more than
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has never guaranteed success, but it can be a
prerequisite,'' said Alderson. ``What happens over the course of
162 games is a lot different than what happens over 81.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners slugger Ken Griffey Jr. agreed with Claire's
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how much you pay somebody,'' Griffey said.
``It's the guys you get and how they click together; do they
complement one another?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who will earn $8.5 million this season, pointed out
when a team does poorly many times it's the highly paid players _
not the rookies making scale _ who become objects of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of people looking to us as targets because of
how much we make,'' he said. ``You make an out at the ballpark and
some guy jumps all over you. You make an error and he's all over
you again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that guy doesn't think. It's BASEBALL. It happens all the
time. The fact is, you get paid more when you put in five, six or
seven good years. And you need the guys just coming up to round
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's understands all too well the
link between payroll and performance. Oakland has the
fourth-smallest payroll in baseball, $22 million, and little chance
of making the playoffs this season despite being on track to win 80
games in the weak AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it tough to play the whole season on a team with a
$20 million payroll,'' Giambi said. ``But it's a Catch-22. If we
spent more money, would the fans come out? I'm not sure they
would.''

HELLING HELPS RANGERS ROLL ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Don't be surprised if the July 31 trade
deadline passes without the handiwork of Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 6-3 victory against the San Francisco Giants
further suggests that the American League West-leading Rangers will
not need their general manager's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers swept the three-game series with the National League
West-leading Giants at The Ballpark in Arlington and matched their
high-water mark of 13 games above .500 with only 10 days remaining
before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see us playing the way we're playing right
now,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``We've made a lot of very nice
defensive plays. We've made some big pitches when we've had to, and
we've beaten some pretty good ballclubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling helped the Rangers remain five games
in front of the pesky Oakland Athletics, who kept pace in the AL
West with their victory against the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (7-7) struggled with his control during most of his 6
2/3-inning appearance, but the Rangers' best starter never broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give him credit,'' Oates said. ``He made a lot
of 3-1 and 2-0 pitches when he had to and pitched deep into the
ballgame, despite not throwing a lot of strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling's ball-strike ratio _ 60 strikes, 48 balls _ illustrated
that, but the Giants never produced a runner beyond first base
until Barry Bonds' one-out, seventh-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like my breaking ball was pretty good,'' Helling said.
``I think the only bad one I threw was the one to Bonds. I didn't
feel like I had my best fastball or my best location, but it was
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' two-run homer barely dented the Rangers' six-run lead,
but a walk to Stan Javier and an infield single to Rich Aurilia
ended Helling's evening.
</P>
<P>
   That upset the pitcher, and it showed when Oates went to the
mound to replace him with left-hander Mike Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only pitch I hung all night was to a future Hall of Fame
player, and he did what you're supposed to do with it,'' Helling
said of the 1-1 curveball Bonds hit. ``I felt I was good enough to
go seven, eight or nine innings. That's just my mentality, though.
I was more mad at myself. It had nothing to do with Johnny's
decision. It was the right move there with the left-handed hitters
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Venafro surrendered a run-scoring single to pinch hitter Scott
Servais, but he would be the Giants' final base runner. Thus, the
early runs provided by third baseman Todd Zeile _ who delivered a
two-run, first-inning single _ and two runs batted in by catcher
Ivan Rodriguez would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   That could be Melvin's stance at the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a veteran ballclub,'' Rangers second baseman Mark
McLemore said. ``We don't have a bunch of guys scanning newspapers
and rosters trying to see who's available. We're going out and
taking care of business. It'll be great if we get someone. It'll be
great if we don't get anyone. Our job is to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and Oates remain convinced that the Rangers would not
have won the 1998 AL West title without the July 31 additions of
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, shortstop Royce Clayton and third
baseman Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a different situation this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a better ballclub,'' Oates said. ``We had some
glaring deficiencies that needed to be addressed last year.''

SAFECO HAS PLUS SIDE FOR HITTERS; JUST ASK DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's not quite accurate to say the Kingdome was a
hitters' park. From a pure hitting standpoint, the Dome's short
fences and juiced air often nurtured bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Because balls don't travel as well at Safeco Field, the
Mariners' new home could have the opposite effect. Mariners hitting
coach Jesse Barfield has already noticed the way Safeco is helping
one of his pupils.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark has helped Russ Davis more than anything,''
Barfield said. ``You're not going to get any cheap home runs here.
He's now thinking more line drives than home runs. You're not going
to muscle balls out of here _ you've got to get line drives and get
your arms extended. It's helped him in that way, because it's not
as tempting as the Kingdome. Now you've got to be a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit the first Safeco Field homer on Saturday _ a line
drive over the left-field wall _ and was 6-for-18 over the first
five games there. After batting .157 in his last 27 games before
the All-Star break, the third baseman said he's comfortable again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the ball well here,'' Davis said. ``But I was starting
to feel more comfortable at the plate even before it opened up. It
ain't the first time I've been through it. ... If I go in the well
for a while, I know I'm going to come out of it. Put your work in,
start concentrating better and good things start happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he's come to realize that there's a time to work on
mechanics, and that time isn't during games. He and Barfield talk
mechanics in batting practice, but ``see ball, hit ball'' theories
have to take over later.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he said, experience has taught him that baseball's a
game of subtle adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get away from making adjustments day in and day
out,'' Davis said, ``because that's totally what it is _ every
pitcher, every pitch, every day, you're adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some things that stay consistent when Davis is
swinging well. For one, he's been using his legs effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Russ was in his funk, he's very jumpy at the plate, real
quick,'' Barfield said. ``Right now, he's very smooth, and he's not
leaving his back side until the pitcher throws the ball. It helps
him stay closed. His timing is real good, and his rhythm is
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   SPLIT DECISION: The newest addition to Ken Cloude's repetoire,
the split-finger fastball, doesn't come naturally to the M's
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have real big hands,'' he explained, opening his palm
for evidence. ``It would probably be easier for a guy with bigger
hands to split his fingers a little wider. The biggest thing for me
is not to try to make it do something, just throw it and let it do
what it's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The splitter is Cloude's fifth pitch; he also has a fastball,
slider, curve and changeup. As a reliever, though, he usually
throws only two or three different pitches per outing. He'll have
the fastball and slider every game, and if the splitter is working,
he'll have that, too. If not, he'll use his changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, manager Lou Piniella hoped right-handers Mark
Leiter and Mac Suzuki would be effective against left-handed
hitters because of their splitters. Cloude's splitter, however,
isn't intended for lefties. He said he's always been comfortable
using all his pitches to left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the righties I lock myself into only two pitches, the
fastball and slider,'' Cloude said. ``Throwing the splitter to
righties is another look. It's not to throw another pitch to a
lefty. I'm just trying to come up with something different. Maybe
it'll work for me, maybe it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed hitters were 0-for-6 off Cloude on Sunday, his
first game using the new pitch.

SOX GET BACK IN THE SWING
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-MARLINS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jimy Williams cackled when asked if he thought he'd be
misty-eyed over the end of interleague play for another summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I imagine I will be, won't I?'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   This was before the Sox' 7-1 spanking Tuesday night of the
Florida Marlins, the last game the Sox will have this season
against a National League rival, barring an October date in the
World Series. That, of course, is something that hasn't happened
around here in 13 years, back when they were playing against Mookie
Wilson, the Mets' outfielder, instead of his kid Preston, the
Marlins' outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a happy exercise, this interleague business. The
Sox won just 6 of 18 meetings against their cousins in the National
League, and had to beat a World Series MVP to salvage the rubber
game of a three-game set against the last-place team in the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   But rookie Brian Rose was equal to the task, outpitching Cuban
righthander Livan Hernandez, hero of the '97 Series, while his
batterymate, catcher Jason Varitek (home run, four RBIs), took care
of the offense, which still has Nomar Garciaparra struggling to
regain his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor in the win? ``This was the best defensive game
anyone has played against us all year,'' said Marlins manager John
Boles, who watched Darren Lewis run down six balls in center field,
Trot Nixon make a diving catch in right, and former Marlin farmhand
Brian Daubach, who never got a chance in Florida because he was
seen as a defensive liability, making a diving stop at first base
with the bases loaded in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice,'' said Daubach, who hasn't missed a day of
taking groundballs since spring training. ``At the time, it was a
big play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is getting confidence in the field. In that
way, it's a lot like hitting. I feel a lot better with the glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, back in the lineup after a night off to rest his
strained left groin, went hitless with a walk in five plate
appearances and is just 3 for 22 (.136) since returning to the
lineup. The All-Star shortstop, who was 0 for 4 with a sacrifice
fly on Sunday, went hitless in consecutive starts for the first
time this season; that happened just twice last season.
</P>
<P>
   But after John Valentin gave the Sox a 1-0 lead in the first
with his eighth home run, Varitek followed a two-out single by
Reggie Jefferson with a home run into the right-field bullpen, his
13th of the season and fourth in six games since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, starting for just the third time since June 23,
singled again in the sixth and took third when Marlins left fielder
Danny Bautista, after catching Varitek's liner, threw the ball over
the Sox dugout in an attempt to double up Jefferson at first. Lewis
ripped a single past second baseman Luis Castillo to make it 4-1,
and an inning later, Varitek delivered a two-run single off
reliever Vic Darensbourg, who then gave up an RBI single to Lewis
for the final Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team doesn't rely on one part of the lineup,''
said Varitek, who came into the game batting just .162 (12 for 74)
with runners in scoring position. ``For us to win, it's got to come
from different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek's four RBIs came on a night that Rose allowed just four
singles in seven innings, an enormous relief to an overburdened
bullpen that had pitched almost twice as many innings (23 2/3) as
Sox starters (12 1/3) in the previous four games. ``I've got just
one job on my day, and that's to help this ball club win, no matter
what's going on,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was the first Sox starter in the last 11 games to pitch
past the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has kept us in every game he's pitched in,'' Williams
said of Rose, who improved his record to 6-2, 2-0 in four starts
against NL teams. ``And clearly, tonight was big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Scott Hatteberg went down with an elbow injury, the
catching burden has fallen almost entirely on Varitek, who is
playing in just his second full season. He has said his hitting is
secondary to what he does behind the plate, but since the All-Star
break, he is hitting .455 (10 for 22) with nine RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's the best catcher I've been around,'' said pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``Toughness, he's conscientious about his
pitchers, thinking and caring about his defense, his pitch-calling,
and the opposing hitters first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts his offense aside, all for the sake of the pitching
staff. That's really hard to do. And he's one tough SOB. He's old
school, the best catcher I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had 12 hits in winning for just the eighth time in their
last 20 games. Rookie Nixon had two singles in three trips, giving
him 10 hits in his last 14 at-bats. Only leadoff man Jose Offerman
(0 for 5) failed to reach base.
</P>
<P>
   But even Offerman played his part. Nixon, whose diving catch of
Mark Kotsay's sinking liner came while the Marlins were cuffing
Rose in the fourth, gave the Sox second baseman some credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Offy's work as a fungo hitter?'' Nixon said.
``(Coach) Dave Jauss can't hit 'em because of his broken hand, so
Offy hit some real rockets to the outfield. He had me running all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Williams, who has made no secret of his dislike for
interleague play, and he'll tell you the Sox' place is in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague play was fun,'' Nixon said, ``but it'll be good to
get back to playing games against teams in the AL East and AL
Central. We're getting toward the stretch run, where we've got to
make a move.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Stellar pitching has masked the blemishes in the Astros' offense in
recent games, but the mascara finally began to run Tuesday, and the
Astros found out what would happen if the pitching suddenly
vanished for a night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That meant outslugging the Cleveland Indians, something the
Astros didn't come close to doing in a 7-1 loss before a crowd of
41,133 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' season-best winning streak ended at eight, and the
loss allowed the second-place Reds to move within two games of the
Astros in the National League Central standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streaks start with one game,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``Hopefully, we'll start another one tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   After sleepwalking through the first two games of the series,
the most feared offense in the majors finally came alive. The
Indians scored five runs in six innings against Astros starter
Shane Reynolds and two more off reliever Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had only 10 hits in the first two games of the
series, which were two more than collected by the Astros, who
somehow managed to win both games. The odds were against the
continuation of that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take two out of three,'' Dierker said. ``If we take two
out of three every time we play, we'll win our division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are hitting just .247 over their last 10 games _ 16
points below their season average _ and they've been held to three
or fewer runs in six of their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   But any evaluation of the Astros' offense Tuesday must take into
account the fact they were facing a pitcher who consistently threw
95 to 99 mph and drew an ovation from the fans when he reached 100
mph on the radar gun in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bartolo Colon held the Astros to five hits, and Jeff Bagwell's
fourth-inning solo home run represented his only lapse in eight
innings of work. Houstonian Mike Jackson worked the final inning to
close out the Indians' victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the Indians are looking for a No. 1
starter,'' said Astros second baseman Craig Biggio, who extended
his hitting streak to 12 games with an infield single in the
eighth. ``When a guy is throwing 98, 99, 100 mph in the eighth
inning, that's pretty impressive. He put the ball wherever he
wanted to, and he stayed ahead in the count. He was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping back-to-back interleague series, the Astros were
aiming for three in a row, and with Reynolds on the mound, that's
usually not an unreasonable thought to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds (10-7) hasn't been himself lately, posting a 6.56
ERA and yielding a .368 opponents' batting average over his last
four starts. Nevertheless, Tuesday marked his first loss since June
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a slump right now,'' Reynolds said. ``I've been giving
up some big innings, and I can't expect the guys to keep bailing me
out and picking me up every game. I at least have to give the team
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-out walk to Jim Thome came back to haunt Reynolds in the
second inning. Third baseman Enrique Wilson hit a low-and-away
pitch down the line into shallow left field, scoring Thome with the
first run of the game. Television replays seemed to indicate the
ball Wilson hit for a double landed in foul territory, but
third-base umpire Ed Rapuano decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   More two-out trouble surfaced in the third when the Indians put
together four consecutive hits, including a three-run homer by
major-league RBI leader Manny Ramirez, who was hitless in his first
eight at-bats of the series. Ramirez has driven in 101 runs this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have gotten out of that inning without giving up
the home run, I could have at least kept it close,'' said Reynolds,
who went to a 3-2 count before Ramirez's homer. ``I got the pitch
down _ it was a fastball away. He was able to get his arms
extended, and he hit it to the big part of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians might have done more damage in the third if not for
Richard Hidalgo's 12th outfield assist of the year. He gunned down
David Justice, who was trying to stretch a double into a triple but
instead became the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's 31st homer pulled the Astros within 4-1, but Thome's
sixth-inning sacrifice fly reinstated the Indians' four-run lead.

GOLFER FOR HIRE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There are a lot of good golfers out there, and no
one is more acutely aware of that than Matthew Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Agoura Hills resident won the New Zealand Open
earlier this year but remains a man without regular playing
privileges on any professional tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a situation where I've won a nice tournament and don't
have anywhere to play,'' said Lane, a transplanted New Zealander
who played college golf on scholarship at Oklahoma University.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kiwi, who completed his college career in 1990, has
been trying since then to earn a living as a professional player _
this summer on the Canadian Tour via sponsors' exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian Tour has been great to me,'' said Lane, who
finished 16th, 11 and third in his first three events this year.
``They've got 18 (sponsors') invitations each week compared to two
on the Nike Tour. When you've got 18, you've got a good chance of
getting in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who grew up in Wellington, N.Z., has lived in the Conejo
Valley since meeting his wife, Terri, who was reared in the area.
They now have two children, and Lane _ who played the past four
years on the Nike Tour but has no current full-time status _ was
thinking of giving up his pro dream seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his father Bob offered to pay airfare to this year's New
Zealand Open. Lane took the trip, only to learn when arriving at
Formosa GC in Auckland that he had to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went halfway around the world and had to play a Monday
qualifier to get in,'' he said, ``but in the end it made it more
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   The end also had its drama, as Lane broke out of a three-way tie
for first to finish eagle-par-birdie in a final-round 64. It earned
him a three-stroke victory over a field that included former
Masters champion Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just any Mickey Mouse tournament,'' said former
Australian tour player Mel Lewis, a 30-year New Zealand PGA member
who is now tournament director at Tarzana's Braemar Country Club.
``World-class players play in the New Zealand Open, and Matthew did
well to win it. I know he's going to break through one of these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' hunch is shared by members at Braemar, where Lane
practices and holds the east-course record of 61, and at Calabasas
Country Club, where Lane also holds the course record at 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a player, no doubt about that,'' said Calabasas head pro
Dave Bartholomew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had just one quarter of his talent,'' said Lewis, who
knew Lane's father while growing up in New Zealand and helped
secure practice privileges for Lane at Braemar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got so much potential,'' Lewis said. ``I played three
years on the Australasian Tour and against Bob Charles when we were
kids. I've played with a lot of good players and I've never seen
anybody who had the potential and natural talent this guy's got.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Lewis recalls the day Lane was hitting practice
wedge shots to a green from 80 yards, never looking up but calling
out the yardage of each shot, short or long, and seldom missing
with those estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who once shot 60 in a Nike Tour event at the Greensboro
Open, hopes his New Zealand Open success can springboard him to
full-time status at this year's PGA Tour qualifying school.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll take work wherever he can find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means going to Canada, then that's what I'll do,'' he
said. ``Golf is such a crazy game.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THERE will be no Randy Johnson in the Astros' future this year.
Unless, that is, his name happens to be Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   With the trading deadline only 10 days off, it seems clear, for
a number of reasons, that general manager Gerry Hunsicker has no
hope of reprising the whopper of a deal a year ago that turned the
Big Unit into a rent-a-'Stro for a couple of entrancing but
ultimately unfulfilling months.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, there will be no one remotely of Johnson's
caliber available whom the Astros would have a chance of landing.
And furthermore, even if there were, it would make little sense for
the Astros in their current depleted state to roll the dice at the
cost of what few top-drawer prospects they have left.
</P>
<P>
   They've held on admirably through a cruel and unusual spate of
injuries and illnesses, but you can't expect postseason miracles
without a corresponding miracle comeback from Moises Alou or Ken
Caminiti _ or, better, both.
</P>
<P>
   This team, plain and simple, can't squeeze any more want-to out
of itself. If there were records for same, the Astros would be
breaking them. To have won eight in a row before Tuesday's 7-1
reality bite courtesy of the humbled Indians was, by any measure, a
stunning accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reynolds is perhaps the one guy from whom they can
_ rather, must _ extract a little extra production. I said
production, mind you, not effort. It's hardly a work-ethic thing
with Shane, a one-man chain gang when it comes to perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, he isn't pitching as well as we have come to
expect him to. Having said that, it's possible our expectations are
greater than they should be, that Reynolds is the consummate
overachiever. But even if he has willed himself into being the
staff ace, for which he received a fat three-year contract
extension over the winter, he hasn't lived up to such a billing in
'99.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, two other Astros starters _ Jose Lima and Mike
Hampton _ made the All-Star team, as did reliever Billy Wagner. In
February, you couldn't have foreseen the Astros sending three
pitchers to Boston and Reynolds not among them. After a 19-win
season a year ago, he appeared poised to cement his status as one
of the National League's elite pitchers, his entrenched anonymity
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   And with 10 victories before the break plus an 11th on hold
until Friday, when surely the Astros will put a wrap on the game
against the Padres he had in the bag when Larry Dierker was
stricken by a grand mal seizure in the dugout, it's hard to be too
critical. Relative to his league-wide peer group, he's hardly
having a horrid season.
</P>
<P>
   But since shutting out the Expos with a six-hitter June 18,
Reynolds has surrendered 52 hits and 24 earned runs over 36 largely
unimpressive innings. It's a pattern the threadbare Astros can't
survive, should it linger much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' arm, by all accounts, is OK. The Astros are therefore
obligated to dissect his mechanics to ferret out a reason _ there
has to be one, doesn't there? _ his regular fastball and his
split-fingered version, a quasi-changeup, suddenly lose much of
their movement.
</P>
<P>
   Shane isn't going to throw many baseballs past people. For
Reynolds, no Bartolo Colon, deception is everything, and he's not
consistently deceiving anybody. In his last start, the night of
Dierker's return, he was virtually unhittable at the outset, yet
the Tigers sent him packing after five.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, when Kenny Lofton drilled his first pitch on a
line into right field for a single, he needed some superb defense
to keep the Astros nominally in the game. They had won 13 of his 20
previous starts, but that stat is at least a hair misleading,
considering he left the Detroit game with the Astros in a 6-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Much evidence suggests Shane is a better pitcher than he should
be, that his career stats far outpace the quality of his stuff.
Unfortunately, the Astros must maximize their intangibles to
compensate for their glaring shortage of tangibles as they are
currently constituted.
</P>
<P>
   Their expansive DL is expensive in more ways than one. The
myriad call-ups have cost the Astros every penny of whatever extra
trading-deadline cash they might have had. So what you see is what
you're going to get the rest of the way save for, hopefully,
contributions from Alou and Caminiti, who in a normal season might
combine for 200 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, somewhere, the slack has to be picked up. You're not
going to extract any more from Lima (13-4) or Hampton (12-3);
that's a given. Scott Elarton, newly added to the rotation with
encouraging results, might be the answer in part, but Reynolds
probably holds the key.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't right himself, the Astros are going to sink with
him.

GALAXY BEATS FLASH

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Clint Mathis notched his second goal of the night in
the 85th minute to give the Los Angeles Galaxy a come-from-behind
3-2 victory over the A-League's San Diego Flash in a third-round
U.S. Open Cup game at Douglas Stadium in San Diego, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy ended the game with nine players as Carlos Hermosillo
and Denny Pena were both ejected for rough tackles. Pena scored
before his tossing to tie the match, 2-2 in the 61st minute.
</P>
<P>
   With a San Diego player also ejected, the Galaxy played the
final 29 minutes with a man short, but Greg Vanney's corner kick
found the head of Mathis, who notched the game winner with a few
minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have luck on our side, except for the end,'' said
Mathis afterward. ``I think we showed a lot of character to win a
game like this with a man down. We came in not trying to think this
would be easy, but these teams are out to prove a point. They use
this as a momentum builder and beating an MLS team really makes
their season.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego opened the scoring in the 20th minute as Antonio
Robles beat Galaxy goalkeeper Matt Reis. Carlos Farias, San Diego's
leading scorer, made it 2-0 in the 25th minute when he sent a
beautiful 30-yard floater over Reis.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy tallied its first strike in the 53rd minute when
Costa Rican midfielder Roy Myers sent a through ball to Mathis, who
was making his run down the center of the field. Mathis collected
the ball and juked Flash goalkeeper Tom Tate before scoring,
cutting the lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pena tied the match later, setting up L.A.'s wild finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly like games like this,'' said Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid. ``Obviously they're one of the better teams in the
A-League. They were highly motivated and we ended up coming out a
little flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this are tough. For them, it's their World Cup. I
remember somebody telling me that Cup games are like Fantasy
Island. Everyone's dream can come true and for sure today was their
Fantasy Island until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm proud of our team. We came back fro two goals down and
that alone shows a lot of character.''

APT SENDOFF IF ANGELS OPT TO CHUCK FINLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Free Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   If there is the slightest bit of compassion in the heart of the
Anaheim Angels' owners and management, they will commute Chuck
Finley from his 14-year sentence with the most afflicted team in
baseball and send him someplace where baseball isn't a punch line
in search of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the way the most veteran of Angels lost a game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He took a 1-0 lead into the eighth inning against San Diego.
With one out, he struck Reggie Sanders out with a hard splitter,
only to see the ball bounce away from catcher Matt Walbeck and see
Sanders reach first. Naturally, Sanders then scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from the bench, he watched the Padres score the winning
run in the ninth when the ball slipped out of the hand of reliever
Mark Petkovsek on that classic high school play, the
bluff-to-third, throw-to-first pickoff move.
</P>
<P>
   If this were any other team, you'd call it strange. But things
like this happen all the time to the Angels. They are ground zero
for unnatural disasters. The Angels routinely find new and
different ways to lose ball games and undercut their own best
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can bother you if you let it,'' said Finley, who has been
around since 1986. ``You hear that all the time `It always happens
to the Angels' and you truly don't believe it. Just because you
lose a game doesn't mean anyone should start throwing quarters in a
well and wishing for good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after 12 years of it ...'' he said, pausing for a moment
of reflection before continuing. ``You just can't let it dictate
what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   No true Angel fan would disagree that Finley deserves better. He
may not be the most beloved Angel, but he is the most respected. He
has pitched in 423 games and won 158 during his career, and only
two players, the Orioles' Cal Ripken Jr. and the Padres' Tony
Gwynn, have played with one team longer than Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts from a handful of American League teams confident of
making the playoffs were in attendance to watch Finley, including
the Yankees, in the person of former third baseman Graig Nettles.
They saw Finley allow only three hits in his 7 fr 2/3 innings of
work and fight his way out of two bases-loaded situations.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers conspire against Finley starting another Angels home
game, at least for this year.
</P>
<P>
   He is a game left-hander who has been a double-digit winner in
nine of his last 10 seasons, and Tuesday's performance was a lot
more typical than his previous five. Finley was coming off a
five-game streak where he didn't get past the sixth inning and
allowed 35 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now lost five in a row, and head into a two-game
series with A.L. West leader Texas eight games under .500 and 10
games behind. Simply stated, they're done.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Indians and Red Sox all could use him in their
rotations. The Indians don't have a starter with an ERA under 4.60
and the Yankees have lost confidence in their only left-hander,
Andy Pettitte. The N.L.'s Giants may also be interested. The first
of several trade deadlines arrives July 30. If Finley's not gone by
then, it's only because Bill Bavasi hasn't been offered enough in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Finley isn't looking to leave. This is home and he's emotionally
attached to the team. He acknowledged earlier in the season that he
could see himself being traded to a contender this summer and
returning to Anaheim next season. He's in the last year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to (win) with this team,'' he said. ``It's why
I've been here so long. I've always believed if we could do it
here, it would be so much nicer and more meaningful because of what
we've gone through. I know there's been (trade) talk, but I'm not
thinking about helping out someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's loyalty is commendable, especially since there is some
question about the same quality in Angels fans.
</P>
<P>
   The last week has been a sour one for Angels players. Fan
contingents for the Dodgers and the Padres dominated the Big Ed
crowds. The roar from the crowd when Trevor Hoffmann came out to
close the game was quite rude.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing feeds negative vibes more than lukewarm support from the
home folk. For new Angels like Mo Vaughn and intense types like
Randy Velarde, the crowd response has been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how it feels from all those years Dodgers fans loaded
up their cars, drove to San Diego and dominated our park,'' said
the Padres' Tony Gwynn. ``I've lived it, and it's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Angels are either used to it or tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't give a (bleep),'' said shortstop Gary DiSarcina,
obviously tired of it. ``I've been here eight years and you just
get used to it. There are a lot of transplants here. We go through
this a lot. The 17,000 loyal fans we get here every game are the
ones we play for.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley tries to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be associated with a winner,'' he said. ``What
we see with San Diego and New York is a carryover from what they
did last season. You have to give the fans a reason to get in a
certain mood.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, Finley may get a chance to feel what that's like.
It just won't be in Anaheim.

CANADA FILM-PRODUCTION BROUHAHA ADVANCES A FRAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now it's getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   The bashing between the United States and Canada over runaway
film production has hit new heights. It's not quite as if the
``South Park'' movie has come true and the United States and Canada
are going to war; it's more like the MacKenzie Brothers have told
the United States, ``You're a bunch of hosers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight has now gone from Hollywood and Vancouver _ site of a
growing number of TV and film productions _ to Washington, D.C.
Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, has
sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Mission Hills,
complaining that the Valley representative is unfairly bashing
Canada for luring Hollywood productions with rebates and tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Though couched in diplomatic phrasing, Chretien basically said
Berman was wrong on several fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ He said Berman's criticism is baseless since Hollywood's
current downturn is not due to runaway production but other factors
such as the Asian crisis and cuts in big-budget studio films.
</P>
<P>
   _ He claimed Canada captures only $573 million in yearly
production, only a fourth of the $2.3 billion calculated in a
recent economic study commissioned by actors and directors unions.
That study, by The Monitor Co., estimated Canada accounted for 81
percent of all runaway production, shifting 24,000 jobs and $10.3
billion in annual economic benefits outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian provinces are entitled to use tax breaks to attract
production of Hollywood movies and TV shows because Canadians are
consumers of such programming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canada is a peripheral player, with only 2 percent of a global
business. ``The United States remains the dominant force in the
film and television industry,'' wrote Chretien, nephew of Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien. ``Hollywood's leadership is not
threatened; if anything it is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as foreign markets become ever more important elements in
the growth of this industry, it is only natural that non-U.S.
societies will also want to participate in the wealth they
generate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's missive came in response to Berman's recent assertion
that Canada had been duplicitous in negotiating the North American
Free Trade Agreement by insisting their nation needed economic
incentives to protect ``sovereign culture'' in the film business.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, in a telephone interview Tuesday, took issue with some
of Chretien's factual assertions such as the amount of production
in Canada. ``To some extent, the letter insulted our
intelligence,'' he said, adding he plans to respond in writing
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has counterattacked recently over complaints about
runaway production, asserting it will fight any protectionist
moves. And in a move that raised eyebrows across Hollywood, British
Columbia announced last week it would launch a $50 million
expansion of sound stages in Vancouver, backed by a $14 million
loan from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said Canada has become increasingly defensive about
subsidizing its film business to lure away productions. ``I think
that Canada thought it could pluck away huge parts of this industry
and the United States would sit back blithely,'' Berman said. ``My
constituents think this is a very large issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish comes on the heels of efforts in the California
Legislature to keep production at home. Two bills that would
provide tax credits for California-based film and TV productions
were recently approved by the Assembly and a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be becoming effective if the Canadian government is
making these kind of responses,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale, who authored one of the bills. ``The situation is
getting more critical every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman noted that the bill's 10 percent rebate was derived from

'70s SLA BOMB SUSPECT FREED FROM L.A. JAIL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kathleen Soliah, a fugitive for more than 20 years
from charges she helped plant pipe bombs under two Los Angeles
police cars, was released from jail on $1 million bail and was
eager to return to her family in Minnesota, where she is known as
Sara Jane Olson.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly happy Soliah, speaking with reporters after her
release Tuesday from the Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles,
thanked her supporters ``who have put up their homes and their
retirement funds to get me out of jail.'' She also thanked her
defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm just looking forward to going home and being with my
family, and experiencing with my daughters the trauma of everyday
teen-age life, and cooking for my family and saying hello to my dog
Emma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Dr. Gerald ``Fred'' Peterson, said his wife is
respected in the community, but he was still astounded by all the
help in raising the bail money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally unpredictable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah, 52, planned to meet with her attorneys in San Francisco,
then fly to Minnesota and arrive home Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler approved the release as
well as a sophisticated video-monitoring system for Soliah in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys, Stuart Hanlon and Susan Jordan of San Francisco,
said about 250 people from around the country contributed bail
money and Soliah will not violate their trust.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon said they expect the case to go to trial this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no evidence linking her to the bombing of
Los Angeles police cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence links Soliah to a house in San Francisco used
by the Symbionese Liberation Army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt they'll develop better evidence'' after so many years,
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon and Jordan denied Soliah was even an SLA member, saying
she merely helped members of the radical group.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst in February 1974 and
later that year engaged in a violent shootout with police officers
in South Los Angeles. Six in the SLA group were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has said that police
still believe Soliah helped plant the two bombs in 1975, perhaps as
revenge for the shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb was found under a squad car parked at an
International House of Pancakes on Sunset Boulevard and the second
was attached to a car at the Hollenbeck Division. Charges were made
by a grand jury in 1976, and Jordan said Soliah went underground
rather than surrender because ``she feared she wouldn't get a fair
trial'' in the turbulent 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when ``the legitimacy of the U.S. government was
in question'' and ``nobody in that day and age wanted to be the
object of law enforcement attention,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   After Soliah got married in Minnesota and had three daughters,
she didn't want to disrupt her new life by coming forward, Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   She will now be able to resume family and community life with
the monitoring program approved by the judge. It involves a
computerized camera that recognizes the facial features of the
person being monitored. There will also be weekly visits by
employees of the monitoring company, Minnesota Monitoring Inc., to
make sure the equipment is working.
</P>
<P>
   The bail contributions represent ``an overwhelming show of
support from people in all walks of life,'' Jordan said. ``People
are reacting strongly. They believe in the presumption of
innocence. People really want to see Sara Jane released and back
with her family.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliah was arrested on June 16 after her case was featured on
the ``America's Most Wanted'' TV program on the 25th anniversary of
the Los Angeles shootout with police and the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the arrest has been hard on Soliah's family in
Minnesota. ``The kids have found it really difficult,'' she said.

CANADA FILM-PRODUCTION BROUHAHA ADVANCES A FRAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now it's getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   The bashing between the United States and Canada over runaway
film production has hit new heights. It's not quite as if the
``South Park'' movie has come true and the United States and Canada
are going to war; it's more like the MacKenzie Brothers have told
the United States, ``You're a bunch of hosers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight has now gone from Hollywood and Vancouver _ site of a
growing number of TV and film productions _ to Washington, D.C.
Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, has
sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Mission Hills,
complaining that the Valley representative is unfairly bashing
Canada for luring Hollywood productions with rebates and tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Though couched in diplomatic phrasing, Chretien basically said
Berman was wrong on several fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ He said Berman's criticism is baseless since Hollywood's
current downturn is not due to runaway production but other factors
such as the Asian crisis and cuts in big-budget studio films.
</P>
<P>
   _ He claimed Canada captures only $573 million in yearly
production, only a fourth of the $2.3 billion calculated in a
recent economic study commissioned by actors and directors unions.
That study, by The Monitor Co., estimated Canada accounted for 81
percent of all runaway production, shifting 24,000 jobs and $10.3
billion in annual economic benefits outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian provinces are entitled to use tax breaks to attract
production of Hollywood movies and TV shows because Canadians are
consumers of such programming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canada is a peripheral player, with only 2 percent of a global
business. ``The United States remains the dominant force in the
film and television industry,'' wrote Chretien, nephew of Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien. ``Hollywood's leadership is not
threatened; if anything it is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as foreign markets become ever more important elements in
the growth of this industry, it is only natural that non-U.S.
societies will also want to participate in the wealth they
generate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's missive came in response to Berman's recent assertion
that Canada had been duplicitous in negotiating the North American
Free Trade Agreement by insisting their nation needed economic
incentives to protect ``sovereign culture'' in the film business.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, in a telephone interview Tuesday, took issue with some
of Chretien's factual assertions such as the amount of production
in Canada. ``To some extent, the letter insulted our
intelligence,'' he said, adding he plans to respond in writing
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has counterattacked recently over complaints about
runaway production, asserting it will fight any protectionist
moves. And in a move that raised eyebrows across Hollywood, British
Columbia announced last week it would launch a $50 million
expansion of sound stages in Vancouver, backed by a $14 million
loan from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said Canada has become increasingly defensive about
subsidizing its film business to lure away productions. ``I think
that Canada thought it could pluck away huge parts of this industry
and the United States would sit back blithely,'' Berman said. ``My
constituents think this is a very large issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish comes on the heels of efforts in the California
Legislature to keep production at home. Two bills that would
provide tax credits for California-based film and TV productions
were recently approved by the Assembly and a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be becoming effective if the Canadian government is
making these kind of responses,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale, who authored one of the bills. ``The situation is
getting more critical every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman noted that the bill's 10 percent rebate was derived from
extensive discussions with producers and studios as a figure that
would be sufficient to turn down the lure of cheaper foreign
locales. ``The 10 percent is not something that was pulled out of
thin air,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shanahan, vice president of the advocacy group Film and TV
Action Committee, said Chretien was out of line for not
acknowledging the job losses that Canada is creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking for is a level playing field,'' he said.
``We're concerned about more than 20,000 entertainment jobs that
have left the country.''

FILM PRODUCTION BROUHAHA ADVANCES A FRAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now it's getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   The bashing between the United States and Canada over runaway
film production has hit new heights. It's not quite as if the
``South Park'' movie has come true and the United States and Canada
are going to war; it's more like the MacKenzie Brothers have told
the United States, ``You're a bunch of hosers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight has now gone from Hollywood and Vancouver _ site of a
growing number of TV and film productions _ to Washington, D.C.
Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, has
sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Mission Hills,
complaining that the Valley representative is unfairly bashing
Canada for luring Hollywood productions with rebates and tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Though couched in diplomatic phrasing, Chretien basically said
Berman was wrong on several fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ He said Berman's criticism is baseless since Hollywood's
current downturn is not due to runaway production but other factors
such as the Asian crisis and cuts in big-budget studio films.
</P>
<P>
   _ He claimed Canada captures only $573 million in yearly
production, only a fourth of the $2.3 billion calculated in a
recent economic study commissioned by actors and directors unions.
That study, by The Monitor Co., estimated Canada accounted for 81
percent of all runaway production, shifting 24,000 jobs and $10.3
billion in annual economic benefits outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian provinces are entitled to use tax breaks to attract
production of Hollywood movies and TV shows because Canadians are
consumers of such programming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canada is a peripheral player, with only 2 percent of a global
business. ``The United States remains the dominant force in the
film and television industry,'' wrote Chretien, nephew of Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien. ``Hollywood's leadership is not
threatened; if anything it is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as foreign markets become ever more important elements in
the growth of this industry, it is only natural that non-U.S.
societies will also want to participate in the wealth they
generate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's missive came in response to Berman's recent assertion
that Canada had been duplicitous in negotiating the North American
Free Trade Agreement by insisting their nation needed economic
incentives to protect ``sovereign culture'' in the film business.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, in a telephone interview Tuesday, took issue with some
of Chretien's factual assertions such as the amount of production
in Canada. ``To some extent, the letter insulted our
intelligence,'' he said, adding he plans to respond in writing
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has counterattacked recently over complaints about
runaway production, asserting it will fight any protectionist
moves. And in a move that raised eyebrows across Hollywood, British
Columbia announced last week it would launch a $50 million
expansion of sound stages in Vancouver, backed by a $14 million
loan from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said Canada has become increasingly defensive about
subsidizing its film business to lure away productions. ``I think
that Canada thought it could pluck away huge parts of this industry
and the United States would sit back blithely,'' Berman said. ``My
constituents think this is a very large issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish comes on the heels of efforts in the California
Legislature to keep production at home. Two bills that would
provide tax credits for California-based film and TV productions
were recently approved by the Assembly and a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be becoming effective if the Canadian government is
making these kind of responses,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Glendale, who authored one of the bills. ``The situation is
getting more critical every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman noted that the bill's 10 percent rebate was derived from
extensive discussions with producers and studios as a figure that
would be sufficient to turn down the lure of cheaper foreign
locales. ``The 10 percent is not something that was pulled out of
thin air,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shanahan, vice president of the advocacy group Film and TV
Action Committee, said Chretien was out of line for not
acknowledging the job losses that Canada is creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking for is a level playing field,'' he said.
``We're concerned about more than 20,000 entertainment jobs that
have left the country.''

JOHNSON SHUTS OUT M'S IN RETURN TO SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Officially, at least, the pitcher's mound at Safeco
Field was built by the Mariners grounds crew.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez knows better. Like the rest of Western
Washington, the Mariners shortstop heard the cheers for Randy
Johnson Tuesday night, and he wasn't at all surprised. The pitcher
who made the place possible was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's standing on the mound that he built,'' Rodriguez said of
Johnson. ``I think that should be the reception.''
</P>
<P>
   With three rows of ``K'' placards strung across the facing of
the left field upper deck, Johnson returned to Seattle Tuesday
night. His team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, did not exist when he
strode in from the bullpen and beat the New York Yankees in the
1995 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If his 6-0 shutout was any more thrilling, Johnson wasn't
letting on. ``I'm just glad this day is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was no less dominant than ever, as the Mariners lineup,
which included five members of the '95 team, found out. Johnson had
10 strikeouts, and his only walk was so controversial, it got his
manager ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson, Johnson's catcher during his Mariner glory days, was
asked if Johnson seemed more pumped up by the 44,884 fans behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Randy, probably,'' Wilson said. ``I think he was
excited to be in this ballpark. He was a big part of this building
and I'm sure he felt like he belonged here a little bit. The fans
gave him a great reception, and he responded and pitched a great
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson improved to 10-7, winning for the first time in more
than a month and ending an historic run of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Before his last start, a no-decision in a 3-2 Arizona loss,
Johnson had dropped four straight starts, all shutouts. That hadn't
happened to any pitcher in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Mariners' Frankie Rodriguez took his turn. He
worked five shutout innings, and while not infallible _ he did not
have a 1-2-3 inning among them _ Rodriguez allowed no runs.
</P>
<P>
   Counting those innings, the Diamondbacks had scored two runs for
Johnson in their last 50 innings. They would double that total in
the sixth against rookie Damaso Marte, who came in for a tired
Rodriguez after 83 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got tired,'' manager Lou Piniella said of Rodriguez,
who pitching coach Stan Williams he was tiring during a mound
visit. ``He's been pitching out of our bullpen. He threw about 80
pitches, and that's what we were expecting anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Marte loaded the bases on singles, and with one out Tony Womack
singled again, bringing in two runs to put Arizona up, 2-0. After a
pop out and a walk, Matt Williams singled to right, scoring two
more and widening the lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks increased their lead to 6-0 when Bernard Gilkey
hit a two-run homer in the eighth. It was the first upper-deck
homer in six games at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, meanwhile, could do nothing against Johnson, the
winningest pitcher in their history. Johnson struck out Ken Griffey
Jr., Edgar Martinez, David Segui, Butch Huskey and Wilson once, Jay
Buhner twice and Russ Davis three times.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was 0-for-4 against Johnson in his early days as a Yankee,
and found the task no less forgiving this time. Davis struck out on
a 98-mph fastball in the third, an 88-mph slider in the fifth and
an 87-mph slider in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an idea of what it was like to face him,'' Davis said.
``It's not very thrilling, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nobody knows Johnson better than the Mariners, who were
hoping that might be an advantage. Johnson said it possibly helped
him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here for nine years, and you see certain things,''
Johnson said. ``But it's not like I had a notebook out over those
nine years. It's no secret to them what I throw.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there was little the Mariners could have done.
Johnson's next-to-last pitch, his 136th of the night, was 99 mph.
And the fastball wasn't even his best pitch. Johnson was getting
ahead in the count, allowing him to use his hard, biting slider,
which he threw in the high-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing 95 to 98, and then when he throws that
88-mile-per-hour slider, it's almost unfair,'' said Huskey. ``But
you have to get in the box and hope he'll make a mistake with that
slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can improvise. After fanning in the second, the 6-foot-3,
244-pound Huskey bunted for a single in the fifth. He stole second
and was stranded there when Wilson lined out to end the inning. The
Mariners, who had eight hits, left eight men on base, including
four in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a nice job swinging the bats,'' said Alex Rodriguez,
who had two hits and acknowledged he sees the ball well when
Johnson pitches. ``But every time we had a chance to score, he
turned it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's double-play grounder, after David Bell led off the
sixth with a single, was what Johnson called the biggest play of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy gave a very Randy-esque performance tonight,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He really stuck it to us.''

JOHNSON'S RETURN IS MARINERS' GLOOM IN THE `GUILTY PLEASURE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Much as it is with heavyweights shadow boxing before
entering the great arena, the crowd built early in the catacombs
just to see him warm up.
</P>
<P>
   When Randy Johnson took the bullpen mound, the crowd behind the
chain link fence was seven deep and shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the best, Randee!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home, Big Unit!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Show 'em Mr. Snappy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little chin music!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No-hit 'em, big guy!''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the number of No. 51 jerseys and the handmade signs
at this intimate little left-field perch in the Guilty Pleasure,
$517 million failed to buy the home field advantage Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing was an offer to rumble by Michael Buffer.
</P>
<P>
   Only there was no rumble. Randy Johnson 6, Mariners 0.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the Arizona Diamondbacks were there, too, but nobody
cared. This was the franchise's best pitcher against the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the franchise, since Arizona's National League
affiliation precludes further bouts, it is also no mas. The last
thing Mariners ownership and management needs is more evenings of
futility like Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The standing ovation that greeted Johnson upon his pre-game walk
from the pen back to the dugout, and again for his first trip to
the mound, was the fans' first organized chance to offer an opinion
on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite unanimous _ ``You're gonna get smoked tonight,
Randy!'' bellowed one who couldn't forgive _ but the consensus was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit is badly missed. The Mariners Tuesday night? They
missed badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't that a great reception?'' marveled D-Backs third
baseman Matt Williams. ``It was really nice that the fans gave him
that ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Johnson, as he always has, gratefully and carefully
acknowledged that the matters that led to his departure had nothing
to do with fan support, even though his legendary game face of
stone never broke until he left the field at game's end with a tip
of his cap toward the fans.
</P>
<P>
   He came. He saw. He kicked butt. He said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether this closes a career chapter, Johnson said, ``I
guess, if you want to look at it that way. I saw my friends and
family, I saw the new park ...''
</P>
<P>
   But he never betrayed any particular satisfaction at firing it
up the gaspipe of his old team, of watching Ken Griffey Jr., Alex
Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and Jay Buhner walk back to the dugout
with linguine in their hands instead of bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first inning, I had a job to do,'' he said.
``There's no breaks in that lineup. I'm used seeing a pitcher in
the ninth spot. But I had no walks and some good defense behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention six runs in front of him _ three times as many as
Arizona had given him in his previous 50 innings over six starts.
Even though the significance of Johnson's return was undeniable, he
and his teammates felt a bunch more emotion over the four-spot they
put up in the sixth inning to break the bizarre curse over his
recent outings.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the only real threat to Johnson was from his own
manager, Buck Showalter. The game's only controversy erupted in the
Mariners sixth when a Johnson pitch apparently nicked Griffey's
jersey, although Johnson and Showalter thought Griffey made a
strike-three swing.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter carried on his debate with plate umpire John Shulock
for several minutes before and after his ejection. Johnson, an
itchy sort not given to indulging nuisances, peevishly paced the
mound while the litigation was pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Once over, Martinez followed up with a single, but David Segui,
Johnson's former scuffle partner a year ago, bounced into an
inning-ending forceout. Thereafter, there was little left to do but
watch the radar gun go up to 99 mph and the Mariner scoreboard hit
000.
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome may have been predictable, particularly once
Mariners starter Jamie Moyer came up lame for the game, forcing
manager Lou Piniella to scramble his pitching, watching Johnson
dominate his former teammates was another twist of the knife in
Mariners fans.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the trade with Houston will be debated for years,
and the Mariners eventually may be better off for having made it.
But that doesn't change nights like Tuesday night, when yet another
Mariner that once came to glory now comes to haunt.
</P>
<P>
   All the green grass and blue skies in the baseball world can't
take that knot from a fan's gut.

COACHING ON THE EDGE  
 SOME SEE MILLER'S VOLATILITY AS DETRIMENT TO TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheryl Miller 5, all other WNBA coaches 0.
</P>
<P>
   On the league's ejection scoreboard for its first 2{ years of
operation, it's no contest. There's no official count in the
league's technical foul derby, but with Miller's career total up to
27, there's no doubt that she is the undisputed champ there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one diverse, if not nearly as flamboyant, personalities
have joined Miller in the league's coaching ranks _ each with as
much at stake and as much frustration about inconsistent
officiating in a young league. All 21 have avoided even a single
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Miller not only has five, including two in the past five games,
but has racked up $7,500 in fines beyond the standard $150 per
technical for criticizing officials. At least she has company in
that category: former Los Angeles Coach Julie Rousseau received a
$500 fine for verbal abuse of officials in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mercury off to its worst start in franchise history
(6-10), Miller's behavior has raised questions: Has she crossed the
line, and is her volatile personality becoming more a liability
than an asset? And will that be a major factor when her three-year
contract expires after this season?
</P>
<P>
   Or is the 35-year-old secure enough in her own celebrity and
cultlike following locally to have no reason to fear a backlash
from the typically image-conscious Suns parent organization?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the risk of going too far,'' Mercury President Bryan
Colangelo said Tuesday, a day after Miller was assessed a $5,000
fine, a WNBA record, for accusing the league and its officials of a
vendetta against her. ``It's up to Cheryl at this point in her
personal interaction with this team, attempting to maximize
everything she can get out of this team, to figure out how far is
too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, there is a point where you can cross the
line and a certain type of behavior on the bench can be detrimental
to the team's efforts, or it may wash out all the other positives
that Cheryl brings.''
</P>
<P>
   The positives speak for themselves: continued high attendance;
die-hard loyalty among the fan base; a profitable bottom line in a
league in which only a quarter of its teams can make that claim;
and two playoff appearances in as many tries, one falling an
eyelash shy of a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury fans hold up signs proclaiming ``Miller for President''
and ``Ejected or Not, We'll get 1st spot'' and collect money to
help pay her fines as if she is a defender of injustice against
them.
</P>
<P>
   They long for her to dance after games _ a routine missing at
first this season because of the Mercury's 3-10 start, then because
of a cast on her right leg because of Achilles' tendon surgery, and
most recently due to the ejections _ and come in numbers that any
organization would be slow to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the WNBA in attendance in 1997 with an average of
13,703, the Mercury shook off the arrival of the Diamondbacks to
average 13,765 in '98.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers remain high despite this year's losing record, a
schedule that saw the Mercury play 10 of the first 14 games on the
road and some early home start times. The average is at 12,604 for
a team hoping to rejoin the Western Conference playoff race with 10
home games in its final 15.
</P>
<P>
   So is that enough to make team executives look the other way
when she says officials ``will not be hungry because they swallowed
their whistles plenty enough'' and that her team played ``five
against seven'' due to officiating, as she did in earning a $2,500
fine last season?
</P>
<P>
   Does that make it easier to accept her denial that her outbursts
are hurting the game and her counter-assertion that the league is
``hurting my team because they've made it personal''?
</P>
<P>
   Ann Meyers, like Miller one of 14 female inductees into the
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and a member of the new
Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   She was the NBC analyst for Saturday's game against the Los
Angeles Sparks at America West Arena when Miller was ejected and
did not immediately leave the court, urging the crowd to jeer while
Los Angeles' La'Keshia Frett shot technical free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Miller a Pied Piper because she is easy for fans to
follow because of the charisma she developed as a player and in
broadcasting, Meyers wonders whether Miller is leading the WNBA
down a path that women's sports should not go.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, she's a little over the top,'' Meyers said. ``We can
be different than the men. Women are getting more of an audience
because people are tired of the men, where it's too raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've never appreciated in teaching is always the
need to degrade somebody and swear all the time. That's just me.
I've been guilty of swearing, but I've learned and matured enough
to keep things in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she's the only one who has the courage to be who she is.
There is so much good she brings to the table, but it doesn't
excuse the negative and other things that come along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA Commissioner Val Ackerman said through a spokesperson that
she did not want to comment on Miller's image.
</P>
<P>
   Miller still seems to have the support of her players, although
some suggest it has eroded since the first season. Quantifying that
is difficult, especially now that the team has won three straight
and has made popular personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what she's saying (to officials), but I
don't think it's where she should be in a bad situation every game
getting technicals,'' guard Bridget Pettis said.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jennifer Gillom said Miller ``has a lot of energy'' and
that officials would be best to overlook her theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   But her 27 technicals, not including the one during a 1998
preseason game that resulted in a broken toe from her kicking the
scorer's table, seem to indicate that the referees are not going to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Miller must adapt, as she promised after the latest ejection _
``I have to go the next level emotionally and draw it in'' _ or she
runs the risk of discovering that instead of being the Pied Piper,
she is wearing the Emperor's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl is like a kid in a candy store,'' Meyers said. ``She's
always testing. How far can I go with this person? If they don't do
anything about it, she goes a little further.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to understand she's the adult and leader of this team.
What she does reflects not only on her, but on the team, the
organization, the WNBA, women's basketball and women in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he had hoped to negotiate a contract extension
with Miller before the season. Scheduling conflicts made that
impossible, but he is not ruling out a new deal before the season
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she wants to remain until the Mercury wins a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to lead, and how you choose to lead and what level
of success you achieve is how you're defined as successful or
unsuccessful,'' Colangelo said. ``Cheryl has a fairly decent track
record with her style prior to this early season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the (1999) team has underperformed as a whole, the
fact things are somewhat back on track at this critical stage is
certainly encouraging.'' &QL;

 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTROL OF NUCLEAR LABS CHALLENGED  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The furor over security breaches at the nation's
nuclear laboratories prompted calls in Congress Tuesday for the
University of California to be stripped of its 56-year-old role
managing two of the largest facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Angered over reports that the labs have done little to thwart
decades of spying, several lawmakers suggested that UC's contract
with the Department of Energy to run the labs be thrown open to
competitive bidding when the pact expires in 2002. Others suggested
that it be terminated even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should start with accountability and responsibility and
pull that contract today,'' Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., charged
during a congressional hearing on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden termination of the University of California's
relationship with 15,000 workers at laboratories in Livermore,
Calif., and Los Alamos, N.M., does not appear likely. But members
of Congress are increasingly skeptical about entrusting an academic
institution with the design, development and dismantling of the
nation's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard for me because the University of California is in
my state and I am a big fan of the university,'' Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., said last week. ``But I question the academic
overlay and the academic administration because there is a whole
different culture that ... is not conducive to security.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein stopped short of calling for an end to UC's management
role, saying instead that the matter should be studied. She is one
of only two Democratic senators who supports a Republican measure
to create a new oversight agency to oversee the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over security breaches at the labs were thrust into the
spotlight after an investigation headed by Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Newport Beach, concluded earlier this year that China has been
stealing U.S. nuclear secrets for the past two decades as part of
an espionage program that ``almost certainly'' continues even
today.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, an internal Energy Department investigation
focusing on Livermore uncovered critical weaknesses in computer
security, protection of nuclear materials and the ``reaction
capability'' of the guard force.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing of the oversight subcommittee of the House
Commerce Committee _ most of which was held behind closed doors,
for national security reasons _ concentrated on the results of that
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the public was cleared from the room, committee Chairman
Fred Upton, R-Mich., complained that ``serious and recurring''
security problems at Livermore ``went uncorrected for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Security directives, ``even when issued by the president of the
United States, were ignored and even flouted by the laboratories
and their scientists,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers backed a more moderate approach, calling for
greater oversight of the labs through financial penalties, an
annual review of the contract and an open bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we ought to micromanage for a while,'' said
Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses invited to speak before the committee said the
problems are being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Podonsky, the Energy Department official who authored the
critical report, said ``the deficiencies at Livermore appear to be
receiving a high level of management attention now.''
</P>
<P>
   Livermore lab director Bruce Tarter told the committee that
``aggressive corrective action'' is being taken and that
``sensitive and classified information are secure.''
</P>
<P>
   UC has managed the nuclear laboratories in Livermore and Los
Alamos, as well as one in Berkeley, since their inception in 1943.
No classified research is done at the Berkeley lab. Of the
university's 140,000 employees, nearly 1 in 7 work at one of the
three laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, UC President Richard Atkinson called for a review of
security, and a report to the university's regents is expected in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., whose district includes Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, says the university should not be blamed for
decades of security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a systemic, 20-year failure on the part of the
intelligence community and ... the Department of Energy to protect
our secrets,'' said Tauscher.
</P>
<P>
   The university receives $25 million a year to run the three
labs. Nearly all of that money is spent on management or research.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the labs has brought UC considerable prestige and has
helped the university attract some of the world's top scientists,
but UC officials say their motives for running the labs are
altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university sees it as a public service,'' said UC
spokesman Rick Malaspina. The current top mission of the Livermore
and Los Alamos labs _ to safely stockpile the nation's nuclear
arsenal _ is best handled by the world-class scientists at UC,
Malaspina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university brings the highest level of scientific
expertise and integrity to the labs,'' Malaspina said. ``Now would
be the wrong time to change the mission of these labs, or their
management.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear weapons research, scientists at the labs
also work on a wide range of scientific projects ranging from
theoretical physics to genetic coding and AIDS research.

 BOTH PARTIES WANT SOME SORT OF TAX CUT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite GOP fractures that are complicating House
passage of a big tax cut, there is surprisingly wide support in
both parties for some kind of tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   With a vote expected Wednesday, the only real questions are
which taxes will be cut and by how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants tax cuts,'' said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, a
moderate Democrat from Walnut Creek, Calif. ``(New York liberal)
Charlie Rangel wants tax cuts. Ellen Tauscher wants tax cuts.
(Texas conservative) Bill Archer wants tax cuts. We all want tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is,'' Tauscher added, ``that some of us want
tax cuts that are irresponsible and will wreak havoc upon our
economy ... and some of us know that we still have a little spinach
to eat before we go crazy at the dessert cart.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to restore their party's crown jewel, Republicans will
try to pass through the House the biggest tax cut since Ronald
Reagan's first term, a $792 billion, 10-year package that would
slash income tax rates by 10 percent, cut capital gains taxes,
eliminate the estate tax and reduce a host of other personal and
business levies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has repeatedly promised to veto such an
extensive package of cuts, arguing that the money should be spent
instead on Medicare, defense and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   As many as a dozen GOP moderates are also threatening to bolt,
saying the cuts are too large.
</P>
<P>
   Given the GOP's slender five-vote margin, party leaders are
pulling out all the stops to avoid an embarrassing defeat on the
floor. But for all the posturing, the battle mostly boils down to
how large a tax cut should be, not whether there should be one at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the projected $1 trillion budget surplus and
Clinton's eagerness to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare
as his presidential legacy opens the door to a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton initially said he would sign a $250 billion tax cut, and
Republicans responded with a promise to support at least some form
of a Medicare drug benefit. Tuesday, the White House insisted the
line stops at $300 billion, and Republicans are betting that
Clinton will ultimately sign something much larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president four months ago was for a zero tax cut,'' said
Newport Beach Republican Christopher Cox, a member of the House
leadership. ``Now he is in favor of a tax cut. That is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   An unparalleled economic boom _ which generated not only huge
projected surpluses but also a new investor class _ has clearly
altered the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   `The American people are responsible for the more than $4
trillion budget surplus projected for the next 15 years, so it
makes sense to give them some needed and deserved tax relief,''
California Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said in May when
she announced her own tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Democrats have fought tax cuts _ particularly cuts in
income, capital gains and estate taxes _ charging Republicans with
aiding the rich at the expense of the poor. Clinton has especially
bedeviled Republicans by framing tax cuts as a threat to Medicare
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton and congressional Democrats will repeat that
strategy _ but with a big difference. This time around, they are
arguing more about the size of tax cuts than their legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial number of Democrats are lining up behind two
iron-clad bastions of Republican orthodoxy: capital gains and
inheritance tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death tax has gone from being a proposal from the
right-wing conspiracy to being a real possibility,'' said Mark
Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital
Formation, which lobbies for lower taxes on capital. ``It's got
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   North Coast Democrat Mike Thompson cited the estate tax as
``first and foremost'' on his menu of possible cuts, saying the tax
forces family vintners in Napa and Sonoma counties to choose
between selling either their vineyards or their wineries when the
owner dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family-owned business are the ones we need to take the first
step in protecting,'' Thompson said, ``not only from a tax equity
perspective, but also from the vantage of what it means to
communities.'' Thompson said paying the tax _ now 55 percent for
the top bracket _ forces farmers to liquidate to developers, family
newspapers to sell out to chains and small retailers to cede to big
``box store'' chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for eventually eliminating death taxes,'' Tauscher agreed.
``I don't think death is a taxable event.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said she would also like to ``look to reduce capital
gains taxes ... for people that are making investments in American
jobs and American companies _ which says, not for day-traders _ and
clearly, I would look to make sure that we are doing something
about the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is significant Democratic support for much of the
GOP package _ from ``marriage penalty'' and alternative minimum tax
relief, to extending the research-and-development tax credit (a big
favorite of Silicon Valley), to tax deductions for individuals who
buy their own health insurance, to tax breaks for long-term care,
and myriad tax incentives for retirement and education savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how much of this menu Democrats will support.
``Now $250 billion is not a lot of money,'' Tauscher cautioned,
after ticking off a list of cuts she favors.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento Democrat Robert Matsui, a liberal veteran on the
House tax-writing panel, conjectured the outlines of an ultimate
compromise: ``I think you'd have to do a little marriage penalty,
obviously estate tax relief, R&AMP;D credits ... and my guess is you'll
probably see some capital gains because Republicans will want
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A key battleground will be over income taxes. The 10 percent
across-the-board cut in rates _ a Reagan lodestar and the chief
element of the House Republican bill _ finds minimal Democratic
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go along with the president, but certainly that would
be the outer limits,'' Matsui said. ``When you have (financing
problems in) Medicare and Social Security, and all the surplus is
really contingent on additional spending cuts that are
unidentified, I think it's really risky strategy to come in with a
tax cut of any substantial size.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui called the GOP bill ``foolhardy,'' adding, ``I just don't
understand where they're coming from on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategist Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax
Reform, is urging Republicans to go for it all and continue passing
the tax bill until Clinton relents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Clinton makes the same decision now that he made in
'96 _ which is, `I don't want this 2000 election to be about
taxes,' just as Clinton didn't want the '96 election to be about
welfare reform _ I believe he would sign a tax bill of almost any
size in order to take that off the table,'' Norquist said. ``If
Republicans don't fold and we keep debating it into next year, and
Clinton says no, Al Gore is toast.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy hinges, of course, on Republicans getting the bill
through its first vote in the House.

 GOV. DAVIS SAYS LEGISLATURE'S JOB IS TO `IMPLEMENT' HIS VISION  &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
(eds: not offensive language in 21st graf)
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an extraordinarily blunt declaration of his
power, California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday that it is the job
of the Legislature ``to implement my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor, who has angered top lawmakers recently
with his interventions in the legislative process, said his
20-point victory in the November election allows him to call the
shots in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with The San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board,
Davis was asked about his increasingly strained relations with the
Democratic-controlled Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a totally different view of the world than I do,
totally different,'' Davis said. ``It was my vision that commanded
a 20-point victory, the largest victory in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect government to reflect the vision that I
suggested. Nobody else in the Legislature ran statewide. Their job
is to implement my vision. That is their job.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came a week after Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa,
D-Los Angeles, directed their top lieutenants to ignore requests
from the governor's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The move was prompted after Davis' lobbyists tried to block
Democrats' legislation by asking committee leaders to delay
consideration of bills.
</P>
<P>
   When Villaraigosa was informed of the governor's latest
comments, he said: ``I hope that the governor's remarks were made
out of anger and don't actually reflect a lack of regard for the
Legislature on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Burton said, ``I have an absolutely
different view. I believe in checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges also reflect the growing tension between lawmakers
and the governor over issues like health insurance. The Legislature
has more than 60 HMO-related bills pending, but Davis wants to
squeeze them into three or four.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Congress has been debating HMO legislation, Davis
insisted that his main issue is education, which polls show to be a
top concern of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see one commercial on health care?'' Davis asked,
referring to his own advertising campaign in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am adhering to my agenda, not the agenda that other people
have for me. They didn't run for governor,'' he said. ``They want
to have their agendas, let them run. Ralph Nader got 2 percent of
the vote. We got 58 percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader was the target of Davis' ire because he said that the
governor is providing ``the antithesis of leadership'' on health
care and that his positions are influenced by campaign donations
from health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Davis met behind closed doors with legislators
and business and labor leaders in his San Francisco office to
negotiate which HMO bills he will sign when the Legislature returns
from its summer recess next month.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spelled out the changes he wants in the state's oversight
of the managed care industry: more legal liability for HMOs,
outside review of disputed HMO decisions and a guarantee that
doctors make the final decisions on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with the editorial board, Davis also displayed a
bit of his legendary temper as the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   He held a copy of the New York Times, which carried a page one
story about his signing Monday of a bill that outlaws possession of
assault firearms while The Chronicle carried the story on an inside
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got me on Page 15 with the toughest bill in the nation,
and the New York Times has me on Page One,'' he said, brandishing
the Times.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly objected to another story on the front page of The
Chronicle that detailed his extensive fund-raising activities among
special interests, including the timber industry, that have
legislation and other business pending in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cheap s_,'' he said ``That's just a chicken s_
article.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that newspaper publishers had lobbied him to eliminate
the sales tax on newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of hypocrisy,'' he said. ``I had the
newspaper publishers in to see me, sitting around a table like
this, and not making cocktail discussion, and each one saying
you've got to repeal that tax on newspapers. There was no consumer
in that meeting. This is blatant self-interest, a captured
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to a fund-raiser, and everybody when you are governor
wants to give you money, and you mingle and talk about the 49ers
and the Giants. You don't talk about timber rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be judged by the results that come from the
regulatory and legislative policies, not by the fact that somebody
decided to have a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first seven months in office, Davis has been a relentless
fund raiser, and he attended another such event on Monday night in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Davis signed legislation reinstating overtime
pay after eight hours of work in most California industries. Under
his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson, employers were required to
pay overtime after 40 hours in a week but not after eight hours in
a day.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Davis promised to sign such a bill, which
was wanted by organized labor. He also made significant concessions
to the restaurant and grocery industry that removed their
opposition to the measure.

NOT ONE TO BE OUTFLANKED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Flanking me as I come before you today (you can't see them, so
you'll have to imagine them) are my attorney, Vinnie ``Boomer''
Bombasto and a generic child, big-eyed and sympathetic.
<P>
   It's important to be flanked. It's cool. Gray Davis publicly
signed an assault weapon ban Monday while flanked by police
officers and victims of the 101 California massacre. Same day, Al
Gore gave a speech pledging Clinton administration support for AIDS
funding in Africa, and Gore was flanked by Archbishop Desmond Tutu
and a Ugandan AIDS orphan.
</P>
<P>
   Both good causes. The flanking: sincere shows of support, or
cheap political theatrics? You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, flanking is definitely a trend; it's hip to be
flanked, and it shouldn't be just politicians. We could all
occasionally use some support, some sincere flanking.
</P>
<P>
   Like now, one of the rare times I take a moment to correct
mistakes or clear up misunderstandings, and I find it comforting to
have Vinnie and the small child at my flanks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, I wrote about the JFK Jr. tragedy, a column that was
misunderstood by all, myself included. Great artists are often
misunderstood, but so are inept ones, maybe even more so.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people liked the column for the wrong reason, and a lot
hated it for the wrong reason. So either a lot of dumb people read
this column, or I accidentally left out a key paragraph or two that
would have explained what the hell it was I was trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   Which is: Good guy, from great (if flawed) American family,
doing good work, with great potential, although he might get
shorted by some shortsighted historians who might consign JFK Jr.,
unfairly, to the status of lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Kennedy chose journalism over politics; how can I find that
light of weight? My theory on political weight is that people in
politics are like balloons. The lighter they are, the more full of
hot gas, the higher they rise.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kennedy was not even in the office-seeking game
gave him, by my theory, great heft.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's magazine, George, though dismissed by some, contains
more weight and pith than any 1,000 political speeches. Kennedy
really was trying to break new ground at a time when political
creativity is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   MISTAKES BAKED here, fresh daily: I wrote that Tom Ammiano was
calling for an investigation of the Mormons for giving church
support and money to the California initiative opposing gay
marriage. Ammiano and Mark Leno were both nice enough to correct
me, noting that it is Leno coming down on the Mormons. Not that
Ammiano supports their anti-gay cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you think we all look alike,`` Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure who the ``we'' is. Supervisors? Non-Mormons? Muni
riders?
</P>
<P>
   Also, apologies to Carry Nation for misspelling her first name.
That's the last person I want mad at me when I sit down with a beer
at the end of a mistake-filled day.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T QUOTE me, says Reliable Source, ``but you should have seen
the neighborhood around the Bank of America building last Wednesday
night. Every illegal parking spot for blocks was filled with S.F.
police cars _ bus stops, fire hydrants, taxi zones, loading zones.
The occasion was a police awards ceremony, at which the cops
congratulated each other on their devotion to civic duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, they deserve our thanks for not hogging the legal parking
spots in the city. All 14 of them.
</P>
<P>
   MARCEL MARCEAU opened last night at Theatre on the Square. I bet
this is one guy who can hail a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Strange de Jim, tickets in hand, was worried, saying, ``I'm
speechless with excitement, but I hope he mimes in English since I
don't speak French.''
</P>
<P>
   I assured Strange that there would be invisible English
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   WENT TO SEE ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' and it brought out some raw
emotion in the audience. Two women were cursing and threatening
each other, and the movie hadn't even started. They were arguing
over a saved seat in the packed house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater rage,'' explained the guy next to me.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ladies, take that rage out onto the street where it
belongs.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are taking apart ``Eyes'' like a cheap watch, but
it's worth seeing. A bit weirder than I expected, but what isn't?
</P>
<P>
   And not to quibble, because I realize Kubrick was an artistic
genius, but it took him a good four seconds into the movie before
he had Nicole Kidman naked. Maybe it was just careless editing.
</P>
<P>
   OH, AND I wrote that JFK Jr. was the last of the Kennedys,
meaning in terms of presidential potential.
</P>
<P>
   Readers wonder: What about Caroline, a brilliant lawyer who
passed the bar on her first try; Patrick, Teddy's son and a
passionate and inspiring congressman; and Kathleen, Bobby's
daughter and lieutenant governor of Maryland?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, take it up with my new attorney, Mr. Marceau.

   From the article ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   With John, everybody has always tried to project what they think
he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable conclusion that
he will be an office holder and president of the United States, if
he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ... But, of course, whenever we asked him that question, `What
will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh, shut up,
Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that kind of
stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed himself ... to
be swept away by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.

   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful,or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.

for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.

</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Kennedy and Christiane Amanpour were
students at neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, they became close
friends, pals. It was a relationship that remained close and strong
down the years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, Christiane took a short respite from her
chores as chief international correspondent for CNN, and with her
husband, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, went to Martha's
Vineyard to spend a few days with John and his wife Carolyn _ a
happy relaxed few days, she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sunday, July 18, when Mike Wallace talked with
his occasional ``60 Minutes'' colleague Christiane about the man
for whom she has long had so much admiration and affection, she
still believed a miracle was possible.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   MIKE WALLACE: So we're going to talk about him as though he's
going to come in the door tomorrow morning, OK? Twenty years ago
you first met him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Twenty years ago I first met him when we were both
college freshmen in Rhode Island. And...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You were at the University of Rhode Island?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was at the University of Rhode Island, he was at
Brown. He was Ivy League, I wasn't. You know, I _ I don't often
talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...

it's really tough.

talk about personal relationships and certainly ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You never have.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And I've never talked about John. But I think at a
time when the whole world is riveted by this moment, we, his
friends, owe him to tell what we know about him from an accurate
and honest perspective.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: What was it that drew you to each other, him to you,
you to him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, we were just friends. You know, we met on
college campus, at parties. I was always sort of a Brown wanna-be
and I had friends at Brown, my Iranian friends and we would meet on
weekends _ and at other occasions. And we just basically, like all
college students do, forged a friendship. I was one of several of
his college friends at this time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Just pals, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: No ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Certainly not. We shared a house off campus. There was
John, there was myself and there were three other friends. And this
went on for two years. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Three other friends, three boys?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: There were boys and girls. There was a different sort
of configuration in the two years, but John and I lived in the same
house for two years. And it was this beautiful house in Providence
and, you know, I had come from an English boarding school and I had
very clear ideas but about how you run a house. You know, I wasn't
about to sort of live with a bunch of frat boys. And so ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right. And there's a certain ... executive aura about
you that was in existence back then...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, that's what you say. No, I...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Come on. You're bossy and I'll bet you were then.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was a little bit bossy and I basically would have
these rosters that I made up. We would divide our duties every
week: somebody would cook, somebody would shop, somebody would
clean bathrooms and toilets. And ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Somebody would what?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Clean bathrooms and toilets. And, basically, I was the
one who sort of instigated all of that. And my friends to this day
laugh at me for that. And, you know, John used to laugh at me and _
and still does, you know, and he says `You taught me how to clean
toilets. I never had before. And I probably never will again.' You
know, and he cooked and he's a good cook and he cleaned. It started
with that kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: With John, everybody has always tried to project what
they think he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable
conclusion that he will be an office holder and president of the
United States, if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But, of course, whenever we asked him that question,
`What will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh,
shut up, Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that
kind of stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed
himself, and still doesn't, to be swept away ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did he ever talk about his dad?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes _ as a son would talk about his father. He
remembers, you know, a little bit, not everything. He was very
young when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it was never a taboo subject in his household,
quite the contrary. They talked about his father as a father.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did you ever talk privacy with him, talk about the
business of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's something that
their whole family has been concerned about, and even his sister
wrote a legal book on the whole issue of privacy. And, you know, of
course it comes up because who's had their privacy more invaded
than that family, than him?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Conceivably the current president of the United States,
and I'll bet you talked about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, we did. I remember having a dinner several
months ago and there were a group of us: his wife, my husband. And
he was just, you know, (talking) about the whole scandal in
Washington, to the point that he said, `I've got to say something
about it. I want to go on television and sort of say this is not
serious, this is just going too far. This is not politics. This is
just destruction and des ...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Destruction of the president of the United S...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Well, just destruction of any kind of serious public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And my husband sort of said to him, `Well, you know,
you have to be careful, or you might want to consider what risks
you're taking if you go out publicly and do that. Because of all
the publicity...'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. What kind of public nature was he
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Oh, I think do an article in George, go on Larry King,
go on CSPAN, whatever. I mean, you know, he's a player.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: He now has a political magazine, he's a player...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Right.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and he's a man who knows a lot about this kind of
political life. And I think that, you know, knowing his own family
history, I think he knew that in today's climate of attack-dog
journalism that even if he tried to say something smart, relevant,
it would be torn apart and people would put the spotlight on his
own family history, his father and that presidency.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: OK, the four of you there (for dinner) for the weekend.
You're at home. You're at dinner. Your husband is an Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs, State Department, Madeleine
Albright's good right. You cover news. This is a Kennedy. I mean,
come on, the conversation _ I'm not prying. Does it not get into
the nitty-gritty of politics at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah, sometimes it does, but you know what? It's often
not as elevated as that, especially when we're sitting around a
dining-room table. We're having fun, we're talking about what we're
going to do the next day...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know, but you're also...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... talking about what we did yesterday. No, come on,
we're talking about fun things. It's not all really serious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I'm not suggesting that it is. Though what I am
suggesting is that there must have been, for instance, conversation
about whether Hillary was smart to run for senator.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I think the consensus was yes.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: His wife, Carolyn...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Mmm.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: ... I think that she may be the least known Kennedy of
all.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Who is she? What is she like? Who is Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Carolyn is the beautiful girl next door who fell in
love with John and whom John fell in love with, and they got
married and they live a happily married life with all the trials
and tribulations that any married couple endure.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: But you hadn't told me...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And theirs _ hold on a second _ except that theirs is
in the glare of the ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yep.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... international, national worldwide spotlight. So
it's really tough.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Well, their fights prior to their marriage were grist
for every tabloid in America.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know, I've never seen one of those and
that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to get into. Because
I've seen them happy and like a normal married couple. And any one
of their friends will tell you the same thing. Despite the lies and
the stories that were made up about them, they get through it. And
I think she is somebody who's a very private person, who went into
her marriage with her eyes open but nevertheless found it difficult
at first ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... is now coming to terms with the spotlight...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ... and what it means. And is a great support and
partner for her husband. And, you know, I noticed a sort of
maturing (in John) after he got married. You know, he found a
partner, a soul mate. And that's not easy for somebody like John.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: When People magazine did that cover about him, ``The
Sexiest Man Alive,'' did his pals rib him?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Totally. Totally. Totally. And he was completely
mortified.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Was he?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. You know _ I mean, on one level, everybody's
flattered, but on another level he was totally mortified. Because
that's all everybody used to say to him, you know, for a while
after that cover came out.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: They'd say ...
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: They just called him that. And I remember going into
friends' houses, I swear to God, and the magazine cover would be
pinned on the refrigerator or whatever. And I never used to talk
about, you know, our friendship, but he affected a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And those of us who have been lucky enough to know him
and to be his friends are really very lucky because he's an
incredibly positive force.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And loyal.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And loyal and generous. And I think somebody like
that, the whole world would like to have known him or would like to
know him. But I was talking to some of his friends and we all agree
that to know him is really to love him. Because he's a good, funny,
honest person with all his flaws and his foibles like all of us
have. You know, he's not a saint.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: I know.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: But it's rare that you find somebody that people
basically just like.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: The Kennedy curse, the Kennedy curse. Did you ever talk
about that with him at all?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: No. Again, it's something that the world and people
outside talk about.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And it's never been something that he's talked about.
He never, ever talked about that. In the same way as the Kennedy
mystique, you know, his answer is that, `To you this may seem like
history or mystique...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: ...or whatever. But this is my father, my mother, my
sister. This is my family. This is the life I lead.'
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: And that's very much how he comes across. He doesn't
go into, at least not with me, those kind of morbid introspections.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: You love this man.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: Yeah. I said everybody says that to know John is to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: And he loves you back.
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: You know, he loves his friends. He's a good man. He
loves his family, he's devoted and he's a joy.

Ling, a correspondent on the ABC TV show ``The View,'' glanced at
the magazine rack to see what news graced the covers that week.
What she saw shocked her. ``To illustrate the ongoing allegations
of stolen nuclear secrets by suspected Chinese spies, both Time and
U.S. News &AMP; World Report chose to use images of slanted eyes -- no
face. Slanted eyes, just like mine.'' Are people of Chinese descent
becoming the new bad guys? In this commentary, Ling, a new

recalls her own experience with racism _ one she'll never forget

 &HT;    BIO: Lisa Ling, a new contributor to New America News Service,
is a correspondent for the ABC TV show ``The View.''
 &HT;    ----------------------------------------------------
 &HT;    
 &HT;    While pushing my shopping cart filled with low-fat foods to the
crowded supermarket register, I glanced over at the magazine rack
to see what prepubescent fashion models and overly hyped ``news''
issues graced the covers for the week.
 &HT;    I nearly choked on the lump in my throat when my eyes met the
covers of two of the country's most widely read publications.
 &HT;    To illustrate the ongoing allegations of stolen nuclear secrets
by suspected Chinese spies, both Time and U.S. News &AMP; World Report
chose to use images of slanted eyes _ no face. Slanted eyes, just
like mine.
 &HT;    Why did this provoke such a strong, visceral reaction?
 &HT;    True, a Chinese spy would have ... well, slanted eyes. I
wondered whether both publications would have used big blue eyes if
the allegations had pertained to Russia or Yugoslavia. Perhaps I
would have felt differently had the United States not
``inadvertently'' bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia just two
months ago. Or if in the latest ``Star Wars'' film the villains
hadn't had blatant Chinese accents. Maybe I wouldn't have become so
sensitive.
 &HT;    Then again, could it be that people of Chinese descent are
becoming the new bad guys?
 &HT;    This is not meant to undermine the seriousness of the threat
posed by security breeches in nuclear-weapons facilities. The more
than 800-page Cox Report prepared by Republican Rep. Christopher
Cox claims that over the past decade spies working for the
government of the People's Republic of China have stolen classified
information on every warhead in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
 &HT;    While there are very serious accusations included in the report,
there are also bits of information which are irrelevant and, more
important, inappropriate and offensive.
 &HT;    The report points out that there are over 100,000 Chinese
nationalists studying in American universities. What purpose does
this statistic serve? Are we to assume they are spies?
 &HT;    There is a reference to the fact that last year over 80,000
tourists from the mainland visited the United States. The point?
 &HT;    Before accusations evolve into hysteria, which is eerily
possible these days thanks to excessive media coverage and
speculation, the perspective of a Chinese-American may lend reality
to the picture.
 &HT;    If recent U.S. history is any indicator, my reasons for wanting
to write this piece should seem clear: Let's not forget that
thousands of Japanese-Americans were interned during World War II
for not being ``American'' enough. The tragic fact already is that
10 percent of the physicists in this country are of Chinese
descent, and a number of them are being heavily scrutinized because
of their ethnic origin.
 &HT;    Although I was born in this country, I have never felt entirely
American. Throughout my life, there have been plenty of people to
remind me of my feelings of exclusion.
 &HT;    From elementary through high school, I was only one of perhaps
10 Asian students in the overcrowded public schools I attended.
 &HT;    Although I was a popular kid, my ethnic background was always an
inescapable source of teasing. Not only did I have more nicknames
than anyone else _ among them ``Risa Ring,'' ``Lisa Yellow'' and
``Ching Chong'' _ I began to reject everything that had to do with
my ethnicity out of fear of humiliation.
 &HT;    I would never allow my friends to come over because my house
smelled like stir-fry. I tried to dye my hair blond and even
refused to associate with the few Asians on my high school campus.
 &HT;    The merciless teasing persisted throughout high school, but it
didn't end there. In fact, it got worse as I grew older.
 &HT;    In 1997, as a five-year veteran of Channel One News, a program
seen in over 12,000 middle and high schools across the United
States, I was chosen as Rolling Stone magazine's Hot Reporter for
their annual Hot Issue.
 &HT;    This was a big deal for me, and I was very excited and proud.
The day the issue hit the newsstands, the office was buzzing. At
the end of the day, I was retrieving my mail when I found a copy of
the Rolling Stone article in my box. Someone had cut the article
out of the magazine, crossed out the line describing me as a ``star
reporter'' and over my photo had drawn slanted slits over my eyes.
 &HT;    Having worked in the same office for over five years, I had felt
it was more of a home than my actual home. I had spent more time in
the office than anywhere else and had considered many of my
colleagues my friends.
 &HT;    Being in a professional environment, especially where a show for
students was being produced, the last place I expected a racial
attack was there.
 &HT;    I left the mailroom and ran into my office, not wanting to look
anyone in the eye because every person I passed looked suspicious
to me. I cried for half an hour.
 &HT;    Since then, I have never been able to attach myself to people
with whom I have a working relationship.
 &HT;    To some people, what separates me from everyone else, whether in
the classroom or in the office, are my eyes. Eyes that look
strikingly similar to those featured on Time and U.S. News &AMP; World
Report. When I see these things, or hear that the Chinese are
becoming the new ``Cold War enemy,'' I can't help but feel sadness
in my heart _ especially for those children in schools across the
United States who as it is have great difficulty deciphering who
they are and from where they come.
 &HT;    I don't doubt that for them, life may have just gotten a little
bit tougher.

 &HT;    To some people, what separates me from everyone else, whether in
the classroom or in the office, are my eyes. Eyes that look
strikingly similar to those featured on Time and U.S. News &AMP; World
Report. When I see these things, or hear that the Chinese are
becoming the new ``Cold War enemy,'' I can't help but feel sadness
in my heart _ especially for those children in schools across the
United States who as it is have great difficulty deciphering who
they are and from where they come.
 &HT;    I don't doubt that for them, life may have just gotten a little
bit tougher.

 &HT;    Salute to a man who lived life well
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not again.
</P>
<P>
   The news hit me with the most piercing sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   I am old enough, just barely, to remember John-John's salute, to
remember the day when Sister Maura announced over the loudspeaker
at Ascension School that the president had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't that day, nearly 36 years ago, I flashed back to
when I heard that JFK Jr.'s plane was missing. It was the tragedy
from only two summers before, from the August morning when I opened
the newspaper to the headline ``Princess Di Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen to the world's other most famous, most
incorrigibly photogenic human being? To the one other person in the
planet whose portrait seemed a part of all of our family albums?
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of Diana, naturally, in the early reports
of the disappearance. Hour after hour, as we waited and prayed for
a miracle, the networks obsessively replayed the familiar footage
of Kennedy family tragedies, old newsreels stuck in a perpetual
loop.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Coast Guard vigorously conducted what was still
being called a rescue effort, newscasters intoned about the
``Shakespearean tragedy'' of the Kennedys. A New York Post
columnist signed off, ``Good night, sweet prince.'' The ``Curse of
the Kennedys,'' others bluntly said.
</P>
<P>
   This, it seems to me, doesn't do justice to the way that John F.
Kennedy Jr. lived his life _ with joy, with vigor, with an uncanny
understanding of the privileges and perils of his unasked-for
wealth and fame. Perhaps no greater tribute can be paid to him than
to say that his life was not the stuff of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was comfortable in his own skin,'' a family friend said
over the weekend _ a remark that doesn't seem an overwhelming
tribute, except when you consider how miserable Diana often seemed
underneath that well-toned skin.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the heir to Camelot could have been neurotic as
all get-out. We all know people who turn an ingrown toenail into
tragedy. Consider the odds for a kid who spent his third birthday
at his father's funeral, who, from infancy on, lived a life as
close as we've come to the real-life version of The Truman Show.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was balm to our national wounds to see him, bronzed
and impossibly handsome, happy, adventurous, full of life. To watch
John and his sister Caroline grow up, apparently well-adjusted,
productive citizens, seemed some compensation for all the family
had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   When JFK Jr. faced the humiliation of failing the bar not once
but twice, he confronted the ``Hunk Flunks'' headlines head-on,
with trademark self-deprecating humor. ``I'm clearly not a legal
genius,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hounded by the media, he took the if-you-can't-beat-'em-join-'em
approach and founded George. And he outwitted the press for one
glorious day to marry Carolyn Bessette, declaring himself the
``happiest man alive.''
</P>
<P>
   People marveled at how, well, normal he seemed. However people
felt about the Kennedys in general, everybody always said, ``Jackie
did a good job with those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, everyone is saying, ``I hate to say it, but it's a good
thing Jackie didn't live to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. died tragically, but he did not lead a tragic life. If
we must make him the stuff of Shakespeare, cast him as Benedick,
not Hamlet. Cast him in a romance, a comedy in which the hero,
hobbled by adversity and his own failings, finds his way in life
and, of course, true love and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   It is no mean feat to spend your life in the public eye, to be
all but devoured by the public, and still to like people. It is no
small accomplishment to endure tragedy after tragedy, yet retain,
as the Bessette family said of the couple, ``a passion for life.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, John F. Kennedy Jr., we salute you.

 &HT;    Depth of feeling can be a curse
 &HT;    By Emily C. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every little thing makes me sad, which
is ridiculous, I know. The sound of a plane taking off in the
fading light of evening. The footage of him, a baby still, in the
White House. Even our slim, dark-haired waiter at dinner on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   I never talked to him or wrote about him or read anything he
wrote. I never thought about the man. Yet, in the days since JFK
Jr.'s death, I have shuffled through the hours under a sky of
unshakable sadness. It is a sadness both real and imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been like this with me. Some people swallow their
emotions. I wear mine right there on my sleeve. My first notion
that I might go through life being a little, shall we say,
emotional happened when I was about 8 years old. I couldn't watch
``Lassie'' without crying.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't listen to that whistling theme song without my lips
trembling and my heart racing in fear of what might come. Other
kids drew up to the television in anticipation of that final rescue
scene. I drew back, afraid.
</P>
<P>
   This used to affect just me. Then I got married and had a child.
And now, turns out, I've passed my emotions on to my son. He's got
his father's love for books. His father's quiet, unflappable sense
of concentration. He's got his dad's competitive nature at the
Monopoly board.
</P>
<P>
   From me, he's inherited a decent sense of humor and the
propensity for tears.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose there could be worse things. I could be the mother of
a girl with my thighs. But I shudder sometimes when I look at my
beautiful boy, his soft, altruistic side opening him up for so much
possible pain. Friends and family applaud my husband and myself for
raising what we today call ``a sensitive boy,'' a boy who likes
books. A boy whose friends are mostly girls. A boy who cried just
last week when he remembered how his favorite cap had blown away at
a baseball game two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I take their friendly compliments and smile. Then I silently
wish that he would run outside and pull the wings off a bug. Any
bug would do.
</P>
<P>
   Did I make him like this? I asked Dr. Marshall Teitelbaum, a
child psychiatrist I sometimes call for advice on my neurotic
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot to be said about the genetic component of
the personality,'' Teitelbaum says, easing my conscience ever so
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   We talk some more. He uses words such as gender and role
modeling. But what I really want this expert to tell me is how to
create a life for my son that is absent the emotional bruises of my
past. It is an answer the good doctor cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   Be gentle, Teitelbaum tells me. Be understanding. Demonstrate
strength. And talk, always, always talk. Sensitive children love to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want him to be the person who he is, but you also want him
to function and survive and be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy. He sure seems happy. He sings in the shower like his
father. He tells bad jokes at the dinner table like me. It's just
that it's so hard to watch as he races off into life with that
sensitive side of his. That side that's both a blessing and a
curse.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes us laugh. It's what makes us sob at ``Terms of
Endearment.'' It's what gets us out of bed in the morning. It's
what keeps us there.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes me afraid for my son.

 &HT;    Honor accomplished celebrities or celebrities by
accomplishments?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ John Fitzgerald Kennedy was my commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women in uniform are supposed to respect their
commander-in-chief. With President Kennedy, however, everyone I
knew in uniform respected the man as much as they did the position
he held.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was a military man himself. He served during World War
II. He was a battle veteran. Severely wounded in action, he
conducted himself above and beyond the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy put us on full alert during the Cuban missile
crisis, it helped to know that the person calling the shots had
been there and done it heroically.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Kennedy was assassinated, most Americans, if not
most people worldwide, felt the loss of a proven leader who had the
potential to make the world better.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had proven himself as a scholar, a prize-winning writer,
a war hero, a bold leader and a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of sorrow at the news of Kennedy's death in
Dallas in 1963 was understandable even to his enemies. Kennedy was
a tested leader in the midst of a red-hot cold war. He was a man of
considerable personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the outpouring of sorrow at the news of the untimely
death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. is less understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is a tragedy that JFK Jr., his wife and his
sister-in-law lost their lives in plane crash off Martha's Vineyard
in Massachusetts. Premature deaths always are tragic. Young people
should have the opportunity to experience all of life's seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect I have with the grief-stricken reactions of
average Americans at the news of Kennedy's plane crash is similar
to the difficulty I had understanding the emotional suffering
Americans showed upon learning that Princess Diana had been killed
in a car crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, President Kennedy had proven potential
to accomplish a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy was a man of celebrated accomplishments. John
Jr. and Princess Di were accomplished celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The young Kennedy's greatest apparent accomplishment was his
attempt to parlay celebrity and politics into George, his glossy
low-circulation magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a career based on glamour in politics may
eventually prove to be a stroke of genius. Maybe, maybe not. We do
know that after flunking the bar exam twice, the handsome young man
admitted, ``I'm clearly not a major legal genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people who have expressed heartfelt anguish over the news of
Kennedy's plane crash knew much about the young man. Like Princess
Di, Kennedy spent most of his life sheltered from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Americans old enough to remember his father's assassination,
also remember John John _ a term of endearment, it turns out, that
was made up by mistake by a reporter and was never used by family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Americans of a certain age remember the boy in short pants
saluting his father's passing coffin. They remember the photograph
of the boy playing under his father's desk in the Oval Office. And
they remember all the other photos of the boy and his family
released to the press.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the tabloids and the celebrity press carried
occasional photos or tidbits about the young man until he blossomed
into a celebrity hunk after college.
</P>
<P>
   I have this lingering feeling that the worldwide outpouring of
grief over the loss of Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. was
motivated in the main by good looks and glamour, attributes that
should not be confused with hard-won personal accomplishments.

 &HT;    Kennedy historian: `I recall him as a baby on my lap'
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Historian William Manchester has been
chronicling the Kennedy family since the first of them began to
die. He is old now. He has seen it all. Perhaps too much.
</P>
<P>
   He met Jack Kennedy just after World War II, when Manchester was
a reporter for The Baltimore Sun and Kennedy was contemplating a
run for Congress. They became friends. Manchester became an
adviser, trusted and respected by the Kennedy family. After JFK was
shot, Jackie Kennedy asked Manchester, and only Manchester, to
write the story of her husband's murder. He did. Death of a
President still sells, 30 years after publication.
</P>
<P>
   He has known John Kennedy Jr. since birth. He watched him grow,
watched his father die, his uncle, then years later, his mother.
And now, the son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot emote much more,'' he said Monday, speaking by
telephone from his house in Middletown, Conn., before Kennedy's
body was found in the water. ``I don't have much more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to another round of phone calls from the press,
calls that came in 1963, again in 1968 with Bobby's assassination,
with Jackie's death, the death of young Kennedy cousins. Nobody
calls anymore to ask Manchester to comment on election victories or
Kennedy marriages or births.
</P>
<P>
   The old historian, who has suffered two strokes in the past two
years, is seen by the press as a sage who can somehow offer a grand
unified theory of Kennedy family tragedy. But he is not prescient.
He's just an old family friend.
</P>
<P>
   If Manchester's words sound cool and precise it's because he's a
hard news journalist and historian, a just-the-facts type of guy.
He doesn't go for conspiracy theories or talk of a family curse or
larger-than-life mythologizing.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to talk about what he thinks, but what he feels is
another matter. His feelings are private and, from his standpoint
as a historian, irrelevant to the facts of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But John Jr.'s disappearance moved even the reticent Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, just so sad,'' he said. ``I remember Jack was so
delighted when his son was born. Only the press called him
John-John. The family never did. He was a nice little boy who grew
into a fine man, a nice man. I recall him as a baby on my lap in
the back of a speedboat off Cape Cod. His mother was water skiing
behind the boat. You don't think about what the future will bring
on a day like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kennedy died, said Manchester, before deciding, or at least
expressing, whether he would raise his son differently from his
father, Joe Kennedy, had raised him. Whether John Jr. was raised in
the hardball world of Kennedy family ambitions and politics would
be left to his mother, and she opted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Jr. was a Kennedy all the way, one of the cousins in all
regards, campaigning for Joe and Patrick, always at family
weddings, one of the group,'' said Manchester. ``But his mother
brought him up in a way that transcended the others, the family.
She was not going to be one of the sisters-in-law, not going to let
the family raise the boy. She was going to raise the boy. And did.
The publishing world, New York, different influences, not the
political expectancy. In that sense, John Jr. is different from the
cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   The name itself _ John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. _ set the boy
apart from his cousins. There were dozens of Kennedys, but only one
JFK and only one JFK Jr. It was not so much to shelter the boy from
enormous expectations but to prepare him to meet them head on that
Jackie removed him from the immediate orbits of the rest of the
family, said Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester has known four generations of Kennedys and
Fitzgeralds: Old ``Honey Fitz,'' who was mayor of Boston 100 years
ago; Joe Kennedy Sr., who pushed his son Jack into politics; Jack;
and Jack's son. He's met them all, and every president over the
past 50 years, and Churchill, magnates, potentates, generals and
giants of arts and letters. He has become a giant in his own right.
He knows he is considered a source by the media, and accepts that
role. He was a reporter once.
</P>
<P>
   But as so often happens, the biographer and adviser formed a
deep personal relationship with his subject. William Manchester
knew the Kennedys, not only as chronicler, but as a friend. He got
close to the flame. As much as he'd like to retain his cool
objectivity, he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I last saw John Jr. at a family wedding in Hickory Hill,''
said Manchester. ``He was grown, of course, a man. Handsome. Smart.
Like his father, his mother. A wonderful life in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester noted in an aside that his life took in almost as
much time as the lives of Jack Kennedy and his son, combined. He
paused, as if thinking of the meaning, if any, in that sad irony.
But when he spoke again it was to beg off more conversation. He was
tired, he said, from the stroke. Didn't feel well. Needed to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said. ``But I just can't emote any longer. He
was a fine young man.''
</P>
<P>
   And like so many Kennedys, like his father before him, John Jr.
will never know the tiredness that age brings, or the satisfaction,
or the memories.
</P>
<P>
   William Manchester knows about the memories.

 &HT;    Indelible images of Camelot at play
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The phone in Cecil Stoughton's Merritt
Island condo rings and rings: Another television producer, another
reporter, a friend who saw him on the ``Today Show'' or the ``CBS
Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting hoarse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's good, though, to keep busy at a time like this, to keep
talking, even if there's no way to avoid the painful topic that
everyone wants him to talk about: John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As White House photographer during the Kennedy years, Stoughton
took many of the pictures that forever fixed John and Caroline in
the public mind as they transformed the Oval Office into America's
playroom.
</P>
<P>
   When they crawled, he crawled. When they ran, he ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that picture of the two of them dancing and the
president clapping?'' he asks. ``That has to be my favorite. It's
so poignant. He's just a happy dad.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Stoughton. His own three children were a few years older
than John and Caroline, but they still got the chance to play
together. When the Kennedys came to Palm Beach for Easter or
Christmas, the Stoughtons came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and Caroline were a lot like my kids,'' Stoughton says.
``They were good when they were good, and brats when they were
brats. But they were never whiny. They were never spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoughton had been an Air Force photographer assigned to the
space program when his boss was tapped to be President Kennedy's
military aide. He brought Stoughton along to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the inaugural stand taking pictures of President
Kennedy as he took the oath,'' Stoughton says.
</P>
<P>
   Young John, born soon after his father's election in November
1960, spent the early months of the Kennedy presidency in a baby
carriage. ``Then he began to toddle and walk,'' Stoughton says.
``It was fun trying to keep up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady were gracious as Stoughton recorded
their public and private moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wonderful experience with them,'' Stoughton says. ``I
had no restrictions on where I could go or shoot. But I'd only go
where I was invited. I knew my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie was protective of her children in the presence of
unfamiliar photographers, but she was eager for Stoughton to record
important moments in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted me to make a series of pictures of her tucking the
kids into bed, or playing with them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls John playing with his mother's pearl necklace. A
moment later, the president walked in and sat on the floor with
him. Stoughton continued photographing until Jackie was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few minutes, she said gently, `That ought to be enough,
captain,' and then I was gone,'' Stoughton says.
</P>
<P>
   It was all gone in a few moments on Nov. 22, 1963. Stoughton was
riding through Dallas in the presidential motorcade. ``I heard the
shots,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There was no time to grieve. Stoughton was immediately assigned
to work for the new president. He was the only photographer aboard
U.S. One for the flight back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He shot the haunting picture of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath
of office as Jacqueline Kennedy stood by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about making sure everything worked, about
finding the right angle,'' Stoughton says. ``I told everyone where
to stand, so nothing would be missed. I composed the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The following days were just as busy, just as intense. The
procession, the funeral, the burial at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie met world leaders in the Red Room, and then she went
upstairs to have a birthday party for John,'' he says. ``By then I
was numb, doing my job by rote. I'm feeling the same kind of trauma
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoughton stayed at the White House for two more years. He
eventually became chief photographer for the National Park Service.
His Kennedy family photographs were the centerpiece of a book
published in 1973, The Memories: JFK, 1961-63. He retired to
Florida in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He saw Jackie Kennedy for the last time in 1979, when she asked
him to take pictures at the opening of the Kennedy Library. He saw
John Jr. twice in the last three years, once with his sister at a
library function and then by himself at the premiere of a
documentary about the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to speak with him, and he asked me to have
dinner at his table,'' says Stoughton, now 79. ``He was respectful,
and I was proud. He knew I felt like an uncle to him. I knew he was
going to make it. I knew he was raised as a winner.''

<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a so-called ``curse'' on the
Kennedy family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although ``curse'' is hardly a statistical or analytical
term, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) brought up the subject himself
in 1969. It was just after the incident on Chappaquiddick Island
off the Massachusetts coast in which his car careened off a bridge
and into a tidal pond, leaving campaign aide Mary Jo Kopechne dead.
Kennedy asked: ``Does some evil curse hang over us?''
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the media with respect to John F. Kennedy Jr. and
his wife and sister-in-law, Lt. Col. Anthony Crisgiana of the New
York Air National Guard again used the ``c'' word: ``If there's any
luck with the Kennedys, it seems to be bad luck. It just seems to
be a curse with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   But unusually large amounts of misfortune cannot, by definition,
defy statistical probability. Statisticians are quick to point out
that unusually large or small numbers of events are merely
unlikely, never impossible or in violation of any cosmic rule.
Instead of a ``curse,'' it might be better to say the direct
descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy have been extraordinarily unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Wills, author of ``The Kennedy Imprisonment,'' pointed out
that a large family always has a ``soap opera aspect.'' He added
that the idea of a special curse on the Kennedy's ``is the obverse
of the idea that they have a special destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Baseball announcers frequently refer to the Elias Sports
Bureau when they discuss baseball statistics. How can I contact
this organization? I've searched the Web, but find only references
to it at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   A: An Elias spokeswoman said there's no Web site. But baseball
fans can write or call: Elias Sports Bureau, 500 Fifth Ave., Suite
2140, New York, NY 10110; telephone 212-869-1530.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on the benefits of drinking tea,
specifically black tea, for its high concentration of compounds
that deter heart problems. For those who don't consume caffeine, do
decaffeinated teas provide the same benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeinated teas contain 50 to 90 percent of the flavonoid
levels of regular tea, said nutritionist Chris Rosenbloom,
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a professor
at Georgia State University. Flavonoids are the antioxidants in tea
that are related to some of the drink's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Teas decaffeinated with a process that uses carbon dioxide
retain the greatest quantities of flavonoid antioxidants,
Rosenbloom explained. She named Lipton as the only national brand
that uses the carbon dioxide process for decaffeinating teas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A former VA employee in New York reportedly used a fake card
to receive $5,011 a month in veterans benefits. How could anyone
qualify for benefits that high?
</P>
<P>
   A: In some instances, veterans can receive even more than that,
depending on a variety of medical conditions and specific
situations, said Tom Thomas of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Disability compensation rates vary from $96 monthly (for
service-connected veterans rated at 10 percent disabled) to $6,065
(for service-connected veterans rated at 100 percent disabled, with
special needs). For example, Thomas said, a triple amputee who is
married and has four children, is blind and requires home health
care as a result of service-related injuries, could receive $6,065
monthly. In some cases, veterans also can receive additional
compensation for dependent parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the case you cited, the man involved worked for the VA in
1986-87 and received more than $620,000 in benefits over12 years.
The perpetrators of this and several other fraudulent cases have
pleaded guilty and sentencing is pending, according to the VA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to obtain a program from the Women's World Cup
soccer match played recently in California?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The official game program is available exclusively
online _ http://st6.yahoo.com/worldcupstore/pp-0001.html _ as long
as supplies last. The cost is $3. The World Cup store's online site
_ http://st6.yahoo.com/worldcupstore/index.html _ has information
about ordering other related merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Red Cross is experiencing a shortage of donated blood.
How is the amount of blood a donor can give determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The volume of blood that can be obtained from a donor each
year is mandated by the Code of Federal Regulations issued by the
Food and Drug Administration, said Karen Eisele of American Red
Cross Blood Services. Individuals can donate a maximum of every 56
days (or six times a year), with blood centers required to collect
precisely 500 ml. each time. That amount is referred to by the Red
Cross as a ``unit'' of blood, which is a little more than a pint.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As an apparent way to increase miles per gallon, drivers of
many pickups keep their tailgate lowered. Is this legal ?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the theory that the tailgate disrupts air flow when it's
up _ thus creating a drag and lowering efficiency _ some drivers
indeed do leave it lowered. While there's no law against it in most
states, it's still the driver's responsibility to see that any load
being hauled must be properly secured so it doesn't come off and
pose a danger to other vehicles. In any case, some experts theorize
that leaving the tailgate up _ not down _ makes the vehicle more
aerodynamic, thus perhaps increasing gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In almost every baseball game I listen to, when the manager
substitutes a player, the radio announcer says it's a ``double
switch.'' What in the world does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a lineup shuffle used to get a good batter into the
pitcher's place in the batting order while bringing in a relief
pitcher. It usually comes in the late innings of a close game in
the National League or at any other level of the game when there is
no designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The double switch occurs on defense as the manager needs to
remove the pitcher on the mound for a reliever. Knowing that the
pitcher's turn in the batting order is coming up in the next
offensive inning, the manager then brings in the reliever as well
as a second new defensive player. The new player who is not the
pitcher (and presumably a good batter) is inserted into the
pitcher's spot and the new pitcher is put in the spot from which
the original player had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent obituary for Pete Conrad included a list of
astronauts who landed on the moon in 1969, 1971 and 1972. Hasn't
anyone been on the moon since then?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The last lunar mission, Apollo 17, landed in the Taurus
Mountains on Dec. 11, 1972. Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt rode
the lunar module to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   There have been none since the 1969-72 Apollo missions because
they achieved the goal of demonstrating U.S. technological
superiority. The race to the moon between the United States and the
Soviet Union ended with a clear-cut American triumph, and there's
no one to race today.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials in the Soviet Union publicly denied there had
ever been a Soviet equivalent to the Apollo program, information
made public in the 1980s showed that the Soviet government had an
ambitious lunar program that failed. The Soviet equivalent to the
Apollo command/service module was a two-person lunar modification
of the Soyuz capsule called the L-1.
</P>
<P>
   Manned L-1 capsules were believed to have been scheduled to fly
past the moon as part of a test program planned for 1966-1967, well
before the United States could attempt a lunar landing. But serious
problems developed and many of the boosters for the L-1 fly-by
exploded. The giant N-1 booster also continued to fail, with the
vehicle exploding in all four secret test flights between 1969 and
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A current Coca-Cola ad on TV has footage of an amusement park
ride dubbed in. It looks like a very wild ride. Can you tell me
what amusement park that comes from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thrill-seekers seeking a ride are out of luck. They won't be
able to hunt the roller coaster down for a very good reason: It's
not real. The commercial, created by Digital Domain (think
``Titanic''), was shot using a roller coaster car on a sound stage,
said Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott. Everything with that
core view _ all the twists and turns that make the commercial so
visually exciting _ was done by computer-generated imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the tomatoes that are sold with as many as
eight or 10 clustered on a stem. How are they grown so they're
always so uniformly ripe?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're similar to the variety Sweet 100, but bigger. They're
treated with ethylene gas for ripening and uniform color.

<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the situation in which
Monarch butterflies are being poisoned somehow from pollen on corn?
The last Monarch I saw was two years ago, and it was dying in my
flower bed.
</P>
<P>
   A: Such corn, of the strain known as Bt (genetically
engineered), is more common in the Midwest, where it was developed
for control of the European corn borer. Monarch caterpillars eating
milkweed leaves dusted with pollen from the altered corn plants
have been observed to eat less, grow more slowly and die more
quickly than those that didn't eat the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Disney Channel has been showing episodes of the 1950s TV
program ``Zorro.'' Can you tell me when Guy Williams, who portrayed
Zorro, passed away? Also, what were the words to the ``Zorro''
song? I couldn't make them out.
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams died at age 65 of natural causes in 1989 at his
apartment in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He had moved there from Los
Angeles after several years of dimishing roles in ``Lost in Space''
following the conclusion, in 1959, of the two-year run of the
Disney series ``Zorro'' on ABC-TV, and its subsequent syndication.
He rarely returned to the United States after moving to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Music played an important part throughout the series, with
composer William Lava writing a different musical theme for each of
the main characters, similar to the technique used in ``Peter and
the Wolf.'' But the main theme was the most important of all.
Written by Norman Foster (words) and George Bruns (music), it would
become one of the most popular of all TV shows with various
versions selling more than a million copies. Its words:
</P>
<P>
   Out of the night,/ when the full moon is bright,/ comes the
horseman known as Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   This bold renegade/ carves a Z with his blade,/ a Z that stands
for Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro, Zorro, the fox so cunning and free,/ Zorro, Zorro, who
makes the sign of the Z.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that some of the new U.S. quarters were being
recalled because the minting date was printed on the wrong side of
the coin. Can you shed some light?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. The date wasn't printed on the ``wrong'' side, so
there's no need for any recall, said Mint spokeswoman Lauren
Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   To make more room on the reverse of the commemorative quarters
for each state's design, Congress authorized the Mint in 1998 to
move certain design elements from the back to the front (and vice
versa). The legislation allowing for design changes doesn't affect
the statutory requirement that U.S. coins carry the inscriptions
``In God We Trust,'' ``Liberty,'' ``United States of America'' and
``E Pluribus Unum,'' as well as a designation of the value of the
coin and the year of minting or issuance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill amending Chapter 51 of Title 31 of the U.S. Code
permitted the secretary of the Treasury greater discretion with
placement of the required inscriptions. When the legislation was
approved, the Mint's director, Philip Diehl, said it gave Mint
engravers ``the artistic freedom needed for the statehood designs
on the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The latest Victoria's Secret commercial features a lovely
background aria. What is the music, and who is the singer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name of the piece is ``Sognare'' and the singer is Mitch
Coodley of Metro Music, a Victoria's Secret spokeswoman said. The
music was created specifically for the company and is not for sale,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about medical supplies being dropped at the
South Pole said the plane flew 700 feet above the Pole, but the
crew had to wear oxygen masks because they were 10,000 feet above
sea level. Does that mean the ice at the South Pole is 9,300 feet
thick?
</P>
<P>
   A: The geographic South Pole's glacial ice thickness is
8,850-9,200 feet, according to Encyclopedia Britannica and World
Book Encyclopedia. But the ice surface isn't perfectly flat
everywhere, and the elevation at any given point is constantly
subject to change. The plateau where the South Polar research base
is situated _ the place where the supplies were dropped _ is about
10,000 feet above sea level. The supply plane flew just 700 feet
above that. There are several definitions and locations of
``poles,'' by the way. The geographic pole's elevation is about
9,300 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story behind the number 33 on Rolling Rock beer?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows for sure the true meaning of the number, which
has appeared on the back of every bottle of Rolling Rock Premium
Beer since 1939. But there are some commonly held beliefs,
according to Latrobe Brewing Co., which lists these: the 33 honors
the year Prohibition was repealed (1933); there are 33 letters in
the ingredients (water, malt, rice, hops, corn, brewer's yeast);
and there are 33 words on the back label pledge (``Rolling Rock:
From the glass-lined tanks of old Latrobe we tender this premium
beer for your enjoyment as a tribute to your good taste. It comes
from the mountain springs to you. 33'').
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Rock is a product of Latrobe Brewing Co. of Latrobe, Pa.
Founded in 1893, the company now is owned by Labatt Breweries. To
hear the company's recorded information about what it terms the
``mystical 33,'' call 724-537-5545 and press 9 when prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the service in counties that deals with plants and
food called an ``extension agency''? I hear it mentioned in
gardening talk shows on radio. I always wonder in what sense that
is connected to gardening.
</P>
<P>
   A: The name Cooperative Extension Service dates to 1914, when
Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act establishing it. Sen. Hoke
Smith of Georgia and Sen. Frank Lever of South Carolina proposed a
way to ``extend'' the knowledge from agricultural colleges and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to serve the people who needed the
information, explained Janet Rodekohr, manager of public affairs
for the University of Georgia Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Extension Service has been called the largest
problem-solving educational system in the world. It links county
agents in almost every county in the nation with a vast pool of
university knowledge. Although it began as a way to help farm
families, it has expanded its scope over the years to respond to
local needs in urban and rural areas. That's why your county
extension agent can help you with gardening questions, food safety
concerns, or even youth development needs through the
Extension-directed 4-H Club program, as well as any agricultural
and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Extension work is coordinated through each state's land-grant
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Dow Jones Industrial Average has peaked at more than
11,000. Can you list the dates when each thousand-mark plateau has
been reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The DJIA's first close above 1,000 occurred on Nov. 14, 1972.
The other thousand plateaus were: 2,000, on Jan. 8, 1987; 3,000,
April 17, 1991; 4,000, Feb. 23, 1995; 5,000, Nov. 21, 1995; 6,000,
Oct. 14, 1996; 7,000, Feb. 13, 1997; 8,000, July 16, 1997; 9,000,
April 6, 1998; 10,000, March 29, 1999; and 11,000, May 3.

 &HT;    When one is left: The void that doesn't heal
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They left behind millions who are
mourning, millions who have prayed and wept and sent condolences
from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But that massive outpouring, as genuine and heartfelt as it is,
can't begin to compare with the grief of just two people _ Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg and Lisa Bessette, sisters of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., Caroline became the last
member of her immediate family. And with the death of his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, Lisa
became not just an only child, but also a surviving twin.
</P>
<P>
   Any grief is painful, yes. But in both of these cases, experts
say, it takes on a special significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the last one left, you're not only grieving about
the person who died,'' says Gloria Howser, a New York-based
counselor who specializes in loss. ``You're also saying goodbye to
the end of a common heritage, the end of shared memories. You may
have the support of uncles, aunts and cousins, but, most likely,
they didn't grow up in the same house with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't remember you opening presents on Christmas morning
when you were 6. They don't remember your first date.''
</P>
<P>
   Horace Wooten, 84, says it's childhood images that sadden him
the most. Wooten, a retiree who lives part time in Palm Beach
Gardens, is the youngest of three brothers and four sisters, all of
whom died in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my bride and my children, and I don't know what I'd do
without them,'' he says. ``But no, they aren't the same as the
people you grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget when we were teenagers and put watermelon
rinds under the wheels of my father's car. We covered them with
dirt, and when he tried to drive away, the wheels just spun and
spun. He was so damn mad, and us kids laughed till our stomachs
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still laugh when I tell it, but I'm the only one left
who can still see my daddy's face.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been numerous studies done on surviving twins,
there's little if any research on sole survivors (except those
who've lost families in cataclysmic events such as war and the
Holocaust).
</P>
<P>
   Caroline's extended family
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it's a compound loss,'' says Dr. Bruce Saltz, a Boca
Raton psychiatrist. ``But often these people don't come to the
attention of health-care providers. They may not realize that
certain symptoms, like sleeplessness and panic attacks _ comparable
to post-traumatic stress disorder _ could be helped with
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lawson, a professor of sociology who teaches a course on
death and survivorship at Florida Atlantic University's Davie
campus, says being the last doesn't necessarily mean being alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Caroline, she is the last of her direct family, but she
has an enormous extended family. They are very close, very
supportive. I think this is very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, 41, was extremely close to her brother, who was three
years younger. Together, they endured the assassinations of their
dad in 1963 and uncle five years later. And together, they adjusted
when their mom wed Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, the siblings often joined forces, presenting awards
and giving money to charities in their parents' honor.
</P>
<P>
   A missing twin is still felt
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that because Jacqueline Kennedy distanced John Jr.
and Caroline from the rest of the clan, support might be less
forthcoming because Caroline's ties aren't as close.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, Jackie didn't want her children to spend those
long summers in Hyannisport getting into trouble with their
cousins,'' says Laurence Leamer, part-time Palm Beacher and author
of The Kennedy Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she didn't separate her children from the family. Sen.
(Ted) Kennedy has gone to be with Caroline right now. He played
basketball with her three kids this afternoon. These are definitely
people who embrace their own.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be just such an embrace, experts say, that Lisa Bessette,
34, will miss the most about her twin sister, Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still feel your twin after they're gone, but you can't
hug them, and that's what hurts,'' says Raymond Brandt, founder of
Twinless Twins, a support network for surviving twins based in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Lives not lived in tandem
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, 70, lost his brother, Raymond, when the twins were 20.
The pain hasn't ebbed, even after half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grief over a twin isn't about the pain of loss, it's about the
pain of absence,'' he says. ``We have 2,000 members, and the most
prevalent thing I hear is, `I only feel one-half alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Nancy Segal, author of Entwined Lives: ``I suspect that the
loss of a twin arouses the dread and disbelief that it does because
twins enter the world in tandem and believe that they should
somehow exit in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, survivor guilt may arise. Why did she die and
not me? Why does a part of me feel good about finally being my own
person?
</P>
<P>
   Suicide among survivors
</P>
<P>
   ``When a twin dies, there can be a strange sense of freedom,''
writes Penelope Farmer, author of ``Two, The Book of Twins and
Doubles.'' ``It can be awfully exhilarating and you can feel
release. Then you feel guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer recalls losing her sister to breast cancer in 1991 at age
50: ``It was very physical. Like part of your body being ripped
away. I became obsessed with the notion of her body disintegrating.
And leading up to her death, I kept having this image of her grave
and jumping into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is prevalent among surviving twins, Brandt says, adding
that ``reckless behavior may also become a problem because the one
left behind doesn't care if he lives or dies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this need to be with your twin,'' he says. ``Like a
huge magnet being drawn to a piece of cast iron.''
</P>
<P>
   `It can be like an amputation'
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Read, a counselor at the Multiple Birth Foundation in
London, has seen this desire in her patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only beginning to know the effects from what surviving
twins tell us,'' she says. ``The grief can be prolonged over a
number of years when other members of the family have healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months and years later, (twins) can feel as if their right arm
is missing. It can be like an amputation.''

<P>
   Brandt admits he used to feel guilty for being alive but now
he's grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my brother so much that I wouldn't want him to have to
bear the grief I've endured from day one. I've really thought this
thing through, and I'm glad it was me who lived. He didn't deserve
the tears, the anxiety, the loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   While those feelings are especially acute after losing a twin,
they also play a role in recovering from the death of any sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often call this a disenfranchised loss, because so few
people recognize it as significant,'' says Maria Teahan, in charge
of bereavement services for Hospice of Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roles change,'' she says. ``You start to question where you
fit in. With the loss of a spouse, a survivor often can find
comfort in making funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A void that can't be filled
</P>
<P>
   ``But siblings may be left out of the planning process. You may
not be asked to take part in the ritual. You're unrecognized, which
may complicate your grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospice, in fact, recently formed a support group for grieving
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sibling loss makes you feel like you might be next,'' says
Paige Stuhr, group facilitator. ``It makes you feel afraid of
living and afraid of getting into relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there are the regrets. Perhaps there was sibling rivalry.
Perhaps the death was sudden, and you didn't get to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fitzgerald, 42, of West Palm Beach, lost her brother to
cancer in February. Christopher would've turned 44 next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was time to say goodbye, and I'm grateful that I could
hold his hand as he died,'' she says. ``But that doesn't make his
pain any less than if he died in a freak accident like the
Kennedys' this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, we had a love that was like the best parts of a
marriage. The friendship, the memories, the companionship. We were
best friends, and we loved each other dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a void that I'll never be able to fill.''

 &HT;    `Poor man's autopilot' saved this Piper flier lost in the murk
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Twenty years ago I was piloting a small
Piper plane from Gainesville, Fla. to West Palm Beach at night
when, to use aviation parlance, I ``lost my horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they are assuming happened to John F. Kennedy Jr. My
predicament _ losing the visual line of reference where sky meets
land and water _ was not identical to his, but it was probably
close. Kennedy, they are saying, was relying on sight to guide him
when he encountered haze that would have blurred the horizon,
leading to disorientation and loss of control of his aircraft, and
an eventual spiraling plunge into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I became gradually enveloped by gauzy clouds and
understood immediately that my decision to fly at night under what
had started out to be perfect ``Visual Flight Rules'' conditions,
was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall, I left Gainesville at twilight, southbound for Palm
Beach International Airport. I opened a flight plan for the
two-hour trip, and I monitored weather frequencies and local
airport winds and weather as I passed.
</P>
<P>
   I still got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As I passed over Vero Beach cruising at 125 mph in the 1965
Piper Cherokee 180C I co-owned with two co-workers, I could see the
stars above, the horizon and lights below. I flew at about 4,000
feet and visibility was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For a while.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't realize at the time was that a wispy cloud layer
was forming below me. I began to wonder what happened to the lights
that I had been using to confirm my compass heading. They had
gradually thinned out, then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   How could this be? After all, I was over a very populous area.
Then I saw a patch of lights below and ahead perhaps a mile or two.
Now I understood that a thin cloud layer had formed under me at
about 3,000 feet and that I was looking into a fast-closing patch
of clear air.
</P>
<P>
   I could turn around and go back, or drop through the hole in the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to descend, hoping that the opening would not close
before I got through.
</P>
<P>
   Where I enjoyed a big advantage over JFK Jr. was that I
understood that visibility was deteriorating. As I descended
through the cloud layer, I used an instrument called the artificial
horizon to verify that my wings were level, and then I did one more
thing.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped on the switch activating my wing leveler.
</P>
<P>
   The wing leveler, a common accessory on a 1965 Piper 4-passenger
aircraft and certainly available on Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II,
was touted as a poor man's autopilot. Now the plane flew straight
and true.
</P>
<P>
   Although I, like Kennedy, was not qualified to fly ``on
instruments,'' there was nothing to stop me from using them in a
pinch. Now I could descend through clouds or fog or haze without
fear of inadvertently tilting my wings into the infamous
``graveyard spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight aid worked perfectly. As I descended through the gap,
I spent the longest half minute of my life with my hands off the
controls, trusting the wing leveler as I maintained a sedate 500
feet per minute descent. I broke into glorious, clear air at 2,000
feet. My remaining 20-minute flight into PBIA was blessedly
uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   So, I'm wondering why Kennedy, when he realized that he couldn't
see the horizon, didn't simply bury his head in his instrument
panel long enough to true his wings and flip on his autopilot? The
best explanation I've read is that his disorientation came on so
gradually that he didn't realize he was in trouble until his plane
was almost upside down and plunging out of control.
</P>
<P>
   To those who wonder how Kennedy might have fared had he passed
the rigorous additional training required to fly by instruments
alone, I would pass along this quip from a retired military flight
instructor. The pilot flew his twin-engine Cessna frequently, yet
decided to give up his coveted instrument license while keeping his
ordinary license, subjecting him to the same weather restrictions
observed by pilots the likes of Kennedy and myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only fly once or twice a week,'' the pilot explained.
``That's not enough to stay sharp. I don't want to be tempted to
fly in bad weather. Without an instrument rating, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a recreational pilot, by all means, get all the
instrument flight training you can. Just don't use it.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take one of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about a so-called ``curse'' on the
Kennedy family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although ``curse'' is hardly a statistical or analytical
term, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) brought up the subject himself
in 1969. It was just after the incident on Chappaquiddick Island
off the Massachusetts coast in which his car careened off a bridge
and into a tidal pond, leaving campaign aide Mary Jo Kopechne dead.
Kennedy asked: ``Does some evil curse hang over us?''
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the media with respect to John F. Kennedy Jr. and
his wife and sister-in-law, Lt. Col. Anthony Crisgiana of the New
York Air National Guard again used the ``c'' word: ``If there's any
luck with the Kennedys, it seems to be bad luck. It just seems to
be a curse with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   But unusually large amounts of misfortune cannot, by definition,
defy statistical probability. Statisticians are quick to point out
that unusually large or small numbers of events are merely
unlikely, never impossible or in violation of any cosmic rule.
Instead of a ``curse,'' it might be better to say the direct
descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy have been extraordinarily unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Wills, author of ``The Kennedy Imprisonment,'' pointed out
that a large family always has a ``soap opera aspect.'' He added
that the idea of a special curse on the Kennedy's ``is the obverse
of the idea that they have a special destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Baseball announcers frequently refer to the Elias Sports
Bureau when they discuss baseball statistics. How can I contact
this organization? I've searched the Web, but find only references
to it at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   A: An Elias spokeswoman said there's no Web site. But baseball
fans can write or call: Elias Sports Bureau, 500 Fifth Ave., Suite
2140, New York, NY 10110; telephone 212-869-1530.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on the benefits of drinking tea,
specifically black tea, for its high concentration of compounds
that deter heart problems. For those who don't consume caffeine, do
decaffeinated teas provide the same benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeinated teas contain 50 to 90 percent of the flavonoid
levels of regular tea, said nutritionist Chris Rosenbloom,
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a professor
at Georgia State University. Flavonoids are the antioxidants in tea
that are related to some of the drink's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Teas decaffeinated with a process that uses carbon dioxide
retain the greatest quantities of flavonoid antioxidants,
Rosenbloom explained. She named Lipton as the only national brand
that uses the carbon dioxide process for decaffeinating teas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A former VA employee in New York reportedly used a fake card
to receive $5,011 a month in veterans benefits. How could anyone
qualify for benefits that high?
</P>
<P>
   A: In some instances, veterans can receive even more than that,
depending on a variety of medical conditions and specific
situations, said Tom Thomas of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Disability compensation rates vary from $96 monthly (for
service-connected veterans rated at 10 percent disabled) to $6,065
(for service-connected veterans rated at 100 percent disabled, with
special needs). For example, Thomas said, a triple amputee who is
married and has four children, is blind and requires home health
care as a result of service-related injuries, could receive $6,065
monthly. In some cases, veterans also can receive additional
compensation for dependent parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the case you cited, the man involved worked for the VA in
1986-87 and received more than $620,000 in benefits over12 years.
The perpetrators of this and several other fraudulent cases have
pleaded guilty and sentencing is pending, according to the VA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to obtain a program from the Women's World Cup
soccer match played recently in California?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The official game program is available exclusively
online _ http://st6.yahoo.com/worldcupstore/pp-0001.html _ as long
as supplies last. The cost is $3. The World Cup store's online site
_ http://st6.yahoo.com/worldcupstore/index.html _ has information
about ordering other related merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Red Cross is experiencing a shortage of donated blood.
How is the amount of blood a donor can give determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The volume of blood that can be obtained from a donor each
year is mandated by the Code of Federal Regulations issued by the
Food and Drug Administration, said Karen Eisele of American Red
Cross Blood Services. Individuals can donate a maximum of every 56
days (or six times a year), with blood centers required to collect
precisely 500 ml. each time. That amount is referred to by the Red
Cross as a ``unit'' of blood, which is a little more than a pint.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As an apparent way to increase miles per gallon, drivers of
many pickups keep their tailgate lowered. Is this legal ?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the theory that the tailgate disrupts air flow when it's
up _ thus creating a drag and lowering efficiency _ some drivers
indeed do leave it lowered. While there's no law against it in most
states, it's still the driver's responsibility to see that any load
being hauled must be properly secured so it doesn't come off and
pose a danger to other vehicles. In any case, some experts theorize
that leaving the tailgate up _ not down _ makes the vehicle more
aerodynamic, thus perhaps increasing gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In almost every baseball game I listen to, when the manager
substitutes a player, the radio announcer says it's a ``double
switch.'' What in the world does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a lineup shuffle used to get a good batter into the
pitcher's place in the batting order while bringing in a relief
pitcher. It usually comes in the late innings of a close game in
the National League or at any other level of the game when there is
no designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The double switch occurs on defense as the manager needs to
remove the pitcher on the mound for a reliever. Knowing that the
pitcher's turn in the batting order is coming up in the next
offensive inning, the manager then brings in the reliever as well
as a second new defensive player. The new player who is not the
pitcher (and presumably a good batter) is inserted into the
pitcher's spot and the new pitcher is put in the spot from which
the original player had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent obituary for Pete Conrad included a list of
astronauts who landed on the moon in 1969, 1971 and 1972. Hasn't
anyone been on the moon since then?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The last lunar mission, Apollo 17, landed in the Taurus
Mountains on Dec. 11, 1972. Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt rode
the lunar module to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   There have been none since the 1969-72 Apollo missions because
they achieved the goal of demonstrating U.S. technological
superiority. The race to the moon between the United States and the
Soviet Union ended with a clear-cut American triumph, and there's
no one to race today.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials in the Soviet Union publicly denied there had
ever been a Soviet equivalent to the Apollo program, information
made public in the 1980s showed that the Soviet government had an
ambitious lunar program that failed. The Soviet equivalent to the
Apollo command/service module was a two-person lunar modification
of the Soyuz capsule called the L-1.
</P>
<P>
   Manned L-1 capsules were believed to have been scheduled to fly
past the moon as part of a test program planned for 1966-1967, well
before the United States could attempt a lunar landing. But serious
problems developed and many of the boosters for the L-1 fly-by
exploded. The giant N-1 booster also continued to fail, with the
vehicle exploding in all four secret test flights between 1969 and
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A current Coca-Cola ad on TV has footage of an amusement park
ride dubbed in. It looks like a very wild ride. Can you tell me
what amusement park that comes from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thrill-seekers seeking a ride are out of luck. They won't be
able to hunt the roller coaster down for a very good reason: It's
not real. The commercial, created by Digital Domain (think
``Titanic''), was shot using a roller coaster car on a sound stage,
said Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott. Everything with that
core view _ all the twists and turns that make the commercial so
visually exciting _ was done by computer-generated imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the tomatoes that are sold with as many as
eight or 10 clustered on a stem. How are they grown so they're
always so uniformly ripe?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're similar to the variety Sweet 100, but bigger. They're
treated with ethylene gas for ripening and uniform color.

<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the situation in which
Monarch butterflies are being poisoned somehow from pollen on corn?
The last Monarch I saw was two years ago, and it was dying in my
flower bed.
</P>
<P>
   A: Such corn, of the strain known as Bt (genetically
engineered), is more common in the Midwest, where it was developed
for control of the European corn borer. Monarch caterpillars eating
milkweed leaves dusted with pollen from the altered corn plants
have been observed to eat less, grow more slowly and die more
quickly than those that didn't eat the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Disney Channel has been showing episodes of the 1950s TV
program ``Zorro.'' Can you tell me when Guy Williams, who portrayed
Zorro, passed away? Also, what were the words to the ``Zorro''
song? I couldn't make them out.
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams died at age 65 of natural causes in 1989 at his
apartment in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He had moved there from Los
Angeles after several years of dimishing roles in ``Lost in Space''
following the conclusion, in 1959, of the two-year run of the
Disney series ``Zorro'' on ABC-TV, and its subsequent syndication.
He rarely returned to the United States after moving to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Music played an important part throughout the series, with
composer William Lava writing a different musical theme for each of
the main characters, similar to the technique used in ``Peter and
the Wolf.'' But the main theme was the most important of all.
Written by Norman Foster (words) and George Bruns (music), it would
become one of the most popular of all TV shows with various
versions selling more than a million copies. Its words:
</P>
<P>
   Out of the night,/ when the full moon is bright,/ comes the
horseman known as Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   This bold renegade/ carves a Z with his blade,/ a Z that stands
for Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro, Zorro, the fox so cunning and free,/ Zorro, Zorro, who
makes the sign of the Z.
</P>
<P>
   Zorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that some of the new U.S. quarters were being
recalled because the minting date was printed on the wrong side of
the coin. Can you shed some light?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so. The date wasn't printed on the ``wrong'' side, so
there's no need for any recall, said Mint spokeswoman Lauren
Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   To make more room on the reverse of the commemorative quarters
for each state's design, Congress authorized the Mint in 1998 to
move certain design elements from the back to the front (and vice
versa). The legislation allowing for design changes doesn't affect
the statutory requirement that U.S. coins carry the inscriptions
``In God We Trust,'' ``Liberty,'' ``United States of America'' and
``E Pluribus Unum,'' as well as a designation of the value of the
coin and the year of minting or issuance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill amending Chapter 51 of Title 31 of the U.S. Code
permitted the secretary of the Treasury greater discretion with
placement of the required inscriptions. When the legislation was
approved, the Mint's director, Philip Diehl, said it gave Mint
engravers ``the artistic freedom needed for the statehood designs
on the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The latest Victoria's Secret commercial features a lovely
background aria. What is the music, and who is the singer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name of the piece is ``Sognare'' and the singer is Mitch
Coodley of Metro Music, a Victoria's Secret spokeswoman said. The
music was created specifically for the company and is not for sale,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about medical supplies being dropped at the
South Pole said the plane flew 700 feet above the Pole, but the
crew had to wear oxygen masks because they were 10,000 feet above
sea level. Does that mean the ice at the South Pole is 9,300 feet
thick?
</P>
<P>
   A: The geographic South Pole's glacial ice thickness is
8,850-9,200 feet, according to Encyclopedia Britannica and World
Book Encyclopedia. But the ice surface isn't perfectly flat
everywhere, and the elevation at any given point is constantly
subject to change. The plateau where the South Polar research base
is situated _ the place where the supplies were dropped _ is about
10,000 feet above sea level. The supply plane flew just 700 feet
above that. There are several definitions and locations of
``poles,'' by the way. The geographic pole's elevation is about
9,300 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story behind the number 33 on Rolling Rock beer?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows for sure the true meaning of the number, which
has appeared on the back of every bottle of Rolling Rock Premium
Beer since 1939. But there are some commonly held beliefs,
according to Latrobe Brewing Co., which lists these: the 33 honors
the year Prohibition was repealed (1933); there are 33 letters in
the ingredients (water, malt, rice, hops, corn, brewer's yeast);
and there are 33 words on the back label pledge (``Rolling Rock:
From the glass-lined tanks of old Latrobe we tender this premium
beer for your enjoyment as a tribute to your good taste. It comes
from the mountain springs to you. 33'').
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Rock is a product of Latrobe Brewing Co. of Latrobe, Pa.
Founded in 1893, the company now is owned by Labatt Breweries. To
hear the company's recorded information about what it terms the
``mystical 33,'' call 724-537-5545 and press 9 when prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the service in counties that deals with plants and
food called an ``extension agency''? I hear it mentioned in
gardening talk shows on radio. I always wonder in what sense that
is connected to gardening.
</P>
<P>
   A: The name Cooperative Extension Service dates to 1914, when
Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act establishing it. Sen. Hoke
Smith of Georgia and Sen. Frank Lever of South Carolina proposed a
way to ``extend'' the knowledge from agricultural colleges and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to serve the people who needed the
information, explained Janet Rodekohr, manager of public affairs
for the University of Georgia Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Extension Service has been called the largest
problem-solving educational system in the world. It links county
agents in almost every county in the nation with a vast pool of
university knowledge. Although it began as a way to help farm
families, it has expanded its scope over the years to respond to
local needs in urban and rural areas. That's why your county
extension agent can help you with gardening questions, food safety
concerns, or even youth development needs through the
Extension-directed 4-H Club program, as well as any agricultural
and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Extension work is coordinated through each state's land-grant
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Dow Jones Industrial Average has peaked at more than
11,000. Can you list the dates when each thousand-mark plateau has
been reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The DJIA's first close above 1,000 occurred on Nov. 14, 1972.
The other thousand plateaus were: 2,000, on Jan. 8, 1987; 3,000,
April 17, 1991; 4,000, Feb. 23, 1995; 5,000, Nov. 21, 1995; 6,000,
Oct. 14, 1996; 7,000, Feb. 13, 1997; 8,000, July 16, 1997; 9,000,
April 6, 1998; 10,000, March 29, 1999; and 11,000, May 3.

 &HT;    Neglected grape redeemed

   DAYTON, Ohio _ No one knows exactly what sin the poor sauvignon
blanc grape committed to relegate itself to poor-stepsister status
to chardonnay, aka the Cinderella of white grapes. But it must have
been a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while winemakers worldwide fall over themselves to plant
more chardonnay, sauvignon blanc's image suffers. The grape
occasionally suffers the indignity of being ripped out of the
ground to make way for chardonnay vines. Sheesh, that's what we
wine drinkers need: one more vapid, overpriced but
easy-to-pronounce chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvignon blancs deserve a break. They're underappreciated, less
expensive and often more food-friendly than chardonnay, and they
shine especially bright this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The grape has some telltale characteristics, especially in
aromas, which can include a grassiness, or even a faint cat-pee
smell. (I know, why would anyone want to drink something that
smelled like that? Well, it's faint, just barely there, and
besides, we wine geeks are a strange breed indeed, and our aroma
descriptions, well. . . .).
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers and grape growers have in recent years taken steps to
tame the vegetal nature of sauvignon blanc, then to cover it up
further by aging and fermentation in oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they made it taste like chardonnay. Nice effort,
ho-hum results.
</P>
<P>
   The best versions of sauvignon blanc strike a balance between
the extremes. The varietal grassiness is held in check but not
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled a few of the least expensive and widely available
California sauvignon blancs and threw in a couple others for fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glen Ellen 1997 Sauvignon Blanc, $4.99: No grassiness, a hint
of sweetness at first sip but a slightly bitter, grapefruitlike
aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sutter Home 1998 Sauvignon Blanc, $5.99: Very lemony-citrusy,
no hint of sweetness or grassiness. Excellent value _ surprisingly
flavorful for a wine of this price. Built to accompany food, as it
might be a bit puckery for an aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woodbridge (Robert Mondavi) Sauvignon Blanc 1997, $6.79: Good,
clean, crisp white wine with little sauvignon blanc
characteristics. A bit light.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.H. Phillips Sauvignon Blanc ``Night Harvest'' 1997, $7.79:
This wine also has just a hint of grassiness but has more complex,
concentrated flavors. Excellent value.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Supery Sauvignon Blanc 1998, $12.99: Strikes the right
balance between the creamy, chardonnay style and the grassy, light
extreme. With everything in the right proportion, one sip of this
wine begs the next.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reverdy Sancerre ``La Coute'' 1997, $18.99: In France,
sauvignon blanc is at its best in wines labeled Sancerre and Poully
Fume, where it is bottled without blending. The grape also forms
the backbone of Bordeaux white wines, where it is blended with
semillon. This wine, like most French whites, has a bit more
acidity than its California counterparts, but plenty of ripe fruit
to balance the acidity and just the right nuances of grassiness.

   KENNEDY-HISTORIAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Historian William
Manchester has been chronicling the Kennedy family since the first
of them began to die. He is old now. He has seen it all. Perhaps
too much. (Reid, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   ONE-SURVIVOR _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They left behind millions
who are mourning, millions who have prayed and wept and sent
condolences from around the globe. But that massive outpouring, as
genuine and heartfelt as it is, can't begin to compare with the
grief of just two people _ Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and Lisa
Bessette, sisters of the victims. With the death of John F. Kennedy
Jr., Caroline became the last member of her immediate family. And
with the death of his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, Lisa became not just an only child, but
also a surviving twin. Any grief is painful, yes. But in both of
these cases, experts say, it takes on a special significance.
(Grantham, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-PHOTOGRAPHER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The phone in
Cecil Stoughton's Merritt Island condo rings and rings: Another
television producer, another reporter, a friend who saw him on the
``Today Show'' or the ``CBS Evening News.'' ``I'm getting hoarse,''
he says. It's good, though, to keep busy at a time like this, to
keep talking, even if there's no way to avoid the painful topic
that everyone wants him to talk about: John F. Kennedy Jr. As White
House photographer during the Kennedy years, Stoughton took many of
the pictures that forever fixed John and Caroline in the public
mind as they transformed the Oval Office into America's playroom.

 &HT;    Cool cheeese
 &HT;    By Skippy Harwood
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cool, crisp salads are a welcome part of summer, and flavorful
cheeses such as feta, made in this country in Wisconsin usually
from cow's milk and in Greece usually from sheep's milk add an
agreeable tang.
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas provide a Spanish note and the option of a wrapped
salad, which becomes even more interesting when hummus is used as a
spread for the tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   Like feta, hummus is a distinctive food with origins in the
Mediterranean. A thick puree made with mashed chick peas (garbanzo
beans), lemons, spices and olive oil, it can be used as a dip or a
spread. Almost every Middle East family has own version.
</P>
<P>
   For a wrapped Greek salad, spread hummus on tortillas and top
with crumbles of feta cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber,
onions and olives.
</P>
<P>
   Hummus is available commercially in flavors such as roasted red
pepper, roasted garlic, pesto, scallion, black olive, cucumber,
dill, spicy three-pepper and more.
</P>
<P>
   A stimulating main course salad of feta tossed with marinated
grilled mushrooms, fresh spinach, tomato and red onion slices can
be a colorful centerpiece for an alfresco evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowtie pasta tossed with feta, sundried tomatoes, cilantro,
kalamata olives, garlic and red pepper flakes makes a savory entree
that can be served warm or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Loomis writes fondly of a goat cheese in red wine dessert
in her French Farmhouse Cookbook, published by Workman. That recipe
is very specific to Provence--where the goat cheese has a special
tang that comes from the wild herbs that provide forage for the
goats on the rocky hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   The goat cheese in red wine was prepared for Loomis at the Les
Ramparts restaurant in Venasque, France, by chef Pascale Engasser
who explained that everyone in his village makes it with slight
variations.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Loomis explains, each farm had its grape vines,
its goats and beehives to contribute to the dessert
</P>
<P>
   GOAT CHEESE IN RED WINE
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle hearty red wine such as Cotes du Rhone
</P>
<P>
   or Cotes du Ventoux
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons mild honey,
</P>
<P>
   such as spring wildflower
</P>
<P>
   3 fresh, plain, soft goat
</P>
<P>
   cheeses, each 6 to 8 ounces
</P>
<P>
   Tiny mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Candied lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the wine in a medium-size heavy saucepan over mediumhigh
heat until it boils. Then reduce the heat and simmer just until it
has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully flame the wine, to remove any excess alcohol, by
passing a long match over its surface. The flames will flare and
then die down almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Add the sugar and the honey, and stir with a wooden spoon until
dissolved. (You may make the recipe up to this point several days
in advance and refrigerate it.)
</P>
<P>
   Cut the goat cheeses in half horizontally, and place one half in
each of 6 shallow bowls. Return the wine mixture to a boil, remove
it from the heat, and carefully ladle the wine around the cheeses.
Serve immediately--garnished with the mint and lemon zest, if
desired.

<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Twenty years ago I was
piloting a small Piper plane from Gainesville, Fla. to West Palm
Beach at night when, to use aviation parlance, I ``lost my
horizon.'' That's what they are assuming happened to John F.
Kennedy Jr. My predicament _ losing the visual line of reference
where sky meets land and water _ was not identical to his, but it
was probably close. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Not again. The news hit me with
the most piercing sense of deja vu. I am old enough, just barely,
to remember John-John's salute, to remember the day when Sister
Maura announced over the loudspeaker at Ascension School that the
president had been killed. But it wasn't that day, nearly 36 years
ago, I flashed back to when I heard that JFK Jr.'s plane was
missing. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The outpouring of sorrow at the
news of Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963 was understandable even
to his enemies. Kennedy was a tested leader in the midst of a
red-hot cold war. He was a man of considerable personal
accomplishments. The outpouring of sorrow at the news of the
untimely deaths of Princess Diana and John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr.
is less understandable. President Kennedy was a man of celebrated
accomplishments. John Jr. and Princess Di were accomplished
celebrities. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I suppose there could be
worse things. I could be the mother of a girl with my thighs. But I
shudder sometimes when I look at my beautiful boy, his soft,
altruistic side opening him up for so much possible pain. Friends
and family applaud my husband and myself for raising what we today
call ``a sensitive boy,'' a boy who likes books. A boy whose
friends are mostly girls. A boy who cried just last week when he
remembered how his favorite cap had blown away at a baseball game
two years ago. I take their friendly compliments and smile. Then I
silently wish that he would run outside and pull the wings off a
bug. Any bug would do. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Twenty years ago I was
piloting a small Piper plane from Gainesville, Fla. to West Palm
Beach at night when, to use aviation parlance, I ``lost my
horizon.'' That's what they are assuming happened to John F.
Kennedy Jr. My predicament _ losing the visual line of reference
where sky meets land and water _ was not identical to his, but it
was probably close. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Not again. The news hit me with
the most piercing sense of deja vu. I am old enough, just barely,
to remember John-John's salute, to remember the day when Sister
Maura announced over the loudspeaker at Ascension School that the
president had been killed. But it wasn't that day, nearly 36 years
ago, I flashed back to when I heard that JFK Jr.'s plane was
missing. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The outpouring of sorrow at the
news of Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963 was understandable even
to his enemies. Kennedy was a tested leader in the midst of a
red-hot cold war. He was a man of considerable personal
accomplishments. The outpouring of sorrow at the news of the
untimely deaths of Princess Diana and John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr.
is less understandable. President Kennedy was a man of celebrated
accomplishments. John Jr. and Princess Di were accomplished
celebrities. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I suppose there could be
worse things. I could be the mother of a girl with my thighs. But I
shudder sometimes when I look at my beautiful boy, his soft,
altruistic side opening him up for so much possible pain. Friends
and family applaud my husband and myself for raising what we today
call ``a sensitive boy,'' a boy who likes books. A boy whose
friends are mostly girls. A boy who cried just last week when he
remembered how his favorite cap had blown away at a baseball game
two years ago. I take their friendly compliments and smile. Then I
silently wish that he would run outside and pull the wings off a
bug. Any bug would do. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-HISTORIAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Historian William
Manchester has been chronicling the Kennedy family since the first
of them began to die. He is old now. He has seen it all. Perhaps
too much. (Reid, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   ONE-SURVIVOR _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They left behind millions
who are mourning, millions who have prayed and wept and sent
condolences from around the globe. But that massive outpouring, as
genuine and heartfelt as it is, can't begin to compare with the
grief of just two people _ Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and Lisa
Bessette, sisters of the victims. With the death of John F. Kennedy
Jr., Caroline became the last member of her immediate family. And
with the death of his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her
sister, Lauren Bessette, Lisa became not just an only child, but
also a surviving twin. Any grief is painful, yes. But in both of
these cases, experts say, it takes on a special significance.
(Grantham, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-PHOTOGRAPHER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The phone in
Cecil Stoughton's Merritt Island condo rings and rings: Another
television producer, another reporter, a friend who saw him on the
``Today Show'' or the ``CBS Evening News.'' ``I'm getting hoarse,''
he says. It's good, though, to keep busy at a time like this, to
keep talking, even if there's no way to avoid the painful topic
that everyone wants him to talk about: John F. Kennedy Jr. As White
House photographer during the Kennedy years, Stoughton took many of
the pictures that forever fixed John and Caroline in the public
mind as they transformed the Oval Office into America's playroom.
(Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NEWS-QUESTIONS _ Q&AMP;A on the news, in two takes. (Bessonnette,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (l, a) MOVED.

   FOOD

<P>
   (EDS: This is the CoxNet FOOD page for the current week. This
layout is now available.)
</P>
<P>
   COXNET FOOD 0720 _ If corn and tomatoes are synonymous with
summer, so is another uniquely American specialty _ crab cakes.
That's because premium crab meat usually becomes available after an
East Coast Fourth of July celebration that was traditionally a crab
orgy. (Heller, Dayton Daily News) Art includes 3-column color photo
of Crab Cakes.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CRASH COURSE IN CRABS _ A primer on the varieties of
crabs.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES _ Ann's Crab Cakes, Thomato's Salmon Cakes.
</P>

the Internet is the place to find berry recipes. (Parham, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) With recipe for Glazed Lemon Blueberry Yogurt
Muffins.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MALE COOKING BOOK _ A new book shows, in a humorous
manner, that a man's place really is in the kitchen. (Peterson,
N.Y. Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-RECIPESWAP _A weekly recipe exchange column. This week:
Green tomato pie casserole. (Langhenry, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>

   FOOD-SKUBE-BEERCOLUMN _ Michael Skube's beer column is not
available this week.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-CYBERSPICE _ A weekly column looking at the plethora of
recipes on the Internet. (Parham, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WINE-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ No one knows exactly what sin the
poor sauvignon blanc grape committed to relegate itself to
poor-stepsister status to chardonnay, aka the Cinderella of white
grapes. But it must have been a doozy. Today, while winemakers
worldwide fall over themselves to plant more chardonnay, sauvignon
blanc's image suffers. (Fisher, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   PBDN-CHEESE _ Do as the Greeks do and crumble feta cheese over
the top of salads or wraps for a more flavorful treat. (Harwood,
Palm Beach Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS
</P>
<P>

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SNUFF-CANCER (San Antonio) _ For those thinking about giving up
that smokeless tobacco habit, a new Air Force study provides some
good news: Most pre-cancerous changes in the mouth caused by snuff
and chewing tobacco disappear within weeks after quitting. By
NICOLE FOY.
</P>
<P>
   FUNERALS-TURKEY (Daly City, Calif.) _ It started 36 years ago in
Madeline Duggan's kitchen as the smallest of gestures. After a
close friend of the family died, the mortuary owner and her husband
wanted to do something more than just lay the loved one to rest. So
Duggan put on an apron, prepared a turkey and brought it to the
grieving family's home. The deliveries haven't stopped since. By
PETER HARTLAUB.
</P>
<P>
   GAY-KILLING (San Francisco) _ A closely watched hate crime case
in the killing of a gay San Francisco man is about to go to trial
in the glare of national publicity over the murder of Matthew
Shepard in Wyoming. By CAROL NESS.
</P>
<P>
   ASTHMA-CHILDREN (Albany, N.Y.) _ With new research illustrating
the potential side effects from long-term use of the medications,
including weight gain, parents and physicians are looking at more
natural ways to manage asthma in kids. With asthma now the leading
cause of chronic illness in children, figuring out ways to manage
the disease is more important than ever, specialists say. By SYLVIA
WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TORTOISE-RETIREMENT (Denton, Texas) _ When Jiggs is in the
house, everybody gathers around. He's old and moves slowly, but has
a winning personality that makes his friends want to cozy up to him
and shoot the breeze. He can be stoic and detached, but if you're
dancing, he likes to join the party. Since March, Jiggs has lived
among the elderly residents of the Alterra Sterling House, an
assisted living center in Denton. And since 1933, Jiggs _ a desert
tortoise _ been hanging out with Ken Connor. By JIM HENDERSON.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-BOOKS (Albany, N.Y.) _ They've become familiar targets.
After incidents like the school shooting in Littleton, Colo.,
fingers readily point to the usual suspects: Marilyn Manson,
ultraviolent films and fantasy games. But one English professor and
the author of a new book says the literature of Ernest Hemingway
and others may have an even greater influence than those of the
dark denizens of popular culture. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   RACETRACK-CHAPLAIN (Houston) _ The Rev. Randy Weaver, an
Assemblies of God minister, reaches out to everyone from horse
owners to stable hands as chaplain of the Sam Houston Race Track.
Weaver is one of only 39 racetrack chaplains nationwide. (Photos
available on NYT database) By RICHARD VARA.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL (``f'' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WORK-VACATIONS (San Francisco) _ When it comes to taking days
off, Corporate America is the model of trickle down stupidity.
Companies have too much short-term greed to appreciate their
importance, making executives less likely to take time for
themselves. And if the boss doesn't get a perk, how many
rank-and-filers will? By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   DIVERSITY (San Francisco) _ You have a six-person staff: a white
man, age 60; a Hispanic woman, 50; an African American man, 45; a
white woman, 35; an Asian man, 30; and a white woman, 25. It's the
picture of diversity, but it might be deceiving. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-PREVIEWS-RACE (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Nothing has galvanized the
Television Critics Association summer press tour more than race.
Where in years past it was an issue that came up sporadically _
because it's a continual problem _ this year it has taken on more
heft because of the NAACP's threats to hold TV networks responsible
for accurate representation. You're not going to find a black actor
or producer who doesn't have a comment about the plight of
minorities in the TV business. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WRESTLING (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Here is a bizarre notion: Pro
wrestling may become a victim of its own popularity. For a moment,
put aside the inappropriateness of the new breed of rasslin' for
kids: There is way too much sexual innuendo and vulgarity, even
though that breed of entertainment (not sport, although they are
athletes) markets heavily toward children. By MARK MCGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Jerry Springer for Senate? Why
not? Think how C-SPAN's ratings would soar. Think how entertaining
impeachment trials could be, especially if senators could be given
lighter chairs, ones they could throw. Think how enlightened the
Senate could become on issues such as male lesbians, cross-
dressing nudists and bosses who cheat on their wives with young
employees while conducting foreign affairs on the phone. Oh, that's
right. We already did that show. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Piedmont, Calif.) _ When the NAACP speaks, the TV
networks listen. Or do they? Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, last
week criticized the four major TV networks for not having enough
African American lead characters in their shows. Faster than you
can say ``must-see TV,'' network bosses said, ``Yeah, that's
right,'' or words to that effect. By WILLIAM WONG.
</P>
<P>
   PILOTING-DANGERS (Columbia, Md.) _ The sky, like the sea, is a
terribly unforgiving place. The third dimension of flight and the
need to keep moving forward or fall make it a risky place for those
who do not know their limits. By GORDON LIVINGSTON.

<P>
   1. THE LONG GOODBYE It could be the beginning of the end of
celluloid for film production and projection. An electronic cinema
system with digital video projectors may be used in future. By
Barry Fox. From New Scientist Magazine. 600 words. (N/A Australia,
New Zealand, Brazil.)
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
SUMMER SIZZLE : TELEVISION'S SEXIEST STARS Since its earliest days,
television has specialized in sexy stars who brought colour even to
the age of black and white. But who are today's sexiest stars? Here
are some men and women who can make even the hottest summer day a
little hotter. By Catherine Dawson, Brian Hartigan and Angela
Barker. From TV Guide Canada. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
BEAUTY QUEENS Two young, fast-rising actresses represent the
current state of sex appeal in Hollywood. Denise Richards (''Wild
Things'' and the new James Bond thriller,) has the sultry glamour
market cornered, while Kirsten Dunst (''Toy Soldiers'' and
``Jumanji,'') is the wholesome, blonde girl-next-door who can also
act. They join forces in ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' a dark comedy set
in the strange, intensively competitive and deadly world of ...
beauty pageants. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,200 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
FRENCH TV : HARD-HITTING SLOGANS AND GRIM PICTURES ARE
</P>
<P>
   NEW WEAPONS AGAINST ROAD DEATHS French TV viewers are currently
being shown three powerful road-safety public information films
that mark a radical break with tradition. The well-known
documentary film-maker, Raymond Depardon, has opted for maximum
effect by creating an ironic discrepancy between soundtrack and
visuals. Carefree people are seen setting off on their holidays to
the strains of a happy song, but accompanying the song are pictures
of car accidents, a smashed motorbike, blankets being drawn over
dead bodies and victims in excruciating pain and tears. By
Jean-Michel Normand. From Le Monde. 1,000 words. (English
translation available.)
_______________________________________________________

<P>
   5. BAD GUYS HAVE ALL THE FUN : RUPERT EVERETT SINKS
</P>
<P>
   HIS CLAW INTO 'INSPECTOR GADGET' Rupert Everett doesn't much
care if people think it's possible for an openly gay man to be a
major Hollywood star. But if he can't, maybe it isn't possible,
because in every other respect he is the ideal, handsome big-screen
leading man. Despite the fears of closeted stars, past and present,
Everett thinks his open homosexuality hasn't hurt his career in the
least. ``Coming out is one of the best things I've ever done,'' he
says. In a switch from his typically elegant image, Everett now
plays the vampy villain Claw in the new children's movie,
``Inspector Gadget.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
THE TYRANNY OF THE HIT SINGLE With the example of artists like Ani
DiFranco, who successfully started her own label, Righteous Babe,
and the hotly contested MP3 technology, which allows listeners to
download music from the Internet, artists are nose-thumbing
commercial taste and traditional distribution. The newest arrival
on this scene is Aimee Mann. Critics loved her, but she couldn't
remake herself as a '90s pop star. With the industry now in
turmoil, she may not have to. By Jonathan Van Meter. From The New
York Times Magazine. Full-length (5,000 words) + edited article
available.
_____________________________________________________________7.
EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD PITCH THAT GOOD Country music legend
Kenny Rogers, whose current hit song is ``The Greatest,'' (about a
boy, a ball and a bat,) has written this special essay about the
lessons that baseball teaches young and old. ``It goes beyond music
and baseball. It's about life,'' Rogers says. 1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES : RICHARD GERE, JULIA ROBERTS
</P>
<P>
   AND ROMANCE MAKES THREE Moviegoers used to Richard Gere's
serious side are in for a surprise with ``Runaway Bride,'' a
romantic comedy that reunites him with ``Pretty Woman'' co-star
Julia Roberts and director Garry Marshall. Re-teaming with Roberts
took ten years, Gere insists, for one simple reason : the lack of a
decent script. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

house, everybody gathers around. He's old and moves slowly, but has
a winning personality that makes his friends want to cozy up to him
and shoot the breeze. He can be stoic and detached, but if you're
dancing, he likes to join the party. Since March, Jiggs has lived
among the elderly residents of the Alterra Sterling House, an
assisted living center in Denton. And since 1933, Jiggs _ a desert
tortoise _ been hanging out with Ken Connor. By JIM HENDERSON.

   VIOLENCE-BOOKS (Albany, N.Y.) _ They've become familiar targets.
After incidents like the school shooting in Littleton, Colo.,
fingers readily point to the usual suspects: Marilyn Manson,
ultraviolent films and fantasy games. But one English professor and
the author of a new book says the literature of Ernest Hemingway
and others may have an even greater influence than those of the
dark denizens of popular culture. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.

owners to stable hands as chaplain of the Sam Houston Race Track.

   WORK-VACATIONS (San Francisco) _ When it comes to taking days
off, Corporate America is the model of trickle down stupidity.
Companies have too much short-term greed to appreciate their
importance, making executives less likely to take time for
themselves. And if the boss doesn't get a perk, how many
rank-and-filers will? By DAVE MURPHY.

   DIVERSITY (San Francisco) _ You have a six-person staff: a white
man, age 60; a Hispanic woman, 50; an African American man, 45; a
white woman, 35; an Asian man, 30; and a white woman, 25. It's the
picture of diversity, but it might be deceiving. By DAVE MURPHY.

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-PREVIEWS-RACE (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Nothing has galvanized the
Television Critics Association summer press tour more than race.
Where in years past it was an issue that came up sporadically _
because it's a continual problem _ this year it has taken on more
heft because of the NAACP's threats to hold TV networks responsible
for accurate representation. You're not going to find a black actor
or producer who doesn't have a comment about the plight of
minorities in the TV business. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WRESTLING (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Here is a bizarre notion: Pro
wrestling may become a victim of its own popularity. For a moment,
put aside the inappropriateness of the new breed of rasslin' for
kids: There is way too much sexual innuendo and vulgarity, even
though that breed of entertainment (not sport, although they are
athletes) markets heavily toward children. By MARK MCGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Jerry Springer for Senate? Why
not? Think how C-SPAN's ratings would soar. Think how entertaining
impeachment trials could be, especially if senators could be given
lighter chairs, ones they could throw. Think how enlightened the
Senate could become on issues such as male lesbians, cross-
dressing nudists and bosses who cheat on their wives with young
employees while conducting foreign affairs on the phone. Oh, that's
right. We already did that show. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Piedmont, Calif.) _ When the NAACP speaks, the TV
networks listen. Or do they? Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, last
week criticized the four major TV networks for not having enough
African American lead characters in their shows. Faster than you
can say ``must-see TV,'' network bosses said, ``Yeah, that's
right,'' or words to that effect. By WILLIAM WONG.
</P>
<P>
   PILOTING-DANGERS (Columbia, Md.) _ The sky, like the sea, is a
terribly unforgiving place. The third dimension of flight and the
need to keep moving forward or fall make it a risky place for those
who do not know their limits. By GORDON LIVINGSTON.

   FIVE MEN TO WATCH IN MEXICO'S 2000 ELECTION

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY, MEXICO By the end of this year, Mexico's main
political parties will have chosen their candidates for president
in the general election of July 2000. The following men are said to
be top contenders for their parties' nominations:
</P>
<P>
   VICENTE FOX, governor of Guanajuato state: The brash and
independent Fox is the only member of Mexico's conservative
National Action Party, or PAN, to have declared his candidacy for
the nomination. Fox has developed a reputation as a harsh critic of
corruption and a politician who is less conservative than most
pro-free market PAN leaders. Polls show the popular Fox is the
PAN's best hope yet to defeat the ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, in the election.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCISCO LABASTIDA, former Secretary of the Interior: Widely
viewed as President Ernesto Zedillo's heir apparent, Labastida
resigned from Zedillo's cabinet to run for president just days
after the PRI announced it would hold its first primary. But polls
show Labastida tied with Roberto Madrazo, former governor of
Tabasco. Because Labastida is close to Zedillo, he can't criticize
current economic policies. And Sinaloa, the state he once governed,
is viewed as a haven for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTO MADRAZO, former governor of Tabasco state: Madrazo is a
PRI maverick who is willing to attack some of Zedillo's economic
policies. His stance gives him cachet with disaffected PRI
followers and the general electorate. Polls show he's viewed as an
effective governor partially because of an early round of
television ads promoting Tabasco's gains. However, Madrazo is
accused of benefiting from dirty campaign donations in 1994, a
charge that could hurt him in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   MANUEL BARTLETT, former governor of Puebla state: Polls show
Bartlett is generally viewed as crafty, capable and corrupt. He's a
longtime PRI leader who has served twice in previous presidential
cabinets, and he's critical of free-market policies that threaten
Mexican businesses. That position has earned him a following, but
allegations that he has fixed elections haunt Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS, mayor of Mexico City: Polls show Cardenas
has slipped dramatically behind Fox and top PRI candidates. But
Cardenas, a member of the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, or PRD, is still considered a threat. The son of one of
Mexico's most beloved presidents, Cardenas broke with the PRI and
ran against Carlos Salinas, its presidential candidate in 1988.
Many Mexicans believe Cardenas, whose party opposes some
free-market reforms, won but was denied the presidency because of
fraud. Cardenas says he'd consider a PRD-PAN alliance and a joint
primary to choose a presidential candidate.

A NEW MODEL FOR THE INTERNET: FEES FOR SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To their great shared financial benefit, Internet investors and
entrepreneurs and the market analysts who serve them have convinced
one another and most of the rest of the world that the only truly
Internet-centered business model is one in which online users pay
nothing for content.
</P>
<P>
   But the facade of this piece of Internet mythology is sprouting
cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising underwrites virtually all commercial Web sites and
serves as the multibillion-dollar foundation for the entire
Internet economy. But the number of people who click on banner
advertisements has dropped precipitously over the past year. And a
new genre of software has emerged to block ads entirely. Add to
this mix a growing consumer perception that ``you get what you pay
for,'' and the free-content argument looks increasingly threadbare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this medium is moving away from the ad-supported
model and toward the transaction model,'' says Mark Anderson, the
president and editor of the Strategic News Service Online
newsletter, which forecasts trends in technology and business.
``People are using the Internet for transactions _ all kinds of
transactions _ and things that are not transaction-related are not
very interesting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, for example, Sony Online Entertainment offered an
online role-playing game, Everquest (www.everquest.com), that
requires both a $25 CD-ROM and a $10-a-month subscription _ not
exactly an easy sell. But in a response that surprised even Sony,
after only four months more than 120,000 gamers are paying to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ramp-up rate has been enormous,'' says Steven Yee, the
vice president of marketing for Sony Online Entertainment. This
kind of success ``validates the subscription model for online
games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet watchers believe that stories like Everquest's
signal a fundamental shift away from what old-guard media
executives thought the Internet would be: an advertising-supported,
mass-market medium like their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactivity,'' such as it was, mostly involved surfing
aimlessly from site to site. But as people became familiar with the
Web, that became much less thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving away from the passive model,'' Anderson says.
``We're now saying, `I'll only take your media if it's connected to
a transaction that's meaningful to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   By now we all know what those meaningful transactions are:
finding a sex partner, trading stocks and buying or selling various
stuff, either through retail or auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all transactions,'' Anderson said, ``and that's why
we're moving from ad support to subscriptions for what I'm
personally interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Tom Baker, the general manager for The Wall
Street Journal Interactive Edition, agrees. The Interactive Journal
and Consumer Reports, each claiming about 300,000 subscribers,
paying $59 and $24 a year, respectively, are the largest pay sites
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free-content model is conventional wisdom, and it leads to
a failure of imagination,'' says Baker. ``Everyone has ceased even
trying to invent a service valuable enough to charge for. Even in
the pawed-over area of personal finance, when you think of the
services that haven't been done _ alerts and various other uses for
the data they have about you in a way that's not just annoying _
I'm amazed that people aren't pursuing more.''
</P>
<P>
   And why are they not? ``Because they would never be able to get
funding,'' says Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when a company has what appears to be a viable pay
service, potential investors often have an antibody reaction that
expels it from the system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a San Francisco-based company called Inquisit was
forced to shut down its service to a subscriber base that once
reached 5,000 with virtually no marketing. Inquisit indexed more
than 400 sources of content, from news services to local newspapers
around the world, and, for $12.95 a month, compared the index with
detailed personal profiles and delivered a personalized selection
of stories or headlines immediately to e-mail, pager or cell phone.
When the company shut its doors, many of the subscribers said they
would have paid several times the price for the service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Opfer, Inquisit's president, says the closest thing
available now is Yahoo Alerts, which searches far fewer sources and
delivers only to a user's Yahoo mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I told investors two things,'' Opfer said.
``One, e-mail's where it's at, not push technology. And two, they
could use our technology for other things _ to deliver changes in
airline schedules and good shopping deals, for example. They told
me that e-mail was passe and that e-commerce was at least a decade
away. And they passed and they passed and they passed. It's the
herd mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the industry's narrow view on payment for
Internet services, according to the Journal's Baker, probably has
as much to do with the supercharged atmosphere on Wall Street for
no-product, no-profit, Internet plays as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure they'll go public and figure it out later,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But it is really not so difficult to figure it out now.
</P>
<P>
   If advertising is the driving revenue generator for the Internet
economy, then most of the online market's ``revenue'' is derived
from companies' simple swapping of ad budgets back and forth in a
zero sum game.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if a company is spending more Internet funny
money than it can ever hope to regain in sales of goods or
services? What happens when the stock market regains its sanity and
insists on profits?
</P>
<P>
   The model will almost certainly collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when it happens,'' said Anderson, ``it will be like a
supernova _ it won't take these companies a year to go out of
business; it will take a month or a day.''

NEW SERVICE PROVIDES DATA ON INTERNET ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monitoring service is being introduced that promises
to provide information about advertising on Web sites in, well,
Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   The service, Leading Web Advertisers, is intended to deliver
reports to subscribers that its founders say will capture and
categorize ads on hundreds of sites, offering data on which
marketers are running ads, when and where those ads appeared and
what they looked like. The goal is to help bring accountability to
the new media as ad spending in cyberspace continues its rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this industry, where things change so quickly, the ability
to find out about ads that ran just yesterday is very powerful,''
said Lee Nadler, president, chief executive and lead sherpa _ yes,
that's his title _ at Digital Pulp Inc., a New York agency that
creates online and off-line marketing campaigns for companies like
Altavista, Doubleclick and 1800flowers.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service,'' Nadler said, ``is especially relevant for the
clients Digital Pulp handles _ dot-com companies that need
up-to-the-moment information to stay ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The principals of Leading Web Advertisers, which is being
demonstrated to Madison Avenue as beta testing proceeds, have
wide-ranging backgrounds in off-line media. One is Leon H. Liebman,
a venture capital investor who was the founder and chief executive
of Interactive Market Systems, a media and advertising data base
and software company that was sold in 1983 to VNU N.V. (VNU is the
parent of Competitive Media Reporting, the service that tracks ad
spending, which was known until 1992 as Leading National
Advertisers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is remarkable, the first truly global medium,'' said
Liebman, who is chairman of Leading Web Advertisers. ``When someone
said there ought to be an L.N.A. for the Web, that hit a button.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principal is Michael Kubin, managing director in New
York for Western Initiative Media, the media services unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real need to get at this information,'' said Kubin,
who is a director of Leading Web Advertisers, ``and the technology
has emerged to make it possible.'' The service has programmers in
London and New Jersey and a data administration team in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a matter of time before someone plowed through the
programming logistics so people could have access to these kinds of
numbers at their desktops,'' said Paul Ahern, president and
managing partner at DDB Digital in New York, the interactive unit
of DDB Worldwide Communications Group, owned by Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that Ahern said he particularly appreciated about
the service was the ability ``for us to go on line for clients like
Compaq or Amtrak or Mobil to see what competitors are doing,
whether image ads, retail ads or price ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can infer the marketing strategies of your competitors,''
he added. ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is now tracking ads on 390 Web sites using what
Liebman described as ``the Willie Sutton model'' after the famed
crook who said he robbed banks because that was where the money
was. The sites include ABC News, America Online, CBS, Cnet, CNNfn,
E! Online, Etoys, Forbes, iVillage, the Internet Movie Data Base,
Lycos, MSNBC, MTV Online, Motley Fool, Mr.cq Showbiz, Newsweek.com,
Playboy Online, Red Herring, Sidewalk.com, The Sporting News,
Switchboard, Ticketmaster, Travelocity and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to get that information now is to have a summer intern
or a college student go through a million sites,'' said Scott
Schiller, senior vice president for advertising and sponsorship
sales at Buena Vista Internet Group in New York, a unit of the Walt
Disney Company. ``L.W.A. provides a valuable service by delivering
it in more timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent demonstration, Liebman and Kubin showed Leading Web
Advertisers performing a variety of tasks. For instance, when asked
for information on ads that ran for the first time the day before
on the tracked sites, the service displayed a lengthy list that
included AT&AMP;T Worldnet, Amazon.com and 800.com _ and presented
miniature versions of each ad.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to sort those new ads by the sites on which they
appeared, the service displayed a list of new advertisers on
Altavista that included Buy.com, Corbis, Furniture.com and Muzic
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information is likely to mean more revenue for
Web publishers,'' Schiller said. ``As a manager of a sales force,
if you see that Procter &AMP; Gamble just broke a campaign on this
site, you can make a call to ask for that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman and Kubin said that the service would charge annual fees
that would range from $10,000 for small subscribers to ``six
figures'' for large ones. Among potential subscribers are agency
media departments, media buying services, companies that sell ad
space on the Internet and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler at Digital Pulp said he was ``a fan who is looking into
subscribing.'' Ahern at DDB Digital said he was ``definitely an
interested possible subscriber.'' And Schiller at Buena Vista
Interactive, soon to become part of the Go.com company combining
Disney's Internet holdings, said he was ``likely to sign.''

MINING THE VALUE IN A CARLOAD OF AVERTED EYES  
 FORMER BROWSER FOES UNITE IN START-UP  
 GE APPLIES ITS TALENTS TO INTERNET HOUSEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The elevator ride has always presented a social dilemma: people
captive in a tiny room, awkwardly silent and unwilling to make eye
contact. The piped-in Muzak version of the Beatles' ``Penny Lane''
does nothing to ease the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to profit from such quiet desperation, a small start-up
company in Westford, Mass., has begun to install flat-panel
displays in elevators around the United States. The screens are
network terminals that can pull current information like weather,
traffic, sports and stock updates off the Internet and give
elevator passengers a nonthreatening place to focus their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Captivate Network Inc., was founded in 1997 after
its chief executive, Michael DiFranza, noticed how fidgety people
became during a long elevator ride. It occurred to him that
advertisers love captive audiences _ even audiences detained for
just 25 to 35 seconds _ the average length of a high-rise elevator
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Captivate Network has already signed agreements with Reuters
Group PLC, Accuweather, BostonHerald.com, Sidewalk.com and
Smartraveler to provide the information, which will be updated
every 20 minutes. The bottom of each screen will be sold to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The displays have already been installed in a test run at the
Seaport Hotel in Boston and several other Boston skyscrapers. This
summer, displays are to be installed in New York in the Worldwide
Plaza building and the Park Avenue Tower. They will also go into a
half-dozen skyscrapers in Chicago.

   Former Browser Foes Unite in Tellme Networks Start-Up
</P>
<P>
   The post-browser-war armistice continues at Tellme Networks
Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up that would already be rich if buzz
were money. Brad Silverberg, a former senior vice president at
Microsoft Corp., who remains a Microsoft consultant, is becoming an
investor and board member of Tellme.
</P>
<P>
   James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape Corp.,
is also investing, Tellme plans to announce Monday. And Peter
Currie, the former chief financial officer of Netscape, is joining
the board.
</P>
<P>
   They are the main new investors in a $6 million seed round of
financing for Tellme, founded in February by a team of young
refugees from the Internet browser war between Microsoft and
Netscape. And James Clark, Netscape's co-founder, signed up as a
Tellme backer a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tellme has been secretive about its technology, except to say
that it will be a service that marries the telephone and the
Internet. The speculation is that it will employ some combination
of natural-language and Internet programming to give users a way to
retrieve information from the World Wide Web with a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Silverberg said he was backing Tellme because of his belief that
the start-up's team has ``what it takes to steadily execute and
deliver on a new service which will be used by millions of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellme plans to roll out its Web-phone service during the first
half of next year.

   GE Applies Its Talents to Internet Housekeeping
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co.'s 3-year-old Web page has just had a face
lift to prepare for total reconstructive surgery in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact, starting Tuesday, will be fewer clicks to
get from www.GE.com to, say, a list of stores that sell GE
appliances. But wait a few months, the company promises, and you
will be able to just type in ``I am a homeowner who needs a
refrigerator,'' and the software will take it from there.
</P>
<P>
   The first changes, though, are primarily cosmetic. Many of the
links that now clutter the home page _ ``Frequently Asked
Questions'' and ``GE Careers,'' for example _ will move to the
navigation bar. The page itself, now equally divided into consumer,
business and corporate sections, will include only consumer
information, with buttons to guide business customers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Links to GE divisions like appliances will be replaced with
links to topics like money management (a GE Capital skill) and
women's health (GE Medical is a leading supplier of mammography
systems).
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get customers to solutions in the fewest numbers of
clicks,'' said Susan Moyer, a GE executive who oversees Internet
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The changes planned for fall are a lot more radical. Logging on
then, and identifying oneself by category _ say, homeowner,
plastics molder or aerospace executive _ will thereafter elicit a
home page tailored to the individual's interest. And asking a
question in everyday language about, say, getting a mortgage may
lead to follow-up queries about how one plans to set up the kitchen
in the new house.

<P>
   BOSTON _ To meet Boston's technology elite, first finagle an
invitation to one of Robert Metcalfe's parties. His salons, as
Metcalfe _ co-inventor of the computer technology named Ethernet _
calls them, are high-technology schmooze sessions, with perhaps a
string of investors chatting up a chief executive in the hallway or
two entrepreneurs courting a partnership at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But who invited the journalists? On a given night at Metcalfe's
Back Bay home, it is not surprising to find a representative from
the publications of International Data Group in one corner, an
editor of Fast Company in another and staff members from MIT's
Technology Review mingling among the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is full of editors these days, now that the city has
become something of a center for publications about technology and
business.
</P>
<P>
   There are the old-timers like IDG, which started Computer World
magazine here 35 years ago and now produces more than 300
publications, and Inc. magazine, which has called Boston home for
two decades and recently added another publication: Inc.
Technology. Sprinkled around the city are Fast Company, Technology
Review, Harvard Business Review, PC Week, Electronic Business,
Software Magazine and Web Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Why Boston? Some point to the city's rich publishing history and
the historical importance of the loop of high-technology companies
on Route 128, which rings the city. But the real reason can be
summed up in two names: Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why IDG began in Boston, its chief executive, Kelly
Conlin, said, ``The founder went to MIT, and so that was where he
was.'' Conlin himself came to Boston via the Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   The two universities do supply a pool of talent, says Alan
Webber, a founding editor of the 3-year-old Fast Company, a
business magazine aimed at young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the same phenomenon as 128 in its heyday, only
applied to information and writing,'' Webber said. ``We've got a
lot of smart people, well-educated people, a lot of people who take
business ideas very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Massachusetts does have its fill of biotechnology
companies, software start-ups and teaching hospitals, which lends
some weight when publishers here say they have a broader economic
base to work with than Wired, Red Herring and their other
chip-focused counterparts out West.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just superciliousness from a coast that lost the battle
for computer supremacy? The Boston magazines cover the goings-on
out West as well, but being away from the ``froth'' of
personalities and issues in Silicon Valley has its advantages,
Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a little bit of distance from the personalities,
the issues, the ideas, so we're able to write to an international
business audience without coming directly from Silicon Valley, as
if we were only interested in the goings-on in Silicon Valley,'' he
said. ``You get a little bit better line of sight into the business
and technology if you're not in the belly of the beast.''

<P>
   One magazine that is reveling in the local mix of academia and
industry is MIT's Technology Review. A 100-year-old magazine, it
metamorphosed last year when Bruce Journey, the new publisher, had
the idea of replacing the editor, laying off all but a few members
of the old staff and changing the focus from sometimes Luddite
reviews to more upbeat coverage of innovation in technology,
science and business.
</P>
<P>
   After doing everything short of taking a wrecking ball to the
publication, Journey, a former Fortune executive, then boasted that
he could double the number of readers and triple the ad base.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, it worked. With the dust still settling from the
demolition, the renewed Technology Review is posting a number
better than its own prediction: Circulation has jumped to 205,000
from 92,000.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is gambling in its attempt to mix science and the
marketplace, two sectors that traditionally keep each other at
arm's length. But the economy is good, the ad team aggressive, and
the staff confident that Technology Review will survive, even after
the $2.5 million the MIT alumni association pumped into its renewal
is used up.
</P>
<P>
   In a city the size of Boston, there is bound to be some
publishing incest. Both Webber and William Taylor were editors at
Harvard Business Review before leaving to found Fast Company.
Metcalfe is a pundit for IDG as well as a board member for
Technology Review. With all the sharing of leadership, the big
question is whether there is enough readership to go around.
Metcalfe is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when technology is being both celebrated and
analyzed,'' he said. ``What a great time.''

<P>
   When David Andre noticed that the Windows NT operating system
would not allow him to set the date on the clock of his Toshiba
510CDT laptop past 2079, he performed a dangerous experiment: He
set the time to 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2079, and let the clock roll
over to 2080.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake,'' Andre, a graduate student in computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley, said last
week. ``I'm stuck with my laptop in complete failure mode because I
can't get Windows NT to boot. I have to reinstall NT and all of my
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Two nuggets of wisdom can be gleaned from Andre's experience:
certainly, that one should exercise caution when toying with the
date settings on computers, but more important, that the
much-vaunted millennium, or Y2K, problem is just the first of what
will prove to be a nasty legacy of time bombs in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even scarier, while the time of detonation is known for some of
these bombs, others are deeply imbedded in programs and even
operating systems where they may give no advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are beginning to voice concern that date-related
computer problems are more pervasive than anyone had realized and
will continue to plague generations of users well past Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's been programming, there have been
date-related issues,'' said Uche Ogbuji, a consultant and
co-founder of Fourthought LLC. ``Y2K has gotten the most attention,
but the rest are not going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the Year 2000 issue, most date-related problems result
from using a limited number of digits to represent the time and
date on a computer. Eventually, the limit is reached, forcing the
date to wrap around to zero, which, in effect, makes computer
programs suddenly jump backward in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parts of operating systems and programs depend on time
advancing forward,'' said John Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer
science at Berkeley. ``These bugs cause time to go backward, which
really screws things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of these problems, named Y2038, affects machines
that run the Unix operating system _ which includes most of the
powerful computers that sort and route packets of data through the
Internet. Unix stores time as the number of seconds elapsed since
Jan. 1, 1970, the beginning of the decade in which it was invented
at Bell Labs. Unfortunately, some Unix-based computers will run out
of space to store these seconds at 3:14:07 a.m. on Jan. 19, 2038.
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone fret about a problem more than 38 years hence?
</P>
<P>
   First, because seemingly distant dates can have a very near-term
impact. Payments on a 30-year mortgage issued in 2009, for example,
must be calculated beyond the rollover date for Unix machines.
</P>
<P>
   And second, software tends to be stubbornly persistent.
Programmers assumed back in 1970 that by the millennium, the code
they were writing would have been long replaced. But it turns out
that while hardware gets updated regularly, old software often
becomes the foundation on which new programs are built. The Year
2000 problem is with us because layers of software have been laid
down by thousands of programmers over the last 40 years, and the
top layers are almost invariably vulnerable to the vagaries of the
bottom layers _ in this case to a hardware limit that disappeared
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Date problems with Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems and
application programs may prove to be more serious than those of
Unix, some experts say. That is because unlike Unix programs, which
all represent time in the same way, Microsoft's programs have been
cobbled together over decades from many sources, and time
representations vary widely. As a result, the Web sites Microsoft
has built to help customers deal with clock-related problems show
program expiration dates ranging from 1999 to ``future centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Kubiatowicz said of
Microsoft's expiration dates. ``Almost every year is a panic year
because something else will expire.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nor does Microsoft itself appear to be sure what to expect _ or
when to expect it. For example, one of its Web sites originally
listed a 2099 limit for Windows NT _ 20 years beyond the date that
wiped out Andre's machine.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about many of the product date limits posted on
Microsoft Web sites _ including a 2099 limit for Windows NT _ Don
Jones, who heads the company's Year 2000 compliance effort, said
the warnings were ``out of date'' and would be removed. And indeed,
several Web sites mentioning date limits disappeared or changed
within 24 hours of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what the correct date limits were for Microsoft's
popular Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems,
Jones said, ``To my knowledge, they will work indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not explain Andre's problem. And while it is
true that software embedded in the computer's basic input-output
system, or BIOS, could also be the cause of such a failure, Toshiba
says its laptop runs to 2099 with other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did confirm, however, that the Microsoft programming
language Visual C++ measures time as seconds elapsed since Jan. 1,
1900, and will roll over to zero in 2036. Because Visual C++ is
among the most popular languages in use today, many applications
being written throughout the industry today could fail in that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone uses Microsoft programming tools,'' Andre
said. ``While we have 36 years to fix it, it may take us 34 years
to make it a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some date-related glitches are just careless programming. For
example, leap years occur every fourth year that is not a multiple
of 100 _ unless it is a multiple of 400. Thus, while 1900 was not a
leap year, 2000 is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many programmers forget this,'' Fourthought's Ogbuji said. ``I
myself have made that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Software with this error may ``forget'' that Feb. 29, 2000,
exists, causing enormous potential headaches with, for example,
financial software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Excel 97 has the opposite problem: It recognizes 2000
as a leap year, but incorrectly thinks that 1900 was one as well,
causing problems with historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's persistent date errors are more laughable
than serious. Through the last three versions of its Outlook
program, Microsoft has calculated the wrong day for Thanksgiving _
and each year a different wrong day. This year the holiday, which
always falls on the fourth Thursday of November, will be celebrated
at Microsoft on Tuesday, Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems are more serious. Kubiatowicz predicts that
software problems dealing with past dates will eventually become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are still relatively young,'' he said. ``But at some
point they'll be old enough that there will be 100-year-old files
that people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry is already addressing some long-term
issues. The newest generation of Unix machines, for example, will
not run out of clock space for at least another 200 billion years _
long after the sun has swallowed up the earth.

<P>
   It was a chance meeting between a self-described ``physicist
gone bad'' and a chemist. And it may someday lead to the creation
of a new breed of computers based on tiny electronic switches, each
no thicker than a single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Phil Kuekes, a Hewlett Packard physicist with
three decades of experience designing computers, was pondering new
ways to use a computer he had developed using massively parallel
architecture _ technology that attacks computing problems by
breaking them into hundreds or even thousands of pieces to be
simultaneously processed by many individual chips.
</P>
<P>
   At about this same time, Kuekes (pronounced KEE-kus) happened to
make the acquaintance of James Heath, a chemist at the University
of California at Los Angeles whose lab had been experimenting with
tiny structures based on molecules of a synthetic substance called
rotazane. It seemed that these molecular structures might be able
to function as digital switches _ the basic, binary on-off
information gateways of modern computing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the two scientists were brainstorming about how it might be
possible to blend Kuekes' computer design with Heath's Lilliputian
switches. In the fashioning of tiny switches, or transistors, from
small clusters of molecules a single layer deep, the researchers
see a coming era of computers that would be 100 billion times as
fast as today's fastest PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The work, detailed in a paper published Friday by the
Hewlett-UCLA teams in Science magazine, is a noteworthy example of
the groundbreaking research that suddenly seems to be flourishing
at computer laboratories around the country _ a flowering of ideas
that some leaders in the field have begun to consider a renaissance
in computer science and design.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate and academic labs, researchers appear to be at or
near breakthroughs that could vastly raise the power and ubiquity
of the machines that have insinuated themselves into almost every
facet of modern society. And since many of these efforts, like the
Hewlett-UCLA research, are focused at the microscopic level,
computing could become an increasingly invisible part of everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of exciting stuff is happening outside the mainstream PC
market,'' Marc Snir, a senior research manager at IBM Corp., said.
``We are entering a world where there will be billions of small
devices spread everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-UCLA team is just one of six groups around the
country working under an ambitious program of the federal Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency that is trying to create a new
kind of molecular-scale electronics _ known as moletronics _ that
researchers hope will one day surpass the power and capacity of the
silicon-based technology used in today's computers. Last year
researchers at Yale and Rice universities took earlier steps toward
the same goal of assembling computers from molecular components.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, separate from the military research program,
researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Laboratory of Computer Science are trying to meld the digital with
the biological by ``hacking'' the common E. coli bacterium so that
it would be able to function as an electronic circuit _ though one
with the marvelous ability to reproduce itself.
</P>
<P>
   It may all sound esoteric. And even the most enthusiastic
researchers concede that practical applications of their theories
and methods may be a decade or more away. But researchers seem
intent on renewing the emphasis on the science in computer science,
venturing beyond electrical engineering and physics to draw upon
diverse disciplines like biochemistry as they form their hypotheses
and test them with empirical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's computer scientists, for example, are pursuing the idea of
building _ or possibly growing, if the E. coli experiments pan out
_ vast numbers of almost identical processors that might act as
sensors or even as the task-performing devices called actuators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be able to make processors by the
wheelbarrow-load,'' said Harold Abelson, an MIT computer scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Abelson and his colleagues, who call their approach amorphous
computing, are experimenting with the idea of mapping circuitry
onto biological material. That might let living cells function, for
example, as digital logic circuits. Such circuits are information
pathways that, whatever their complexity, ultimately involve a
multitude of quite simple, binary choices: 0 or 1, on or off, this
but not that.
</P>
<P>
   Biological cells, of course, would be able to compute only as
long as they remained alive. But the premise is the same as in the
molecular-scale work: Pack as many millions or billions of these
tiny decision switches as possible into the smallest spaces
conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``smart'' materials might be used for new types of
paints or gels, for example, that would enable a highway to be
``painted'' with computerlike sensors to issue traffic reports, or
let floors be given a surface of infinitesimal actuators that could
detect dirt and dust and silently and instantly whisk it away.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Hewlett-UCLA work, researchers have
successfully created digital logic circuits, but not yet any in
which the molecular switches can be restored to their original
state _ returning to the off position, for example, after having
switched to on. And still to be developed are the molecular-scale
wires that would be needed to interconnect the switches.
</P>
<P>
   The really significant implication of the Science article is
that for the first time researchers have built molecular-scale
computing components using chemistry rather than the time-honored
technology of photolithography, the ultraviolet-light etching of
circuitry onto silicon that is the process for making today's
chips. The chip industry has not yet reached the theoretical limits
of photolithography, but the day may come when it is no longer
possible to etch circuits any closer together. That is where
molecular chemistry could take over _ and possibly wring more
computing power from a single chip than exists today in the
biggest, fastest supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kuekes said his team had been in contact with the MIT
group and was now discussing the possibility of combining the
Hewlett-UCLA molecular switching technology with the MIT lab's
biological processor work with an eye toward future computer
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of us as the Sherwin-Williams of the Information Age,''
Kuekes said, referring to the vision of suspending billions of tiny
processors in a paint. ``This is the raw material for
super-intelligent materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledge that their projects are gambles and
that any practical applications may be a decade or more away. But
the work on both coasts indicates the breadth of the renaissance
now sweeping through computer-design circles.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the most recent work is a continuation of
efforts that began about five years ago and quickly grew into the
commercial field of microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS chips.
MEMS are microscopic mechanical structures etched into the surface
of silicon chips; they have spawned a multibillion-dollar business,
largely around the chips in silicon accelerometers that are now
standard equipment as sensors for air-bag collision systems in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Hewlett-UCLA and MIT research makes clear, even the
conventional circuitry of a silicon chip _ or the silicon, for that
matter _ can no longer be assumed. Indeed, computer architects are
rethinking the whole concept of the microprocessor, the master chip
that begat the PC and that has been the building block of modern
computers for a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to do something different. It's time to look at the
things we've ignored,'' said David Patterson, a computer scientist
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Patterson helped pioneer one of the most
significant computer design innovations of its era, a technology
known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC.
</P>
<P>
   Building on ideas first advanced during the 1970s by a team of
researchers working under the computer scientist John Cocke at
IBM's Thomas J. Watson Laboratory, Patterson and his Berkeley
graduate students proved that sharp increases in the speed of
processor chips could be achieved by simplifying computer hardware
and shifting many functions to software.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade after the success of the Berkeley RISC
project, many experts in the computer industry believed that RISC
would ultimately displace Intel Corp.'s X86 computer chip design,
on which the industry-standard PC was based.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to unseat Intel, dozens of new RISC-inspired companies
sprang up from the mid-'80s through the mid-'90s. But beginning
with its 486 chip, introduced in 1989, and continuing in its
Pentium series, Intel was already incorporating the best RISC ideas
into its chips, keeping their performance close enough to RISC's
potential to let the company retain its commanding market lead.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Intel's hardware and Microsoft's software
proved invincible, and one by one the RISC challengers collapsed.
The end of the RISC era almost a decade ago left computer designers
with few fundamentally new ideas for improving computer
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Intel juggernaut moved on, the rising importance
of the Internet and a growing consensus that computing's future
lies in inexpensive consumer-oriented devices helped fuel the
renaissance in chip design.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, the RISC pioneer, has now embarked on a new design
approach, known as intelligent RAM, or IRAM, that has generated
great interest among consumer electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
   RAM stands for random access memory, the semiconductor memory
that is used as a kind of temporary scratch pad by software
programs. Patterson and his Berkeley colleagues have noted that the
largest performance constraint in computer systems today is the
mismatch in speed between the microprocessor and the slower memory
chips. The Berkeley researchers predict that in the next decade
processors and memory will be merged onto a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   The IRAM chips would embed computer processors in vast seas of
memory transistors. Instead of stressing pure processor speed,
these new chips would place the emphasis on avoiding bottlenecks
that slow the data traffic inside a processor. Such an approach
would be especially attractive to makers of memory chips _
companies eager to find new ways to distinguish themselves in what
is now a commodity market.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some consumer electronics companies are
pursuing ideas similar to those behind the IRAM project. For
example, Sony Corp.'s Emotion Engine chip, which the company is
designing in cooperation with Toshiba Corp. for the coming Sony
Playstation II game console, blends memory and processor logic as a
way to create faster, more vivid on-screen game action.
</P>
<P>
   But no single computer architecture is optimal for every kind of
problem. That is why many researchers are exploring the idea of
reconfigurable chips _ chips whose circuitry can be reorganized for
each specific computing problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most extreme efforts in this direction is a processor
approach known as RAW, for raw-architecture work station, that is
being pursued by a group of researchers at MIT's Laboratory of
Computer Science, working separately from the E. coli project.
</P>
<P>
   RAW pushes the idea of RISC to a new extreme. The processor
would not have an ``instruction set'' in the conventional sense of
the term, which refers to the types of instructions that let
software programmers direct a chip to do things like add or
subtract, or compare and move blocks of data. Instead of using
preordained instruction sets, RAW would present the entire chip to
the programmer as a veritable blank slate on which tens of millions
of transistors might be individually programmed.
</P>
<P>
   Such unprecedented flexibility would mean that the same basic
chip might be used for an infinite variety of purposes _ like
creating three-dimensional animated graphics, performing
supercomputer calculations or carrying out tasks not yet conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine whether this is simply a challenge
for programmers or a complicated nightmare,'' said Anant Agarwal,
the MIT computer designer who heads the RAW project.
</P>
<P>
   As all these research efforts proceed, computer scientists are
toiling against the perceived limits of Moore's Law _ a guiding
principle for chip design since the Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore,
observed in 1964 that the number of transistors that could fit onto
a silicon chip doubles approximately every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, there are physical limits to how closely
together circuits can be etched with light onto the surface of a
silicon chip and still function _a reality that is expected to mean
the end of the Moore's Law paradigm sometime around the year 2012.
That is why forward-looking work like the molecular-scale circuitry
research of the Hewlett-UCLA team is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly a technology this radically different won't tip over a
trillion-dollar industry'' like today's computer-chip industry,
Kuekes said. ``But we're looking considerably ahead of where
silicon runs out of steam.''

   PHOENIX - It's easy to lose perspective. &QL; 
That fact was underscored for me recently when the U.S. Commerce
Department released its third technology access survey, ``Falling
through the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows how many of us have _ and don't have _ home
computers and Internet access. In case you missed it, you can read
the entire 125-page work at www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/ &QL; 
digitaldivide.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   - About 40 percent of American households have computers.
</P>
<P>
   - About 25 percent of those households with computers have
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   - About 47 percent of Whites own computers, but minority
ownership is much lower. For example, just 25 percent of Hispanics
own computers.
</P>
<P>
   So, no matter how many people (including me) write or talk about
how computers are everywhere these days, the fact remains that the
vast majority of people still do not own computers _ at least not
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling was the fact that just 25 percent of those who
have computers at home also have access to the Internet, to the Web
and to all the information and resources the online world offers.
</P>
<P>
   That's amazing. Here we are, looking at a growing e-commerce
market that some predict will hit $1 trillion within the next three
years. Can you imagine what would be possible if everybody were
online?
</P>
<P>
   I thought about all this recently, as I drove my family through
the sand dunes and bleak desert that borders Interstate 8 from Yuma
and El Centro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   We had just spent a week in San Diego, a vacation we'd
researched and planned using the Web. Travel sites, for example,
helped us find a nice hotel with reasonable rates. I think we even
checked the weather forecast before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   We've come to consider checking the Web as just another thing to
do in preparation for a trip. It's as natural as packing a
suitcase. After reading about the Commerce Department study,
though, it's clear that what many of us take for granted is still
very much out of reach for most Americans. And that's not good.
</P>
<P>
   Experts constantly tout the need for children to learn computer
technology in order to succeed. An increasing number of people are
finding new jobs by posting resumes and conducting job hunts
online. The ability to communicate on an equal basis with anyone
via electronic messages is empowering.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we fix the fact that 60 percent of Americans don't
have computers at home, and even more lack online access? How do we
get a computer in every kitchen? How do we get everybody online? Do
we need a device not yet invented to replace our complicated
computers? Should we even try to fix the problem?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't come up with any easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of computers, they remain expensive and
complicated. And even if you gave everybody in America a free
machine, how would you maintain them? How would you train users?
Would you provide upgrades every two years?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I find it hard to believe that we'll ever reach the
point where home computers are as ubiquitous as home telephones,
the latter of which can be found in about 94 percent of American
households.
</P>
<P>
   Although computers are an invaluable resource, allowing the
in-home use of educational software and individual research, I
think the access to the Internet and its sea of information is more
important.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, my solution would involve the invention of a small
device, perhaps 12-inches square and an inch or two deep, that
could be connected to the telephone line and would allow basic Web
access in any language via a touch-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The device should be available for free or no more than, say,
$30. It should work in concert with your phone, allowing
simultaneous Web surfing and voice calls. Finally, the Web access
should be free, assuming you're already paying for basic phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Am I dreaming? Let me know what you think. Send me your thoughts
on this, and I'll publish the best ideas in a few weeks. I can be
reached via e-mail at dhoye(at)home.net or by regular mail at David
Hoye, c/o Arizona Central, 200 E. Van Buren St., Phoenix, AZ
85004. &QL; 
`Free' computer update &QL; 
Last week, I wrote about a new $400 rebate deal between America
Online (www.aol.com) and upstart computer maker eMachines
(www.e4me.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a $399 computer from eMachines and sign up for three
years of online service with CompuServe 2000, which is owned by
AOL, you get a $400 rebate, essentially wiping out the cost of the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, everybody's getting in on the same game.
</P>
<P>
   OfficeMax, for example, is promoting the same $400 rebate to
those who buy computers and sign up with CompuServe 2000. But
OfficeMax allows buyers to purchase any of several brands of
computers, not just eMachines.
</P>
<P>
   I also received e-mail from Len Gutman, public relations manager
at Insight in Tempe. He pointed out that Insight was about to
one-up everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting Monday,'' he wrote, ``you can get an eMachine etower
333cs at Insight for $474 (and) get a $75 rebate. Then, if you sign
up with CompuServe for three years, eMachines will give you a $400
rebate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total that up,'' Gutman concluded, ``and you actually make a
buck!''
</P>
<P>
   And here's another twist on the ``free PC'' theme: Micron
(www.micron.com) is offering a free Celeron-based PC to anyone who
signs up for a three-year Micron service package, which includes a
warranty, training and Internet access. Cost of the package:
$1,087.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? There are other ``free PC'' deals out there. Some
might make sense for you while others might actually be a bad idea.
Make sure you read and understand all the fine print before
deciding one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, it looks as though we're headed for the day when
computers are handed out for virtually nothing just so you'll have
the tools you need to go online and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, what crazy times we live in. &QL; 
A dose of humor for you &QL; 
The e-mail always brings something to laugh about, and this week
was no different.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Milton S. sent along a humorous tale about a
French language class that was discussing how nouns in French are
designated either masculine or feminine.
</P>
<P>
   One student raised his hand and asked, ``What gender is a
computer?''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a condensed version of the answer provided in
Milton's e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   The teacher divided the class into two groups _ one all male,
one all female _ and asked them to decide whether a computer should
be masculine or feminine.
</P>
<P>
   The group of women concluded that computers should be masculine
because:
</P>
<P>
   1. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.
</P>
<P>
   2. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half
the time they ARE the problem.
</P>
<P>
   3. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had
waited a little longer you could have had a better model.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the group of men decided that computers should be
feminine because:
</P>
<P>
   1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.
</P>
<P>
   2. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory
for later retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   3. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself
spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the laughs, Milton!

LESS THAN $1,000 BUT MORE THAN ZEROS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The low-priced desktop is now the best-selling consumer PC
category _ and fiercely competitive. What was once considered a
technology graveyard where older components went to die has now
become the liveliest spot in the market.
</P>
<P>
   But some manufacturers do cheap PCs better than others. Let's
face it, when you are selling a system for $500, $600, $700,
corners will be cut. How a computer maker cuts those corners makes
all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two systems with different approaches to
getting the price under $1,000:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5304, $599, Compaq Computer Corp.: At first glance,
this is one of the best bargains among cheap PCs. The
specifications look great for the price, and Compaq is pushing this
with a 17-inch monitor _ the MV720 _ that sells for just $400.
Combined, you get a powerful system and a large display for just
under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure and read the fine print on this one.
</P>
<P>
   The 5304 comes with a Cyrix MII processor that's rated at 366
megahertz, 64 megabytes of random access memory, a 4.3-gigabyte
hard drive, a 32X CD-ROM drive, a four-megabyte graphics adapter,
56K fax modem and Compaq's versatile Internet keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But the kicker here is the processor, memory and video adapter.
The MII is usually found on computers in which the video card uses
system memory as its own memory. So, while the 5304 has 64
megabytes of RAM, four MB are in use by the video card, leaving 60
MB for operating system and applications.
</P>
<P>
   To Compaq's credit, it has at least stocked this PC with 64 MB
of RAM. Many companies that use the MII chip are putting only 32 MB
in their lower-end machines, then using 2 MB for video memory.
Running Windows 98 with just 30 MB can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   The 5304 performs quite nicely with everyday programs _ word
processors, e-mail, Web browsers. But some graphics-intensive
programs can cause it to bog down. For example, I tried out
Mindscape's Organic Art Deluxe, a 3-D art and screen saver program
that makes heavy use of Direct3D, Microsoft's 3-D graphics scheme.
The images moved slowly and at times even haltingly.
</P>
<P>
   It also did not handle games well. In fact, if you want to run
any state-of-the-art 3-D titles, such as Unreal, Half-Life, Need
for Speed III or the upcoming Quake III Arena, I'd highly recommend
you supplement this PC with a Voodoo2-based 3-D add-on card, such
as Diamond Multimedia's Monster II.
</P>
<P>
   The system is quite expandable for a low cost, with a free PCI
slot, one combo PCI/ISA slot, and an ISA slot.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has made its Internet keyboard friendlier. Previous
versions were hard to reprogram, making it difficult to get away
from the company's default Web sites and applications.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Compaq also offers several deals for getting on the
Net. There are special offers from America Online and the company's
new Compaq.net service, and even a free online service called
NetZero. The latter requires that you turn over personal
information about yourself, then agree to have a set of ad banners
on your screen whenever you go online. Obviously, there's no free
surf.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select 400, $999, Gateway: Between the time I received this
low-end system from Gateway and the publication of this review, the
direct-sales PC maker has changed the configuration of this system.
Frankly, the model I tried has better specs than what the Gateway
is offering now at $999.
</P>
<P>
   The system I tried has a 400-Mhz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2
chip, 64 MB of memory, a 4.3-GB hard drive, a 40X CD-ROM drive, an
eight-MB ATI Rage Pro video card, a 56K fax modem and a 15-inch
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Since it arrived, Gateway has reduced the amount of memory to 32
MB and increased the hard drive size to 6.8 GB. Given the choice,
I'd rather have more memory. And fortunately, since you can
configure a Gateway any way you want it, you do have a choice, but
the model I actually used will now cost you $1,048. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   This is one zippy computer _ at least with 64 MB. The eight MB
graphics card also helps. It easily handled the Organic Art
program, Need for Speed III and other titles that use Direct3D.
However, the ATI Rage Pro is not great when it comes to games that
use SGI's OpenGL 3-D graphics system, such as most of the
Quake-based games.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Compaq, the Select 400 comes with a keyboard that also
has buttons, though they are more geared toward launching
applications than Web pages. One button _ dubbed The Help Spot _
brings up a friendly tutorial on using the PC and fixing common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway has only two open PCI slots and no ISA slots. If
you've got an older card you want to drop in here, forget it. This
is also a glimpse of the future _ starting next year, nearly every
PC sold will have only PCI and AGP (for graphics) slots. Time and
technology marches on.

IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING A NEW PC, HERE ARE SILVERMAN'S MINIMUM
SPECS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have been wanting to buy a new PC, but I was waiting for
your semiannual recommendation on minimum specs in your column.
When do you plan to run it?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've changed how we run the minimum specifications
recommendation. Previously, it ran twice a year in my column,
usually at midsummer and again at the start of the Christmas
PC-buying season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the minimum specs piece ran as a feature story in
late November (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/11/27/main.html), and
that's how we'll handle it for the foreseeable future. But it makes
sense to offer a mid-year ``refresher.''
</P>
<P>
   The declining cost of computers makes buying a ``minimum''
machine almost painless. The cost of PCs has dropped so
dramatically that a system that sold for $2,000 last Christmas now
sells for less than half that. And it's still an incredibly
powerful machine.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the minimum specs I'd recommend if you were buying
today:
</P>
<P>
   _ Processor: You'll want at least a 366-megahertz chip, though
400 megahertz is better, and the difference in cost is often
negligible. Avoid chips, such as some Cyrix MII processors, that
require that video memory be ``borrowed'' from the main system
memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory: At least 64 megabytes of RAM. If you buy a budget
system that has only 32 megabytes, it's fairly affordable to bump
it up another 32, usually for well under $100.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard drive: Four gigabytes remains a minimum, but like memory,
drive prices are way down. And, unfortunately, the size of the
average program is way, way up. A six-gigabyte drive is preferable.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD or DVD: The minimum PC can still get by with a CD-ROM
drive, with a speed of at least 24X, or 24 times the speed of the
original CD-ROM drive. DVD-based software remains a rarity, but
getting at least a 2X DVD-ROM drive would better prepare your
system for the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video: If your needs are modest _ Web surfing, word
processing, home finance, working at home _ then a four-megabyte
video card is just fine. If, however, you play games at all, or are
interested in working with graphics, you'll want a card with at
least eight or 16 megabytes of video memory. And again, avoid those
video adapters that use system memory as video memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sound: Nearly every PC comes with at least 16-bit stereo audio
that's more than adequate for most needs. However, if you are
interested in better sound for games and multimedia, consider a
card that can do 3-D or positional audio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modems: All PCs now come with 56K modems. If possible, avoid
``winmodems,'' which can only work with Windows applications and
use commands stored on the hard disk _ rather than in a chip on the
modem itself. I've found they are not as reliable, though the
latest crop of winmodems seem to be a vast improvement. That's
good, because many PC makers now offer only winmodems in their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitor: You'll want at least a 15-inch monitor with a maximum
.28 dot pitch. Seventeen-inch monitors are now as inexpensive as
15-inch models were a year ago, and you'll appreciate the extra
real estate if you work with multiple applications at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expandability: Gone are the days when bottom-of-the-line PCs
had sealed cases and you could not add new cards or capabilities.
You'll want at least two free PCI slots inside the computer and at
least one free drive bay. Some systems are now coming without an
older, ISA slot. If you have a device that uses an ISA card, you'll
want to be sure to ask about this before buying a new PC. Starting
next year, ISA slots will completely disappear.

Having your computer fixed can be a nightmarish experience 
By James Cummings  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In January, a local consultant's personal
computer crashed, and he took it to the repair counter at an
electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   After 64 days and a dozen conflicting excuses, Ted Fowler, the
consultant, finally got his computer back and it still didn't work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fowler's experience was extreme, he, unfortunately, is
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are complex machines, and most home users have only a
foggy idea of their internal workings.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: Computers can develop glitches faster than
adolescents develop zits.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a home computer user, chances are good your machine
is going to need to be repaired at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of woe
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News recently asked readers to call and write
about their computer repair experiences, and a few were satisfied
with the service they had received.
</P>
<P>
   But others had real horror stories, and the primary complaint
from disgruntled customers was the way computer repair technicians
and businesses treated them.
</P>
<P>
   They said technicians were flippant, condescending, deceitful
and incompetent. The repair people tended to treat customers as
annoyances rather than as the source of their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me they couldn't care less whether it was done
when they said it would be done,'' said Doug Berger of suburban
Dayton, who took a computer to a Miamisburg, Ohio, repair shop.
``The second time I called them to find out what was going on with
my machine, they wouldn't tell me a thing. All they would say was
they would call me when they were finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has had several bad experiences with computer repair. He
said this past spring he started having trouble with his Web
browser disappearing from the screen while he was online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made seven different calls to America Online,'' he said. ``I
got seven different technicians who gave me seven different reasons
for my problem. None of them helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger eventually took his computer to the small shop. After
several broken promises from the shop, Berger said finally got a
working machine back.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fowler was not so lucky. Fowler is the managing principal of
a consulting firm that works in value analysis, and his computer
crashed after becoming infected with a virus in January.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to the repair department at a Best Buy store Jan. 26,
explained the problem and was charged about $400 for a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he called the store and spent seven minutes on
the phone before reaching the technician who took his repair order.
Fowler said the technician told him, ``I have been busy on the
counter. I haven't had time to look at your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said at this point he began to get irritated and started
taking notes on his exchanges with Best Buy. The notes were later
used to write a 12-page affidavit he sent to Best Buy executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, his computer was shipped back and
forth from Trotwood, Ohio, to a repair center in Cleveland for two
months before he finally got it back along with an additional bill
of $82. In the meantime, he talked to Best Buy officials more than
30 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lying and incompetence and not caring about the customer
were just amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Best Buy said the computer was finished, Fowler said
he continued to get error messages every time he turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   He took it to another shop, A.C.E. Computer Helpers and a
technician there discovered what he said were major errors made by
Best Buy. It cost Fowler another $260, but now he says his machine
works perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said after he sent his affidavit to the Chief Executive
Officer of Best Buy, the company sent him a gift certificate for
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Harris, a spokesperson for Best Buy, said Fowler's case was
``unfortunate and very unusual,'' but she said Best Buy has had
problems with equipment being in the repair loop too long. She said
repairs lasting 20 days were not unusual, but the company has made
improvements lately.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Best Buy has instituted a program that will try to
ensure that computer will be repaired within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Good experiences
</P>
<P>
   Not every customer who needs a computer repair walks into a
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Van Allen of Sidney, Ohio, for example, bought a computer
at Stillwater Microsystems in Piqua, Ohio, in December 1997 and
says he's had excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Van Allen bough the computer, he purchased a
program that refused to install, an infuriating situation many
users have faced.
</P>
<P>
   He took the computer back to the dealer, and technicians there
downloaded a program patch from the Internet and installed it on
computer while he waited. Van Allen didn't have Internet access at
the time, and the company also downloaded the latest video card
driver and installed it at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the experience of the readers interviewed for this
article, there seems to be two keys to having a good computer
repair experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first key is learning as much as possible about your own
machine and doing as much trouble-shooting as possible without
taking the computer to a repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second key is choosing a repair technician carefully. You
should know specifically who is working on your machine and if that
technician fails in some way, find another.
</P>
<P>
   Glenna Cooper of Miamisburg is a good example of the value of
understanding computers. She bought her first computer in 1986 and
discovered when she turned it on that it had no operating programs
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Using manuals and books she bought she gradually learned to
write her own programs. Now Cooper's family has three computers and
a laptop at home. ``Any time the kids or my husband crashed the
computer, I just simply fixed it very easily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important accessories home computer users own are the
manuals that came with their system and software. Never throw away
a manual, and always reread the relevant sections when a problem
crops up.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, every time you buy a new program or accessory, you
must immediately register the purchase with the manufacturer. Most
manufacturers offer telephone or online assistance for their
customers, but you usually have to register to qualify for help.
</P>
<P>
   When you call for help be prepared to explain the exact
circumstances of your problem. What goes wrong and what seems to
cause it? Also print out or jot down any error messages that pop up
when the problem occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to all your receipts and warranty documents. If a
product is faulty, it's better to have the manufacturer pay for the
repair if possible.
</P>
<P>
   It also pays to be connected to the Internet. Because computer
software and hardware are made by so many different companies and
their configurations change constantly, you may have to download
upgrades and patches to make the products you buy work together.
</P>
<P>
   You also should be careful when you buy software and
accessories. Read the packages thoroughly to be sure the purchases
are compatible with your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting help
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to knowing everything about your computer is
associating with people who do. Joining a user group is a good idea
if you often have trouble getting your computer to operate
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Spurgeon, president of the Dayton Area Computer User Group,
said members regularly bring ailing computers to meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to brag, but we've never had anybody who had to
go outside the club for a repair,'' Spurgeon said.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that many computer repair technicians are
quite young. That's probably not just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Shelton, director of public relations for CompUSA, said
the chain typically recruits its technicians through high
school-level vocational programs. She said the company asks
vocational school instructors for the names of outstanding
students, and the students who are hired are sent through a
five-day certification course.
</P>
<P>
   Each company is different, however.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Edge in Dayton, for example, is basically a one-man
operation run by owner David Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Horn has only run his repair and sales company for about 18
months, but he's been involved with computers for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of business through word of mouth,'' Horn said.
``Some consumers may be apprehensive to turn their computers over
to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Having your computer repaired can be an intimidating experience,
but you should can increase your chance at having a good experience
by doing some homework.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking your computer in for repair or summoning a repair
service to your home, quiz friends and acquaintances about their
experiences. Ask questions not only about which companies did good
work for them but also about which individual technicians they
found helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid repair shops that have failed to complete work on time for
others without giving a very valid reason.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave your computer with a technician who doesn't listen
carefully to your problems. A technician should ask questions about
your experience with the machine before jumping in with proposed
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, have the technician run a quick diagnostic program
while you watch. Have the technician repeat the steps that usually
lead to the failure you want fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Get a written estimate spelling out what the problems are and
how they are to be corrected. The estimate should indicate the
company will get your authorization before exceeding the estimated
amount.
</P>
<P>
   If components are replaced, get the components that were
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your only option is to be patient; after all, no
technician can fix a computer if a needed part hasn't arrived yet.
But if a particular company makes a habit of disappointing you _
moving back the time when your computer will be ready, finding
problems they'd previously overlooked, failing to keep you
informed, etc. _ keep notes and records of your experience.
</P>
<P>
   Complain to management about a technician's poor performance and
perhaps your job will move up the priority scale a little.
</P>
<P>
   If one repair shop turns out to be hopeless, you may be better
off simply retrieving your machine. Some readers said even though
they had to pay a bad shop basically for doing nothing, it was
worth it to get their machine to a more capable technician.
</P>
<P>
   When you find a repairer who is reliable and reasonably priced
make sure every computer user you know hears about it.

Catalog your needs, then spend carefully on a computer 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was easy to give advice about
buying a computer. All machines were pretty much the same, and the
conventional wisdom was to buy as much computer as you could
reasonably afford.
</P>
<P>
   It was good advice in its day. But over the past couple of
years, a lot of things have changed to make that advice outdated.
In the past, almost everyone except scientists and engineers did
the same basic tasks with a computer: word processing, e-mail,
finances and an occasional game. Those were the days of one
computer fits all _ think of it as the Model T era of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there's a definite class system in computing. Some
people do little more than e-mail, Web surfing and letter writing
with a computer. Others are true power users, manipulating graphics
from digital cameras, editing videos or even playing games.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second factor, too. A few years ago, prices were
basically the same for similarly equipped machines. Sure there's
always been the brand-name factor _ just as with cars, you pay
extra for a good brand name. But the price spread was relatively
small compared to today.
</P>
<P>
   That gives you more choices to make when it comes to buying a
computer. Since the question I am asked most frequently is what
computer to buy, here's my most current computer buying advice:
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you plan to do with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   If all you need is a way to log on to the Internet and write the
occasional letter, consider a relatively low-end machine. Even a PC
powered by an Intel Celeron (the junior-grade Pentium chip) that
runs at 333 megahertz will do nicely for those uses. If you're
adventurous, try one of the no-brand computers that sell for as
little as $500 without the monitor. Or get a brand-name machine for
more _ but you'll still pay less than $1,000. Then spend the money
you saved on a high-speed Internet connection like a cable modem,
or DSL, from the phone company. If the Web is your main interest,
you'll get a lot more satisfaction with a low-end machine and a
high-speed connection than with a high-priced computer and a
regular telephone modem. The biggest factor when it comes to Net
performance is the speed of your connection.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another group of computer users who are more
ambitious. They care about the Internet but also want to edit
images from their digital cameras, run complicated databases and
play a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   These folks probably need more computer, but they still don't
need a Cadillac. Look for a 400- or 450-megahertz PC. Since games
are of some importance, consider a 3-D video card. It's required by
some games, and even when it is not, it makes a difference. You'll
probably be OK without spending extra on a better sound system if
games are just a minor factor. If you go the no-brand route, you
can still get a machine, less monitor, for $800 or so (but even
with a brand name such as Dell, you can get a 450-megahertz system
with 17-inch monitor for about $1,500).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are those folks who either need or want the top
of the line. There's nothing wrong with that. And with serious game
players, for instance, these systems can make sense _ especially if
you aren't making financial sacrifices to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   For around $2,000 you can get a 550-megahertz Pentium III
machine that's loaded with 128 megabytes of RAM, a 3-D video card,
17-inch monitor, great sound card and speakers with a subwoofer.
That's for a brand-name machine. If you shop around for a no-name
brand, you can beat that price (although if you want a
king-of-the-hill machine, there's a good argument for spending the
money for a brand name).

Check injury risk before you play 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thinking about taking up inline skating, but you're
not sure about how big a role crutches might play in your future? A
Web site, www.sportscover.com
</P>
<P>
   /injcalc.htm, can take away some of the guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   The sports injury calculator is divided by type of activity _
archery to weightlifting _ and age range, gender and fitness level.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonably fit male 30 to 39 years old, for example, has a 7.5
percent chance of hurting himself playing croquet. The same man
playing rugby will get hurt 75 percent of the time, according to
the calculator, which is to be used as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly aged female is a safer bet for most sports. A fit
woman playing croquet at the same age as the fit man has a 6
percent chance of injury. The female rugby participant is a 60
percent bet for the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a free service from Sportscover, a sports insurance
information Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking guide company puts Appalachian Trail on CD
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire company has developed a topographic map of the
Appalachian Trail, stored on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech sells CD-ROM hiking guides. The Appalachian Trail CD,
which will be released in August, covers the full 2,160 miles, from
Georgia's Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It shows topographic maps, which tell you where the land is
relative to sea level. The disc also includes trail descriptions
and navigation software.
</P>
<P>
   The map's breadth along the trail is at least two miles and up
to eight miles. The guide contains mile-by-mile descriptions and
more than 150 photographs showing what the hikers would see as they
walk the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are icons for shelters, campsites and road access
points. The navigation software lets users mark and measure
distances with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-state trail is divided into four discs. Each sells for
$39, so a set of four would cost $156.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs are divided into regions. The southern region includes
101 maps of Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The Virginia
region has 102 maps for Virginia and West Virginia. The
Mid-Atlantic region includes 102 maps for Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and New York. For Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, 114 maps are included.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs can be ordered from Maptech, at 800-627-7236. The maps
and navigational software require at least Windows 95 and a
Pentium-class CPU, a CD-ROM, 16 megabytes of RAM and a 256-color
monitor with a mouse or another kind of drawing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard spiffs up its computer offerings
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has taken a hint from the iMac and become a
little more provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The HP Pavilion 8000 series is Hewlett-Packard's first redesign
in two years. The most notable change is a smoke-colored
translucent panel on the front of the computer's tower.
</P>
<P>
   The series includes broadband capabilities and a keyboard geared
toward Internet navigation. Models range in price from $749 to
$1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The 8570c PC comes with an Intel Pentium III 450-megahertz
processor, 96 megabytes of RAM, a 19-gigabyte hard disk drive, a
32x CD-ROM drive and networking card, a 56K modem, and a way to
program Web sites into your keyboard for one-touch navigation. The
8570c is expected to sell for about $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   On the lower end of the price scale is the Pavilion 4540 PC,
powered by an Intel Celeron 433-megahertz processor with 64
megabytes of RAM and an 8-gigabyte hard drive. The 4540 includes a
32x CD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and a one-touch Internet keyboard. It
is expected to sell for $749.
</P>
<P>
   The HP series PCs come with 10/100BT networking cards that can
be used for high-speed Internet access through a cable modem or
digital phone line.

Wired lends an ear to music revolution 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a revolution under way in how people will be
able to buy and receive music and videos. Of course, it involves
the Net. Read all about the coming change in the August issue of
Wired. The magazine features a series of stories about new digital
distribution technology, including MP3. Wired's article includes a
fun chart depicting the new technology and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Treat your PC like a sports car. That's the advice in the August
issue of PC World magazine. It features a series of articles that
show you how to tune, fix up and boost the power of most PCs. These
articles will show you how to tell if your PC is on the blink and,
even if it's working fine, how to make it more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of PC World also has an interesting piece
reviewing the new PalmPilot VII. This is the model that introduced
wireless communications to the hand-held computing world. You can
use the PalmPilot VII to send and receive e-mail and visit a
limited number of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   ``Links Extreme,'' a new Microsoft release, features a novel
twist on golf simulation CDs. In the game, you can play on a
demolition driving range where the golf balls will explode. Another
course offers a 100-foot skeleton as a practice target. You get the
idea. The game contains mild animated violence. It's available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris'' was one of the original games for Nintendo's GameBoy.
It's changed over the years, adding cool graphics and colors and
migrating to other game platforms. The latest version is ``The Next
Tetris,'' which has been released for Sony PlayStation. With ``The
Next Tetris,'' you can play against friends, play in 3-D and play
through a controller.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There's so much going on with Apple these days it's hard to keep
up. A great site to keep track of all the changes and upcoming
products is Apple Insider.
</P>
<P>
   This site features extensive behind-the-scenes coverage of
things such as Apple's next version of the Mac operating system,
code-named Sonata. There's also information about the Mac portable
expected to be released at MacWorld in New York this week. You'll
find Apple Insider at www.appleinsider.com/.

Web isn't interwoven with much of the world 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The typical Internet user worldwide is male, under 35
years old, with a university education and high income, urban-based
and English speaking.
</P>
<P>
   This profile of the average Web surfer comes from the
just-published ``Human Development Report 1999,'' commissioned by
the United Nations Development Program. The 260-page study touched
on a variety of issues concerning the worldwide distribution of
wealth and technology. It concluded that while technological
advances may be improving life for many, it's also widening the gap
between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   North America, with less than 5 percent of the population, has
more computers than the rest of the world combined. South Asia,
with 23 percent of the world's people, has less than 1 percent of
the world's Internet users. The study also reports that 80 percent
of all Web sites are in English, which is spoken by less than 10
percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   The study also noted that Internet connections cost an average
of about $10 a month for Americans but can cost upward of $100 in
Africa. A computer costs the average American one month's pay but
would cost the average Bangladeshi eight years' income.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were possible to wire developing countries quickly
and inexpensively, people in those countries without basic computer
skills would still have little access to electronic commerce. Nor
would they have access to any of the basic functions such as
sending e-mail or access to educational opportunities available via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The study has some solutions for leveling out the worldwide
inequalities, including a possible ``bit tax'' on e-mail that has
sent editorial page editors from Canada to Canberra into a frenzy
that should keep them going for months.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of information is troubling, partially because there
is not a lot average citizens can do about it _ except feel vaguely
guilty that they aren't doing something about it. There are some
people, such as Intel's PC Dads, who travel the country teaching
parents and educators computer basics, and Richard Kenyada of
Decatur, who works on his own time to bring computers and know-how
into the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly everyone working to increase computer access and
raise computer literacy levels will tell you that bridging the
digital divide in the United States is hard enough without
literally throwing the weight of the world's problems onto the pile
as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are things we do almost without thinking in the United
States that are not possible in many parts of the world. Every day,
millions of Americans are trading stocks, uploading photos of the
grandchildren, reading articles from Salon or buying Bruce
Springsteen music at CDNow.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen million people have access to America Online and pay
only $21.95 a month, which many argue is way too much.
Mademoiselle, a women's magazine targeted at twentysomething
working women, features Web addresses at the end of every story.
During the Super Bowl, lingerie maker Victoria's Secret put its Web
address in a 30-second TV ad, and millions of Americans (presumably
the under-35 white males the study mentions) dashed to their
computers to check it out. There are very few places in the world,
the study says, where a great portion of the population has not
only the skills but the resources to do such things.
</P>
<P>
   Many people may remember being told as children to eat
everything on their dinner plates because children are starving in
India. Lots of kids wondered how eating all of mom's meatloaf would
make life better for a starving 8-year-old in Calcutta. The answer
is simple: It doesn't. The point of even being asked to clean your
plate was to make you realize how lucky you were to have a full
plate of food in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you're out pricing computers at the mall or at
home online getting slightly miffed because the Ticketmaster Web
site is down, remember what we think of as an absolute necessity is
still a remote, almost incomprehensible dream for most of the
world's population.

Sites cover Fido, Fluffy and every possible pet 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's more than one way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a pet lover, the Web is littered with sites that can
help _ whether your pet of choice is a Chihuahua or a king snake.
Let's start with a good general purpose site called petlinks.com,
located understandably enough at www.petlinks.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice is a rather busy page filled with
text. But the absence of graphics means the page loads fast, and
the text is an elaborate system of links for almost every type of
pet you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if rodents are your thing, you'll appreciate the
links for rats, mice, gerbils, squirrels and chinchillas. For more
popular pets like cats or dogs, you'll find a series of links to
everything from shelters to trainers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice search feature so, if you aren't sure what
category to check, you can use a search word to find your topic
fast. There's also a link for a live chat section, where you can
have typed real-time conversations with other pet fanciers.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called the Tame Beast _ is also a general
collection of pet links. It can be found at www
</P>
<P>
   .tamebeast.com/. The organization is a bit different here.
Instead of a list of possible pets on the starting page (and you'll
find that as well), there are links for topics such as ``working
animals,'' ``fun sites,'' ``live cam sites'' and for searching past
articles about pets.
</P>
<P>
   There's an impressive amount of information here, most of it to
be found in links to other sites outside the Tame Beast. For
instance, if you click on ``cat,'' you'll get literally hundreds of
links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that even the most passionate cat fancier
would have the time or the inclination to visit each of the sites.
But since there's a capsule summary of each site, you can winnow
down the list to just the sites with the information you want.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a commercial site sponsored by Ralston-Purina.
You'll find it at petquarters.petkare.com/.
</P>
<P>
   This site focuses strongly on cats and dogs. Since those two
animals make up most of this country's pet population, the site
will appeal to many. The good features here include meaty sections
on choosing a veterinarian, essays on basic care for dogs and cats,
a pet column and _ as you'd expect from a pet food company _ lots
of data about nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   While you need to keep in mind that this is sponsored by a
company that would love to sell pet food to you, the nutrition
information is in-depth and seems unbiased. You'll learn about
special diets for cats with urinary tract problems and ways to keep
an older animal healthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places where the Ralston-Purina connection helps is
in a section that explains the ins and outs of reading the label on
a pet food can. There's an amazing amount of information to be
mined there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's go back to that notion that there's more than one
way to name a cat.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what you have in mind, take a look at a site called
2000 cat names. It borrows a theme from several sites that offer a
list of names for new babies. It can be located at www.petrix.com
</P>
<P>
   /catnames/.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names are fairly strange _ Jabberwocky and J. Edgar,
for instance _ but then so are cats.

Better Homes DVD cookbook is handy, but could be better 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week we'll examine another new cooking program _
the Ultimate DVD Cookbook from Better Homes &AMP; Gardens _ which of
course necessitates another guest appearance by my lovely and
talented wife Donna.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of struggling with this thing, she had some
good things to say about it:
</P>
<P>
   ``I started married life 42 years ago with two cookbooks. The
first was a collection of my mother's recipes, simplified for a
daughter who had steadfastly refused to learn to cook. (Her first
observation for baking potatoes was `Wash Potato.')
</P>
<P>
   ``My second cookbook was the Better Homes &AMP; Gardens cookbook
with the familiar red-and-white plaid cover. When I opened the
computerized version, I looked for sugar cookies and chili, two
recipes I remembered fondly. The sugar cookies were gone, and the
chili was there but completely different. (I'm embarrassed to admit
that a born-and-raised Texan got her first chili recipe in what
must have been a Yankee cookbook. I assume it's a Yankee book since
the cornbread recipe has sugar in it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipes are creative _ the pizza cookbook includes basic
pizza, as well as spinoffs, appetizers and desserts (candy bar
pizza sundae).
</P>
<P>
   ``The All About Cooking section is particularly useful. It tells
you what you need to know about everything from abalone to
zwieback. For example, the program defines zucchini, tells you how
to choose a good one, how to store it, how to cook it, and what
nutrients you'll get when you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tips section was also useful. To make sure you get
adequate protein, the vegetarian cookbook recommends combining
grains and legumes, legumes and seeds, or grains and dairy. It also
suggests how to use tofu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis is available for every ingredient from
alfalfa sprouts to yogurt, plain and nonfat. Most recipes _ but not
all _ include nutritional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ingredient Equivalent section is useful. I didn't know
that two whole chicken breasts equal 1 1/2 pounds chicken or 2 cups
chopped chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite some good features, however, I can't recommend this
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Homes has, basically, taken 10 separate programs and
tossed them onto this DVD. Each is a separate entity, and they
don't all work the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parts don't work at all. The DVD offers video, but
doesn't run it. One of the 10 cookbooks refuses to cough up its
help section, insisting that it's already open. There is no way to
run a nutritional analysis of your own recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra's Mastercook Suite, reviewed last week, is far
superior.''

DIGITAL REVOLUTIONARIE WANT PC'S TO MAKE LIFE SIMPLER FOR HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM PAULSON   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A small group of subversives who want to eliminate
personal computers from every home in America has been meeting
quietly in Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the meeting, sponsored jointly by the University of
Washington and Microsoft, is to chart a path that will take us to
the day when your refrigerator decides when to order the milk or
your wristwatch does more than today's most powerful PC. Or other
things yet unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really want to do is get computers out of people's
way,'' said Gaetano Borriello, professor of computer science and
engineering at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to turn the computer on, log in and press
all these buttons to get it to perform a simple task,'' Borriello
said. Computers increasingly dictate human behavior, he said:
``It's totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Borriello and fellow insurgent Turner Whitted of Microsoft
Research are the ringleaders in this movement to help humans
triumph over computers.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by about 40 top scientists and engineers from other
seedbeds of intellectual unrest including the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley,
Georgia Tech, IBM, Xerox, Intel and Hewlett Packard, these digital
revolutionaries are meeting all week to explore ``Technologies of
Invisible Computing.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days of presenting individual ideas and discussing
obstacles at the UW, they move on Wednesday to the Inn at
Semi-ah-Moo, near the Canadian border, where smaller groups will
study the tasks necessary to rid the world of the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCs are general-purpose machines,'' Borriello noted. For that
reason, he said, they're good for many things, not excellent at any
one thing and way too complicated for most daily household or
office uses.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of stories, and ``Star Trek'' episodes,
that describe the concept of invisible computing. A few
technologies today give a glimpse of the goal _ the ``smart'' room
where lights and music turn on when a person enters or the personal
digital assistant with wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But all these examples, Borriello and Whitted say, are largely
based on the PC mentality in which users have to direct an
otherwise passive system to make something happen and the exchange
of information is still too complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want these devices to do things automatically, simply,''
Borriello said. ``They have to talk to each other, take in new
information and, in some cases, anticipate what you need and do it
without asking you about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't simply about how to improve computing,
Whitted said. ``It's about the movement of data,'' he said, about
moving it in completely new ways that won't depend upon people
having to learn new skills or change habits.
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for privacy concerns associated with computers
autonomously handling personal information, invisible computing
sounds fine and good. So what's the holdup?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting stuff, but to make it work is incredibly
difficult,'' said David Culler, a professor of computer science at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is information management, Culler said. If the smart
house of the future has 1,000 or so mini-computers each with
specific tasks, he asked, how will all this information be managed
_ sorted, turned on and off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without proper management, the world we're talking about will
be like those Furbees (toys) ... They keep talking and talking
until eventually you just lock them up in the closet to get them to
shut up,'' Culler said.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle often not considered in the trend toward
miniaturization in computing is the question of power sources,
Whitted noted. Each of these devices will need power, he said, and
nobody wants to change 1,000 tiny batteries in their house or wear
a device that generates too much heat.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Russell, from Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), said
it's important to think not so much about what's possible as what's
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Russell told a story about Porsche equipping its car with a
computerized sensor in its gas tank aimed at protecting the engine
from the damage of running on fumes. A driver went around a curve,
the gasoline sloshed to one side, the sensor said the tank was
empty and the car slowly shut itself down.
</P>
<P>
   After making some frustrated calls, Russell said, the driver
learned the only way he could restart the car was to reboot the
system _ something that could only be done at the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the user experience Porsche wanted the driver to
have,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about information management, power
sources and the ``user interface'' in invisible computing,
participants identified many other technical and social obstacles
that need to be hurdled before this vision becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Information transfer in most cases will need to be wireless, and
a number of experts said this will require innovative methods to
protect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Shih, a newly minted UW computer science and engineering
grad who is working at Microsoft before heading to MIT this fall,
said he's working on a system that uses the human skin's natural
electrical conductivity to transmit information through signals
that aren't broadcast but limited to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would aid in privacy,'' Shih said. ``The goal of all this
is make our lives simpler. Right now in computing, that's not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Starkweather, the man who invented the laser printer, said
the value of the UW/Microsoft Summer Institute on invisible
computing is in bringing together experts who don't normally
intersect _ software programmers with hardware designers,
networkers with operating systems gurus.
</P>
<P>
   Starkweather, who developed the laser printer while at Xerox and
who is now with Whitted at Microsoft Research, knows only too well
the value of getting people to think outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to develop something new within an engineering
organization in which people are mostly focused on improving on
what they've got and cutting production costs,'' he said. ``That's
why I got in hot water.''
</P>
<P>
   When Starkweather in 1967 presented his idea for laser printing,
his superiors at Xerox told him to ``stop fooling around and get
back to work.'' The idea went nowhere until 1970 when Xerox
launched its new research arm, PARC, to support creative research.
</P>
<P>
   Starkweather got a transfer to PARC and the laser printer was
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the exchange of new ideas and different
perspectives,'' he said. ``That's what this meeting is all about.''

ALL THE INTERNET YOU CAN DRINK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID BLOOM   
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Think of computer data _ text, music, voices,
still pictures, moving pictures, anything you can view or listen
to, get, store or send _ as water, a sloshing ocean of bits of
information washing around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, think of that water flowing through pipes, wires actually,
into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   At home, that flow of water/data is probably pretty slow,
dribbling in actually. Most home PCs sold these days come with a
modem, which serves as the spigot on that water flow, encoding and
decoding a computer's information so it can be sent reliably across
the information ocean to its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, your computer has a modem that lets data flow at
either 28,800 bits per second, or the increasingly widely used
56,600 bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   The slow drip, drip, drip of Web pages loading through a 56Kbps
or 28.8Kbps modem onto your home computer can become a kind of
Chinese data torture test that will drive an impatient Internet
user mad.
</P>
<P>
   The torture may finally end. The big pipe known as broadband is
coming, and it will let the bits flow as much as 350 times faster
than a 28.8Kbps modem. And at reasonable prices, too.
</P>
<P>
   But what is broadband exactly?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it's a high-speed Internet connection provided
through one of a group of competing technologies offered by phone
companies, satellite providers and cable-TV firms.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of these connections, and the fact that they are
``always on,'' mean they're likely to change how we use our
computers, the Internet and entertainment in the relatively near
future, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 2 million Americans have some kind of broadband
connection in their home (perhaps 14 million more have a fast
connection at work or school), but that's expected to change
radically in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both phone and cable companies have finished hammering out
technical questions and are trying to upgrade their wires to
compete for what is expected to be a large market: speeding
interactive information and entertainment of all kinds to the home
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crescendo of hype about broadband, you may still
have a hard time getting it in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Phone-based digital subscriber lines, or DSL, only work if your
home is within 3.5 miles of the ``central office,'' where the
high-speed switches are located. Cable TV modems require the cable
company to wire a neighborhood, a multibillion-dollar outlay that
means some areas won't get wired for months or years to come. And
satellite systems can be expensive to install for something that
isn't nearly as fast as the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the classic example: I live in a new development, where
there's $500,000 and up houses and most people work in high tech,
but we can't get DSL no matter what we pay, because we're more than
3.5 miles from a central office,'' said Clay Ryder, chief analyst
and vice president of Zone Research Inc. in Redwood City.``I'm
living in the prototypical neighborhood that would want this
service. And yet, I'm unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   But sooner than you think, this will change, and it'll change
the way you live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different kinds of Web sites will emerge, with all kinds of
content that you just can't use with a (slower connection),'' said
Bruce Kasrel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. ``It's richer, more entertainment oriented, assuming the
person is more at home. It's a fuller experience of the content.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the speed, either, that will change things.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike current connections, where you have to dial up a service
provider and wait for a connection, broadband systems let you swim
all the time in the Internet's ocean of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will have this `always on' connection, a big
difference from the dial-up world,'' Kasrel said.
</P>
<P>
   That means people use the Net differently, to check phone
numbers, get map directions, buy theater tickets, get reservations
and do a thousand brief chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that minute of time that used to be spent dialing up the
Internet, they're already done,'' Kasrel said. ``There's a lot of
potential quick hits of information that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable giant MediaOne sponsored an anthropological study of how
people use broadband services and found that its ``always on''
nature meant it was used far more heavily _ and by everyone in the
family, said the company's Kelly Ruebel, a vice president for
marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use it everywhere _ in the kitchen, in the bedroom, in
the family room,'' Ruebel said. ``It's becoming more of an
appliance. It changes the way you use media, because it's faster
and it's packaged for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the differences were obvious at a recent conference for
broadband content developers at Sony Pictures Entertainment's
Culver City studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a brand-new medium for people,'' said
Michael Sepso of Gotham Interactive, a broadband developer. ``It's
not just a fast Internet. You can make video interactive and maybe
tie it into things we're already used to, like e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii-based Pixelworld is putting together tourism-oriented
sites connected to specific geographic locales and viewable only on
a high-speed connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only interested in broadband, that's it,'' said Stephen
Szabo, Pixelworld's production director. ``It gives people a more
compelling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pixelworld's Hawaii site, which should launch within a couple of
weeks, will automatically check a visitor's connection speed. If
it's not at least 100 kilobits per second, the site shunts the
visitor to a message that tells where to get a faster connection,
Szabo said.
</P>
<P>
   The site showed excellent-quality live video (about
three-fourths of the normal TV speed of 30 frames per second) shot
from a Hawaii beach as the sun rose. And that was with a temporary
connection cobbled together for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of what will come isn't yet clear, because developers
have only just started playing with the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we bet heavily on broadband: The more you give them,
the more they consume,'' said Carl Rogers of cable giant MediaOne.
``But five years ago, nary a word was said about the Internet.
Everyone was enamored with interactive TV. Will we be able to
predict with precision where it will be in the future? I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Online gaming should blossom, for one, Rogers and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Thriving subcultures already exist for the online components of
many computer games; all three next-generation gaming consoles will
have a modem and Internet gaming abilities; and online-only games
such as Ultima Online and Everquest draw thousands of players back
for month after month of play.
</P>
<P>
   With higher-speed connections, all those gaming experiences
should be even more involving, with richer graphics, more
compelling worlds and room for even more competitors to duke it out
in the same world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see people creating things specifically for this medium
that you couldn't do before broadband,'' said Patrick Kearney of
Columbia TriStar Digital Media.
</P>
<P>
   Videophone service, Web conferencing, interactive video, stock
tickers, soap opera news, weather reports, streaming video from
ESPN.com, high-quality music, in general lots of ``short and sweet
content bits,'' will be popular, said Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   What probably won't happen is access to an endless shelf of old
TV episodes, said Rob Tercek, Columbia TriStar's vice president of
online services and an adjunct professor at USC's film school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-interactive content sucks on the Net,'' Tercek said.
``We're trying to incorporate Web features such as feedback and
customization for this medium. The idea that you can talk back to
your TV is very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   That means more gaming, more auctions, more chatting and more
``metacontent'' _ data about data, so you can find your way to the
good stuff, Tercek said.
</P>
<P>
   It also means personal TV stations, where some 14-year-old with
a digital video camera is creating his own shows and
``broadcasting'' them. And more reality: weather and traffic. And
lots of selling, with episodic stories worked into commercials and
catalogs, to draw in customers.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's Rogers predicted broadband will really blossom
between 2000 to 2002, when enough homes are connected to create the
mass markets that make a new medium possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to boil the ocean tomorrow,'' Rogers said.
``This thing is going to take a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   BROADBAND CHOICES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telephone
</P>
<P>
   What technology: Various flavors of what's generically known as
Digital Subscriber Lines, or DSL. The most common DSL technology
for home use is called asymmetric, or ADSL, because the speed of
your downloads is much faster than speed sending information out.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Uses regular phone line. Always on, for easy access.
Also, you can ``split'' your line, getting a phone call while
surfing the Net and sending a fax.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Only available within 3.5 miles of the phone
company's ``central office,'' where the DSL switches are housed.
More and more central offices are getting hooked up, including many
in the Valley and surrounding areas, but you could still be too far
away. DSL has lower top speeds than cable modems, and costs more.
You still have to get an Internet service provider for an extra $20
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Speed vs. price: Up to 6 megabits per second, though typical
guaranteed service level priced for home use is more like 384
kilobits (384,000 bits) per second, for a price of around $40 to
$60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Shop around. You have a variety of choices
besides your local Baby Bell for DSL service, and what they charge
for equipment, establishing service and monthly charges can vary
quite a bit. Lots of smaller companies looking to build a business
are offering good deals and specialized expertise. Not every
Internet service provider has a deal with every DSL provider, so
you may have to move e-mail addresses to get faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Where to look: The number of companies offering DSL is expanding
rapidly, but start with places such as Pacific Bell
(www.pacbell.com/products/fastrak/dsl), GTE (www.gte.com), Sprint
(www.sprint.com and has a partnership with Pasadena ISP Earthlink)
and Covad (www.covad.com ).
</P>
<P>
   Cable television
</P>
<P>
   What technology: Cable TV modems
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Superfast, when no one else is on your local loop.
Always on. Cheaper for the speed.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: It's a shared network, so when everyone in the
neighborhood gets on at once, your access speed plummets. And
shared network means potential security vulnerabilities. Not
available until cable company wires your neighborhood. And no
choice of provider (now, at least, in most of the country); it's
whatever broadband provider your cable company has designated and
only that one.
</P>
<P>
   Speed vs. price: Up to 10 megabits (10 million) per second, for
$30 to $40 a month. Real speed depends on who else is using your
connection at the same time. Hope for a bunch of clueless
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Ask about their security measures to prevent
easy snooping by others in your computer. Because you're on a
shared network that's always on and very fast, your computer can be
a terrific place for a cracker to poke through.
</P>
<P>
   Where to look: Home (www.home.com or Roadrunner
(www.MediaOneRR.com), the two main broadband providers in the cable
world. &QL; 
Satellite services
</P>
<P>
   What technology: Satellite service.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Available just about anywhere, as long as you have a
clear spot to erect a satellite dish. Only one satellite company
providing the big pipe, but you can pick whomever you want to
provide Internet services on that pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Good speed, but top end is far below competitors,
and that speed is available only one way, for downloading. Sending
stuff back up to the Net still requires a pokey old telephone line.
You still have to dial in each time you want to get online, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speed vs. price: 400 kilobits per second top speed; as little as
$19.99 a month for 25 hours of use.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: Current price structures are cheap on the
front end but come with a lot of fine print, such as an hourly
charge after as little as 25 hours of use a month. They bill a
minimum five minutes for every connect, too. That can add up fast
if you're a serious Web head.
</P>
<P>
   Where to look: Only one place, DirecPC (www.direcpc.com)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget Department of Justice vs. Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting legal battles being fought in the
technology world is pitting phone companies and Internet service
providers such as America Online against cable companies,
particularly the nation's biggest cable operator, phone giant AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Major Internet companies such as AOL have been lobbying hard, at
every governmental level from the Federal Communications Commission
to the Los Angeles City Council, to force cable companies to act
more like phone companies and face competition.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hook your PC to cable right now, you'll only have
one choice in your Internet service provider, probably either
Roadrunner or ExciteHome, depending on your cable company. That may
change, given a series of fights around the country now going on.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and its allies won a potentially pivotal Oregon court
decision requiring open access there this spring. Just this week,
their side won a similar battle in the Florida county where Fort
Lauderdale is located.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills to force open competition nationally are currently
floating in the U.S. House of Representatives. State Sen. Richard
Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, has also introduced a bill in the California
Legislature to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies and AT&AMP;T, which recently spent $114 billion to
buy two of the nation's largest cable companies (which in turn own
large portions of Roadrunner and ExciteHome), have fought that
effort strenuously, with support from the FCC's chairman, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and others.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that if they have to open their cable modem systems
to competitors, it will slow their construction process by years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking several billion dollars before all that
infrastructure is upgraded, and then you have to look at the
economics of it,'' said Clay Ryder, vice president and senior
analyst for Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have the battle (in cable company executives' minds)
of, `Can I have more pay-per-view channels, or do I provide
broadband?''' Ryder said. ``Does TCI want to plunge billions of
dollars into making all this stuff, then have to sell it to their
competitors? They'd rather do one channel with Home, instead of
opening up their entire network to their competitors.''

 &HT;    TAX CUT COULD SPUR INTEREST RATE HIKE, RIVLIN SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tax cut passed by Congress this summer would
increase the likelihood that interest rates will go up, Alice M.
Rivlin, who recently resigned as vice chair of the Federal Reserve
Board, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts, designed to help Americans keep more of their money,
could stimulate the economy. But many think the U.S. economy
already is growing so quickly that any further stimulation could
drive up both wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   This is a situation the Federal Reserve Board is determined to
prevent. Just last month, the board raised interest rates a quarter
of a percentage point to counter inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy is growing very strongly,'' Rivlin said at a
breakfast with reporters. ``The concern about it overheating is
certainly legitimate,'' and tax cuts would make it ``more likely''
that the Fed would raise interest rates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting taxes while the economy is strong and before Congress
has reformed Social Security and paid down more of the national
debt makes little sense, she said, adding, ``I think it's the wrong
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rivlin joined the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research group, as senior fellow in the Economic Studies
program. She was on the Federal Reserve Board for three years.
Before that, she served as director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, and was the founding director of the
Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983.

KENNEDY WOMEN HAVE SIDESTEPPED FOIBLES OF FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Personal frailties and unforeseen tragedies. They're as much a
part of the Kennedy clan's legacy as public service.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend plane crash that took the lives of John F. Kennedy
Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law is only the latest in a history
of misfortunes, some brought on by risky behavior. A cousin died
after an accident during a game of ski-slope football. Another
overdosed on drugs. Still others saw their political careers
damaged by philandering and other scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But are there Kennedy cousins who seem to have sidestepped this
part of the famous family's legacy? Well, yes. The women.
</P>
<P>
   While the news media concentrate less on the Kennedy women, they
have been more adept than some of their male cousins at moving
forward in careers, politics and parenthood while avoiding the
traps.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is in her second term as Maryland's
lieutenant governor. Rory Kennedy is a documentary filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impresses me is that they make their own lives,'' said
Laurence Leamer, who wrote The Kennedy Women and is working on a
book about the Kennedy men.
</P>
<P>
   That men should exhibit physical courage is a Kennedy theme that
goes back to Joseph Kennedy Sr., Leamer said. His belief was that
Kennedys should lead intrepid lives, an idea imprinted deeply on
the men. The result was a drive for toughness, competitiveness,
machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it clearly comes out in the presidency of John F.
Kennedy,'' said Dennis Merrill, history department chairman at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, ``who took a great many risks
in terms of his private and public life. But we see it in the third
generation, with the skiing episodes and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Such values, Merrill said, have their roots in traditional
attitudes about masculinity and the family's Irish-Catholic,
patriarchal background.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar America, too, said Miriam Formanek-Brunell, director of
women's and gender studies at UMKC, has shaped this ``cult of
masculine courage.'' Meanwhile, women, especially elite women like
the Kennedys, were socialized in more traditionally ``feminine''
ways, to be nurturing and supportive and, generally, silent, said
Formanek-Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Kennedy, always in a supporting role, served as a model of
quiet strength and faith. At her 100th birthday celebration in
1990, her son, U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, said she was the ``quiet
at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe
harbor to which we could all come.''
</P>
<P>
   These early gender role models could have been repressive for
the Kennedy women, Formanek-Brunell said, but instead have been
liberating. Unlike the men, they aren't required to ``profile their
courage in public,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very high achievers who have taken the best of the
Kennedy legacy and merged it with the best female socialization has
to offer women,'' Formanek-Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy, whose wedding was postponed Saturday, makes
documentary films that focus on the poor and troubled. That she
pursues such work, Formanek-Brunell said, can be traced to the
Kennedy family culture and to the practices of the elite going back
to the 19th-century Victorian period, when elite women were at the
forefront of philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Jackson County prosecutor, Missouri State Auditor
Claire McCaskill has seen families with plenty of problems. So,
except for the Kennedy assassinations, she isn't astounded by the
sex and drug scandals that surround the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty all-American problems,'' said McCaskill, who
has met Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend but otherwise has
watched the Kennedy saga, as most have, through the media. ``The
fact that the women have avoided those kinds of problems has a lot
to do with our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, generally, don't make such mistakes as often as men. And
women who want to accomplish things, even women with the Kennedy
name, can't afford to be reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the female side, it's harder to assume you're going to get
somewhere because of who you are,'' McCaskill said. ``As a woman
trying to do things in what sometimes feels like a man's world, you
don't have a sense of entitlement.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said this generation of Kennedy women could be
inspirational if American women had a chance to know them, although
she understands their desire for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg certainly impressed the Rev.
Emanuel Cleaver, Kansas City's former mayor. He first met her in
1986, when she was researching a book she wrote with Ellen
Alderman, In Our Defense: The Bill of Rights in Action. She was
interested in his handling of Ku Klux Klan issues.
</P>
<P>
   What Cleaver liked best about her, he said, was her
ordinariness. When he phoned her, she always picked up the call
herself. And she didn't ask a secretary to place her calls to him.
In fact, as they continued to keep in contact, she remained
down-to-earth, never aloof.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets up in the morning like every other working woman, and
she does her work with a grace that's uncommon,'' Cleaver said.

PUBLIC SERVICE, PRIVATE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend
</P>
<P>
   She's been called the ``Clean Kennedy'' and ``the Nun.'' Born in
1951, the oldest of Robert and Ethel's children is Maryland's
lieutenant governor. Her husband, David, teaches at St. John's
College in Annapolis. They have four children.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend earned a law degree and worked in the 1982 campaign of
her uncle U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. Four years later she ran for a
Maryland congressional seat and lost.
</P>
<P>
   She was a deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration,
then won the lieutenant governor's job in 1994. She and Gov. Parris
Glendening were re-elected in 1998. Her political future may
continue to focus on Maryland: Glendening is barred from seeking a
third term as governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her late brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., the 41-year-old
Schlossberg jealously guards her privacy and that of her family.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to Edwin Schlossberg, an artist and museum
planner. They have a 6-year-old son and two daughters, 9 and 11,
and live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Harvard and has a law degree from Columbia
University. (She passed the New York bar on her first attempt,
unlike John Jr., who had to take it three times.) She doesn't
practice law but has written law-related books, including The Right
to Privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg takes seriously management of the Kennedy legacy:
She is chairman of the board of the Kennedy Library in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Shriver
</P>
<P>
   Famous on many counts, Shriver is a Kennedy cousin (born in 1955
to Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver), an NBC news correspondent
and is married to movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   She is also known as a devoted mother to two daughters and two
sons, ranging in age from 11/2 to 9. She has scaled back her hours
at NBC to spend more time with them.
</P>
<P>
   As a TV reporter she has landed major interviews, including one
with Fidel Castro. Recently Golden Books published a children's
book she wrote, What's Heaven?, the story of a girl dealing with
the death of her great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   It was Rory Kennedy's wedding that was postponed after news of
Friday night's plane crash. At 30, she was scheduled to marry Mark
Bailey, who writes and edits books and films. They live in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy was born in 1968, six months after the
assassination of her father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. She was the
last of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary filmmaker, she is said to be ``Kennedy-esque''
because of her concern for the poor and disenfranchised. She was
arrested in the mid-1980s during an anti-apartheid protest outside
the South African embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her first film, ``Women of Substance,'' chronicled the plight of
incarcerated, pregnant drug addicts. Kennedy and Bailey worked
together on the recent documentary ``American Hollow,'' a year in
the life of a rural Kentucky family.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kennedy Cuomo
</P>
<P>
   She is the seventh of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's children, born
in 1959, a civil rights lawyer and ardent campaigner for liberal
causes, opposing the death penalty and campaigning against police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1981, as an intern with Amnesty International, Cuomo
documented alleged abuses by U.S. immigration officials against
refugees from El Salvador. She got her law degree, and in 1988 she
started the RFK Center for Human Rights, which draws attention to
human rights abuses around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is married to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo (whose father
is former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo). They have three young
daughters.

WILL EMMY GET TO KNOW NEW SHOWS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Rains would have understood the Emmy nominations process
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chief gendarme of ``Casablanca'' said it eight
years before the first Emmy Awards, Rains' famous order _ ``Round
up the usual suspects!'' _ would aptly describe how the top honors
in television are now selected.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences issued the
list of nominees for the 51st annual prime-time Emmys on Thursday
(July 22). And in most of the major categories, one can expect
three or more returning nominees from previous years. The winners
will be announced Sept. 12 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because the academy insists on nominating the same shows and
talent year after year, some of TV's most popular and critically
acclaimed programs have spent their entire on-air lives waiting for
their shot at the Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Below are the categories that are among the worst offenders,
along with the names The Star's television critic would have
slipped into the nominating envelopes _ if only he'd had the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Best Drama.
</P>
<P>
   Usual suspects: ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy additions: ``The Sopranos,'' ``Any Day Now,'' ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy should simply start over with a clean slate in this
category. In the last four years 19 of the 20 Best Drama slots have
been claimed by just five shows. That first-time nominee ``The
Practice'' won last year was a sure sign that this category needs
new blood.
</P>
<P>
   No series has been more overlooked than ``Homicide,'' Barry
Levinson and Tom Fontana's intimate look at detective life in
Baltimore. A multiple winner in TV critics' polls, the show has
produced only one major Emmy, Andre Braugher's win last year for
Best Dramatic Actor. That was Braugher's swansong on ``Homicide'';
now the show is saying goodbye. An award for Best Drama would make
a fine parting gift.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's series-you-can't-refuse, ``The Sopranos,'' is a shoo-in,
as is last year's winner, ``The Practice.'' Both shows are noted
for their large and talented ensembles and addictively circuitous
story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now,'' a heartwarming and intelligent series about
interracial friendship in the Deep South, was passed up by CBS, but
cable's Lifetime took a chance on it. An Emmy nod would raise its
profile and offer evidence that academy members actually watch more
than the same 10 channels.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Touched by an Angel,'' sure, it can be schmaltzy, but
no more so than perennial nominee ``Chicago Hope.'' And no
prime-time show opens as many tear ducts than ``Touched'' _ that
alone ought to get it nominated.
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Best Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Usual suspects: ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``3rd Rock From the
Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy additions: ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``SportsNight,''
``Cupid,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy will have to come up with at least two new nominees
to take the place of usual suspects ``Seinfeld'' and ``The Larry
Sanders Show,'' which signed off last season. That's good news for
Ray Romano, whose ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is almost certain to
be a finalist after its third season.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no doubting the quality of either ``Friends'' or
``Frasier,'' it's time Kelsey Grammer and the ``Frasier'' gang took
a rest from their yearly ritual of acceptance speeches. If the
academy wants to give trophies where trophies are due, then let
them honor the funniest sitcom this season, ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other shows would make this the highest-quality comedy
category in years: freshman sensations ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and
``Sports Night.'' One is highly rated, the other not; both are
quick-witted and fast-paced; both are getting extra promotional
oomph from their networks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like to see a nod for ``Cupid,'' the beautifully done
romantic comedy starring Jeremy Piven that died too young on ABC.
Some would call this a wasted nomination. To which I say: And ``3rd
Rock'' wouldn't be?
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Best Actor, Drama.
</P>
<P>
   Usual suspects: Dennis Franz, David Duchovny, Jimmy Smits,
Anthony Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Worthy additions: Eriq LaSalle (``ER''), James Gandolfini (``The
Sopranos''), Giancarlo Esposito (``Homicide''), Michael T. Weiss
(``The Pretender'').
</P>
<P>
   It's a toss-up which was the bigger surprise: the New Jersey guy
who played lovable psychopath Tony Soprano or Esposito, who took
Braugher's place on ``Homicide'' and racked up several memorable
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER's'' LaSalle deserves a nomination in his new leading role,
as does Weiss for taking a fairly limited character and giving him
sparkle and heart.
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Best Actress, Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Usual suspects: Helen Hunt, Patricia Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Worthy additions: Felicity Huffman (``Sports Night''), Lisa
Kudrow (``Friends''), Kathy Kinney (``The Drew Carey Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   Give Richardson a valedictory Emmy for her years of saving
``Home Improvement's'' bacon. Kinney, who plays Carey's
makeup-intensive foil, has been unfairly shunned for years. Kudrow,
winner as best supporting actress last year, has earned an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Outstanding Variety Series.
</P>
<P>
   Usual suspects: ``Late Show With David Letterman,'' ``Tonight
Show With Jay Leno,'' ``Dennis Miller Live,'' ``Tracey Takes
On...''
</P>
<P>
   All of the above have taken home this Emmy. And yet the
consistently funniest variety-talk show on TV is ``Late Night With
Conan O'Brien,'' which has never been nominated. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   - Category: Best Commercial.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how many TV commercials we watch _ and how few we
can think of that would be worthy of this recently added Emmy
category. Perhaps the most memorable ad was Budweiser's
anti-climatic send-off to its talking frogs that debuted during
this year's Super Bowl. You'll recall it ended with a lizard
scornfully noting, ``What has this got to do with selling beer?''

   ``First, we realized that the first thing people notice about us
is we are two Japanese girls,'' Hatori, the band's vocalist, said
last week. ``A lot of people still think only of Godzilla and
geisha girls when they think of Japan. We wanted them to notice
more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, our last record had all food titles. OK, we are serious
about food, we love food. But people misunderstood: `You are very,
very food crazy, Cibo Matto. You only think about food.' We have
more of a food culture in Japan than you have here. Here it's
difficult to mix food and art. So, people misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Cibo Matto (chee-bo MOT-oh, Italian for ``food
madness'') has expanded from a duo to a quartet (a quintet if you
count DJ//turntablist Duma Love, who tours with the band), and one
of its new members is Sean Lennon, son of John and Yoko and a
recording artist for Grand Royal records (he and Honda are dating).
</P>
<P>
   Then, instead of rehiring studio legends Tchad Blake and
Mitchell Froom, who produced ``Viva!'' Honda hired herself as
producer, thus casting this superficial take on Cibo Matto in 1999:
Two lovely Japanese ``girls'' with a fetish for food hire the son
of John Lennon to perform on their new record, which was produced
by one of those lovely girls.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pile of novelties and biases, one that Honda and Hatori
blow to smithereens on their new record, ``Stereotype A.''
</P>
<P>
   The food metaphors haven't completely disappeared; the album's
title comes from the song ``Sci-Fi Wasabi,'' which contains (in its
title and lyrics) some food references: ... ``feeling Stromboli,
not ravioli ...'' and ``... her fingers are smooth as butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the star of the new record is music: the band's seamless
integration of many genres _ hip-hop, funk, samba, bossa nova,
funk, metal, jazz _ into luscious cosmopolitan pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make this record more of our work, more
personal,'' Hatori said. ``On the last record, we had much more of
a live sound because we didn't have so many guest musicians; it was
just Yuka and me. And we didn't have as much time, about a month.
This time we had about a year, and we have our new band so the
sound is fuller.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound is fuller and more elaborate and interesting because
Warner Bros. let Honda produce the record; let her bring in friends
like jazz guitarist Marc Ribot to drop elegant guitar lines into
songs like ``Spoon'' and Love to drop beats into the edgy,
electronic haiku ``Clouds''; let her infuse the record with the
many noises dancing in her head _ noises that recall other New York
ensembles like Luscious Jackson and Soul Coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yuka produced Sean's record (``Into the Sun''),'' Hatori said,
``so they knew she was a great arranger and musician ... Yuka and I
were listeners before we were musicians; we love many kinds of
music. Manhattan has many races and many sounds on the street. That
is what we wanted to create on this record.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have. ``Working for a Vacation,'' the opener, is an
icy, funky rush of pop punk; ``Speechless'' and ``King of Silence''
sound like Herb Alpert tunes remixed by Everything But the Girl;
``Blue Train'' would have fit on any set list in Ozzfest (Hatori
said she and Honda are old metal//hard-core fans _ ``Motley Crue,
Suicidal Tendencies, bands like that''); ``Sunday Part 1'' is
straight ahead, martial rap; and the beautiful ``Sunday Part II''
is low-core, ambient pop, a mix of Mazzy Star and Edith Frost.
</P>
<P>
   As complex as many of the arrangements are on ``Stereotype,''
Hatori said, the band re-creates the music nicely in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mostly all live,'' she said. ``We use a little samples.
But mostly it's the band: Sean on bass and (multi-instrumentalist)
Timo Ellis and Duma Love, who does beatbox and turntable. We are a
band now; everyone in the band is an artist and very creative. And
you see that when we play live.''
</P>
<P>
   The record is so good that it should put to rest most of the
novelties and stereotypes about Japanese ``girls,'' Beatles'
offspring and women producers. That food thing, however, hasn't
completely gone away. In the liner notes, Hatori and Honda thank
their management company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them,'' they write, ``we are chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, probably more like foie gras.

``Apple.''

RUPERT EVERETT: AN IDEAL ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rupert Everett was a stranger to most American
moviegoers until he led a ``I Say a Little Prayer'' sing-along in
the 1997 summer hit ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' That movie put
the 40-year-old actor on the map, and although he didn't receive an
Oscar nomination as expected, Everett secured a career boost that
turned the journeyman thespian into a star.
</P>
<P>
   Everett has been everywhere this summer, appearing as a royal
sprite in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' an acerbic gentleman in
the Oscar Wilde adaptation ``An Ideal Husband,'' and now as the
evil Dr. Claw in Disney's ``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   He's currently filming a movie with Madonna and will soon reteam
with ``Wedding'' director P.J. Hogan for a comic thriller called
``Unconditional Love.'' For that movie, Everett will receive a
career-best payday running into the low seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupert appeals to everyone,'' says his ``Ideal Husband''
director Oliver Parker. ``Women love his rugged looks, and men find
him witty and charming. On top of that, he's a fantastic actor. He
has an intelligence behind the wit that makes him quite formidable
and believable.''
</P>
<P>
   The openly gay Everett recently talked about his limitations as
an actor, Hollywood stereotyping and why Madonna makes for a good
friend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why did you decide to, as they say, ``Go go Gadget''?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I've never been in a movie that costs $85 million before.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; :And ...?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  And it was a lot of fun. I love the technical artistry side
of movies, and you don't get to much of that with costume dramas,
do you? Plus, I play the villain in ``Gadget,'' so I could be
totally diabolical, totally over the top.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Can you offer an example?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I have a little cat named Sniffy, and I look like Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Got it. You were quite open about your sexuality when ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' came out. Has all the attention changed
your life?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It's old news, really. I'm just an actor. Since Ronald
Reagan becoming president, I believe actors should stick to being
actors if they can.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : So you resist the role-model impulse?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Absolutely. I'm not up for that. My life is not
role-modelly enough. If it's inspirational to people, that's
fantastic. But I don't want to enter the political arena like, say,
Ian (McKellen). I'm not capable of it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : In other words, you don't want your acting to be about your
sexuality. Yet, I imagine after playing a gay man in ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' some people stereotyped you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The gay scripts I get are usually filled with bad
characters and are just tragically bad, period. The movie I'm
making now (``The Next Best Thing'' with Madonna) is a script I
rewrote, because the gay character was totally stereotypical in a
very dull way. Good script, bad character.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : What about other scripts?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I've seen a variety of roles. My acting limitations aren't
about sexuality. Playing gay or straight isn't a problem. I'm
limited by other things _ my Englishness, for example.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : You and Madonna seem to have hit it off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I've always liked her. And she's a good actress. People
disparage her because we're all so conscious of her image. But she
can do it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Most had you getting an Oscar nomination _ if not the award
itself _ for ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' Were you disappointed
after the buildup?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Funny enough, Madonna put that in perspective for me. I
went around to her house the night the nominations were announced,
and she told me that no one who ever wins supporting actor ever,
ever wins for best actor. And I thought about it, and it snapped me
out of my disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : So Madonna's shoulder isn't a bad one to cry on?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  She doesn't let you get carried away by things that don't
matter. She's also been through everything herself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Not getting a nomination didn't seem to hurt your career,
though.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Strangely enough, I've never been more successful. And it's
funny, because after I did that movie, I was waiting for the right
parts to come along and ... nothing. So I thought, ``Well, getting
an Oscar nomination will really help, and everything's going to be
much better after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, I didn't get the nomination, and I felt terrible. But the
weird thing was, straight afterward I got this boost. And I've
worked now from ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' through ``Shakespeare
in Love'' to ``Inspector Gadget,'' ``An Ideal Husband,'' and now
I'm starting another film with P.J. Hogan. And they all came
together literally in the two weeks after the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : You have residences in New York and Miami, having fled Los
Angeles a few years ago. Why did you leave?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Los Angeles isn't a good town to be a failure in. It's a
real victimy existence. Now that I've had a bit of a career
windfall, I'm very happy being here (Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Audiences _ men and women _ love Lord Goring, your
character in ``An Ideal Husband.'' What's the secret to his appeal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  He has this mixture of slapdashness and laziness that's
very amusing. There's also his vanity, the great deal of time he
spends on his appearance. I like that he's scathing and, at the
same time, very generous. And he has a passionate interest in his
friends, which is rather touching, I think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Many just assume that you're essentially playing yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Oh no. I'm much more neurotic than he is, and I'm not very
good at doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : What are your feelings on Oscar Wilde?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  He's a very important gay icon. He was totally pilloried
for being a homosexual. He was destroyed for sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; : Times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I don't think the public cares anymore. Maybe the media,
but not the public. &QL;

`DROP DEAD GORGEOUS' AIMS LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(for publication Friday, July 23 or later)  
Our rating:  one star (fact box at bottom) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mean-spirited and obvious, the beauty pageant
satire ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' isn't going to win any prizes for
congeniality or, more importantly, talent. Full of low humor and
characters that don't remotely resemble human beings, this movie is
ultimately every bit as shallow as the bubble-brained contestants
it lampoons.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, the world needs a spoof on beauty
pageants about as much as Miss America needs another layer of
pancake foundation. Michael Ritchie's merciless sendup, ``Smile,''
did the job fine back in 1975, and subsequent years have brought a
slew of ``Saturday Night Live'' skits, talk-show jokes and inferior
imitations. (An exception: Beth Henley's ``Miss Firecracker,''
which had its charms.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' adds absolutely nothing to the genre,
which is somewhat surprising since its writer, Lona Williams, was
once a pageant contestant herself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in the small, Lutheran-dominated town of Mount
Rose, Minn., where everybody says, ``Yah, you betcha'' and eats
lutefisk for lunch and casseroles for dinner. The movie pokes
relentless fun at the flat accents and bland lifestyles with a
sense of smug superiority that was absent from the Coen brothers'
``Fargo,'' which had the decency (and the acumen) to populate its
world with interesting, colorful and, above all, recognizable
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's a pageant of cliches. There's the stage mother,
Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), a former Miss Teen Princess intent
on having her spoiled daughter, Becky (Denise Richards), follow in
her footsteps. Becky's chief competition is Amber (Kirsten Dunst),
a sweet, smart trailer-park beauty who _ and this is certainly a
new twist _ practices her tap dancing while attending to corpses at
the local mortuary.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of the Miss Teen Princess contest is captured by a
documentary film team, which gives ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' the same
basic structure of classic satires like ``This Is Spinal Tap'' and
``Waiting for Guffman.'' Here, though, writer Williams and
first-time director Michael Patrick Jann (from MTV's ``The State'')
go almost entirely for low humor and banal bromides.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the movie ridicules an array of easy targets _ the
empty-headed beauty contestants, trailer-park denizens, Lutherans
and ``retards.'' There's a scene of mass vomiting, a shot of a
young girl falling on a balance beam and landing square on her
crotch and a talent routine where a girl sings ``Can't Take My Eyes
Off You'' while dancing around the stage with an effigy of Christ
on the cross. (And she's the winner.)
</P>
<P>
   Dunst (the only survivor here among the cast) perfectly sums up
the movie toward the end, saying, ``The whole thing is just kind of
sad and lame at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. &QL;

<P>
   You've scoured the seed catalogs, you've mulched and watered and
weeded. You've battled the bugs, the pests and the squirrels. Now
it's time to enjoy the fruits, vegetables and herbs of your labor.
Whether you cultivate an acre, a backyard patch, a couple of
containers or a window box _ to claim the singular taste and
intangible energy of freshly harvested produce is the ultimate
reward for the gardener who loves to cook.
</P>
<P>
   To make the most of your garden yield, whether small or
abundant, check out these Internet sites. They're loaded with ideas
on preparing freshly picked veggies, pickling and canning tips and
advice on maintaining a kitchen garden.

</P>
<P>
   /garden/html/columns.html. Noting that ``nothing is more
satisfying than cooking with your home-grown foods,'' there is a
place to share your great garden recipes with others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you yearn for the satisfaction of growing and eating a crop
of something, don't let lack of space discourage you. Tending a
squash vine on an apartment balcony can be lots of fun and fabulous
squash casseroles can be the pride of your summer table. See

MESA COUPLE OPEN HEARTS, HOME TO 10 SIBLINGS  
 (ADV: RESENDING TO FIX LEDE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - Police found the 10 children hungry and covered
with lice in a trash-strewn house in downtown Phoenix, cockroaches
scurrying across the babies asleep on the soiled floor.
</P>
<P>
   The kids were taken in by child welfare officials, thrust into
different foster homes, shelters and group homes and kept apart for
years.
</P>
<P>
   It will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, Shirley and Van Hughes of Mesa will be named the
children's legal parents, their adoptions final. It is the largest
adoption of a group of siblings that experts _ local and national _
can recall.
</P>
<P>
   But Shirley and Van have been Mom and Dad to these kids for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love us,'' says Maria, now 8, the first to arrive on the
Hughes' doorstep as a foster child at 3, the rest following over
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank. Teresa. Asucena. Steven. Agustino. Juan. Enrique. Maria.
Veronica. Doni.
</P>
<P>
   Torn from each other when their mother could no longer care for
them, they are a family again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last day in April in 1995 when police found the 10
children, along with five of their cousins, fending for themselves
in a house near 10th and Roosevelt streets. Their mother and her
sister, the mother of the other children, had been gone for days,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, according to court records, had a history of
drunken driving and had spent time in jail. She was unreachable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest boy, Frank, was 14 at the time and sometimes stole
food for his brothers and sisters. Teresa, then just 13, was the
closest thing they had to a mother.
</P>
<P>
   The children have four, maybe five different fathers, Shirley
says. No one knows for sure. Anyway, none of them are around.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time police discovered the siblings, Van and
Shirley decided to take in foster children. Their own two sons, now
adults with children of their own, had moved out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too quiet,'' Van says.
</P>
<P>
   So, in June 1995, Maria, then just 3, arrived. She said little
more than ``yes'' or ``no'' for the first six months. She did
everything she was told, though _ and quickly, obviously afraid,
Shirley says, of what would happen if she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Maria talks a lot _ and happily _ about living here. She
likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to have a big house. My Dad makes a lot of stuff new,
like that,'' she says, pointing to the recently enclosed back
porch. ``He also made us a new air-conditioner.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after Maria arrived, state caseworkers asked the
Hugheses to take Enrique, then 5, and Juan, who was 6. They were
living in separate shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique had hair to his shoulders and was mad. He pitched fits
and kicked. Now 9, he's learning to control his temper. He has deep
dimples and plays basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Juan had been told that he was stupid so many times that he
believed it. Now 10, he is his teachers' favorite, Shirley says. He
is a natural soccer player, named the best on his team two years
running.
</P>
<P>
   Then came two more _ 2-year-old Doni and 3-year-old Veronica,
the youngest of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica, now 6, has a loose tooth. She'll have to repeat
kindergarten because her mother's drinking while she was pregnant
has made it hard for the tiny girl to remember things, like numbers
and letters. Doctors diagnosed her as being fetal alcohol affected.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Doni suffers because of his mother's drinking,
too, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Like his sister, he has
trouble remembering things. Doni was just 6 months old when the
police found him dirty, congested and running a fever with only a
bottle of spoiled milk in his crib.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy's hearing is bad. He often asks Shirley to repeat
what she says. Still, no matter where he is in the house, he can
hear Shirley pick up the keys to the van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you goin'?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going crazy,'' Shirley tells him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I go?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're driving me there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Doni follows Shirley everywhere, even camping outside the
bathroom door while she is in there. &QL; 
The remaining 5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, with the five youngest children already with the
Hugheses, state caseworkers asked them to take the older five as
well. Van and Shirley balked. They were 50 and figured they should
be planning their retirement, not another family.
</P>
<P>
   But if they hadn't taken the remaining five, Shirley says, the
kids would have been sent to different adoptive homes out of state
and likely never see their siblings again. The kids had been
visiting their brothers and sisters living with the Hugheses for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything they have gone through, we couldn't let them
be split up,'' says Shirley, who wears an ``I love Mom'' gold charm
on a necklace, a birthday present from the kids.
</P>
<P>
   So, Shirley ordered pizza and invited the older children over.
She and Van asked them if they wanted to live with them, if they
wanted to live there permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The children voted to stay and moved in in May 1997. Van and
Shirley told the kids that they could call them by their names or
``Mom'' and ``Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   All chose to call them Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   So do their friends. Often, Shirley looks up after hearing
someone say, ``Mom, can I talk to you about something?'' only to
discover that it isn't even one of her own kids.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa, Asucena, Steven and Agustino arrived at the Hughes home
together.
</P>
<P>
   Now 16, Teresa, the little mother, wants to work in child care.
Asucena, 14, wants to be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The boys love video games. Agustino, 12, saved his money and
bought a Nintendo 64. Steven, 13, and Enrique pooled their money
for one.
</P>
<P>
   Frank bought his own.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost 16 when he came to live with the Hugheses, the
last to arrive. Caseworkers warned the couple that he was a tough
kid.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was in four different foster homes and shelters. He talked
mean and sometimes stayed out all night. During a heated argument,
Frank told Van: ``What are you going to do? Beat me like my other
dad did?''
</P>
<P>
   Van hugged him instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best dad in the world,'' says Frank, now 17. ``It's
pretty cool here. I don't got to worry about nothing, like I did
before. I'm glad that we're together. That's what I'm grateful for,
everyone sticking together.'' &QL; 
Pizza night &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday night, Shirley orders six large pizzas _ for a tab
of $55.
</P>
<P>
   ``First few times I called, they thought I had a party every
Friday night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They do have a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Their Mesa home is surprisingly quiet for the number of kids
inside. It's never just the Hugheses' 10. Friends come for dinner
and stay the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's one more kid?'' Van asks.
</P>
<P>
   In the driveway is a secondhand, 15-passenger van with 401,000
miles. Six kids have braces on their teeth; four wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   At Calvary Southern Baptist Church in Mesa, the family fills the
front two pews. At breakfast, the kids put away two or three boxes
of cereal and 2 gallons of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The washer and dryer run all day. The kitchen floor gets mopped
twice a day. And the monthly grocery bill is about $1,500. Some
days, Shirley has to go to the supermarket twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids eat it all on the way home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Three cats and two dogs live here, along with a variety of
rabbits and turtles that come and, well, go, may they rest in
peace, Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   A converted garage and dining room make this a six-bedroom house
with three bathrooms. Little kids bathe at night, big ones in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Van is retired from the Navy and works nights as a security
guard at Phoenix City Hall. Shirley stays at home with the kids.
They receive $6,600 a month from the state for the children's care
that they'll continue to get after the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy evening, they eat dinner next door at the home of
Shirley's parents, Larry and Vera Russo. The kids swim there most
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, Larry cooks something on the barbecue and
everyone troops next door to eat. This week, he is wearing a
T-shirt that says, ``Dad knows a lot but Grandpa knows
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who agrees that Dad knows more than Grandpa?'' Van asks over
the chicken, steak, chili and salad. His query is met with a rare
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who agrees that Grandpa knows more than Dad?'' he asks. Ten
hands shoot into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunch of little suck-ups,'' Van mutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Dad, the light is reflecting off of your head,'' Teresa,
16, says, eliciting hoots of laughter from her brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to smack you!'' Van jokes, running his hand over his
balding head.
</P>
<P>
   They know he is kidding, of course. These children have had
enough poor treatment. What they get here is love, lots of hugs and
kisses. No one goes to bed without at least one of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show them love,'' Shirley says. ``How else are
they going to learn to love?'' &QL; 
House rules &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children set the rules of the house. No running. Bed at 8:30
p.m. for the little kids, 10 p.m. for the teenagers. Curfew.
Chores. Homework before television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `You have to be able to walk out of this door one
day and stand on your own two feet,' '' Shirley says. ``And the
only way they are going to do that is to get a good education.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no place for a dictatorship, Van says. Start barking
orders, and there would be mutiny. And Van and Shirley would be
outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this home, God is the foundation. These four adults,''
Shirley says, pointing to herself, Van and her parents, ``are the
pillars, and every child is a building block.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems get hammered out at family meetings, which anyone _
even the 4-year-old _ can call. Attendance is mandatory. Shirley
called one recently to complain that the children were slow to do
their chores but quick to ask for their allowances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing we cannot sit down and talk about,'' Shirley
says. ``There are no mistakes that cannot be rectified, nothing
that cannot be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Shirley and Van don't have a solution to a problem,
they turn to the big Bible that rests on a shelf near the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   With the teenagers, they talk openly about sex. Teresa and
Asucena wear gold promise rings that signify they will not have sex
until they are married. They can date, but only with other couples
until they are 17, and ``no smooching all over each other,''
Shirley says. She tells their dates: ``You toucha my girl, I toucha
you face.'' The girls laugh. Frank gets the same lecture.
</P>
<P>
   They keep no secrets. Some of the children talk to their birth
mother by telephone. The others are still angry. Shirley sends the
woman the kids' school pictures every year.
</P>
<P>
   That is a different life than the one they are living now. They
laugh here and play sports _ soccer, baseball, swimming,
cheerleading _ with parents cheering from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   They wear new clothes, paid for over time on layaway, the same
way the computer, kitchen table and bunk beds for the girls were
purchased. There's plenty to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always someone here,'' Asucena says. ``And you know
they care.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, after the kitchen and the kids are clean, and prayers
have been said, the house is quiet. Van comes home from work at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses are 52, married for 32 years. Van puts his arm
around his wife, as he does every night, kisses her and says,
``These are happy times, Shirl, you know that?'' &QL;

 &HT;    Pie makes great use of green tomatoes
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gordon Pitts of Atlanta asked for a green tomato pie
recipe that he thought he had clipped from this newspaper but lost.
He couldn't remember some of the ingredients, nor how much sour
cream and how many eggs to use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a search of the archives back to 1985 turned up many
variations on green tomato pie, none included sour cream and eggs.
Still, we found lots of good ways to use those unripe tomatoes,
including this main-dish pie with sour cream in the pastry. This
recipe originally ran in 1992.

DEARTH OF BLACKS ON TV A BOON FOR BET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Nothing has galvanized the Television Critics
Association summer press tour more than race. Where in years past
it was an issue that came up sporadically _ because it's a
continual problem _ this year it has taken on more heft because of
the NAACP's threats to hold TV networks responsible for accurate
representation.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a black actor or producer who doesn't have a comment
about the plight of minorities in the TV business.
</P>
<P>
   But there's irony in the fact that other ethnic groups can't
comment on their lack of exposure _ because they're not represented
on the TV show interview panels.
</P>
<P>
   It has fallen mostly to African-American members of the
Hollywood community to talk about the subject. And there's been no
lack of input in what has become TV's hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
   Black Entertainment Television (BET), which reaches 57 million
cable homes, was at the center of attention as it announced an
aggressive slate of new movies it says would never be made by the
broadcast networks, because everyone involved will be
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, said BET had
created a kind of throwback studio for the new films, with everyone
working together _ almost as a repertory company _ to make movies
that deal with all sides of the black experience. ``This is the
first time in the history of this town where an African-American
owned company managed by African-American executives, building a
relationship with African-American creative talent, both in front
of the camera and behind the camera, are distributing
African-American product over an African-American controlled
distribution network.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do BET representatives view the networks' fall
programming whitewash that creates a unique opportunity for the
channel? ``I wouldn't say we're pleased,'' said Debra Lee, the
president and chief operating officers of BET. ``We're part of the
African-American community and we think (black actors) should be
part of the networks. But it does present an opportunity for us to
showcase the films that we're here to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the networks seem to have stopped actively seeking
minorities, Johnson said it came down to competition and
advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a network executive _ who's probably white _ I'm
sitting back, saying, `My job depends on delivering that half-hour
show that gets the ratings.' So what am I going to do? I'm going to
launch a show that I think (one) advertisers like, (two) because it
will deliver a white audience that the advertisers value more. I'm
not going to do something risky with black people and white
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly going to stay away from black-and- white sex,''
Johnson said, ``so that takes out any romance stories. I'll
probably take out any show that shows a black man as a dynamic
business man, sort of lording over white people because that's
going to offend the angry white male. And you go on and on down the
line and pretty soon the guy says, `OK, let's do `Seinfeld' _ New
York, no black people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming _ a
network often singled out for its balanced minority representation
_ said there was no mystery to the situation. It was about the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the networks has decided who their constituency is and
they are spending their money against that constituency. And I can
only assume that they look at minority segments of the audience as
just that _ minority segments. And it seems to me that they've made
a business decision to spend against where they're going to get the
biggest return for their clients, who happen to be advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN is the only broadcast network that will launch a fall show
with black lead characters. Although the network often is brought
to task for questionable quality across the board, it continues to
believe that diversity is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, the president and chief executive of UPN, said
when he took over 18 months ago, he felt ``that television had
increasingly become only white and was increasingly divorced from
the reality of American life. And I always felt that it was good
business and responsible business for us to try, over time, to
reflect the way the country looked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that we have a number of shows with
African-American leads,'' Valentine said. ``I think there's a
longer way to go for us in having Hispanics, Asians, Russian
immigrants _ a whole lot of other people _ where I don't think
we've done enough yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Farquhar, one of the leading African-American producers
(he created ``Moesha,'' among others, and a new spinoff, ``The
Parkers,'' for UPN), said the coming season would be ``a bad, bad
year'' for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest answer is there's never been a particularly good
year,'' Farquhar said. ``And so, when you have four, five of the
(six) networks making a complete about-face, it becomes
ludicrous.''

KNOCK OUT OR KNOCK DOWN? TV TURNS TO WRESTLING FOR RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Here is a bizarre notion: Pro wrestling may
become a victim of its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, put aside the inappropriateness of the new breed
of rasslin' for kids: There is way too much sexual innuendo and
vulgarity, even though that breed of entertainment (not sport,
although they are athletes) markets heavily toward children.
</P>
<P>
   Now focus on the fact that pro wrestling is cyclical in
popularity, and is on a historic upswing. It is also poised to
become a larger jumble of letters.
</P>
<P>
   We already had WWF on USA and WCW on TNT. Now in the fall, ECW
will be on TNN, while the WWF will also air on a broadcast network,
UPN.
</P>
<P>
   It's UPN's stone-cold hope that the World Wrestling Federation
and ``WWF Smackdown'' (Thursdays at 8, starting in September) will
be the savior for the struggling broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, UPN's demographics last year were close to cable's
USA, a degrading fact. Now, since story lines from USA on Mondays
will carry over to UPN on Thursdays and back to USA on Mondays,
they are de facto step-partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a destination franchise ... akin to `Monday Night
Football,''' entertainment president Tom Nunan said. ``It will be
an excellent promotional vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   This coming season, UPN is targeting young male viewers, and
wrestling appears to be a shrewd way to do it. But with the
``sport'' (I know, I know, it's fake. Let it go.) to be on the air
at least five days a week, is this too much of a ``good'' thing?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Heyman thinks so. He is the owner of Extreme Championship
Wrestling, which will debut Aug. 27 on The Nashville Network. He
argues the brands WWF and WCW (World Championship Wrestling,
created by Ted Turner) are already overexposed (ECW tends to be
more ring-oriented and violent, with less back story).
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think that the skits and the story lines that
they're trying to present have been played to death,'' Heyman said.
</P>
<P>
   But UPN head Dean Valentine said the WWF characters' stories,
beyond what they do in the ring, is the unique draw. ``It has
really become a soap opera for guys, young guys,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   What about the youngest guys? Simply said, pro wrestling today
is just plain not right for kids, with characters giving the
audience the finger, scantily clad women, and wrestlers with
monikers like Sexual Chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Go ask Big Boss Man, a k a Ray Traylor, 36. A truly nice if
imposing man and a fixture in the WWF dating back to the 1980s, he
has two kids, 7 and 4. ``I don't let them watch the show because I
am a parent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UPN and the WWF don't subscribe to the inappropriateness angle,
although UPN will tag the show with a TV-14 rating. ``We don't
believe there is anything sexist or violent about WWF,'' Valentine
said. ``There is no one getting knifed on WWF. There is no gun
going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince McMahon, the brains and boss behind WWF, agrees. ``We're
Sunday school compared to what action/adventure shows do,'' he
rightly noted. He also doesn't buy into the notion that the
television wrestling field is getting too crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a wrestling genre we refuse to be part
of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look, this is a good move for UPN. But there is a danger that
the genre could go into one of its periodic nose dives. Wrestler
Owen Hart died in the ring in May when a steel cable snapped during
a stunt, while female personality Sable is suing for sexual
harassment. There is some bad karma there, karma that seems to
follow UPN around.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just maybe, wrestling will be the vehicle to finally
get a staggered UPN off the mat.

   `INDECISION 2000'
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has been a comedian's best friend. But as he steps
to the side stage for the 2000 elections, Al Gore and George W.
Bush, the Democratic and Republican front-runners, will become
favorite punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, other comedic political patsies remain on the radar.
Dan Quayle is one. And with his own party and millions of dollars,
H. Ross Perot can't be ruled out for a third presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the folks at Comedy Central and its show
``Indecision 2000'' (to be hosted by Jon Stewart of ``The Daily
Show'') is: Are those two still funny? Absolutely, according to
Stewart and crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross Perot will remain forever in our hearts,'' Stewart said.
``He is a hall-of-famer. I want him, I want (Steve) Forbes _ I
don't want to lose any weapons we had in the past.''

PROFESSOR SAYS LITERATURE MAY BEGET VIOLENCE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They've become familiar targets. After bloodshed
like the school shooting in Littleton, Colo., fingers readily point
to the usual suspects: goth-rockers like Marilyn Manson,
ultraviolent films and fantasy games like Dungeons and Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, look to the likes of Ernest Hemingway or Virginia
Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book, an English professor at the State University
of New York at Albany says the works of such prominent authors can
have an even greater influence than those of the dark denizens of
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving Literary Suicide,'' by Jeffrey Berman, urges
teachers to treat the literature of suicide with greater empathy
and reality. ``That's what will make my book controversial,''
Berman, 54, said last week in his book-lined office. ``Critics
don't like to talk about the impact of high culture on readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman is not arguing for some kind of ``suicide correctness.''
Nor does he think the writers he discusses, from Sylvia Plath to
William Styron, should be censored. Some of their books are among
his favorites. He merely suggests that teachers need to be aware of
the emotional effects literary suicide might have on students, and
resist the temptation to describe such deaths as ``transcendent''
or romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we ever say of a 29-year-old woman's suicide that it was
an act of transcendence?'' he asked. ``But literary critics do this
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman's book has won rave reviews from Key Redfield Jamison,
who wrote the best-selling ``An Unquiet Mind,'' and Styron, author
of ``Sophie's Choice'' and the only writer on Berman's list to have
overcome a battle with suicidal depression.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the book stemmed from a 1994 graduate course Berman
taught at SUNY-Albany. He wanted to examine student's reactions to
literary suicide by having them write personal diaries in which
they reflected on their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Where possible, Berman supports his book with intriguing
evidence from the world of science. There is Jamison's study
showing a 38 percent incidence of manic depression among students
at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop, while less than 1
percent of the general population suffers from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers from the Centers for Disease Control show that 27
percent of high school students contemplate suicide and 8 percent
attempt it. Yet many of his students, English scholars at the
master's and doctoral level, had never examined the taboo topic _
in literature or in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of Kate Chopin's popular, pre-feminist work
``The Awakening,'' many students said they had previously never
addressed Edna Pontellier's climactic suicide at the end of the
book. ``How could they ignore the most important aspect of this
novel?'' asked Berman. ``I suspect many teachers are just as afraid
of the topic as their students.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway is portrayed in the book as having wrestled with his
father's suicide through his writings. Robert Jordan in ``For Whom
the Bell Tolls'' is a thinly disguised version of the author.
Jordan, like Hemingway, rejects suicide after his father kills
himself, yet walks headlong into battle, where death is inevitable.
Similarly, Hemingway lived on the edge _ dodging bulls, joining
battles and hunting lions _ as a way of fighting his ghosts.
(Hemingway died of a self-inflicted shotgun blast in July 1961.)
</P>
<P>
   Berman also confronts ghosts. The book is dedicated to Leonard
Port, Berman's best friend, who in 1968 took sleeping pills and
slashed his wrists. Port was a charismatic English professor at the
State University of New York at Buffalo and was responsible for
Berman meeting his wife. Although he's led a ``privileged life,''
with a loving family and five books to his credit, Berman has
repeatedly returned to Port's suicide in his teaching and writing.
</P>
<P>
   The professor sometimes feels like the ancient mariner of the
Coleridge poem. Port's suicide is his albatross, and the book the
story Berman must share. ``I'm reluctant to make the comparison,
because it may sound self-inflated, but this is the story I needed
to tell,'' he said.

PARENTS, DOCTORS LOOK BEYOND MEDICINE TO CONTROL ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>

 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lori Miranda felt helpless when her daughter's
lips turned blue from asthma. But she didn't like the treatment
prescribed by her doctor either, a regimen that included two
inhalers and a steroidal nasal spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more stuff we put her on, the sicker she was,'' said
Miranda, who lives in Dutchess County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about her daughter's deteriorating health and the
long-term side effects of steroidal medications, Miranda began
looking for an alternative approach.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, her daughter is almost symptom-free and rarely
needs medication. She attributes her recovery to a strict diet of
no dairy, chocolate, eggs or corn. She's also careful to keep her
daughter away from other allergy triggers, like mold and dog
dander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her health has been so much better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out ways to keep asthma attacks from happening has been
the foundation of successful asthma treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But with an arsenal of new medications available to treat and
prevent asthma symptoms, such an approach hasn't always been the
first line of defense in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With new research illustrating the potential side effects from
long-term use of the medications, including weight gain, mood
changes, eye problems and bone problems, many parents and
physicians are looking at more natural ways to manage asthma in
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' said Dr. Jocelyn Celestin, head of the
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Center of Albany Medical Center.
``It's always better medicine if you know what the triggers are and
eliminate them.''
</P>
<P>
   With asthma now the leading cause of chronic illness in
children, affecting some 5 million, or one of every 14 children,
figuring out ways to manage the disease is more important than
ever, according to Dr. Kenneth Bock, a family practitioner in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Medical Association, the asthma rate
nearly tripled from 1980 to 1994 among those ages 5 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma is a condition that's growing in leaps and bounds,''
said Bock, who has seen that growth firsthand in the practice he
shares with his brother, Dr. Steven Bock.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions and concerns about the disease, the
brothers have written a new book, ``Natural Relief for Your Child's
Asthma'' (Harper Perennial, $13.95), to help parents figure out how
to minimize the use of medications by minimizing exposure to those
environmental factors, from dog hair to milk, that might prompt an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the difficulties posed by asthma, take a deep
breath. Now try to take another breath without letting the first
breath out. Try it again, and another time.
</P>
<P>
   If your chest is tight, and you feel like you're suffocating,
you're starting to experience what it's like to have an asthma
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cannot breath, nothing else matters,'' Celestin said.
</P>
<P>
   While Celestin and other doctors believe part of the increased
incidence of asthma is environmental, triggered by pollution and
other toxins, he is also researching, in conjunction with the New
York Department of Health, the genetic factors that might
predispose someone to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bock is focusing his work on helping parents manage their
children's symptoms. His book includes tips on diet, exercise,
nutritional supplements, homeopathic remedies and even how to plant
a ``sneezeless'' garden.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggests specific strategies to determine food and other
allergies, and gives some advice on breathing and relaxation
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   For Miranda and her daughter Alyssa, Bock's approach has meant
some radical adjustments, particularly in the family's diet. Yet
she says it's worth it to see her daughter healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too much work,'' she said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The recently opened Palomino Euro Bistro lures
diners with its explosion of flavors and colors and adds vibrancy
and stylish sophistication to the re-emerging Westwood Village
restaurant scene. With street-front views and floor-to-ceiling
windows, the casually elegant, spacious 245-seat restaurant and bar
are filled with hand-blown glass, Italian marble and rich woods.
The restaurant winds around the corner of the ground level in a
building at Glendon Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The first Palomino opened in Seattle in 1989. Westwood is the
12th and latest Palomino.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition kitchen in Westwood, including a 600-degree
hardwood-burning oven and a 6-foot-wide hardwood-fired spit
roaster, turns out rustic Mediterranean-inspired creations.
</P>
<P>
   Menu choices at both lunch and dinner range from soups and
salads to Roma-style pizzas, wood-fired oven and spit-roasted
specialties to pastas, plates of the house and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Food should be a feast for the senses _ and seduce you with
wonderful aromas, lure you in with beautiful color and live up to
the promises of multilayered flavors on the palate, noted chef
David Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my food to have depth. The different herbs, sun-dried
tomatoes, juicy meats all reveal their tastes one by one. Each
ingredient plays an important part and needs to be combined
carefully to highlight its attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The menu features seasonal fresh products and herbs along with
imports like Italian salami and sausages, Moroccan olives, Greek
feta cheese and Serrano ham.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signature Palomino dishes offered at all of the
restaurants' locations are Herb Crusted Dungeness Crab Dip,
Spit-Roasted Garlic Chicken, Hardwood Grilled Atlantic Salmon, Oven
Roasted Garlic Prawns, Roma-Style Cracker Thin Pizzas, Grilled
Chicken Breast With Apricot Cilantro Sauce, Chop Chop Salad and
Tomato-Feta Relish. Once you've sampled them, it's easy to
understand why diners return for more.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the delicious Herb Crusted Crab Dip and some other
tasty creations at the Palomino restaurant in San Francisco a
couple of years ago led to recent visits to the Westwood location
for some copycat sleuthing and sampling _ starting with the dip.
</P>
<P>
   We've replicated five creations _ with excellent results _
streamlining them so you can re-create them with ease in your own
kitchen. In a few instances, recipe ingredients in a dish were
verified with a little assistance from chef Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The sinfully rich Crab Dip is definitely not dieters' fare. Our
version is a breeze for home cooks to whip up with jarred
mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, onions and chopped artichoke hearts.
Although the restaurant uses Dungeness crab and we recommend it if
you can find it, we used frozen, thawed snow crab from the
supermarket fish counter. It was a good substitute. For
best-tasting results, avoid canned crab or fake crab.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned bread crumbs zipped up with dried herbs and more
Parmesan finishes the top before a quick bake in a very hot oven.
Serve the dip hot with thin baked pieces of herb-seasoned lavosh _
and you're in for a fabulous appetizer. The restaurant portion will
serve from two to four diners, but we based our recipe on half a
pound of crab, which will serve six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   Just after you sit down at the restaurant, a dynamite
Tomato-Feta Relish arrives at the table in a basket with slices of
rosemary bread. It's reminiscent of bruschetta, but the
tomato-olive oil mixture contains touches of crumbled feta cheese
and chopped Kalamata olives in addition to fresh basil and lots of
garlic. We were surprised to learn from Shaw that the recipe is
based on canned tomatoes rather than fresh, making the relish a
good candidate for serving year-round. You can make the relish a
few hours in advance and keep it stashed in the fridge until
serving time.
</P>
<P>
   The Chop Chop Salad makes a great casual main dish meal for
dinner or on a summer weekend afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To speed preparation, rely on pre-washed, pre-chopped lettuce
from the produce section _ and just chop more finely.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have to cut up provolone cheese, smoked turkey,
tomatoes, salami and fresh basil to combine with the lettuce and
some canned garbanzo beans _ but that is the most time-consuming
part and doesn't really take long if you're good at wielding a
chef's knife.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a batch of Balsamic Vinaigrette similar to the
Palomino's in a jiffy or use a prepared version from the store. To
simulate the egg used in the restaurant's version, we opted for a
little whipping cream, which does the trick and yields a
similar-tasting result. Toss the dressing with the salad mixture
just before serving to avoid a soggy salad, especially on a hot
day.
</P>
<P>
   For something novel and a little off the beaten path, give
Chicken Breasts with Apricot Cilantro Sauce a whirl. Skinless,
boneless chicken breasts are spread with a terrific combination of
Dijon mustard, olive oil and dried herbs, then refrigerated several
hours before grilling over hot coals or broiling in the oven until
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   The apricot-tomato sauce accompanying the chicken sounds a
little strange but is a creative melange of onions, garlic, ginger,
tomatoes, dried apricots, orange juice, cinnamon, coriander and
cloves cooked stove-top to marry the flavors. Freshly chopped
cilantro goes in at the end of the cooking time along with seasoned
salt to taste. Serve with cinnamon-flavored couscous as the
restaurant does, or try pilaf, basmati or white rice instead.
</P>
<P>
   During our first visit, the restaurant offered Cappuccino Crema
for dessert. It was a divine indulgence _ and a wonderful idea
served in a large, wide coffee cup, garnished with shaved chocolate
and poufs of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's been pulled from the menu, but that didn't
stop us from making a copycat version, which goes together without
a hassle. A mixture of mascarpone and cream cheeses is beaten with
powdered sugar, dissolved espresso coffee powder and vanilla until
smooth, and then whipped cream is folded in. After spooning into
cups and allowing it to set up a couple of hours in the
refrigerator, you simply drizzle with a prepared chocolate sauce
(Dove brand dark chocolate ice-cream topping worked well) mixed
with espresso powder before serving. Tasters were in ecstasy over
this simple but fabulous-flavored no-bake idea.
</P>
<P>
   Head to Palomino for some delicious, interesting dining, or try
these copycat renditions in your own kitchen. &QL;

STUDY SAYS QUITTING SNUFF HELPS AVERT CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For those thinking about giving up the smokeless
tobacco habit, here is some good news: An Air Force study says most
pre-cancerous changes in the mouth caused by snuff and chewing
tobacco disappear within weeks after quitting.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published this month in the Journal of the American
Dental Association, illustrates the importance of giving up
smokeless tobacco products before such lesions become cancerous,
said the lead author of the study, Lt. Col. Gary Chad Martin, a
dentist who studied basic military trainees at Lackland Air Force
Base in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this would have shown that there was a high occurrence
of pre-cancerous lesions and it would have scared the heck out of
everybody,'' Martin said. ``Instead, it showed how fortunate we are
that the body is able to heal itself. But it takes quitting before
the process starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have concluded that the risk of getting oral
cancer is up to four times greater for smokeless tobacco users than
non-users. The latest study demonstrated that such products,
especially snuff, are associated with pre-cancerous lesions in the
mouth lining known as leukoplakias.
</P>
<P>
   Leukoplakia is a disease characterized by white, leathery
patches on the tongue or gum. The patches can become irritated by
the tobacco juice.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he chose to study military trainees because they are
forbidden from using tobacco products during the six weeks of basic
training. The situation provided a controlled setting in which to
study the benefits of quitting smokeless tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of basic training, Martin performed oral
examinations on 3,051 male trainees at Lackland. About 10 percent _
or 302 trainees _ reported they were regular users of snuff or
chewing tobacco. Of those users, 119 had leukoplakia.
</P>
<P>
   Once training ended, these trainees were re-examined, with the
exception of 10 young men who previously had been discharged. Of
the 109 remaining, the lesions of 106 trainees had completely
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The three trainees whose lesions remained were evaluated further
and the patches were found to be benign, or not cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep stressing that there was clinical resolution
demonstrated here, which doesn't preclude the possibility that
these products could have done some residual damage at an even more
basic, DNA level,'' Martin cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have indicated that somewhere between 3 and 6
percent of oral leukoplakias go on to become cancerous, Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was a dental resident at the University of Texas
Health Science Center during the study, now is an assistant
professor at the Center for Oral Health Studies at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he's noticed an increasing trend of cigarette
smokers opting instead for smokeless products to try and cut their
habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, as we have deglamorized cigarette smoking,
people have switched over to snuff because it is more discreet,''
he said. ``But it carries some of the same health risks and can be
very damaging to the lining of the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Snuff and chewing tobacco can cause cancer and a number of
non-cancerous oral conditions. It can also lead to nicotine
addiction and dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's former professor, who contributed to the journal
article, said the study offers hope for young males who want to
quit smokeless tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This points to the value of stopping,'' said Dr. John Brown,
chairman of community dentistry at the University of Texas Health
Science Center. ``The earlier you stop, the better chance you have
to avoid the problems that can come along with it.''

JUMPING ON THE BANDWIDTH BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as Wall Street's bandwidth bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, few things are capturing the imagination of
investors like the companies that boost telecommunications
capacity. Among the darlings: companies focused on digital
subscriber lines, known as DSLs, which drastically increase the
speed of data traveling along the plain old copper wire Ma Bell
strung along America's roads ages ago.
</P>
<P>
   Affordability is a big advantage for DSL, especially among
businesses that want high-speed connections to the Internet.
Network Plus of Quincy, Mass., which connects customers on
networks, estimates that a business can get ``all you can eat'' DSL
service for about $650 a month. One alternative high-end service,
known as T-1, still offers more capacity but might cost three times
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   A few local stocks have already ridden the DSL wave. Aware Inc.
of Bedford, Mass., which licenses software to the manufacturers of
DSL equipment, has doubled in value this year and gained a stunning
465 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But a younger company in North Andover, Mass. may soon become an
even more interesting gauge of Wall Street's appetite for DSL
stocks, and another example of the seeming contradictions that go
along with high-tech investing.
</P>
<P>
   Interspeed Inc., which designs and manfactures the kind of
equipment that makes DSL work, registered in June for an initial
public stock offering to raise as much as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this day and age, Interspeed's business track record is
pretty skimpy for a company that wants to go public. Its products
became generally available just five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interspeed recorded revenues of $319,000 for the six-month
period ended March 31. One customer, Cabletron Systems Inc. of
Rochester, N.H., accounted for 79 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a sign of the times, says analyst Herbert Tinger of
First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``First earnings didn't matter, now revenues don't matter,''
said Tinger. ``Interspeed has essentially no revenues. It is going
out as a public venture capital deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Why go public so soon? Interspeed executives aren't permitted to
say much about their company now that their IPO is in registration.
Our first guess: Take a look at what happened to a few other recent
stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of California-based DSL equipment maker Copper Mountain
Networks Inc. went public at 21 barely two months ago, hit 107 last
week, and have since settled in at 97. Last week's initial public
offering of Florida-based Paradyne Networks Inc. went off at 17,
shot up to 58, and settled back to 40 5/8 by Tuesday. Tut Systems
Inc. of California went public in January and has more than doubled
in value.
</P>
<P>
   A hot market, the use of stock options as a standard employee
benefit at high-tech businesses, and the customer-level visibility
a public company gains are a hard combination to pass up. None of
that was lost on executives at Brooktrout Inc. in Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Brooktrout was a go-go technology stock in 1996, when it was
worth more than 40 per share. But it fell hard, losing more than
three-quarters of its value over the next year. Brooktrout shares
have only climbed back today to less than half its peak price,
valuing the company at about $186 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooktrout's stock market depths of 1997, it began to seed a
new venture that became Interspeed (total investment now in the $9
million range.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brooktrout still owns 99.7 percent of the company and
will likely own a significant majority of the stock, though the
percentage of Interspeed ownership to be offered in the IPO has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   As contradictory as it may seem, Brooktrout's continuing
investment in Interspeed could become worth millions more than the
parent company itself. It's not a certainty, but not out of the
question, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course not,'' said analyst B. Alex Henderson of
Prudential Securities. ``You can get to a valuation equal to or
greater than the entire valuation of Brooktrout if the (Interspeed)
offering goes well.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind those potentially lopsided valuations
probably had a lot to do with Brooktrout's decision to spin off
Interspeed rather than run it as a wholly owned business.
</P>
<P>
   First, a hot technology will never receive its highest stock
market reward if it is one unit mixed in with other types of
businesses. Pure plays win the richest valuations.
</P>
<P>
   But the tough road back for a small high-tech stock that hit the
skids is another market fact of life. Once that company loses its
following among investors, it's hard to win them back.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooktrout's case, it probably made more sense to establish a
brand new public stock that could be an untinged market darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have expressed their displeasure for a pretty long time
that Brooktrout's valuation was not reflecting the potential of
Interspeed,'' said Tinger. ``They saw (successful IPOs) like Tut
Systems and Copper Mountain. Now they feel Interspeed can exhibit
the same characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more evidence of Interspeed's business future would
help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock wants to merge its $708 million Special Equities
fund with its $722 million Small Cap Growth. Hancock says Special
Equities, once a star performer, and Small Cap Growth have similar
objectives and own many of the same stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which requires the approval of shareholders, was
announced as an effort to ``streamline'' the Hancock family and
lower expenses. The company said it didn't have plans to merge any
other funds.

WINGED VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ASTORIA, Ore. _ Not five minutes after paddling out onto the
waters of the Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge, I saw a
pair of bald eagles swooping in just over the tops of the coastal
pines. In the seconds that seem like an eternity when excited hands
fumble for binoculars, the two birds sliced into the stiffening
winds of late afternoon over the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I raised the binoculars to my eye, the eagles had
already caught a ride up nature's elevator. In that moment of
coming over the trees, the birds stopped the heart by arriving with
the wingspan of Wilt Chamberlain. Now they were mesmerizing for how
they soared, in the way of a child's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I was right underneath, and the circling gave little clue how
fast and how high they were going up. They shrank as if viewed
through a rapidly reversing zoom lens. First the white head and
white tail were lost in the glare of the sun. Then the breast
disappeared between the wings. Within mere minutes, the wings
themselves became a final black dot that, with the dropping of the
binoculars, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Had America not cared, that might have been a final flight. In
1782, when the bald eagle was chosen as the nation's symbol by the
Continental Congress, there were up to 500,000 of the birds in
North America. By the early 1960s there were only 417 breeding
pairs in the lower 48 states. That caused Rachel Carson to write in
her 1962 book ``Silent Spring'' that their disappearance might
``make it necessary for us to find a new national emblem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Carson made us care. In 1972, the federal
government banned the pesticide DDT, the poison that got into the
fish that the eagles ate, which then made eagle eggs too thin to
support chicks. Today there are 5,800 breeding pairs of bald eagles
in the lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   This month President Clinton announced plans to take the bird
off the endangered species list by next year. ``The American bald
eagle is now back from the brink of extinction, thriving in
virtually every state of the union,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was loudly seconded by leading environmentalists. Frank
Gill, director of science for the National Audubon Society, said
the comeback of the bald eagle is ``one of the biggest conservation
successes of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bean, chairman of the wildlife program for the
Environmental Defense Fund, said: ``This is a tremendous victory
for the bald eagle and for the Endangered Species Act. There is no
prouder symbol of our nation's commitment to preserving our natural
heritage than the eagle, and there's no greater tribute to the
Endangered Species Act than to allow its finest success story to
fly off the list, free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagle is free to remind us of the beauty we can behold and
hold on to when we choose to preserve a living resource. Last
summer, my wife and I kayaked on Lake Umbagog in New Hampshire to
view what was then the only nesting pair of bald eagles in the
state. This year, new eagle nests have been found in two other
spots of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A far larger recovery has occurred in Maine. In the DDT era,
Maine's eagle population dropped to 40 nesting pairs. Now there are
more than 200. Two decades ago, Maine was the only state in New
England with nesting bald eagles. Today, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, and Connecticut have nesting pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The job is hardly done. With ceaseless expansion of suburbs and
constant pressure to develop coastlines and riverways, there is
always the danger of reversal. Chris Martin, senior biologist for
the Audubon Society of New Hampshire said, ``This is the beginning
of the process, not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a grand beginning. On our paddle on the Columbia, two
immature eagles landed briefly on a tree. In the last minutes of
our tour, as if we were in a scripted safari, a mature eagle, with
white head, white tail, and golden beak contrasting with the deep
brown body, descended from the blue skies.
</P>
<P>
   This eagle was no tease, not like those first two that started
soaring before I could get a firm finger on the binoculars. This
eagle dropped down and landed on a tree over our heads. It perched,
30 feet above us, allowing us to gaze up for a good five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in Alaska a perching eagle can be casually acknowledged
as just another pigeon, but not down here, not just yet. Even our
guide, who was steeped in knowledge about the local coastal
environment, found it a moment of amazement _ to be actually
visited by an eagle as opposed to snatching a view of one while
kayaking around a corner.
</P>
<P>
   As we decided to turn and head for the dock, the eagle tweeted.
It flapped and unfurled its wings, obliterating the branch it stood
upon. It took off and alighted in the opposite direction of where
we were headed. Humans will never have the feeling of soaring on
their own power like the eagle. But the eagle, perhaps that very
eagle, is ascending today because we have the capacity to dream, to
soar above our destructive past.

RABBI STEPS INTO CONTROVERSY ON MESSIANIC JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Carol Harris-Shapiro knew she was treading in dangerous
territory when she decided to write a book. And the controversy
surrounding its recent release underscores the explosive nature of
her topic.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Shapiro's book, ``Messianic Judaism: A Rabbi's Journey
through Religious Change in America,'' chronicles the evolution of
a movement that has been roundly rejected by mainstream Jews.
Harris-Shapiro, a religion professor at Temple University, has been
criticized in the Jewish press for giving credibility to a group _
whose members say Jesus is the Jewish messiah _ that some religious
activists consider to be a cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the controversy comes from some of the
entrenched leadership of the American Jewish community that is very
worried about the fragmentation of American Jewish life,''
Harris-Shapiro said in an interview last week. ``I think they were
upset that someone was taking a serious look at the Jews for Jesus
and not saying that they are a terrible, brainwashing cult. They
are people whose claims we may be disagree with, but at least let's
try to understand where they're coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   For Messianic Jews, Jesus is the culmination of Old Testament
prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the earliest church, Jesus and the immediate
disciples were all born Jews,'' Harris-Shapiro said. ``There's no
reason to assume they were nothing but practicing Jews.
Christianity was a Jewish sect for the first 30 years of the
movement. According to Messianic Jewish understanding, if you want
to be the best Christian, you have to imitate what Jesus did. He
spoke Hebrew and went to synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But traditional Judaism considers a Christian Jew to be a
theological impossibility, since a Jew is expected to worship one
God. Also, worshiping Jesus conflicts with Judaism's view of
monotheism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Jews accuse Messianic Jews of using agressive
means to try and win converts, particularly on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus members do not shy away from these charges. They
refer to their gospel tracts as ``broadsides.'' And one of the
mission statements makes their goal quite clear: ``Jews for Jesus
exists to make the Messiahship of Jesus an unavoidable issue to our
people worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Messianic Jews say they have 100,000 followers in the United
States, but Harris-Shapiro says the figure is closer to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Shapiro said she had been interested in Messianic Jews
since she was a girl and an older cousin became involved in
Messianic Judaism. ``She tried to convert me when I was only 8,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   With her book generating intense reaction, Harris-Shapiro has
given many lectures before Jewish groups and has tried to defuse
preconceptions about what she set out to do. ``I'm not making any
claims that Messianic Jews are genuine Jews,'' she says. ``One
thing I do raise is how can we make a claim regarding whether a Jew
is a genuine Jew?''

   --The Roman Catholic priest of the 21st century must live in
``simplicity and poverty'' and be a model of ``sobriety and
temperance,'' according to clerical advice recently published by
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect priest also wears clerical clothes, uses ``correct
and elegant language,'' avoids politics, and reads good literature
that he downloads from a Vatican Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The advice was featured in a letter to priests from the Vatican

   --Fueled by increasing anti-Semitism and a worsening Russian
economy, Jewish emigration from Russia to Israel jumped 129 percent
during the first six months of this year. During the period, more
than 12,000 Russian Jews moved to Israel, according to the Jewish
Agency, which assists with resettlements.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually as many as 30,000 Russian Jews could move to Israel
during 1999, compared to 14,000 last year, according to the agency.

LATE CALL TO HALL FOR SELEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RICHARDSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Since 1901, Boston's major league teams have won 12
pennants, an average of one every 12 years when allowing for the
fact the city had two teams until 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Over that span, 46 men have managed the Red Sox or the Braves at
least a full season, 13 of them eventually elected to the Hall of
Fame. That baker's dozen _ nine of whom were enshrined at least in
part for their managerial accomplishments _ produced just four
pennants.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that lackluster history with the record of Frank Selee,
who from 1890 to 1901 led Boston's National League entry to five
pennants in 12 seasons and finished as low as fifth only three
times, including his first and last campaigns. His winning
percentage was .607.
</P>
<P>
   Selee (pronounced SEE-lee) then took the reins of the Chicago
Cubs, who improved from sixth place to second under his tutelage
before tuberculosis forced him to give way to Frank Chance midway
through the 1905 season. Under Chance, the Cubs won 116 games the
following year and four pennants over the next five seasons, a
dynasty essentially built by Selee.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 90 years after his death at 49, Selee at last will be
recognized for his brief but remarkable career via induction into
the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Why the long delay in enshrining the manager whose .598 career
winning percentage is the fourth best of all time? Besides the fact
his illness removed him from the scene too soon, Selee simply
lacked the flash for which baseball in the Gay Nineties is
remembered. In addition, his proteges fizzled as managers, unlike
those of rival Ned Hanlon, whose teams won the five pennants Boston
did not from 1891 to 1900. Hanlon's fiery lieutenants, Wilbert
Robinson, Hughie Jennings, and John McGraw, came to personify
19th-century baseball and were inducted into the Hall long ago.
Hanlon joined them in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The disparate managerial styles of Selee and Hanlon illustrate
baseball's turmoil in the 1890s as the game evolved into the sport
we know today. Hanlon's Baltimore Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas
were brash, intimidating, and willing to bend the rules to win.
Selee matched their success with a more gentlemanly approach, a
throwback to the 1870s and '80s teams of Harry Wright, the only man
to bring Boston more titles (six) than Selee.
</P>
<P>
   But Selee did not take a backseat to Hanlon strategically. ``He
believed in place-hitting, sacrifice-hitting, and stealing bases,''
recalled longtime second baseman Bobby Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century manager's job differed from that of his modern
counterpart, incorporating many of the duties of today's general
manager and traveling secretary and ceding much of the on-field
decisions to the playing captain.
</P>
<P>
   Selee was not a taskmaster. ``He didn't bother with a lot of
signals,'' Lowe remembered. ``He let his players figure out their
own plays and he didn't blame them if they took a chance that
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Jimy Williams would be comfortable with Selee's
managerial philosophy. ``If I make things pleasant for the players,
they reciprocate,'' Selee said. ``I do not want a man who cannot
appreciate such treatment. I want them to be temperate and live
properly. I do not believe that men who are engaged in such
exhilarating exercise should be kept in straitjackets all the time,
but I expect them to be in condition to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Selee was a keen judge of talent and was particularly adept at
developing young players _ keys to success in the days before teams
had farm systems. Hall of Famers Kid Nichols, Hugh Duffy, Tommy
McCarthy, Vic Willis, Jimmy Collins, Johnny Evers, and Joe Tinker
all became stars under his tutelage, and Selee converted Fred
Tenney and Frank Chance from mediocre catchers into two of the best
first basemen the game has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Amherst, N.Y., Selee, son of a minister, grew up in
Melrose, where he played for the amateur Alphas. In 1884, he
graduated to the semipro Mass. State Association, managing first
Waltham, then Lawrence. The following season, Selee advanced to the
Eastern New England League, the first minor league in this region.
He began as an umpire and took over as manager of the Haverhill
club in midseason, piloting the team to a strong third-place
finish. He was released midway through the 1886 season, not because
of his team's poor play but to save the salary of a nonplaying
manager, a luxury in the 1880s. So Selee went west, guiding
Oshkosh, Wis., to the Northwestern League pennant in 1887, then
moving on to Omaha, where he captured the Western Association
championship in 1889 before Boston beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited an awkward situation. The first players' union
formed its own league in 1890, and most of the Boston team defected
to the Brotherhood or Players' League. Selee seized the opportunity
by bringing Nichols with him from Omaha and persuading his new
bosses to sign Lowe and shortstop Herman Long, who became the
double-play combination for all five of Selee's Boston pennant
winners. Fortified by the return of the Brotherhood boys, Boston
won the first of those pennants in 1891. After three years of
retooling, Selee brought Boston two more titles in 1897 and '98. An
aging team and defections to the nascent American League brought
Selee's Boston tenure to an end after the 1901 season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Carlton Fisk just missed joining George Brett, Nolan
Ryan, Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda, Nestor Chylak, and Smoky Joe
Williams in Sunday's Cooperstown class of 1999, New England has
reason to cheer. Boston's most successful manager in more than a
century is finally getting his just reward.

US TEAM IS A REAL DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ They do the same things their predecessors did, which
is the unspoken mandate for any NBA team in international
competition: win and win big. Beyond that, there is little to bind
this year's qualifying team _ also known as next year's Olympic
Team _ to any of the three that preceded it. This one differs in
style, manner, and composition.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever duplicate the 1992 Olympic squad, the one and
only Dream Team. (Maybe this team, given its youth and energy,
should be called the Power Nap Team.) No one wants to duplicate the
1994 world championship team, outfitted with sociopaths who,
surprise, behaved like sociopaths. The 1996 Olympic Team had a
``been there/done that'' feeling, a spillover of sorts from 1992
(five members had also been on that team).
</P>
<P>
   This team is its own. For marquee power, there are no Hall of
Famers, at least not yet. There are Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan,
born 24 days apart only 23 years ago. For veteran leadership, there
are Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway, who between them have 19 years in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 12 players are making their first Olympic or
pre-Olympic appearance for the United States. These guys want to be
here, and they have an appreciation for the whole enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you appreciate the game more,'' said Allan Houston.
``People all over the world recognize you and appreciate what
you've done. Sometimes, in the NBA, we get caught up with ourselves
and get spoiled and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   This team almost looks as though Miss Manners had a hand in the
selection process. For shooting guards, there's Houston and Steve
Smith, neither of whom has made an All-NBA team. (Houston didn't
even get a vote this season.) They just happen to be excellent
players and upstanding gents. The only center is Duncan, whose
demeanor merely should be copied by every single basketball player
on the planet. The coach is Larry Brown, who sometimes talks as if
he were still in Kansas, figuratively and literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're with a group of guys that want to play the right way,
and it's been a real pleasure to be a part of it,'' Brown said.
``We wanted to have people appreciate the way we play. I've had
four or five (tournament) officials come up to me and tell me how
much they enjoyed our effort and the way we've played. A lot of the
referees have even said that this is a great group to watch because
they play so hard and try to defend. It's nice to hear people say
that. It's good for our league.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are soaking in everything; the competition, the
attention, and, of course, the golf and the casino. This will be
the group that goes to the Sydney Olympics and, possibly, beyond.
So far, they have been nothing but gentlemen. They may be testing
the limits of the Good Neighbor Policy with dominating wins over
our hemispheric friends, but they haven't rubbed it in, shown off,
or trash-talked. They have obligingly posed for pictures with
opponents and signed autographs for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the free throw line, and a guy asked me to take his
picture (with him) after the game,'' Garnett said. ``I said I'd
speak to the White House. He kept asking, and I finally said,
`Sure. I can't believe you asked me this during competition, but,
yeah, sure.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda weird. We're out there, in our zone, and someone
asks for an autograph or a picture. It's weird. But we're not doing
anything degrading our country or our families or ourselves. We're
just having a lot of fun. We know everyone here wants to come out
and beat us. That's cool. We set the tone early, blow the game
open. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, one of the many NBA execs who also works with USA
Basketball, said this team was chosen for its ability and its
gentility. He remembered the backlash surrounding the 1994 team,
featuring Larry Johnson, Derrick Coleman, and Shawn Kemp, none of
whom ever have to worry about being invited back. He also knew that
the US had to look ahead, rather than behind, and start promoting
its stars of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win. We want to have great players. We want to have
people who represent USA Basketball and the country the way you'd
like to be represented. That's our charge,'' Thorn said.
``Sometimes, we've done a better job of selecting teams that did a
better job along those lines. With this particular team, we not
only have a great team, in terms of playing together, interaction,
and how they get along, but they also are terrific people. We're
very happy with this particular team. It's a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that goes to Sydney next year will also be very good
but will only include NBA players. The three soon-to-be-rookies on
this team, Elton Brand, Wally Szczerbiak, and Richard Hamilton,
won't be going. (Hamilton, the poor soul, may not even get a chance
to play here because of a bad ankle sprain.) The final three
players will be announced in February and will join this group,
which already is bonding on and off the floor. You can assume
Latrell Sprewell and J.R. Rider won't be getting anything in the
mail. Neither will Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all these guys come back,'' Payton said. ``It's a great
group of guys, and we're jelling now. It's good. There are a lot of
young guys to help us old guys when we have to play eight games in
eight days. These guys have legs. They're more energetic. We're not
showing off. We're having fun. That's what Coach told us to do _
have fun and make it fun.''

JFK JR. KEPT HIS CHARITABLE WORK PRIVATE, HELPED THOUSANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody knew he rode his bike through the streets
of Manhattan, played softball and Frisbee in Central Park, and made
grand entrances at black-tie galas.
</P>
<P>
   But John F. Kennedy Jr. also worked _ quietly but very
intensively, his associates say _ with several charity groups that
have donated millions of dollars and helped thousands of people in
the city he made his own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the year People magazine declared him ``the sexiest man
alive,'' Kennedy formed Reaching Up, an organization to improve
care for the mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he joined the board of the Robin Hood
Foundation, a group started by Wall Street millionaires that gives
more than $1 million a month to programs to help the city's
impoverished children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no resume-builder for him,'' Peter Kiernan III, Robin
Hood's chairman, as well as a managing director at the Goldman
Sachs investment house, said Tuesday. ``This was not a subtle,
slight involvement. He was very engaged. He was a full partner.
Quite often, he kept us focused on our mission when we started to
drift away.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the group's causes, including a school in Harlem,
Kennedy was the one who initiated the contact and encouraged the
board to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to every board meeting, went to look at every place we
invested in,'' Kiernan said. ``When we went to a school, he'd talk
with the strategic-planning people, and John was very good at that.
But he'd also plunge right in there with the schoolchildren. `Hey,
kids, what's going on.' He'd get into conversations with them. . .
. We lost a great guy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Up grew out of the Kennedy family's longstanding
charity work with the mentally retarded, which began as a memorial
to his father's sister, Rosemarie, who spent much of her life in a
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``John spent about a year investigating how to get involved in
this,'' said Bill Ebenstein, the executive director of Reaching Up.
``And he realized the best way to support people with disabilities
was to support the workers who provided services for them, by
creating a program for them in higher education and helping them
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anselm, now the director of an adult day-care program
for United Cerebal Palsy in Brooklyn, was a caseworker and advocate
for the handicapped in 1991, when Kennedy awarded her a stipend,
one of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me pay the tuition so I could go to classes at
night,'' Anselm recalled. ``I met John Kennedy. He told me he had
selected my application himself. It was nice to know _ it
encouraged me to know _ that people of that stature were supporting
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Reaching Up, Ebenstein said, people like Anselm had few
professional prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people with low-wage jobs, poverty jobs really,''
he said. ``There was no career ladder. Politicians were talking
then about `quality health care,' but John realized you could never
build a quality system of services unless you had quality jobs for
the front-line workers.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Kennedy funded _ and persuaded professionals in a variety of
fields to develop _ a series of courses on disabilities at the City
University of New York, especially its East Side Manhattan branch
at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd bring public and private entities together to work out
how to do this: city and state agencies, the public universities,
the hospital workers unions,'' Ebenstein said. ``He could hold a
coalition like this together. He led these meetings, visited all
the places, knew all the executive directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebenstein is unsure whether the organization can continue
without Kennedy. ``Keeping these entities together _ you've got all
this infighting and politics _ you need someone who can transcend
that,'' he said. ``I'm hoping we can keep doing it, but I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since it began, Reaching Up has awarded stipends
to 400 Kennedy Fellows, 90 percent of whom have stayed in the field
of helping the disabled. Ebenstein estimated that an additional
1,000 students have taken college courses that the organization has
created.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy played down his involvement in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   David Saltzman, who is executive director of the Robin Hood
Foundation and went to Brown University with Kennedy in the 1980s,
declined to talk, in any specifics, about his role in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend of mine,'' Saltzman said. ``He asked me to
respect his privacy, and I'm going to continue doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebenstein made the same point: ``He did not seek publicity. We'd
win an award, and I'd say, `Can't we put out a news release?' He'd
say, `No.' He feared people would just focus on him and miss the
substance of what he was doing.''

KAREN SMYERS WILL NEVER STOP TRYING

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ When the call came, Michael King was feeding
the baby and couldn't get to the phone before the answering machine
kicked in. What he heard next was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, pick up the phone! Michael, are you there? Oh, Karen,
don't move. Karen, don't . . . oh my god. Michael, are you there?
All right, I'll have to call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   King knew the voice belonged to the training partner of his
wife, world-class triathlete Karen Smyers. He knew the two had been
planning a three-hour bike ride, followed by a 90-minute run, and,
since she was being warned not to move, he knew she must be alive.
But, for another three-quarters of an hour last Aug. 12, he didn't
know much else.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned to the only thing he had: the tape. ``I must have
played it 100 times, trying to find out exactly what he said,''
King recalled last week. ``It was a pretty intense 45 minutes.
Every scenario goes through your head.''
</P>
<P>
   What he finally learned was that Smyers, cycling at 35 miles per
hour down a long hill on Route 27 leading out of Sudbury toward
Wayland, had been sideswiped by an 18-wheel truck. Knocked from her
bike, the winner of the 1995 Ironman Triathlon World Championship
in Hawaii sustained some nasty injuries: six broken ribs, a
third-degree shoulder separation and a lung contusion. The driver,
who did not stop and denies knowing she had been struck, was not
charged.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Smyers found reason to flash her familiar loopy grin
last week, distracted from anything but the bright side by
14-month-old Jenna's antics as she ricocheted, giggling, and
smeared with peanut butter, from kitchen to living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing triathlons for 15 years and I've never so much
as fallen off my bike,'' said Smyers. ``I kept thinking, oh well,
at least it's ribs. They heal on their own and they'll be 100
percent when they're done. I'd rather deal with that for three
weeks than something that's going to take six months to rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyers resumed competition this spring, winning her comeback
triathlon in April to lock up a spot on the US team that will
compete Saturday on the opening day of the Pan American Games. In
Winnipeg, she will try to defend her 1995 title, which came the
same year she won the Hawaii Ironman and the short-course World
Championship to be named Triathlon Magazine's Triathlete of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's ready. But coming on the heels of a 1997
household accident in which a falling storm window slashed her
hamstring, followed by pregnancy and the birth of her first child,
Jenna, on May 1, 1998, the bike crash means the 37-year-old Smyers
has been essentially sidelined for two years at a time when she was
at the pinnacle of her sport.
</P>
<P>
   That's long enough for demons to sneak up on even the most
affable athlete; long enough for the sight of a starting line to
provoke fear; long enough to wonder whether the sport has passed
you by while you sat with the cast on your leg, then the baby on
your shoulder, then the sling on your arm. Only a good race will
put things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very nervous,'' Smyers said of that April race in
Tampa. ``A lot of doubts had crept into my mind. You get so wound
up not being able to be out there competing. Having this enforced
layoff, all of a sudden (I realized), `Geez, I'm 37 years old and
some of the kids in this sport are 22, 23. What am I doing here?
What if I'm no longer in their league?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A victory that day and four top-five finishes since then going
into Saturday's event have quelled any inner turmoil. ``Knowing
I've at least proven I'm capable of winning races again, that's
enough for me,'' said Smyers.
</P>
<P>
   And no surprise to those who know her. ``She's so positive,''
said Maryellen Powers of Dover, N.H., a top triathlete and Pan Am
alternate who took up the sport after watching Smyers win an event
outright in Cambridge 10 years ago. ``She just generally has a
positive outlook on everything. It's just another challenge. It's
kind of exciting to see if you can do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   King, a producer of independent films who works at home,
confirms that Smyers had a good attitude through it all. ``There
was never really any frustration,'' he said. ``It was just, OK,
after it heals we'll get going.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncanny sequence of events began in June 1997, when Smyers _
the day before she was to leave for a major international
competition _ decided to finally take down the storm windows. She
dropped one, slashing her left hamstring. Instead of waking up in
Monte Carlo, she woke up in a full leg cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it totally in stride,'' she said. ``I felt I'd had a
charmed career up to that point. I'd never really been out of
competition for any problem whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the lengthy recovery would make it an ideal time to
start a family, something Smyers and King had been talking about
for a long time. ``It's very hard when you feel you're in the best
shape of your life to voluntarily take time off and put on 25 or 30
pounds and completely change your body and not know if it's going
to come back the way it was,'' she said. ``It's hard to ever take a
break, because it definitely is not going to last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyers got pregnant almost immediately, and rehabbed the
hamstring as her stomach expanded. Within weeks of Jenna's birth
and despite a Cesearan section, Smyers was fit enough to win the
Danskin Women's Triathlon in Wrentham two months later. Then came
the 1998 Goodwill Games in August, where she finished a
disappointing 22d.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every reason not to be competitive at the Goodwill
Games,'' said Smyers, who was still nursing at the time, ``but even
so I went there thinking I could probably rise to the occasion and
at least not embarrass myself. Yet, I felt like I had embarrassed
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The miscalculation gave Smyers the first reason to doubt her
intuition. There was no time to erase those doubts with another,
more successful race before she was hit by the truck a few weeks
later, on a stretch of road she added only because she had finished
her planned loop 15 minutes early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned right where we usually turn left,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Smyers believes she is finally back on track, heading
toward both a return to the Ironman this October after a two-year
absence and triathlon's Olympic debut in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she never thought she'd make it (to see triathlon in
the Olympics). `I'm going to be too old,' '' said Powers. ``But
when she had her accident and had to take two years off, it was
like unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no talk of retirement. After this year's Hawaii
Ironman (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, 26.2-mile run), Smyers will
buckle down to train for the far-shorter but faster Olympic trials
(.93-mile swim, 24.8-mile bike, 6.2-mile run _ same as Pan Am). If
she doesn't make the Olympic team, it will be back to Ironman in
2000. After that, it will be time to take stock.
</P>
<P>
   But Smyers is already offering a hint: ``At this point, I've
invested a lot just getting back to this level, so I want to reap
the benefits of it,'' she said. ``I think the only thing that would
make me take a break would be giving Jenna a little brother or
sister.''

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SIGHTSEEING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed how no one is a tourist anymore? Suddenly,
everyone's a ``traveler.'' And not just any old traveler, but an
``insider'' traveler at that, veering ``off the beaten path'' to
reconnoiter exotic new destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is most noticeable in guidebooks, the mirror that
tourism holds up to itself. In the 19th century, genteel travelers
embarked on the European Grand Tour armed with a memoir written by
a man or woman of commensurate breeding. The 20th century has
witnessed a long procession from the elegantly written prewar (that
would be World War I) Baedecker's through the coltish ``Let's Go!''
guides of the '60s generation. The '80s brought us the cool,
analytical, and generally impractical ``Access'' and ``Eyewitness''
guides, and my personal favorites, the hippy-dippy ``Lonely
Planet'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fueled by the success of the New York Times' snobbish
Sophisticated Traveler magazine and by rampant Merchant-Ivory-dom _
in the decade following ``Room With a View,'' was there any fat-cat
suburbanite who didn't rent a villa in Tuscany? _ no one carries a
guide that might tell you what day the museums are closed. How . .
. pedestrian! Fodor's new ``upCLOSE guides'' purport to ``point the
way to authentic experiences that will take travelers away from the
crowds and close to the culture.'' ``The Insiders' Guide'' series,
not to be confused with ``The Hip Insider's Edge Guides,'' ``help
you make the transition from tourist to adventurer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``Rough Guides,'' and also ``Massachusetts
(and everywhere else) Off the Beaten Path.'' Rick Steves has a
series ``Europe (and other places) Through the Back Door'' that
urges readers to ``get off the beaten path with Rick's
recommendations for Europe.'' (``As Seen on PBS!'' Natch.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I wanted to join the crowd forming on the path less
traveled. So I recently test-drove two nouveau guide books and
herewith report on the results.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I frequent-flew off to Quebec City, with
Katharine and Eric Fletcher's ``Quebec off the Beaten Path'' in
hand. Quebec is gorgeous, and of no small historical interest
because if events had unfolded differently on the Plains of Abraham
in 1759, I might be writing this column in French. The Fletcher
guidebook has some lovely asides, not the least being that the
Canadian national anthem, ``O, Canada'' (not to be confused with
the splendid, jettisoned ``Maple Leaf Forever''), was first sung in
French in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to insider tidbits, ``Off the Beaten Path''
disappointed. How could it not mention, for instance, that one of
the two French ``victories'' consecrated by the Notre Dame des
Victoires church was in fact a storm that blew away a menacing
British fleet? And how could it ignore the story of St. Genevieve's
``little bread''? Quebecois parishioners offer the dollhouse-size
loaves to strangers in memory of the saint who fed Paris during the
famine of 451. I took two of the tiny loaves home with me, and, as
promised, I haven't gone hungry since.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, I tried out the recently updated ``Insiders'
Guide to Cape Cod, Nantucket &AMP; Martha's Vineyard.'' The 30-odd
pages devoted to Nantucket are informative, but not what I would
call insider stuff. No mention of SUV gridlock at island
intersections, nor of the vulgarian who's building some modern
monstrosity that threatens to block Chad Gifford's view.
</P>
<P>
   I dragged the guide with me to Provincetown earlier this week,
and hardly felt like an insider at all. The cool crowd knows that
the Provincetown bookshop has been there since 1932, not 1964, as
the guide reports. And how come no mention of the Portuguese bakery
on Commercial Street? Those delicious malassadas _ an exotic name
for sugared, fried dough patties _ are going on my expense account!
</P>
<P>
   Final thought on this subject: Thank God for the Japanese.
Without them, who would be left to walk the Freedom Trail, and
photograph the Eiffel Tower?

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of the Kennedy School's ever-proper Institute of
Politics, it could have been an embarrassing moment. The journalist
Florence Graves was talking about her work in breaking the Packwood
story, and when she got to the part where she said Senator Bob
Packwood had reached under a female employee's skirt to grab her
girdle, two Harvard freshmen in the front looked blank.
</P>
<P>
   So Graves went over to the two young men and gently explained to
them what a girdle was. ``She did it in such a demure, almost
puritanical way,'' recalls Michael Gartner, the former NBC News
president and institute fellow who had invited Graves to talk to
his study group. ``It was done with charm.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't let that charm fool you, as it may have Packwood, Alan
Simpson, and Ken Starr, to name a few of the power brokers scorched
by Graves's reporting. Underneath the charming Southern accent and
approachable demeanor beats the heart of an investigative tiger who
broke one of the biggest political stories of the '90s and
continues to best the Washington, D.C., media at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people who have been covered by Florence
misunderstood who she is,'' says Fred Wertheimer, who worked with
Graves when he was president of Common Cause and she was editor of
its award-winning national magazine. ``Yes, she is genteel. But she
is also an old-fashioned reporter in the best sense of the word.
She is relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves lives in Needham, a suburb of Boston, in a charming
Victorian house that has gingerbread trim and white wicker
furniture. But she reports on the Washington power scene with
tough-minded acuity.
</P>
<P>
   When Graves was editor of Common Cause magazine in the early
'80s, her reporting on financial abuses by Pentagon contractors
prompted congressional reforms. In 1992, she broke the story of
Packwood's abusive behavior toward women for The Washington Post,
which set off a chain reaction leading to the Oregon senator's
ouster. More recently, she raised alarms about independent counsel
Starr's subpoenas to journalists in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest project, published in May, was an opus in The Nation
about Kathleen Willey, whose sexual accusations against President
Clinton not only kept the Paula Jones case alive, but ultimately
led to the discovery of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   In her 20-page piece for The Nation, Graves tore into Willey's
credibility, arguing that the onetime flight attendant turned
Democratic fund-raiser was excited to be involved with the
president and welcomed his Oval Office advances. Graves also argued
that Starr thought Willey was lying but gave her immunity anyway,
instead indicting Julie Hiatt Steele, who had testified that Willey
was not telling the truth about her encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after her piece appeared, jurors in the trial against
Steele deadlocked, causing a federal judge to declare a mistrial.
The jurors were banned from reading news accounts, such as Graves's
article, but Nancy Luque, Steele's attorney, believes that Graves's
reporting did affect the trial. In her four-month investigation,
Luque says, Graves uncovered evidence that Willey had lied to
Starr's office about having a fling with a soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resulted in us being able to impeach Kathleen Willey's
credibility,'' says Luque in a telephone interview from Washington.
``Florence Graves is the only reporter who really dug into the
Willey story, and I admire her greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As she opens the door to her home, Graves, 53, looks like
anything but a tough investigative reporter. She is tall and
elegantly dressed, with teased blond hair and big blue eyes. The
decor only amplifies the Southern-belle impression. Large
impressionistic paintings in ornate frames adorn the living room,
and a profusion of flowers blooms in the kitchen, competing for
attention with the Chinese blue ceramic dishes mounted on the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Only a visit to Graves's office, which is knee-deep in papers,
documents, and barking terriers, gives one the sense that this is
the same woman who helped hand Starr his hat on his only indictment
in the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the Kathleen Willey room,'' Graves says, giggling.
``Do you know that Ken Starr considered Julie Hiatt Steele so
important that he had an entire room devoted to this woman who was
a seemingly minor player in the scandal? He so desperately wanted
to be able to use Kathleen Willey to get Clinton that he was
willing to ruin Julie Steele's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves rubs her chin thoughtfully. ``I think that's one of the
things that attracted me to the story,'' she says. ``I think a lot
of my work has focused on abuses of power. Just like I saw
Packwood's extraordinary behavior with women as a major abuse of
power, I saw Ken Starr's pursuit of Julie Steele the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists familiar with Graves often use the same words and
phrases in describing her: fearless, principled, someone who
doesn't run with the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that to do what she does as a freelance
investigative reporter, you have to be three times as good as
someone on staff,'' says Gartner, who is now editor at The Tribune
in Ames, Iowa. ``To overcome the hurdle of being an outsider, you
have to be spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Graves's cross hairs, of course, may have quite a
different view of her. But none of them (including Starr, Willey,
and Simpson, the last of whom Graves roasted in an article on
Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation) returned phone calls
for this story.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group,
is not quite so recalcitrant, however.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I read'' her piece in The Nation ``all the way
through,'' says Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the
center. ``But I'm familiar with The Nation's tub thumping for
Clinton. Throughout all this they have been attacking Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she looks like someone who has an agenda,'' he adds.
And the agenda is? Graham thinks a minute. ``To hurt Republicans
and help Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who's also a fellow at Radcliffe's Public Policy
Institute and a resident scholar at Brandeis University, laughs
gaily when told of Graham's comment. ``At Common Cause, I did
stories that nailed a number of Democrats on campaign finance and
ethics issues,'' she says. ``And I've written about Brock Adams,
who was a Democrat.'' (Adams, a US senator from Washington state,
resigned in 1992 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.)
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post's media reporter, has worked
with Graves and says, ``There's sometimes grumbling that Florence
might have something of a feminist agenda. But anyone who works
with her will see that whatever her personal feelings, she's really
interested in nailing down the facts.''

   Kurtz says Graves ``sinks her teeth into somebody's leg and
doesn't let go. She has a great passion about the mission she's on
and the stories she's pursuing in a way that makes her stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves makes an unlikely Nelly Bly. The daughter of a real
estate investor and a homemaker, Graves grew up comfortable in
Waco, Texas, when football was king and marrying a Catholic was
treated ``as if there was a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   But as one of five siblings, Graves remembers, she was the child
who was always asking why. ``In the 1950s in Texas there were
drinking fountains for whites and coloreds, and I can remember as a
child asking why that was so,'' Graves says. ``I never got an
answer _ there were no good answers _ but I was profoundly affected
by the disparities I saw between blacks and whites and rich and
poor and, in that sense, I think living in Texas was a defining
experience for me.''

   She married her college sweetheart and collected a master's

prevailing wisdom in politics and journalism.

   She worked for the Washington Journalism Review (now the
American Journalism Review) and freelanced. On becoming editor of
Common Cause magazine, she, along with her staff, began
investigating stories that the mainstream press was missing, about
fraud at the Pentagon, and the Food and Drug Administration's
lackadaisical vetting of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Graves says the mainstream press wasn't writing about sexual
harassment on Capitol Hill because that wasn't considered a story.
``Look at Packwood. Journalists knew what he was doing, but there
was a shared narrative that this is what powerful men do,'' she
says. ``That longstanding view wasn't challenged until the Anita
Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings,'' which resulted in Thomas's
confirmation to the high court on a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Graves had left Common Cause to move with her husband,
Sam Graves, to the Boston area, where he had accepted a job as
professor in the School of Management at Boston College. After a
short-lived stint as editor of New Age Journal _ a mismatch of her
investigative skills and the magazine's lighter purpose, according
to one former employee _ Graves returned her attention to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the (Thomas) hearings, I kept waiting for the major
newspapers to follow up on the story, but the pack moved on,''
Graves says. ``It's funny. People have this perception that these
large newspapers have all these resources in the world and that if
there's a story to be done they'd be doing them. And that's just
not true. The reality is that most news organizations are not
devoting huge resources to investigative reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   So at the behest of Tina Brown, then editor of Vanity Fair,
Graves began looking at the intersection of politics and sex, and
Packwood's name came up, again and again. But Graves says Vanity
Fair canceled the assignment when she refused to sign the
magazine's standard contract holding it legally harmless for
anything she had written.
</P>
<P>
   ``It essentially said I promised there would be no legal action
as a result of my work, and I said I can't sign that,'' Graves
says. ``Their view was, `We're Vanity Fair and if you don't sign
it, forget it.' '' A Vanity Fair spokesperson agrees with her
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad time for Graves, who as a freelancer is dependent
on selling her work to publications that often don't pay enough to
cover the great amount of time she puts into her pieces. (She tries
to make up that difference by obtaining grants from foundations
like the Fund for Investigative Journalism and by getting
fellowships. She is a past recipient of the Alicia Patterson
Journalism Fellowship.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Packwood story, ``I would wake up screaming: `I have
this great story, why can't I work on it!' '' she recalls. ``One
month I had a $400 phone bill, which wakes you up. I went to talk
to other news organizations _ I'd rather not say who they are _ and
no one was interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Graves approached The Washington Post, which agreed to
team up with her to do the story. The Packwood series ran in
November 1992, prompting the congressional hearings that led to the
senator's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her work on this and other stories, Graves is not a
household name inside or outside the Beltway. Even many journalists
don't know who she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her name didn't resonate with the Packwood story, while
(Newsweek reporter) Michael Isikoff's name so resonated with Monica
Lewinsky,'' muses Emily Rooney, who as host of WGBH-TV's ``Greater
Boston'' has hosted Graves on her show as a commentator. ``She
reminds me in a way of Doris Kearns Goodwin. She has this great
intellect, yet she's so down to earth. I feel she deserves more
attention than she's gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting demurely, legs crossed, on a high-legged kitchen chair,
Graves doesn't appear bothered by the lack of name recognition,
which she attributes to the facts that she works by herself and
doesn't live in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people I can see much more clearly from Boston,'' she
says. And then she smiles, and that smile is anything but sweet.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the cancer recoveries that Dr. Robert Amato has seen,
few have surprised and impressed him more than that of a
50-year-old man who was successfully treated for kidney cancer,
only to see tumors spread to his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, an oncologist and clinical investigator at the University
of Texas's MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, gave the man eight
weekly injections of an experimental cancer vaccine that was made,
in part, from the patient's own cancer cells by Antigenics LLC, a
5-year-old biotechnology company in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the last injection, the tumors in his lungs began to
disappear, leaving just scars, which surgery subsequently removed.
Today, 17 months after his first inoculation, the man is still
cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of our first patients tested . . . and his tumors
were gone,'' Amato told Antigenics officials, cancer researchers,
and investment bankers last month at the opening of the privately
held company's new $5.5 million biomanufacturing and research
facility in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's patient was among 38 who suffered a kidney cancer
relapse and participated in Antigenics' phase 1 safety trial to
test its custom-made vaccines using three different doses. Five
patients have remained cancer-free and four have experienced
partial recoveries, prompting the company to progress to a phase 2
trial that will use a single dose of the vaccines to more carefully
measure recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The nine patients are part of a recent wave of promising
clinical results for treating certain cancers using experimental _
and controversial _ therapeutic vaccines derived, in part, from the
patients' own cancerous tumors. Still in their infancy, these
promising vaccines attack the abnormal proteins in cancer cells.
And while these vaccines are still a tiny fraction of the $7.5
billion spent annually on cancer medications, some specialists see
them as potentially plausible alternatives to today's cancer drugs,
many of which have significant side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical researchers see promise in the vaccines because,
they say, cancerous tumors and melanomas are individually distinct,
like a fingerprint, making them difficult to identify and treat
with one single off-the-shelf drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on patient-specific vaccines, because
cancer is not one disease but many, and there is evidence of some
promising results today that we did not see a decade ago,'' said
Dr. Stanley Nathenson, professor of microbiology and immunology at
New York's Albert Einstein School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of the proposed vaccines is considered a possible
cure. Instead, they are expected to help patients who have already
undergone such standard anticancer procedures as surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy, but have suffered a relapse. They need
a treatment that has fewer side effects, yet is more effective in
fighting cancer in older patients with weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Since early clinical testing of patient-specific vaccines began
two years ago, none has been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. Several vaccine developers are hoping to launch
major testing with hundreds of patients next year, with an eye
toward gaining FDA marketing clearance in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it will take about five years to assess the status of
patients' recovery to sort out whether the new type of cancer
treatment is a long-term solution. Unlike preventive vaccines that
ward off polio or measles, that stimulate the immune system to
protect against invading infectious, therapeutic cancer vaccines go
to work immediately battling diseased tumors and melanomas.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their promising outlook, they are seen as merely a
temporary step on the road toward developing off-the-shelf vaccines
that will cost less and be available to treat a wider group of
cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of these patient-specific vaccines goes back more
than 60 years,'' said Dennis Panicali, president of Therion
Biologics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. company working with the
National Cancer Institute to develop seven therapeutic cancer
vaccines that are not patient-specific. ``And while the scientific
and physician community has taken notice, they are always saying,
`If we can only make it little bit better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme, Antigenics, and several other companies think they have
made major strides with a new generation of vaccines. Antigenics,
which reported an 80 percent cure rate in mice, is one of several
companies developing patient-specific cancer vaccines that boost
the body's anticancer immune response.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other proposed therapeutic cancer vaccines, which
are made in laboratories, a patient-specific vaccine requires first
harvesting a tumor biopsy, which is then packed in ice and shipped
overnight to a processing lab. Depending on the technology, the lab
creates the vaccine and sends it to the patient's physician, who
over the course of three to eight weeks, injects it into the
patient's skin.
</P>
<P>
   These drugs are sometimes referred to as autologous vaccines,
because they combine a patient's own cancer cells with a type of
bacterium or other agent that provokes a major immune response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our individualized cancer vaccines can be used
to treat pancreatic, kidney, and skin cancers,'' said Garo Armen, a
cofounder and president of Antigenics, which developed the
personalized cancer vaccines that Amato used in Houston. He said
the company's new Woburn facility can produce 7,000 individualized
vaccines per year, at a cost to the patient of $15,000 per
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Antigenics has found a way to attack tumors using a class of
proteins called heat-shock proteins, which when extracted from the
patient's own tumors and purified, can be used to stimulate the
immune system to attack cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Based on nearly 20 years of research by Pramod Srivastava, a
cofounder of Antigenics and a cancer specialist at the University
of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, a patient's
heat-shock proteins are extracted from the tumor, processed, and
sent back in the form of a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Armen, who hopes to gain FDA approval in three years, said the
cost is comparable to standard chemotherapy, but still higher than
some newer cancer-fighting drugs such as Genentech Corp.'s breast
cancer drug Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Genzyme Molecular Oncology, a unit of Genzyme Corp. of
Cambridge, Mass., said it has tested two melanoma vaccines in a
phase 1 product safety trial in more than 50 patients, with 20
percent having ``dramatic clinical responses.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company launched a phase 2 clinical trial of 24
patients who have the most severe form of skin cancer, led by Dr.
Frank G. Haluska of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer
Center. Patients will receive six injections over three months,
with the first results due next year.
</P>
<P>
   At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, several clinical studies are
underway to test cancer vaccines from Cell Genesys Inc. of Foster
City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston area was the only place where we could get the
technical expertise, the biotechnology researchers, and a major
facility for our needs,'' said Armen, who shuttles between
Antigenics' Manhattan headquarters and the facilities in Woburn and
Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Several other personalized vaccines are being tested around the
country to treat lung, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancers.
Dendreon Corp. this fall expects to launch a pivotal clinical trial
to test its dendritic cell therapy on men with late-stage prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle company harvests a patient's white blood cells and
separates out a component called dendritic cells, which are
produced by bone marrow to circulate throughout the body.
Considered the most powerful stimulator of immune responses in the
body, the patient's dendritic cells are cultured for two days with
specific cancer markers, or antigens, that are absorbed into the
cells to produce a targeted response against prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's longest study, 20 prostate cancer patients were
tested and nearly half have not suffered a relapse in nearly a
year, according to David Urdal, Dendreon's chief scientific
officer.
</P>
<P>
   And Avax Technologies of Kansas City recently launched a pivotal
clinical trial for 400 patients with melanoma who have experienced
a relapse since their cancers were removed surgically. Melanoma is
the most serious form of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the company reported that earlier testing of 40
patients showed 17 still alive, of which 12 remain cancer free.
Avax is projecting its patient-specific vaccine would cost about
$20,000 per patient if it gains FDA approval, according to Ernest
W. Yankee, Avax executive vice president. ``Right now, the large
pharmaceutical companies are not sure that this kind of vaccine
technology is really practical,'' said Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, major drug companies would rather deliver
off-the-pharmacy-shelf products that they can sell in large
quantities to hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
Making small quantities of custom vaccines quickly and shipping
them across the country overnight raises concerns with the FDA over
the quality of each vaccine batch and whether it is consistent for
each patient, said Denis R. Burger, president of AVI Biopharma Inc.
of Portland, Ore., which is developing a laboratory-produced
therapeutic vaccine for colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our cost of goods is $100, which means we can charge
under $1,000, so once we get real conventional therapeutic vaccines
approved, autologous vaccines are out the window,'' said Burger.
</P>
<P>
   Nonpatient-specific vaccines like those made by Therion
Biologics and AVI Biopharma are attracting pharmaceutical company
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, SmithKline Beecham PLC, one of the largest vaccine
makers in the world, expanded its strategic partnership with Corixa
Corp. of Seattle, a 5-year-old developer of vaccines for cancer and
tuberculosis, to include therapeutic vaccines for ovarian and colon
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But some oncologists, such as Nathenson at Einstein, say that
any drug that is effective and less toxic than some current
medications is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these patient-specific vaccines are approved, they will
meet an unmet medical need of prolonging survival with a better
quality of life,'' said Dr. Mark A. Goldberg, an associate
professor at the Harvard Medical School and vice president of
medical affairs at Genzyme Molecular Oncology. ``But the long-term
goal is to develop off-the-shelf vaccines.''

REALITY BITES AS EURO LOSES PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Europe's idealism about a single, unifying currency has been
punctured by the euro's sharp slide in the months since its January
debut. Reality, it seems, has hit the Continent hard.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of a disappointing currency conversion does not
stop at Europe's shores. Strong ties between Europe and the eastern
United States have brought the euro's woes here.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a 15 percent drop in the euro has made Parisian
pastries and Italian pottery less expensive for the droves of
American tourists heading to Europe for summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   But if those tourists are also investors in European stocks,
they have watched their portfolios get sapped by the plunging euro,
which reduces investment gains when it is converted back to US
dollars. And US companies exporting goods to expand their customer
base in Europe are reporting declining sales on the Continent due
to soft spending among Europeans, compounded by a weak euro that
undercuts their buying power.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's fall is ``felt on both sides of the Atlantic,'' said
Keith Cheveralls, managing director of foreign exchange services
for BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cheveralls was virtually alone earlier this year when he warned
the euro faced tough times ahead. ``Look for the euro to weaken
further,'' he said in a February memo to BankBoston's clients.
</P>
<P>
   Few believed him then. At the euro's introduction, the air was
thick with euphoria that the 11 member countries would conquer
their economic weaknesses and meld into a dominant world trading
power. Optimistic forecasts predicted the value of the euro would
climb to as much as $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after a very short honeymoon, the currency plunged over
the first six months of the year from its record high of $1.877 on
Jan. 4, to the range of $1.0197 on Friday. Some currency
specialists predict the euro could be worth less than a dollar by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to restore the world's confidence in what is certainly
the most ambitious currency unification ever undertaken, Wim
Duisenberg, president of the newly created European Central Bank _
which sets monetary policy for the nations that have adopted the
euro _ said last week, ``There's clear potential for a stronger
(euro).''
</P>
<P>
   But economists said reasons for the euro's surprising weakness
are complex, and its recovery may take months or years _ or it may
not occur at all.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's decline in value against the US dollar is attributed,
first, to a booming US economy, which has pushed up interest rates
here. In Europe, rates are heading in the opposite direction,
causing all European currencies to weaken against the almighty
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is in limited use; each member country has retained its
own local currency until euro coins and bills are issued in 2002.
During the current transition, however, business may be transacted
in euros. Credit card purchases and traveler's checks are also
denominated in euros.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to the euro's value, economists say, is the
highly complex task of merging not just currencies but also
economic policies in 11 countries in the eurozone: Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Europe is, in a sense, under one roof financially, its
economic activity runs the gamut. Sluggishness in Germany, the
kingpin of European commerce, contrasts to a boom in Ireland, a
small country in which a highly educated work force and growing
high-tech industry have pushed growth toward 10 percent annually
for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   While economies vary, the European Central Bank fixes a single,
pan-European interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the problem with the one-size-fits-all monetary policy,''
said Nariman Behravesh, international economist at Standard &AMP;
Poor's/DRI in Lexington, Mass. ``What may be right for all of
Europe might not be right for Germany. It's a dilemma for them
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors hit by weak European currencies know what to do: They
are fleeing the Continent in growing numbers. Although many stock
markets in Europe are up smartly this year, Americans' returns _
when translated to a strong dollar _ have been eaten away by the
currency losses in translating gains back to US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   US investors in European stock mutual funds lost 1.84 percent,
on average, in the first six months of the year, according to
Lipper Inc. in New York. That's a big disappointment after seeing
European funds gain 22.6 percent in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   US investors pulled $500 million out of European mutual funds in
March, $700 million out in April, and $300 million out in May,
Lipper said. The moves are an acceleration of a trend that emerged
last summer when some international investors who fled currency and
financial market turmoil in Asia and Latin America also withdrew
from European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But William Wendler, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming
International, which manages $33 billion in US money invested
overseas, is optimistic about European stocks. ``Europe has
finished bottoming out and is in a slow recovery phase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the hope of US exporters reporting declining European
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the euro is not to blame, because often trade is
still being conducted in the local currencies of countries in the
eurozone. But those currencies, which track the euro, have also
weakened. The deutsche mark, for example, has dropped 18 percent in
value against the dollar from recent highs, while the French franc
has fallen more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exports our more expensive. It's getting harder and harder
to sell things over there,'' said Robert Giegerich, vice president
of worldwide marketing for Cynosure Inc., which sells lasers for
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Polaroid Corp.'s bright announcement last week of
higher second-quarter sales was marred by an 8 percent drop in
sales of cameras and film in Europe, due to ``lower conventional
and instant film sales and unfavorable foreign exchange,'' the
Cambridge company said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lueders, Polaroid's controller, blamed not only weak
currencies but European consumers, who are not as eager to buy as
are US consumers, who have been on a monthslong spending spree.
These factors pushed second-quarter sales in Europe down to $107
million, from $117 million in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some have a slightly different view of the euro's troubles:
Travel agents are reaping the benefits of US tourists flocking to
Europe to take advantage of lower air fares and hotel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Said Maria Marinelli at Garber Travel, about the euro: ``it's a
good thing -- definitely.''

ON VACATION, LEAVE WORK AT THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you're an executive who's taking a laptop on
your vacation, here's how to use it effectively: Grab the computer
with both hands and whack yourself on the head with it over and
over and over until you're unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'll be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to taking days off, Corporate America is the model
of trickle down stupidity. Companies have too much short-term greed
to appreciate their importance, making executives less likely to
take time for themselves. And if the boss doesn't get a perk, how
many rank-and-filers will?
</P>
<P>
   Consider two surveys:
</P>
<P>
   _ American employees typically start with two weeks of vacation
after their first year, management consulting firm Hewitt
Associates reports. The firm says workers with the same experience
in Brazil, Australia and most of Western Europe get at least four
weeks off _ a level Americans don't usually achieve until they've
been with a company more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty-two percent of 5,000 executives surveyed by the search
firm Management Recruiters International say they work during their
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly good reasons to get in touch with the office
during a vacation _ like a fire at the factory, a hostile takeover
or nuclear winter. Otherwise, calling the office can be a symptom
of two serious problems: insecurity and insensitivity. And, while
we're at it, insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Years and years of layoffs have made even normal workers a
little paranoid. If your boss sees that the company is doing fine
without you, that paranoid voice whispers, there may be a pink slip
in your future.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an insecure executive, one purely selfish way to
protect yourself is to make sure that no one else can do your job.
It's pretty simple: You hire a bunch of incompetents or delegate
only the most inconsequential decisions. The organization may
crumble, but you'll still be seen as a star.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, of course, is that you either can't take a
vacation or you have to check in with the office all the time while
you're gone. No one else can do your job, remember? If you don't
see yourself as insecure, but still feel compelled to check in,
stop long enough to figure out why. In all but the smallest
businesses, someone ought to be able to step in for you for a few
weeks _ for your sake and the company's.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what would happen if you had a heart attack? (Given
your habits, that's worth serious consideration.)
</P>
<P>
   Are your subordinates incompetent? If you hired them, read books
on how to hire people more effectively. If your boss hired them,
see if you can be more involved next time. Have you given them
enough training? Are you doing as much as you can to emphasize
their strengths and minimize their weaknesses? Do you delegate
enough? That isn't just letting people make decisions, but helping
them understand how and why you do what you do, so they can take
over when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Are you treating things as urgent when they really aren't? Next
time you're tempted to check in with the office, ask yourself what
the real impact would be if you just waited until you returned
home. It's probably insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   If you still feel compelled to call in or cut your vacation
short, somebody doesn't appreciate the value of a good vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Is it you or your company? Maybe you don't want to take a
vacation because you enjoy your job. OK. But I'd love to see a
survey of how many people on their deathbed say, ``Gee, I wish I'd
gone to Paris'' vs. ``Gee, I wish I'd worked harder.''
</P>
<P>
   If you honestly can't find anyone or anyplace outside your job
that's worthy of two or three weeks, you must have a wonderful job.
And an extreme case of tunnel vision.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a vacation like health insurance. You might be able to
sneak by without it for a couple of years, but sooner or later it
will catch up with you. And it might be very costly.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses and employees need to realize that just because you're
doing your job well doesn't mean a vacation wouldn't help. Often
people get their most creative ideas when they're relaxed, and
being exposed to different cultures and different ways of doing
things is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the tight job market, this is a great time to
negotiate for more days off. Employers may be more willing to let
you get away, especially if they don't have to hire a replacement.

DESPITE THE MODERN EQUIPMENT, A TEDIOUS, CONFUSING PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not quite a needle in a haystack, but it's close: As ships
troll the area off Martha's Vineyard in search of remains of John
F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, they have to contend with a seafloor
jumbled with rocks, debris and old shipwrecks that may be similar
in size and shape to the elusive wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem facing the search effort, said research
scientist Dana Yoerger of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is
that ``there's a lot of other stuff out there _ rocks, shipwrecks
and so on _ and they don't really know what they're looking for.
What would a smashed-up plane look like in side-scan sonar?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, in this case the searchers do have
the advantage that because of the relatively shallow water,
whenever a possible ``target'' is seen on the seafloor, they can
quickly send divers into the water to check it out. In deeper
water, they might have to wait to send a robotic submersible with
video cameras to investigate potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Sending down divers to investigate every suspicious sonar target
has been the procedure for the last two days, said a Coast Guard
spokeswoman, Petty Officer Bridget Hieronymus. ``We had eight
targets (Monday), and seven more this morning,'' she said Tuesday,
and in each of those cases, ``divers are sent down to
systematically verify'' what those targets really are. The divers
``are moving from target to target until they find something.''
</P>
<P>
   Conducting the search are two National Atmospheric and Oceanic
Administration ships, the Rude and the Whiting, along with a Coast
Guard cutter called Willow, which had sonar equipment installed on
Monday for this search operation, and a Navy rescue and salvage
ship, the USS Grasp, which in addition to side-scan sonar search
capability is also equipped to recover and bring to the surface any
wreckage that is located by the search efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The side-scan sonar equipment being used can provide images of a
swath of seafloor extending out about 300 feet to either side of
the ship's path, providing a detailed picture of any objects within
that strip. The equipment aboard at least one of the ships, the
Rude, was built by Edgetech, a Milford-based company founded by the
late Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor and engineer who also perfected the technology
for high-speed stroboscopic photography that can capture still
images of speeding bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Edgetech engineer Darren Moss, who demonstrates the side-scan
sonar to clients and provides training in its use, said that just
two weeks ago, he was demonstrating this equipment in Lake Michigan
in a search for wreckage from another small private plane. ``We
were able to get great imagery, but there was nothing there,'' Moss
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is basically designed for this type of work,'' Moss
said. Other kinds of side-scan sonar equipment are designed for
other purposes, such as geological mapping, where the need is for
wider coverage with less need for distinguishing small details. But
this equipment, aboard the same NOAA ship Rude, for example, was
also used successfully in the search for wreckage from TWA flight
800 off Long Island three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the seafloor is large and littered, and the wreckage being
sought may be in small pieces. ``This could take a long time,
unless they get lucky,'' said Yoerger, even though the searchers
are using state-of-the-art commercial equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The process is difficult and tedious, and depends in part on
high-precision navigation throughout the process.
</P>
<P>
   Covering a search area methodically involves a meticulous
coverage pattern _ ``mowing the lawn, we call it,'' said Yoerger,
who has been involved in many deep-sea searches. As in mowing a
lawn, ``you don't want to cover some areas twice, but you also
don't want to leave any gaps.'' That may be easy with grass of
uneven length to remind you of where you've been, but in the
trackless ocean it means pinpoint navigation and mapping.
</P>
<P>
   The NOAA ships conducting the search are normally used for
mapping potential obstructions, such as large protruding rocks or
old shipwrecks, that can pose a hazard for ships in the area. The
same equipment, which sends ``pings'' of sound down to the seafloor
and then records the echoes with underwater microphones, is ideal
for locating debris from a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although they don't know exactly what to look for, typically any
man-made objects stand out because of their straight edges and
sharp corners, unlike the rounded lines of natural objects such as
rocks on the seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   But even when a likely ``target'' shows up on the sonar, it
takes time to investigate. Normally, a separate boat with divers is
then sent to the spot, which it must identify through its own
navigation systems. Then, ``the divers don't have any navigation,
once they jump off the side of the ship,'' said Yoerger, so it can
be difficult to tell for sure if, for example, a rock they see on
the bottom is really the same object as the ``target'' they were
sent to investigate _ especially when underwater visibility is
poor.
</P>
<P>
   But if the plane is intact, or in a few large pieces, ``it
should make an excellent sonar target,'' said Clifford Goudey, a
marine engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Even
lobster traps can often be identified using such sonar systems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goudey, who recently spent time at sea mapping the seafloor a
little farther south of Martha's Vineyard, said that ``you see
rocks, sand ridges in the bottom, all sorts of things. But anything
unusual is easy to identify.''

DIVERSE WORKPLACE MEANS MORE THAN SHADES OF COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You have a six-person staff: a white man, age
60; a Hispanic woman, 50; an African-American man, 45; a white
woman, 35; an Asian man, 30; and a white woman, 25. It's the
picture of diversity, but it might be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   That mythical staff is really the picture of inclusion, bringing
in people of different ages, races and sexes. ``That may or may not
give you diversity,'' says R. Roosevelt Thomas Jr. of Atlanta,
founder of the American Institute for Managing Diversity and
co-author of the recently published book ``Building a House for
Diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that all six employees were raised in
upper-middle-class families and graduated from Stanford University.
And they all had to fit a rigid corporate mold to get either hired
or promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that picture of diversity is a bit out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the key points in his book, Thomas uses a fable
about how a giraffe had built a wonderful home for himself and his
family, with raised ceilings, narrow hallways and high windows. But
when his friend the elephant came over, he couldn't make it
comfortably around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The giraffe said that maybe the elephant could take aerobics and
ballet classes to make himself thinner and lighter on his feet, but
the elephant wasn't so sure that any house built for a giraffe
would work for him _ unless there were major changes in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the giraffe often symbolizes white males in the
workplace, Thomas said in an interview that true diversity crops up
in a variety of ways besides race and sex. People who work in the
main office have a different perspective from those who work in a
bureau; people in a small company that gets purchased will be
different from those who have been with the big company all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue, quite frankly, is that all of us go back and
forth between being giraffes and elephants,'' Thomas said.
``Diversity can crop up with respect to any dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Elephants can be anyone from elementary-school students who
aren't in the popular group to the outsider brought into a family
business to the person who pushes for more vacations in an office
of workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   Often companies will push to hire people of different races or
backgrounds, but then will be unable or unwilling to change the
corporate culture, Thomas explained. Instead of widening the
hallways, they'll expect the elephants to take ballet classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often you cannot maintain your representation gains without
having diversity,'' he said. ``Young people today are much more
inclined to say, `I'm good, but I'm different.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides realizing that diversity goes beyond attributes like
race and age, Thomas said that people who have ``diversity
maturity'' share certain characteristics, such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ Knowing themselves and their organization. They're aware of
how they respond to those with different attitudes and backgrounds,
and understand the ways diversity can help their companies and
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking responsibility for diversity effectiveness. They look
for similarities and differences between themselves and others.
They're willing to challenge conventional wisdom and engage in
continuous learning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Realizing the difference between a genuine requirement for the
job and a personal preference. Some companies could make a
legitimate business argument for having a dress code; others do it
just because it's a manager's preference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appreciating that diversity often is accompanied by complexity
and tension. To bring in elephants and make them want to stay,
giraffes have to do some serious remodeling. That leads to tension
for giraffes and elephants alike.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that people have to understand the importance of
diversity in helping themselves and their company succeed, not
simply seeing it as an issue of fairness or morality. He said
elephants and giraffes both have to look at the overall success of
the business, and in what areas diversity can be an asset, or even
a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   He said a first critical step is for the company to help
employees understand the many types of diversity. ``That includes
mixtures in your personal life. Two spouses is a mixture. Two
children is a mixture.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising that kind of awareness can help even if the company
isn't ready to come up with a formal policy, Thomas said. Then the
company needs to decide if it really wants diversity. If it does,
it must determine in what way the diversity should occur, and how
much it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the confusion about diversity is that we're not
absolutely clear what we want,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file workers who feel like the elephant in the
giraffe's home have to decide whether it's best to leave the
company or try to adjust, Thomas said. He explained that some who
push hard for diversity might find that it hurts their chances for
advancement in their particular company, so they have to leave,
stop pushing or try to achieve more diversity in their private
lives instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be clear about why they're here and what their
goals are. Elephants can be viable in a giraffe's house. The issue
is: At what cost?''

   BUSH-ADVISOR _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The real-world laboratory for the

Indianapolis, where churches run city parks and the Jewish mayor
raises money to get kids out of public schools and into Catholic

Goldsmith, is now the man behind the Bush domestic plan still under

   NEWFUEL _ ATLANTA _ EPA Adminstrator Carol Browner is coming to
Atlanta Thursday to announce that low-sulfur fuel will be offered
at some 550 stations in 25 counties around Atlanta, making this the

here? Combine Atlanta's sprawl reputation, the sheer number of cars
and a way to support Gov. Roy Barnes' anti-sprawl efforts.
Officials say the fuel, which will be replacing premium grade at
the stations, will help reduce nitrogen oxide emissions daily at a
rate equal to 12,000 cars. (Soto, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

PLUMBING A RUSH TO MOURN CELEBRITY ICONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They were standing so close they could have touched,
Sharon Shepherd said. She and John F. Kennedy Jr. were at the same
event six years ago, and she wanted more than anything to talk to
him. But he was too famous, too handsome, too close, and she was
too afraid. She didn't speak. She's since regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Shepherd, 45, was free to say so in a message to
Kennedy himself, carefully penned in the condolence book at the
John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. From now on, the Dorchester
resident wrote, ``I guess I can talk to you anytime I feel like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the irony of Kennedy's death, the passage of a man who
was larger than life when he lived. In passing, Kennedy has grown
even larger, yet smaller, too _ he is farther away, yet closer,
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Like Princess Diana and Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and James
Dean, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death has placed him in a pantheon for
the celebrity age: intently watched in life, publicly mourned in
death.
</P>
<P>
   In messages in the condolence books, or impromptu shrines like
the one outside the Kennedy Library, or even in the collective
viewing of television news, people draw closer to these figures
when they die, said Caryl Rivers, a journalism professor at Boston
University. They also draw closer to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of these natural moments which become sort of
community binding events,'' she said. ``Since we have, in our
community, less sense of community. . . . We feel like they're our
friends. And we almost act like they're our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And many people treat their deaths as if their friends had died
_ almost.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people signed the condolence book,
some of them after waiting in line for an hour, Kennedy Library
officials estimated. Others left flowers, candles, cards, and
balloons at a shrine outside the library's entrance. Many addressed
their messages directly to Kennedy or to his family. Shepherd said
she started her condolence book note the way she'd address a buddy:
``Well, John-John. . .''
</P>
<P>
   And several said they felt better, relieved, at the chance to
say goodbye this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I needed to do something,'' said Teresa Egan, 35,
of Dorchester, who brought flowers.
</P>
<P>
   For Bostonians, the Kennedy Library served as an obvious site
for that. And the staff was prepared for the deluge, said a
spokesman Tom McNaught. The library had set up a similar book, and
had drawn a similar response, when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died.
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't an obvious place to mourn, people seek shrines
where they can. When Princess Diana died in a car wreck two summers
ago, some Bostonians chose a Newbury Street boutique, Bjoux.
</P>
<P>
   Bjoux's owner, Barbara Jordan, had purchased three of the
princess's famous gowns at a Christie's auction, months before
Diana's death. After the car crash, Jordan hung the dresses in her
store window. She was stunned when, for days, people left flowers
and notes on the sidewalk outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd come in the morning and there were more of them,'' Jordan
said. ``It's like tying the yellow ribbon on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the public mourning serves a spiritual purpose, said
Jacqueline Landry, the Catholic chaplain at Harvard University. In
the face of death, she said, people feel ``a need to ritualize _
not only personally, but in a community.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the signing of a book and the gift of flowers are acts
that mirror funeral rituals, Landry said. They come as a natural
response.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the structure and liturgy of a synagogue, church, or
mosque, that kind of hurried mourning isn't necessarily healthy,
said the Rev. Anthony Campbell, preacher in residence at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do the heavy lifting of faith or belief or grief,''
he said. ``It's kind of microwave religion. You can do it in a
hurry and be done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that could be the way people like it: a minimal helping of
grief or reflection. Society's reaction to the death of someone
famous speaks to the way it deals with death itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a death-denying culture,'' Landry said. ``We don't
have, really, the words for it, the fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   When he discusses death with his students, Boston University
professor Michael Corgan said, they look at him strangely, as if
they're far too young to consider such a subject. But he points out
that 50 years ago, before advances in medicine, more of them would
have experienced the death of a sibling or a friend, somebody
equally young.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the deaths of young people are rare, they carry
special shock value, Rivers said. Because of ``that sense of
forever young and unfulfilled,'' she said, it's easy for early
death to give birth to a myth.
</P>
<P>
   What makes people cling to icons, she said, is the youth they
represent: the beauty of Princess Diana or Marilyn Monroe, the
thwarted promise of James Dean or John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like losing a hero _ a Martin Luther King or Robert F.
Kennedy _ Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroism demands distance,'' and modern culture offers none,
Rivers said. Instead, people see John F. Kennedy Jr. flunk the bar
exam, fight with his girlfriend, rollerblade, and ``we think we
know him.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing a celebrity isn't the same thing as losing a
relative. And it isn't the same as losing a leader _ a figure with
historical heft, like Kennedy's father. When a cultural icon dies,
the consequences aren't so great, Rivers said. Time passes;
attention wanes. Public shrines become private mementoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library will offer its condolence book to the
family, McNaughton said. Jordan collected the flowers left for
Princess Diana and made a dry arrangement. She keeps it in her
home, to remember.
</P>
<P>
   The public will remember, too, Rivers said. But not every day.
``If you lose a television icon,'' she said, ``life goes on.''

THE PRICE OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lives of three famous men intersected briefly this past
week.
</P>
<P>
   We marked the 30th anniversary of Neil Armstrong walking the
moon, Bill Gates's wealth going over the moon, and the sad and
accidental disappearance of the only son of the president who sent
men to the moon. Genuine public sorrow and empathy engulfed the
families of John F. Kennedy Jr. and the Bessettes.
</P>
<P>
   His is the family of the second half of the century, for all the
reasons endlessly offered this week by the media chiaroscurists,
arranging light and dark hues on cue, back right after this
commercial message. Being fodder for the fame machine is no fun for
the living, when so much sentimentality can turn to dross in a
simulacrum of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``John would be the first person to laugh at all the fuss,''
said a sorrowful acquaintance. He never asked to become the avatar
of the age, a symbol of glitz who in his own life seemed to endure
more than enjoy the importunings of the less-famous on the more so,
all with a good grace and the patience of the truly adult.
</P>
<P>
   He was of the media but beyond the media. Would he have chanced
the night flight over water into steamy, horizon-obliterating haze
with an unhealed foot injury if he'd been a normal fellow who could
walk through LaGuardia or Martha's Vineyard airport without causing
a stir, commotion, gawkers, or risk being prey for an odd pack of
stray papparazzi?
</P>
<P>
   Recycling envy is one of the things we do best in the news biz.
If you have stunning good looks, a swollen bank account, play a
game uncommonly well, or you're related to someone famous, then we
want you. In our newspaper. On our magazine cover. On our TV show,
24-7.
</P>
<P>
   Fame is contagious, to a point. Being the photogenic son of an
assassinated president, for instance, is bigger than being
second-cousin to the world's richest man or brother-in-law of a
famous astronaut. We decide how famous to make you. Media money is
made by seducing you to read, watch or listen. When books were
still being hand-copied by monks working in candlelight,
word-of-mouth was what passed the news, the gossip and the spin in
the medieval marketplace. ``Did you hear about the baron's son and
the count's daughter after the boar-roast?'' Now words and images
fly everywhere. This is not an unmixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who was a Peace Corps volunteer in Afghanistan told me
this week that after Neil Armstrong walked on the moon 30 years ago
this week, her Islamic students in Kabul insisted it was a giant
hoax, that blue-eyed devil American propagandists had cooked the
whole thing up in a Hollywood studio.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when John Kennedy and two young women fell from the
sky, words and pictures went everywhere. ``The globalization of
grief,'' declare the talking heads. The Princess Di-ification of
Jack Kennedy's only son. From deification to Di-ification, with the
twist of a control room dial and the help of satellite relays.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the week that Gates, the Croesus of our age, climbed
another rung on the ladder of envy. Whose life or lifestyle is to
be envied more _ John's or Bill's? Gates owns a fifth of all
Microsoft shares, worth $100 billion this week. That's a one
followed by 11 zeroes. The New York Times said of Microsoft's $500
billion market valuation: ``If it were a country it would have the
ninth-largest economy in the world, behind Spain, which has a gross
domestic product of $553 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   How would you like to be Spain this morning? Bill's lakefront
pad cost $60 million. Does anyone know what the Alhambra cost? Does
Bill have stuff hanging on his walls comparable to the Prado?
</P>
<P>
   But how much can you spend? How many meals can you eat in a day?
How do you find and keep fast friends when you're so loaded with
fame or money that everyone you meet calculates instantly what they
can get from you?
</P>
<P>
   I know young Kennedy had tons of friends and a big family who
prized him for being kind, gentle, breezily stylish, open-minded,
considerate. He surfed through and over the waves of a difficult
life, with lordly confidence and appealing self-mockery that never
allowed itself to be perceived in public as self-pity. That was a
hard act, carried off with panache.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Bill Gates has riches in his private life as well. He's
done a lot for a lot of people. Three of the world's wealthiest
five people are Microsoft execs. It's phenomenal. But I'd still
rather be Neil Armstrong than any of them. An aging Ohio farm boy,
who epitomized the qualities of nerve, fitness, deftness, and calm
that NASA calculated gave earthlings their best chance of landing,
then getting back in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
Armstrong never capitalized on fame. He went the other way,
retreating to the farm. No commercial onslaught: ``Drink Moonwalk
Cola . . . Buy a Space City condo . . . Drive a Moonrover . . . ''
Didn't happen. The moon belongs to everyone. The best things in
life are free to the nonfamous only. Fame is a burden too heavy by
half.

PBS'S HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ If war is too important to be entrusted to the
generals, culture is too important to be left to the politicians,
especially those eager to get their mitts on that eccentric outpost
of culture, the Public Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   PBS fund-raisers hired brokers who swapped donor lists. This was
a foolish, even childish act, after which, like naughty children,
they stalled and stumbled. Like errant urchins, they await rescue
by Big Bird and Barney the dinosaur. Meanwhile, these reckless
mendicants have jeopardized the 15 percent of its budget that PBS
gets from federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Public television's carelessness with donor lists, including one
from the Democratic National Committee and another from the
reelection campaign of Senator Barbara Boxer, a California
Democrat, has formed a symmetrical, bicoastal, bipartisan pincer
movement that threatens the independence of PBS and resurrects the
issue of elitism and the arts. Federal aid survived the
fulminations of Jesse Helms, the Tarheel philistine, but federal
support of public television may yet capsize on the donor list of
Boxer, a California liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The first reaction from the first station caught was a parody of
self-righteousness. A low-level employee did it, WGBH in Boston
said. Rationalizing the irrational and explaining the inexplicable
continued until a pattern emerged at WNET in New York, WETA in
Washington, and KQED in San Francisco, Boxer's beneficiary. The
broadcast signal then groaned from deep in the Cookie Monster's
cookie jar: We did nuttin' wrong, and we won't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Public television's apologists seem to be unaware that
Republicans now control Congress. Had the stations traded sucker
lists with Volvo dealerships or Birkenstock boutiques, that would
be sound, old-fashioned capitalism. Volvo and Birkenstock aren't
trying to take over Congress. Democrats are.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Democrats is Edward J. Markey, senior minority
member of the telecommunications subcommittee investigating the
brouhaha. As the de facto defense counsel for PBS, he says: ``We
concede. There's no excuse. We are now in the sentencing phase.''
Markey can recite relevant facts:
</P>
<P>
   ``For taxpayers, it costs one dollar per person per year to
support public television. There's no cable channel that can be
purchased for that price, for that cost-effectiveness. When the
political cognoscenti look at PBS they look at it from
MacNeil-Lehrer on, into the evening. When the average family looks
at it, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., it's the children's television
network, with `Sesame Street' and `Barney' and `Wishbone' and all
of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most homes, the TV is on an average of six hours a day.
This idea that cable with Nickelodeon is a substitute does not face
the fact that not everyone has cable. Those who don't have cable
are disproportionately poor and disproportionately minority. So
this is an incredibly vaulable asset, available on a virtually
universal basis, an electronic oasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should every public television station in America be cut
because of a decision to allow these list brokers to barter
separate and apart from the ongoing effort to maintain their
independence?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal aid to the arts began in 1964 as a tribute to John F.
Kennedy. A month before his death, JFK said, ``We must never forget
that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth. In a
free society, art is not a weapon and does not belong to the sphere
of polemics and ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS fund-raisers, by cozying up to polemicists, ideologues, and
propagandists, have defiled and politicized their mission. Politics
may yet save them. Markey has tried to encourage bipartisanship in
the subcommittee headed by W. J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana
Republican. The GOP, already considered pro-gun, anti-poor and
anti-minority, may pause before blowing a hole in Barney or
defeathering Big Bird.

LET US RETURN TO OUR REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no curses in life, only choices.
</P>
<P>
   It is not fate, but the accident of birth, the element of luck,
and the exercise of will that determine the shape and substance of
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, we have heard more about royalty and
destiny, dynasty and curses, than befits a democratic people, no
matter how grief-stricken. When talk turns to the Kennedys of
Massachusetts, we lose our footing and fall fast into the realm of
Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. It is a 40-year habit we are
loath to break.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden, heartbreaking deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his
wife and sister-in-law in a plane crash off Martha's Vineyard, on
the eve of a Kennedy family wedding, have plunged us yet again into
the cliches of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to mourn the loss of glamorous, promising
lives. Grief must be overlaid with our intimate projections for a
young man and woman we knew only through a telephoto lens: John
would have run for the Senate, surely, and would have been
president one day, certainly. Carolyn would have been an elegant
political partner, her poise and grace so reminiscent of the
mother-in-law whom she never met but whom we presume to know. Of
course, they would have had children, children as charming as the
two preschoolers who played on the floor of the Oval Office 37
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Our preoccupation with the Kennedys is understandable enough;
the family has helped to define a half century of American public
life. But our voyeuristic attachment to their private lives damages
us far more than it does them. The original cultivator of its own
mystique, the clan at the Cape Cod compound has always known the
difference between fantasy and reality. The Kennedys are not
watching round-the-clock coverage of the ``Tragedy at Sea;'' they
are living it. They are not grieving the loss of a nation's ``crown
prince;'' they are mourning a nephew, a cousin, an uncle, a
brother.
</P>
<P>
   What about us? When did we forget that Camelot was not a
physical place but a mythical kingdom, that King Arthur was not a
reigning monarch but a romantic fiction? When did we begin to
mistake the storytellers for the historians?
</P>
<P>
   How many of us who might have spent these last steamy days
cavorting with our own children on a beach instead went inside, and
found ourselves riveted by someone else's home movies? How many of
us watched Jack hoist a sail or Bobby throw a pass and lamented
that life holds for us no more excitement than the Friday night
bowling league?
</P>
<P>
   Swept up in the drama of the Kennedys' lives, we risk minimizing
the dignity of our own. Most of us don't fly our private planes to
resort islands on summer weekends. We rent a cottage for two weeks
and pray it doesn't rain. How can our morning jogs or aerobic
classes at the local ``Y'' not pale next to the parasailing and
touch football games we've glimpsed from the foot of Scudder Avenue
in Hyannis Port?
</P>
<P>
   If we lionize the fallen son of the fallen president as a brash,
young adventurer, a novice pilot whose final, fatal flight was
emblematic of a life passionately lived, do we, by implication,
trivialize our own lives? It is easy enough to dismiss the cautious
man, to conclude that the measured life reflects a failure of
imagination, to forget that a man with fewer options weighs his
choices with a care not required of a man for whom no choice is
beyond possibility.
</P>
<P>
   It might prove not to have been imprudent for an inexperienced
pilot to have flown into a black night in hazy conditions. It might
be that mechanical failure, not pilot error, sent Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga into a nosedive over the Atlantic. But it says something
about the difference between John F. Kennedy Jr. and most of us
that he flew out over the open ocean without life vests on board.
Confidence that not only could he survive the unanticipated but
also the expectation that he would survive is the stuff of what?
Courage? Hubris? Both? Pop psychology is no more illuminating than
the inexhaustible nattering of all those Kennedy family sycophants
dominating the airwaves this week.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curses in life, only choices. We could choose now
to lower the camera lens, to turn off the TV. As the most American
of centuries comes to a close, we could choose to leave this most
American of families to grieve with the dignity and privacy we
claim to have admired in the young people now lost at sea. We could
choose to honor those lives by passionately embracing our own.

<P>
   WEEKEND-HOUSES (Amagansett, N.Y.) _ ``Weekend Utopia: The Modern
Beach House on Eastern Long Island, 1960-1973,'' an exhibit at the
Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, is a catalogue of a maligned
period of architectural experimentation and a window into the light
heart of 1960s weekend style. The houses on display, by architects
such as Peter Blake, Andrew Geller, Charles Gwathmey, Norman Jaffe
and Julian and Barbara Neski, are examples of that interesting
mid-century moment when American architecture had shaken the dogmas
of modernism, but had not yet calcified into postmodern pastiche.
By Philip Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   WEEKEND-GELLER (Undated) _ On the road in Long Island with the
architect Andrew Geller on a search for some of the innovative
beach houses he created in the 1950s and '60s. In fact, we are
looking for a lost period of civilization, a period of innocent
expectation, of family beach picnics, cole slaw, outdoor showers
and bunk beds, before real-estate prices skyrocketed, before the
traffic became unbearable, before setbacks or environmental
consciousness _ when houses could still be designed to burrow into
the side of a dune or hover over wetlands. By Alastair Gordon.

   MELISSA-BANK-FISHING (New York) _ Women identify with Melissa
Bank, whether she likes it or not. In the midst of a
whistle-stopping 16-city tour to promote her best-selling
thirty-something bildungsroman, ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and
Fishing'' (Viking), she has come face-to-face with eager readers
who all act as if they know her intimately. Not only that, many of
them seem to think she knows them really well, too. At book
signings, fans proffer their brand-new copies of the volume and ask
the first-time author to inscribe them: ``To my best friend.'' ``In
those cases,'' she says dryly ``I always write, `I feel so close to
you right now.''' By Julie Iovine.

   ELTHAM-PALACE (Eltham, England) _ Eltham Palace is one of the
greatest modernist houses in England, a country in which domestic
modernism was mostly a wan affair. Inside the restrained red brick
and stone building, 11 miles from the center of London, is a newly
restored platinum-blond Art Deco interior. The palace offers a rare
insight into what was avant-garde in the 1930s and is a tribute to
an idiosyncratic and modernist couple, Virginia and Stephen
Courtauld, philanthropists whose wealth was based on rayon. By June
Ducas.

FOLLOWING THE KENNEDY FLIGHT PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDON LIVINGSTON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Md. _ Similarities to the Greek myth of Icarus are
unavoidable. Icarus, son of Daedalus, tried with his father to
escape the captivity of King Minos of Crete. For their flight
Daedalus designed wings of feathers and wax. Against his father's
advice, Icarus flew too close to the sun. The wax melted, and he
fell into the sea near an island.
</P>
<P>
   The moral is either the dangers of impetuous youth or the
consequences of arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was 38 years old. Perhaps the second moral
applies. His early death, like that of his father, puts him on the
path toward legend. But before he passes into myth we might
remember Icarus and the risks of hubris.
</P>
<P>
   The sky, like the sea, is a terribly unforgiving place. The
third dimension of flight and the need to keep moving forward or
fall make it a risky place for those who do not know their limits.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes crash in this country on the average of one per week
because pilots have flown into weather they are not trained to
handle. That this was the cause of the Kennedy crash cannot be
known for certain until the investigation is complete, months from
now. Some mechanical failure is possible, though unlikely in a
4-year-old, well-maintained airplane.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. was an inexperienced pilot, only 14 months licensed. He
was flying a high-performance single-engine airplane that he had
just purchased in April, apparently for something in excess of
$300,000. There is an axiom in aviation circles about the
consequences of a pilot's money exceeding his skill.
</P>
<P>
   The critical fact is that he was not ``instrument rated,'' that
is, able to control the plane by reference to instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over water at night in the haze, he had no visual
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In these conditions one must rely on instruments. The body's
positional senses are unreliable and deceiving. Kennedy appears to
have crashed as he made the descent to the airport at Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. The last radar hits showed a dive at 4,700 feet per
minute from an altitude of 2,200 feet to 1,100 feet, consistent
with an aircraft out of control. Normal descent rate is 600 to 700
feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's first mistake, from which all else followed, was
launching from New Jersey into the hazy twilight. Each year when
accident statistics are compiled, the three primary causes that
reflect poor pilot judgment are: low-level ``buzzing,'' running out
of fuel and visual flight into instrument weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 86 percent of the latter accidents were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Many people regard small planes as inherently unsafe, especially
if they have only one engine. (``What if it stops?'') With
approximately one engine failure in every 100,000 hours flown, most
pilots would never experience one in 50 lifetimes of flying. In
general terms, cars are eight times more likely to have an accident
than small aircraft on a per-mile basis. When an airplane accident
occurs, however, it is eight times more likely to be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Some categories of pilots are more accident-prone than others.
Doctors, as a group, are more likely to have an accident than those
in other occupations. You can, I am sure, come up with a number of
plausible explanations, none of them flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes have not been kind to the Kennedy family. Joe Jr. died
during World War II when his bomber exploded over the English
Channel. His sister Kathleen died in a small-plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Kennedy was badly hurt in a private aircraft accident.
(His Chappaquiddick auto crash, fatal to his passenger 30 years ago
nearly to the day, is eerily similar in its recklessness and
location to JFK Jr.'s crash.)
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the latest installment in the Kennedy saga.
</P>
<P>
   We and this family appear locked in a permanent embrace of
celebrity and mourning. They are shot, fall from the sky, drive off
bridges, overturn cars and ski into trees.
</P>
<P>
   We seem unable to avert our eyes from them, living or dead.
</P>
<P>
   They have shown us the meaning of courage, grace and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   They are by turns beautiful and flawed. We have celebrated and
wept with them for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Would they, I wonder, be any different if we left them alone?

WHAT'S MISSING ON TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ When the NAACP speaks, the TV networks
listen. Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, recently criticized the four major
TV networks for not having enough African-American lead characters
in their shows. Faster than you can say ``must-see TV,'' network
bosses said, ``Yeah, that's right,'' or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said: ``Those of us in the entertainment industry need to
make sure the characters on our screen reflect the diversity of our
population as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said: ``Although we are proud of the minority representation
in many of NBC's dramas ... we realize that there is still work to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC said: ``We are making improvements in this area, and we
understand the need to do more. We are very sensitive on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Seinfeld might say, ``Yada, yada, yada.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this exchange is like a bad rerun _ warmed-over
platitudes in the ongoing American cultural wars.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume certainly has a point, but here's another perspective: The
representation of African-Americans on network TV shows, while
pathetic in some respects, is a lot better than that of, say,
Hispanics or Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   What major TV cop drama, current or past, has not had a black
lieutenant or captain in charge of a squad room mostly populated by
white actors? This character has become a cliche. Think ``NYPD
Blue,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Martial Law'' and ``Homicide: Life on
the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   If not the top-billed star, these characters are at least among
the top-tier of the ensemble casts of these shows. On network
comedies, Mfume is right on. Comedies are much more segregated than
dramas on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Images on TV shows may seem a trivial matter _ after all, it's
just TV _ but they carry symbolic weight in our nation's continuing
psychodrama over racial and ethnic issues.
</P>
<P>
   One theory holds that American culture should reflect the
nation's variety of people. Whether we like it or not, TV is a
major American cultural form. So if TV shows have all-white or
almost all-white casts, that must mean that black, brown, red and
yellow Americans and multiple shades in between don't count.
</P>
<P>
   A sub-theory is that TV and the movies should reflect the
reality of the nation's racial and ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   If that were so, however, then I wonder whether having
African-Americans as high-ranking police officials truly reflects
the reality of police hierarchies.
</P>
<P>
   Following this line, why don't major TV medical dramas like
``ER'' and ``Chicago Hope'' feature Asian-American characters as
doctors, nurses and medical technicians? Neither of those shows
does, when in fact if you walked into a Chicago hospital (the
locale of both dramas), you could hardly avoid seeing an
Asian-American doctor, nurse or technician.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics have legitimate gripes as well. Jimmy Smits and
Benjamin Bratt, two Latino stars, had leading roles in cop dramas,
but have gone on to other things. Few other shows have Hispanics in
lead parts.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, of course, is the bottom line _ money. TV shows
aren't on the air for art's sake or to make us feel good about
ourselves. They are vehicles to sell cars, computers, phone
service, soft drinks, beer and other goods of our materialistic
system.
</P>
<P>
   TV advertisers shy away from shows that have too many minority
characters because, they say, these shows aren't watched by
affluent white suburban audiences.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked an Asian-American who held a prominent
entertainment executive job why TV cop dramas had to have a black
lieutenant and why Asian-Americans aren't depicted as regulars on
medical shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple demographics'' was his simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   More than any civil rights group, money talks, especially on TV.

THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ON C-SPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Springer for Senate? Why not? Ohio elected
a senator who was farther out in space than Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Think how C-SPAN's ratings would soar.
</P>
<P>
   Think how entertaining impeachment trials could be, especially
if senators could be given lighter chairs, ones they could throw.
</P>
<P>
   Think how enlightened the Senate could become on issues such as
male lesbians, cross-dressing nudists and bosses who cheat on their
wives with young employees while conducting foreign affairs on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's right. We already did that show.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the drone about tax cuts and trade agreements? Let's
elect the entire collection of TV's professional talkers, uplifters
and smut-rakers to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie, Ricki, Jenny, Geraldo, Kathie Lee, Regis, Montel and
especially Oprah couldn't be worse than Trent, Jesse, Arlen ...
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I can't recall most of their first names, unlike the
big talkers people actually listen to.
</P>
<P>
   The radio talk jocks _ Howard, Imus, Rush and the rest _ can
have the House of Representatives. They'd be even nastier than the
people who are already there.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Howard Stern debating Dr. Laura Schlessinger on family
values. We might learn which one can say ``whore'' and ``slut'' the
most.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mills Lane, Judge Judy and Ed Koch can be the judicial
branch of government. Then we'd have Supreme Court decisions we
could understand, like ``Don't give me that free speech stuff,
buster.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry King could be president, but he already thinks he's God.
</P>
<P>
   Government of the talk-show hosts, by the talk-show hosts and
for the talk-show hosts. It makes sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   At least there is nothing fake or staged about Springer's new
political production, although there may be some overzealous
producers.
</P>
<P>
   High officials of the Democratic Party in Ohio have asked
Springer to consider challenging Republican Sen. Mike DeWine next
year for his Senate seat. Springer is on vacation and hasn't
commented yet. He's probably waiting to hear who hoots and boos,
and who cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's on a listening tour.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the logic of a Springer candidacy. If a wrestler can be
a governor, then a talk-show host who gets other people to wrestle
_ sometimes nude _ is surely qualified to be a senator.
</P>
<P>
   If you want partisan brawls, lively impeachments and really good
smut in the Senate, elect a professional. Government deserves
better ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Springer Democrats in Ohio are doing the kind of clear thinking
that comes with an age in which trash TV and filth politics have
merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Springer would be a viable, fascinating, interesting
candidate for the U.S. Senate,'' said David Burke, Democratic Party
chairman for Hamilton County, Ohio. ``Did you know his TV show is
the No. 2-rated television show in the world?''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-rated show is ``Baywatch,'' so maybe the Republicans
can get David Hasselhof to run. There's a guy who'd have the best
aides and interns, and all the better if they work on legislation
in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Springer even comes with political qualifications. He is a
former member of the Cincinnati City Council and was twice elected
that city's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   He was a big success despite Cincinnati's conservatism. He even
came back from a scandal as a councilman, when the cops caught him
visiting a prostitute in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   We need senators who are already tested in the crucible of sex
scandals. Best of all, Springer paid the prostitute with a check.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was stupid to give a signed check to a hooker, but he
talked her into taking a check. Who's dumber?
</P>
<P>
   Not only do most talk-show hosts come pre-scandaled, they are
highly qualified in the all-important area of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Springer seems gentle and innocent in interviews, and has said
most fights on his show weren't staged. The staged ones, he said,
were the results of a few ``over-zealous producers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he simply wants people to express themselves on his
show. You bet. One of the promotional gimcracks for his movie
``Ringmaster'' was a Band-Aid box over-zealously inscribed
``Seasons' beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hideous. But you know what they say. It takes a
dysfunctional village. And that's what America is.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tradition of beatings in the Senate, though. In 1856,
Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was beaten with a cane by the
nephew of a South Carolina senator Sumner had insulted. The brawl
wasn't staged. It took Sumner years to recover.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe fake fights are better in the Senate. Who better to
give them to us than a senator with bouncers as aides?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we need public officials who understand the true desires
of the American masses, and give us vast variety in smut instead of
endless repetition of one Arkansas heterosexual's pathetic
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vote the all-talk-show-host ticket. There's no carpetbagger
issue. These days things are in one bad state.

TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY WANTS 5-YEAR DEAL WITH IRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway plans to make the
beleaguered Pep Boys Indy Racing League part of its schedule for
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and general
manager, said yesterday he plans to renew the sanctioning agreement
with the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to sign up to a five-year sanctioning agreement
with them,'' Gossage said. ``We want everybody to know we believe
that firmly in open-wheel racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he has forwarded a letter to Tony George, the IRL's
founder and president, and executive director Leo Mehl, expressing
his desire to renew for two races a year. TMS played host to the
first night-time Indy-car race in modern history in June 1997. For
the past two years, TMS has played host to two IRL events. Gossage
successfully campaigned to have the season-ending IRL race moved
from Las Vegas Motor Speedway to TMS for 1999, and it is scheduled
for Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had tremendous success with the IRL,'' said Gossage,
whose races consistently have ranked second only to the Indy 500 in
drawing fans for the series. ``It's been too successful for us not
to continue to run them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only concerns with the IRL have been about safety matters.
They've addressed those. And they continue to address and improve
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's May 1 event at Lowe's Motor Speedway, TMS' sister
1.5-mile facility in Concord, N.C., was marred by the deaths of
three fans and injuries to eight more after a crash sent a wheel
and debris into the Turn 4 grandstands. The IRL since has
instituted a wheel-tethering system to prevent suspension parts
from leaving the car's tub area upon impact.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said Mehl showed him the IRL's latest version of the
tethering system last weekend at Atlanta Motor Speedway, site of
the series' Kobalt Mechanics Tools 500. TMS, AMS, Lowe's and Las
Vegas Motor Speedway _ all owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc. _
currently play host to five of 11 races on the 1999 IRL schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After the LMS tragedy, SMI uniformly raised the height of its
catch fences from 15 to 21 feet at its IRL facilities, and extended
the overhangs from three to six feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is not that we did not like the IRL or believe in
its stars,'' Gossage said. ``We wanted to be comfortable that the
cars are safe for fans and spectators alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he was not sure about the fate of IRL races at TMS'
sister facilities. Smith and H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, the president
of LMS, have been campaigning for the addition of fenders to IRL
cars as a safety measure. There is speculation the series might not
return to LMS next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you about our other speedways,'' Gossage said.
``But Bruton knows we want to continue to run 'em.''

GOLD THEFT NOT LINKED TO O'HAIR DISAPPEARANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The theft of almost $500,000 in gold coins from
a storage unit believed to have belonged to Madalyn Murray O'Hair
is not connected with the renowned atheist's disappearance, the FBI
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Rene Salinas of the San Antonio FBI office said three
men came forward in May and admitted breaking into the Austin
storage facility and stealing the coins.
</P>
<P>
   The men, whose names were withheld, said they broke into several
storage units and were unaware that they would find a gold stash in
one, Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just in the right place at the wrong time,'' he
said. ``One of them contacted us in May and gave it up. We do not
believe they are implicated in the homicides we are
investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained international fame for a lawsuit that, along with
another court case, led to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision
banning organized prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials continued their tight-lipped approach to their
investigation into the mysterious disappearances of O'Hair, her son
and her adopted daughter in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As they did during Easter weekend, when they combed a South
Texas ranch for the missing trio's bodies, FBI officials would not
even confirm that the O'Hairs are the subject of their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said the men involved in the coin theft, all of them
from San Antonio, are cooperating with authorities and have not
been charged. They told investigators that they stole the
Krugerrands, Canadian Maple Leafs and American Eagle coins in fall
1995 and converted them into cash through various pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   Only one coin was kept, melted down and made into a piece of
jewelry, Salinas said. That jewelry has been turned over to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The coins taken by the three men were worth $400,000 to $420,000
and were in a large suitcase in a storage rental unit in north
Austin, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and members of the Austin Police Department held
a news conference in San Antonio on Tuesday to seek the public's
help in finding about $80,000 in gold coins that are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Calls should be directed to the San Antonio office at (210)
225-6741.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Hair case has been troubling for authorities since the
trio vanished from their Austin home, leaving their uneaten
breakfast on the table.
</P>
<P>
   In April, authorities searched a sprawling ranch along the
Nueces River in Real County, presumably for the bodies of Madalyn
Murray O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray and Robin Murray O'Hair. No bodies
were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In May, officials released a March 23 affidavit in which an
Internal Revenue Service agent alleged that David Waters, a former
employee of O'Hair's atheist organization, masterminded a plot to
kill the trio and steal at least $600,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who pleaded guilty to federal firearms charges, has
denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, which cites unnamed sources, Waters
hated O'Hair and fantasized about seeing her suffer and ``snipping
off her toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The document alleges that Waters conspired with Gary Karr, now
imprisoned in Detroit; Danny Fry, who was killed shortly after the
O'Hairs vanished; and Gerald Lee Osborne of Fort Worth. Fry's
headless and handless body was found in Dallas County.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men has been charged in the O'Hair case.

 &HT;    NEW INTERNET SERVICE CONTAINS OWN CONTENT FILTERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Internet service that contains its own content
filters was launched Wednesday, giving parents a simpler, more
effective way to keep objectionable material away from children,
its backers said.
</P>
<P>
   This.com _ an Internet service provider like America Online or
Mindspring _ blocks unwanted Web sites, e-mail and chat rooms on
its own ``server'' computers, making it unnecessary for parents to
install filtering software on family home computers.
</P>
<P>
   The founders said at a Washington news conference that this.com,
which will cost $21.95 a month, would be ``the nation's first
Internet service provider dedicated to making the Internet a safe
place for children.''
</P>

   ``The user has less knowledge about what's being blocked. It's
sort of an invisible filter,'' said Larry Ottinger, an attorney for

<P>
   A parent might want such a service, said Ottinger, ``but it is
important for consumers to know what is being blocked out.''

   Since parents can decide whether or not to purchase an Internet
service provider with a built-in filter, Ottinger said, ``we don't
have the same constitutional concerns as we did with government
mandating filtering.''

<P>
   If parents want to turn the filter off while searching the
Internet themselves, they can do so by using a password, said
Daniel, who was a co-founder of the Gerald Stevens retail floral
and gift chain before becoming head of the new Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.-based service.
</P>
<P>
   He said the artificial intelligence filtering system is being
augmented by focus groups of parents across the country in deciding
what Internet sites to block. ``If the site contains pornography,
depictions of sexual acts, violence, criminal acts, hate,
discrimination or profanity, the this.com will filter the offending

 &HT;    NEW INTERNET SERVICE CONTAINS OWN CONTENT FILTERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ An Internet service that contains its own content
filters was launched Wednesday, giving parents a simpler, more
effective way to keep objectionable material away from children,
its backers said.
</P>
<P>
   This.com _ an Internet service provider like America Online or
Mindspring _ blocks unwanted Web sites, e-mail and chat rooms on
its own ``server'' computers, making it unnecessary for parents to
install filtering software on family home computers.
</P>
<P>
   The founders said at a Washington news conference that this.com,
which will cost $21.95 a month, would be ``the nation's first
Internet service provider dedicated to making the Internet a safe
place for children.''

brine and storing them in the refrigerator means doing away with
clumsy sterilizing equipment. And with good, fresh produce
available year 'round, there is no need to ``put things up'' to
last all winter. You can just whip up a little batch of pickles or

 Vodka Kicks Up Flavors of North Beach Pasta   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  North Beach Restaurant's recipe for spaghetti with
vodka is 100 percent proof that simple is best.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sauce has just eight ingredients. Onion, cream and butter
weigh in on the sweet side of the equation. Vodka gives a peppery
kick, and Parmesan cheese fills in the flavor holes with its sharp,
salty nuances. It's truly simple, and simply delicious.
</P>
<P>
   This pasta is the type of basic recipe that adapts well to
interpretation and additions. You can add herbs, vegetables such as
peas or broccoli rabe, and meat such as pancetta.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Bruno Orsi serves hundreds of plates of his simple
straightforward pastas everyday. Simple has always been his
hallmark but he still takes the time to make his own prosciutto in
the basement below the dining room.
</P>

 There's No Topping Old Fashioned Ketchup   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Ketchup went gourmet five or six years ago when
several companies come out with natural or upscale versions of one
of America's favorite condiments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that gourmet revolution may have fallen flat. When The
Chronicle's tasting panel sampled the upscale varieties along with
several brands of standard old-fashioned ketchup, they didn't
measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 11 ketchups ranging from familiar brands
like Heinz and Del Monte to those labeled organic or natural. Not
surprisingly, prices differed a great deal. The high-end brands had
price tags as high as $2.99 for 13 1/2 ounces. Others were as low
as 99 cents for 28 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   None of the upscale varieties scored high enough to rate.
Panelists thought that most tasted either burned or as if they had
been made with underripe tomatoes. Many tasted more of sweet spices
like mace than of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The panel overwhelmingly favored  &UR; Safeway &LR;  (20 ounces, $1.39).
It becomes the highest rated product of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists particularly liked the balance of acidity to
sweetness; others commented on the good tomato flavor. All would
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Heinz &LR;  (14 ounces, $1.59 at Andronico's).
Two panelists thought the texture was slightly pasty, but others
liked the peppery, piquant flavor. One panelist noted that it
wasn't as sweet as Safeway, but didn't consider that a fault. All
would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Springfield &LR;  (28 ounces, $1.69 at Andronico's) came in third.
Two panelists detected a tinny flavor, but others liked the
exceptionally smooth texture. One panelist liked its pleasant smoky
notes. Three would buy it; two might.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Hunt's  &LR; (24 ounces, $1.49-$1.89 at many
supermarkets). One taster felt it lacked structure and wasn't as
full-bodied as other brands. Three others thought it was acidic,
but most liked the flavor. Three would buy it, one might buy it,
and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining brands tasted ranked far below fourth but the best
of the rest was  &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (28 ounces, 99 cents), the least
expensive brand tasted. Two panelists thought it was too acidic.
Another described it as overspiced, while another thought it was
bland. One panelist thought it tasted more like jam than ketchup.
One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte, Muir Glen, Westbrae Un-Ketchup, Westbrae
Fruit-Sweetened, Millina's Finest and Robbie's faired too low to
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna
Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park, and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 Landing Sand Dabs Means Fishing With Finesse   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  On any given day, some 15 miles off the Northern
California coast, you can find Steve Fitz coaxing thousands of tiny
sand dabs into a huge net.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the end of the day, he might have pulled 8,000 pounds of the
little chocolate brown flounders from the deep waters near the
Monterey Bay canyons or the Farallon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Fitz, who has a degree in English and 18 years of West Coast
sand dab fishing under his belt, is by all accounts the premier
sand dab fisherman in Northern California. He runs his 68-foot
former shrimper, the Mr. Morgan, out of Half Moon Bay, fishing
almost exclusively for that most San Franciscan of fish, the sand
dab.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fish have a firmness to them,'' explains Phil Bruno of
Exclusive Fresh Inc., who sells about 20,000 pounds of Fitz's sand
dabs a week on the West Coast. ``There is no scale loss and the
bellies are intact. They're not bruised.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishmongers say Fitz's sand dabs are the best because of the
relatively gentle method he uses to catch them. And with the
delicate, bony sand dab, gentleness matters. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   The fish are smaller than most of their flounder kin. At a pound
or less each, they're more akin to rex sole (also a flounder) than
a petrale sole, which can weigh as much as five pounds. Some East
Coast sand dab fisheries exist, but the fish caught in Atlantic
waters are large flounders, genetically different from West Coast
sand dabs and weighing up to two pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dabs are caught year-round, although the fishery slows down
in winter when colder temperatures and storms drive the fish
farther offshore into deeper water.
</P>
<P>
   How the sand dab came to be a California _ and particularly a
San Francisco _ menu staple isn't well documented, but people in
the fish and restaurant business say the sand dab is a fish of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dabs became popular among Italian fisherman who immigrated
to the Bay Area. They weren't always big sellers, but the Italians
liked to salt and dry them like cod or saute them with garlic. They
remain a constant at old-school San Francisco restaurants like
Tadich Grill and Sam's Grill, and also are experiencing resurgence
at trendier restaurants interested in showcasing local fish.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of immigrants is helping the sand dab's popularity,
and Fitz credits some of his increased business to the rise in the
Bay Area Asian population. A lot of his catch goes directly to
Vietnamese and Chinese markets, where he believes the quality of
his fish makes them stand out.
</P>
<P>
   To keep a sand dab in perfect condition, you have to treat it
well from the start, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dabs are bottom dwellers that swim the long, sandy sea
floor just this side of the Continental shelf. But unlike most
halibut or flounders that feed off the bottom, sand dabs shoot up
into the water during the day to eat organisms swirling closer to
the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Fitz's fishing method is markedly different from many
bottom-fish operations. Often, bottom fish are caught by trawlers
that drag the ocean floor at a fairly fast clip, a large net
holding the catch for hours until it is lifted from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Fitz uses a Scottish seine method. A weighted polypropylene rope
that stretches out about two and half miles is dropped to the
bottom in a rough diamond shape. Fitz's boat slowly pulls the rope
along the floor, which kicks up little clouds of mud. When the fish
see the cloud, they instinctively herd away from the rope toward
the center of the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional dragging methods, the pressure created as the
net is pulled rapidly through the water essentially sandblasts some
fish and suffocates others that get pushed against the net itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dabs can't withstand that sort of treatment, Fitz says.
Rather, the gentle motion of the rope tickles the fish to the
center, where they swim freely until the net is pulled shut and
lifted to the surface. The fish spend only a few minutes in the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a finesse fishery,'' Fitz says.
</P>
<P>
   He and his crew _ Jay Dykens and nephew Stevie Fitz _ hand sort
the fish into 100-pound boxes and lower them into a hold chilled to
33 degrees. By that afternoon, the fish are at a supplier, being
pan-dressed for restaurants, fishmongers and supermarkets like
Draeger's, Whole Foods and Mollie Stone's.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-dressing involves gutting the fish and removing the head and
fins and sometimes the tail. Filleting sand dabs is a difficult
and, some would argue, futile task. Some experts suggest it's
better to fry a pan-dressed sand dab quickly on each side, then
gently lift the backbone, starting tail first, to remove the bones.
(See sidebar.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfilleted sand dabs are regulars at Fitz's house, where they
get boned after they come out of a hot saute pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a week we have a dab dinner out of respect,'' he says.
``I like to pan fry them fairly hot with butter and garlic so they
brown and then squeeze on a lot of lemon. If you cook them right
and leave the tail on, you can literally flip them from one side to
the other and the meat falls off.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Remember It's Key to Trim a Sand Dab &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Don't let the bones keep you from enjoying the delicate, mild flesh
of the sand dab. As any good San Francisco waiter will tell you,
boning a sand dab looks trickier than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The key is in the preparation. At Sam's Grill (374 Bush St.,
near Kearny), sand dabs have been a staple for almost a century. To
make boning easy, chef Andy Cravalho trims about a quarter-inch all
around a fish that has already had its head, tail and fins removed.
</P>
<P>
   After heating canola oil in a saute pan, lightly dusting the
fish in flour, salt and pepper, he pan fries them for about three
minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he runs a table knife lightly along the back bone from
tail to neck and flips the meat onto a platter. With one swift but
gentle motion, he grabs the bone near the tail, lifts it from the
remaining meat and slips the second fillet onto the platter
skin-side down. The dish is finished with butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is you have to do that trimming first,'' Cravalho
says. ``Then you have to just have some confidence.''

   &UR; Macy Gray makes &LR;   &UR; a scene, then a CD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _  &QL; 
Macy Gray's tuneful r&AMP;b-fueled debut is drawing the kinds of
reviews you don't normally expect for a relatively unknown artist.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray has been at the center of her own musical universe for
several years. ``Macy Gray on How Life Is'' (Clean Slate/Epic), due
Tuesday, grew out of countless jams and listening sessions in
living rooms, studios and rehearsal spaces around Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gray even created her own after-hours hangout she dubbed The We
Ours at an all-night, 100-capacity Hollywood cafe. The weekend
event, which featured open mics, live music and guest DJs, drew the
likes of Tricky, the Roots and Garbage chanteuse Shirley Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started it because we'd get out of the studio real late, and
there was nowhere to go,'' the Van Nuys resident said. ``Word
spread, and it grew. We used to play there every week, but because
the place was so small, we stripped down our 12-piece band to a
quartet with new arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's engaging blend of straight-up soul and modern hip-hop is
a result of her parents' record collection. Raised in Canton, Ohio,
she soaked up the sweet sounds of Sly Stone, James Brown, Marvin
Gaye and, especially, Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best cuts on ``How Life Is,'' such as ``Do
Something'' and ``Still,'' recall the gritty vocals of Aretha
Franklin and Tina Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The album was produced with Andrew Slater, known for mining gold
from Fiona Apple and the Wallflowers. Musicians included ex-Chili
Peppers guitarist Arik Marshall and seasoned soulsters like
ex-Funkadelic guitarist Blackbird McKnight and Tower of Power
percussionist Lenny Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real big hangout,'' Gray, 29, said. ``The spirit was
great. Everyone just wanted to play. It was kind of a new style for
everyone.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Getting testy over `Titanic' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Go-Go's say they were unaware of any other punk-rock
versions of the ``Titanic'' theme after local girl-group the
Switchblade Kittens complained their idea had been lifted. The
Go-Go's Charlotte Caffey said she and guitarist Jane Wiedlin came
up with the idea to perform an upbeat version of ``My Heart Will Go
On'' at least 18 months ago, ``and one day at rehearsal, we decided
to learn it.'' The single-named Drama, a member of the Kittens,
whose ``Titanic'' theme has been available on the Web at
www.switchbladekittens.com for about a year, said she thought of it
earlier, adding: ``What happened to punk sisterhood?''  &QL;

 CHRON  
 How to Keep as Cool as a Refrigerator Pickle   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; It's such a wonderful image: the cook, wearing a
light cotton frock (can we make it gingham?) and sweltering in the
kitchen as the fragrance of summer fruit and the pungency of brines
and vinegary spice infusions permeate the steamy air. And later,
pantry shelves stacked with hand-labeled jars of jams and pickles,
preserves and relishes that promise to extend the bounty of summer
into the dreary winter months.
<P>
   The trouble with such Norman Rockwell pictures is that they bear
little resemblance to our late-century reality. Who, after all, has
the time and energy for all that cutting and brining, the laborious
preparation of equipment, the water baths and testing of rubber
rings and checking for tight seals?
</P>
<P>
   The death knell to the American tradition of home preserving
might have been heard a couple of years ago when the revised,
enlarged sixth edition of ``All New All Purpose Joy of Cooking''
appeared without a chapter on preserving. The editors at Scribner
felt that even with the renewed passion for  &LR; Americana &LR;  _ mashed
potatoes, roast chicken, meat loaf, root beer floats and fruit
cobblers _ modern cooks simply wouldn't bother with this
time-consuming activity.
</P>
<P>
   We beg to differ. When farmers' market bins overflow with shiny
peppers and perky little gherkins and the fragrance of sun-ripened
apricots wafts toward our nostrils, we still get that urge to make
a little jam, a relish, a pickle. Fortunately, it can be done
without all the drudgery of old.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving foods in an easy-to-mix brine and storing them in the
refrigerator means doing away with clumsy sterilizing equipment,
pots, racks and Mason jars. And with good, fresh produce available
year 'round, there is no need to ``put things up'' to last all
winter. We can just whip up a little batch of pickles or relish to
enjoy almost immediately. Prodigious amounts of acid, and sometimes
sugar, keep these concoctions safe in the refrigerator for up to a
week or two.
</P>
<P>
   These simple preparations make wonderful snacks (low-calorie,
too), piled on a piece of baguette. And they add panache to the
simplest meal off the grill.
</P>
<P>
   My family has scarfed up gallons of zucchini pickles ever since
a friend brought a jar to a cabin barbecue some 20 years ago. With
a few alterations, we still use her easy recipe.
</P>
<P>
   From Germany, we acquired pickled mushrooms. Woodsy chanterelles
are particularly interesting, but even inexpensive brown button
mushrooms add a piquant touch to a rib steak or an unadorned piece
of grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   Diners with long memories may remember the craze for dilly beans
some 30-plus years ago. People even dunked them in martinis, a
practice we are loathe to revive. But we certainly love crisp
pickled beans and Southern-style preserved okra. Put them on a
plate with some crackly small radishes, a handful of golden cherry
tomatoes, a few slices of salami or prosciutto and some fresh
mozzarella, and you have a very '90s antipasto platter.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons to recommend these quickie pickles
besides their intriguing taste. Even though they are not meant to
be kept a long time, you can make them at your leisure. A mandoline
or food processor _ the thin slicing disk for cucumbers and onions,
the shredding disk for zucchini _ make preparation a snap. And the
price is right _ most of these recipes can be made for a fraction
of the cost of fancy imported pickles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Tips for Safe Pickle Making &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pickling can be a ticklish project. The methods Aunt Gertie
used, the canning equipment you inherited when Mom moved to a
condo, even the instructions you saved from that box of pectin you
bought in an ambitious moment 10 years ago may all seem helpful.
And, according to the latest food science findings, they may all be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As insight into the nature of food-borne bacteria has increased,
new cautions have been sounded. That's the bad news. The good news
is that high-acid refrigerator pickles are not prone to the same
sorts of contamination that can plague low-acid fruits and
vegetables intended to be stored for a long time. But no matter the
pickling method, these tips will help ensure a safe, successful
product.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ Use the freshest, highest-quality produce available and fresh,
aromatic spices. Avoid over-the-hill, mushy produce or zucchini
that have outgrown their intended size. The success of pickling can
only be as good as the ingredients used.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always use meticulously clean jars. Wash jars and lids with
hot soapy water (the short cycle of the dishwasher is fine) and
rinse with boiling water just before filling. To cleanse them, you
can also place water-filled pint jars in the microwave and process
them at high for 3 minutes. Take care not to burn your hands when
removing and emptying.
</P>
<P>
   _ For freezer pickles, use small plastic containers with
tight-fitting lids or self-sealing plastic bags. Always allow some
room for the food to expand as it freezes. Defrost in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make pickles in small batches that you will use up within a
week or so _ that's the whole point of these preparations. Don't
exceed specified refrigerator time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refrigerate leftovers. If a pickle has been sitting out for
more than two hours, discard it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you notice any kind of mold, fizziness or changed color or
odor, discard the pickles. Remember the wise old food adage still
holds: When in doubt, throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FREEZER CUCUMBER MANGO PICKLES
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a group of freezer pickles from Linda Ziedrich's
book, ``The Joy of Pickling,'' (Harvard Common Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds pickling cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   1 barely ripe mango, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup thinly sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pickling salt or white sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Gently wash the cucumbers; slice thinly (this can be done
quickly with the thinnest slicing disk of a food processor or on a
mandoline), discarding a slice from both ends of the cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   This will yield about 7 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the cucumber slices, mango cubes and the onions with the
salt in a large bowl. Let stand 2 to 3 hours, then drain well in a
colander.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together the pepper flakes, ginger, allspice, sugar and
vinegar in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Return the drained vegetables to the large bowl and pour the
liquid over them. Cover and refrigerate 8 to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pack the mixture into freezer bags or rigid containers,
distributing the solids and liquid evenly; freeze 1 day to several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Thaw the pickles in the refrigerator 8 hours before serving and
serve ice cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 pints.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The calories and other nutrients absorbed from pickling brines &LR; 
 &LR; vary and are difficult to estimate. Variables include the type &LR; 
 &LR; of food, marinating time and amount of surface area. Therefore, &LR; 
 &LR; these pickle recipes contain no analysis. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; ZUCCHINI IN A PICKLE
</P>
<P>
   A jar of this makes a great picnic take-along _ it complements
everything from the grill. You can even spoon a little on burgers
or sandwiches in lieu of pickle relish.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds small zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt; more for extracting liquid from vegetable
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 Vidalia or other sweet onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Wash the zucchini and trim off the ends. Finely shred the
zucchini with a grater or in a food processor. Place the zucchini
in a colander or sieve and sprinkle lightly with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Place over a bowl and allow the zucchini to drain for 20 to 30
minutes. Squeeze lightly to extract more liquid and place in a dry
bowl. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Core the bell pepper and cut into fine strips; peel and thinly
slice the onion. Add the bell pepper and the onion to the bowl; mix
lightly. Add the vinegar and the sugar; mix again.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mixture to a quart-size jar with a tight-fitting
lid. Refrigerate at least 5 hours or as long as 7 days,
occasionally turning the jar upside down. Taste before serving and
add more salt if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

<P>
   Combine the cabbage and onion in a medium bowl and cover with
the hot brine. Cool to room temperature; cover tightly and
refrigerate 1 to 5 days. Drain before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; PICKLED CHANTERELLES
</P>
<P>
   This is a traditional German recipe. You may substitute other
wild mushrooms _ even brown cultivated mushrooms _ though
chanterelles are particularly delicious. This is frequently served
with venison and game birds, but also goes well with roast beef,
steak, even meat loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound chanterelles or other mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 two-inch piece cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon peppercorns, lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoon mustard seed
</P>
<P>
   6 whole allspice berries
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Wash the mushrooms thoroughly; remove the stems, reserve for
another use. Cut the mushrooms in half if they are small; cut them
in quarters if they are large.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the vinegar, salt, sugar, cinnamon stick, peppercorns,
mustard seeds, allspice and bay leaves in a nonreactive medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat
and add the mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   When the mixture is cool, remove the cinnamon stick and the bay
leaves. Transfer the mushrooms and their liquid to a jar or other
container with a tight-fitting lid. Refrigerate 1 to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Taste before serving; add salt if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound yellow wax beans
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 dried cayenne chile (or other red chile)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup white wine or cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Top and tail the beans; peel and cut the garlic in half; slice
the chile in half lengthwise and remove the seeds unless you want a
very spicy pickle. Place the beans upright in a nonreactive
container with a tight-fitting lid. Place the garlic, chile,
coriander seeds, peppercorns and bay leaf between the beans.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the vinegar, wine, water, salt and sugar in a
nonreactive small pan. Boil the mixture 1 minute. Pour the liquid
over the beans; let them cool.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the container and refrigerate for 3 days to 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

OLD SOUTH OKRA
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Damon Lee Fowler's ``Beans, Greens and Sweet
Georgia Peaches,'' (Broadway Books, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound young okra
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, peeled, sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   2 dried cayenne chiles (or other red chiles), seeded
</P>
<P>
   11/4 teaspoons mustard seed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Remove the stems from the okra and rub off the fuzz under cold
water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the okra
and when the water returns to a boil, cook for 2 minutes. Drain the
okra in a colander and immediately cool under cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Pack the okra into a large jar, placing the sliced garlic, dill
sprigs and chiles between the okra.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the mustard seed, peppercorns, vinegar, water and salt
in a nonreactive pan and bring to a boil. Pour the liquid over the
okra; let it cool, then tightly cover the jar. Refrigerate 1 to 7
days.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TAMED ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   This is an adaptation of an Apulian recipe in Faith Willinger's
``Red, White &AMP; Greens,'' (HarperCollins, 1999). The longer you
marinate the onions, the milder they become. Try this with polenta
or boiled new potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 large red onions
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons capers, preferably salt-packed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   White vinegar to cover
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Peel the onions, slice them paper thin. Rinse the capers and
drain. Pack the onions and the capers into a container with a
tight-fitting lid. Sprinkle with salt and pepper between the
layers. Cover with vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Close the container and refrigerate at least 20 minutes, or as
long as a day. Drain before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

   There are few deliciously old-fashioned treats you can whip up
in the kitchen more easily than jams _ freezer jams, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Freezer jams require none of the paraphernalia of conventionally
cooked jams and preserves. They are simply fruit, cleaned, crushed
and mixed with sugar, pectin and a little lemon juice, packed into
clean containers (see related story) and stashed in the freezer.
They will bring the very essence of summer to the breakfast table
for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Pair these jams with good commercial ice cream and crushed
amaretti or other crunchy cookies for a quick dessert. A swirl of
whipped cream on top looks and tastes great.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FREEZER PEACH JAM
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The New Good Housekeeping Cookbook,'' (Hearst
Books, 1986). It also works with sweet red plums or apricots.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 pounds ripe peaches
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   5 cups cane sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 (13/4-ounce) package powdered fruit pectin
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Using a slotted spoon,
submerge each peach in boiling water for a few seconds. Cool for a
moment under running tap water, then slip off the peach skins.
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely chop the peaches, discarding the pits, and place them
in a large bowl. You should have 21/2 cups fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Crush the peaches with a potato masher or large spoon. You may
also chop them in a food processor, as long as you use brief on/off
pulses and don't liquefy the fruit. Add the lemon juice, sugar and
salt and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the pectin with the 3/4 cup water in a medium saucepan,
bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 1 minute. Add to the
peaches and stir for 3 minutes. Or, put the peaches and the pectin
mixture into a food processor and process with several on/off
pulses.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle the jam into 8 eight-ounce jars or food-quality plastic
containers with tight-fitting lids. Leave about 1/2 inch head
space. Wipe off any spills on the rims of the containers with wet
paper towels. Close the containers and leave them at room
temperature overnight to cool and set.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, refrigerate the containers you plan to use
within the next 3 weeks. Freeze the remaining containers for up to
9 months. Defrost frozen jam in the refrigerator overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 8 cups.

   WEEKEND-HOUSES (Amagansett, N.Y.) _ ``Weekend Utopia: The Modern
Beach House on Eastern Long Island, 1960-1973,'' an exhibit at the
Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, is a catalogue of a maligned
period of architectural experimentation and a window into the light
heart of 1960s weekend style. The houses on display, by architects
such as Peter Blake, Andrew Geller, Charles Gwathmey, Norman Jaffe
and Julian and Barbara Neski, are examples of that interesting
mid-century moment when American architecture had shaken the dogmas
of modernism, but had not yet calcified into postmodern pastiche.

<P>
   WEEKEND-GELLER (Undated) _ On the road in Long Island with the
architect Andrew Geller on a search for some of the innovative
beach houses he created in the 1950s and '60s. In fact, we are
looking for a lost period of civilization, a period of innocent
expectation, of family beach picnics, cole slaw, outdoor showers
and bunk beds, before real-estate prices skyrocketed, before the
traffic became unbearable, before setbacks or environmental
consciousness _ when houses could still be designed to burrow into
the side of a dune or hover over wetlands. By Alastair Gordon.

   MELISSA-BANK-FISHING (New York) _ Women identify with Melissa
Bank, whether she likes it or not. In the midst of a
whistle-stopping 16-city tour to promote her best-selling
thirty-something bildungsroman, ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and
Fishing'' (Viking), she has come face-to-face with eager readers
who all act as if they know her intimately. Not only that, many of
them seem to think she knows them really well, too. At book
signings, fans proffer their brand-new copies of the volume and ask
the first-time author to inscribe them: ``To my best friend.'' ``In
those cases,'' she says dryly ``I always write, `I feel so close to
you right now.''' By Julie Iovine.

greatest modernist houses in England, a country in which domestic
modernism was mostly a wan affair. Inside the restrained red brick

restored platinum-blond Art Deco interior. The palace offers a rare
insight into what was avant-garde in the 1930s and is a tribute to
an idiosyncratic and modernist couple, Virginia and Stephen
Courtauld, philanthropists whose wealth was based on rayon. By June

 &HT;    Stock-up time for Belle and Sebastian fans
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This music originally saw the light of day on a vinyl-only
edition of 1,000 copies, released more than three years ago. Then
the Scottish combo's second release, ``If You're Feeling
Sinister,'' was unleashed to critical gushing and a slavishly
devoted fan base.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked as if ``Tigermilk'' would remain a fan's
scratchy fifth-generation cassette or a collector's holy grail _
those vinyl copies were changing hands for hundreds of dollars.
Thankfully, the band decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   As for the music, don't expect the critical praise to stop here.
Primary songwriter Stuart Murdoch's lyrics speak directly to the
high school outcast with a penchant for ``making life-size models
of the Velvet Underground in clay.'' The songs are yearningly
romantic, sparkling amalgams of folkie '60s psychedelia and '80s
indie pop.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this early work is how much of
the band's style and substance was already fully developed. The
only drawback is the occasional flirtation with
electronics.``Tigermilk'' can't match the perfect statement that
``If You're Feeling Sinister'' would make a year later, but it's
not too far short of that mark. ``Tigermilk''

 &HT;    Brazilian guitarist transcends language, musical genres
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most appealing things about Brazilian singer Caetano
Veloso is the way his albums at once embrace and transcend the
notion of pop. The beauty of breathy insinuations phrased in
Portuguese, of course, is that the language's natural sensuality
lets you get away with a lot. So on his latest CD ``Livro''
(``Book''), the 56-year-old poet and '60s cultural radical covers
subjects unthinkable in the contemporary American hit parade. He
restates the mythic-yet-historical saga of Alexander the Great and
offers a brutally vivid epic of a slave ship in the Middle Passage,
yet also sings the praises of his peers (a tune each for Antonio
Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto), pines for ``the hottest mulatta
girl in Bahia'' and works in a rebuke to ``You harpy, spider ...
You slut, you piranha'' in a song that warns, ``My samba will put
you in your place.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear all of this, though, shot through with Bahian percussion
(popularized here by Paul Simon on ``The Rhythm of the Saints''),
made diaphanous by strings and lent an Ellingtonian texture by
seductive brass and reed arrangements, is to delight at the way one
performer can reconcile so many different kinds of music into such
an intoxicating flow. As seemingly complex as this can become, it
sounds effortless _ a sun-kissed invitation to subtropical desire,
indigenous grooves and postmodern thinking.

   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Leading off your album with a track called ``Perfect'' is just
begging for trouble. You can hear jaded music critics sneering,
```Perfect,' huh? We'll see about that.'' But Atlanta
singer-songwriter Doria Roberts' sophomore effort comes as close to
flawless as a low-budget indie release can get. Roberts'
mesmerizing voice, which grafts the whip-smart elocution of Ani
DiFranco to the soul of Lauryn Hill, draws you in. Her evocative
meditations on love and hanging out, along with the warm production
by longtime Atlanta folkie Dede Vogt, hold you. Just listen to the
brawny cello countermelody on the title track or the sumptuous bass
line (supplied by Vogt) on ``Bluebird.'' If that's not perfection,
I don't know what is.

   Drop a piece of wood in a body of water and it'll sink, float
back up and then just bob above and beneath the surface. Much like
``The Wood'' soundtrack. It makes a splash with the spirited
matchup of rappers Mystikal and Outkast on ``Neck Uv Da Woods.''
Then there's the desperate gasp for album filler: Blackstreet's
lazy reworking of its remix of Janet Jackson's ``I Get Lonely''
into ``Think About You.'' And the Roots step in next, saving this
effort from the stop button with the rap band's well-written boast,
``Ya' All Know Who!'' Throughout, ``The Wood'' never thuds; it just
floats along with enough likable songs (Joe's ``I Wanna Know'') to
buoy the occasional bottom feeder (Night &AMP; Day's ``Dante's Girl'').

<P>
   Lil' Cease's name was established in Notorious B.I.G.'s raps,
but when B.I.G was shot dead in the seat beside him in 1997, he
still hadn't established himself as an individual talent. In the
nine-member hip-hop act Junior M.A.F.I.A., he was the
swollen-tongued one with the lisp, who went on to prove himself
quite comical on the million-selling team-up with Lil' Kim, ``Get
Money.'' Guess Cease figured combos were what worked for him, as
only one or two of the 21 tracks features Cease A Leo alone. ``Puff
Daddy'' (``Need a Lady''), Jay-Z (``4 My (expletive)'') and
countless other rappers and R&AMP;B singers share space on this lengthy
introduction to a world as crowded with guest appearances as it is
fun singles.

 &HT;    Character study of a criminal chilling
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The General'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Director John Boorman (``Hope and Glory'') is back in fine form
with this cocksure character study of celebrated Irish criminal
Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson). It copped Boorman the best
director prize at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with Cahill's death in 1994. An assailant guns
him down in front of his home. This is a bit suspicious, because he
was under 24-hour police surveillance. News of the death draws
cheers at the nearby precinct, with congratulations extended to the
Javert-like inspector (Jon Voight) who dogged him for years. The
rest of the film is essentially a flashback, beginning with his
childhood as a petty thief (Eamonn Owens of ``The Butcher Boy'')
pinching rolls for his starving family.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Cahill becomes a folk hero of sorts in Dublin,
known for his roguish ways and daring robberies. But Boorman and
his star refuse to romanticize this gangster-rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson, with his stocky build and soccer-thug eyes, plays
Cahill with a disarming child-man spark. He's a true eccentric. Yet
underneath the hearty geniality lies a vicious streak that erupts
with chilling intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman shot the film in sparkling black and white but be
forewarned: VHS tapes are being released with a process called
``desaturated color,'' which appears to be the technical term these
days for ``colorization.'' Luckily, DVD retains Boorman's
black-and-white cinematography. Grade: A-

example of morbidity chic from the screenwriter of ``Seven'' and
the guy who killed the ``Batman'' franchise, director Joel

 &HT;    DEFECTS ABOUND IN MANUFACTURED HOUSING, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than three-quarters of mobile home owners have
``significant problems'' with their defects in their homes,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While 95 percent of mobile homes have warranties, only one-third
of the defective homes were successfully repaired under them, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Problems include construction, installation, and systems and
appliances, according to the study conducted on behalf of AARP,
formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, the nation's
largest organization for people 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fisher, a senior research adviser for AARP, said most of
the problems reported are serious ones covered by federal
manufacturing standards, such as cracking walls, leaking ceilings
and doors and windows that don't fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 60 percent of the worst problems, all under federal
regulations, either were never fixed or were fixed at considerable
expense to the home owners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questioned 933 mobile home owners nationwide who had
purchased manufactured housing within the past eight years. Census
figures indicate that 43 percent of all mobile homes were located
in the Southeast last year.
</P>
<P>
   AARP President Joe Perkins said federal standards for the
manufacturing of mobile homes are not being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufactured housing is affordable housing, but there is more
to affordability than a low price,'' he said. ``Mobile home buyers
are not protected sufficiently now and will not be in the future
without tougher standards.''
</P>
<P>
   AARP supports proposed legislation sponsored by Rep. Rick Lazio,
R-N.Y., that would create a committee to periodically update mobile
home construction standards as new manufacturing technologies come
along. The AARP has also recommended requiring a five-year
manufacturing warranty for mobile homes and a two-year installation
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mobile home manufacturers are not required to offer a
warranty. Perkins said that in order for legislation to protect
current and future owners, ``it must include a requirement for a
comprehensive manufactured housing warranty and a guarantee of
properly performed installation.''

 &HT;    Papa at 100: His work lives on in print, on film
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago this month, Ernest Hemingway was born.
Thirty-eight years ago this month, Ernest Hemingway died. A
suicide. In the intervening years, he became a world-famous writer,
won the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes and saw most of his work turned
into movies. Because bar-crawling in Havana and shooting endangered
species in Africa aren't as easy as they once were, why not try a
video homage to Papa's memory?
</P>
<P>
   ``A FAREWELL TO ARMS'' (1932)
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes play ill-fated lovers _ an American
ambulance driver and an English nurse _ in Italy during World War
I. The 1957 remake starred Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Fredric March and Claudette Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: Coop was paid a mere $15,000 because he was a
mere movie star; Hayes, imported from the theater, got $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: He wasn't exactly thrilled that,
unlike in his book, Hayes' character lives. When the film was
re-released in 1948, she quite properly died (two endings had been
shot). In a letter to a friend, Hemingway also protested other
changes: ``The movie hero deserts because his girlfriend won't
write him any letters. When he goes to look for her, the entire
army tags along so he won't get lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FOR WHOM
</P>
<P>
   THE BELL TOLLS'' (1943)
</P>
<P>
   Cooper plays a soldier of fortune fighting the Fascists in Spain
and becomes romantically involved with a fiery Spanish peasant
(Ingrid Bergman).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Coop, who by then was a Hemingway buddy, and
Vera Zorina, a ballet dancer. After viewing the early rushes, the
filmmakers switched to Bergman _ who was, incidentally, the
novelist's first choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: Hemingway was paid $150,000 for the rights to
his book. David O. Selznick was paid the same amount for loaning
out Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: Bergman recalled that Hemingway
told her he saw the movie five times. It was not a compliment:
``After I'd seen the first five minutes, I couldn't stand it any
longer so I walked out. ... Later I went back again because I
thought I must see the whole movie and I saw a bit and again I
walked out. It took me five visits to see that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE KILLERS'' (1946)
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's short story is stretched into a neat film noir
starring Burt Lancaster as an ex-boxer, the doomed target of two
hired killers, and Ava Gardner as the woman who done him wrong.
Loosely reworked by Don Siegel in 1964 with Lee Marvin and, in his
last Hollywood role, Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Lancaster was a virtual unknown, so the
studio tested ``bigger'' stars _ such as Wayne Morris and Sonny
Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: One reason Morris wasn't cast was that his
studio wanted $75,000 for the loan-out. Lancaster could be had for
$2,500 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: According to Gardner, another
Hemingway chum, he considered it the best of all the movies based
on his work and often screened his personal print for friends.
Added Gardner, ``Of course, he'd usually fall asleep after the
first reel, which made sense because that first reel was the only
part of the movie that was really taken from what he wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SUN ALSO RISES'' (1957)
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Power is the hero with the symbolic groin wound who's in
love with Ava Gardner, who has a thing for bullfighters (notably
Robert Evans, who later turned to producing and, reportedly, was
the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Wag the Dog'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Gardner said her part was first offered to
Jennifer Jones, who turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: At $5 million, it was, at the time, the most
expensive location picture ever made by 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: ``Darryl Zanuck's splashy Cook's
tour of the lost generation ... the silliest damn thing I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios eye Kubrick catalog
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes on ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' three different studios
have shrewdly brought director Stanley Kubrick's earlier work back
to the marketplace in both the DVD and VHS formats.
</P>
<P>
   From MGM come ``Paths of Glory'' and ``The Killing.'' Columbia
has re-issued ``Dr. Strangelove.'' The juiciest collection is being
offered by Warner's: ``Lolita,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``Barry
Lyndon,'' ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and, my
personal pick, ``The Shining,'' which includes a terrific ``making
of'' featurette.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Kubrick's daughter Vivian while the movie was being shot
in the late 1970s, the documentary originally aired on the BBC.
Along with the rare chance to watch the notoriously secretive
Kubrick at work, there are some extremely entertaining bits with
Jack Nicholson, who impishly hams it up for Vivian's camera every
chance he gets. Facetiously sharing some of his tricks of the trade
with his daughter, Kubrick explains, ``I always brush my teeth
before I report back into work. Consideration for my co-workers.
It's grueling enough without a face full of lamb cutlets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's a sure bet where the Rev. Randall ``Randy''
Weaver can be found seven days a week _ the Sam Houston Race Park.
</P>
<P>
   Since the racetrack's opening in northwest Houston in 1994,
Weaver has ministered to hundreds of track employes, jockeys,
grooms, trainers and racing fans. He prays with jockeys every race
day and visits them in hospitals when they are injured. He
regularly visits the ``backside'' _ the restricted barn and stall
areas where horses are quartered _ chatting with stall cleaners,
trainers and grooms who must devote literally 24 hours a day to
caring for the horses, even to the point of living at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 1,100 horses at any given time,'' said Weaver, 44, an
Assemblies of God minister whose Western shirts, cowboy hats and
Texas-size belt buckles serve as his chaplain's uniform. ``The
number fluctuates, but there's about 1,000 people on any given
morning on the backside. That doesn't include the mutuel people
(betting tellers) and the other people employed by the park
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is often sought out for counseling or consolation and has
a small chaplain's office in the park's administration center. He
presides at weddings of employees or fans _ some of them in the
park's winner's circle or paddock.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays at 11 a.m., Weaver converts the Homestretch Cafe, the
``track kitchen,'' into a church where T-shirts and jeans, straw
cowboy hats or baseball caps are the Sunday go-to-meeting clothes.
Varnished picnic tables become pews, and worshipers munch on donuts
or eat a hearty cafe breakfast as Weaver strums his electric guitar
and sings ``A Closer Walk With Thee'' or leads congregants in a
foot-stomping ``I'll Fly Away.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Darla, ministers to teens during the sermon portion. A
``children's church'' is held concurrently in a carpeted storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stained glass is beautiful,'' Weaver said. ``But you don't
have to have stained glass for Jesus Christ to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stained glass may not be necessary, but Weaver's down-home
approach and folksy sermons laced with ``cowboyisms'' pack more
than 160 worshipers into the Homestretch each week.
</P>
<P>
   In Weaver's western lexicon, godly but dour people act like they
``have been baptized in pickle juice,'' and energetic youths can
act like ``three-year-old stud colts.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Randy is a pretty neat guy,'' said Gary Hearen, who has been
attending the park church with his family for about 18 months.
``The (church) is really a neat deal. It is low-key; it is more
about God than church. And any one person can be a committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearen is one of several congregants who attend the race-park
church even though they have no connection with horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people here are not your traditional churchgoers,''
Hearen said. ``Randy has a bunch of people going to church that had
quit, but he got them back into church.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's Colorado and Utah cowboy upbringing and professional
rodeo career and rodeo ministry resonate well with the park's
horse-loving community.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver was the son of an Assemblies of God minister ``who showed
horses at halter and roped calves and steers.'' As teen-agers, he
and his older brother, Russ, would be charged by their father with
holding services for the homeless in an Ogden, Utah, street
mission. ``Some of them would be drunk, some would be fighting, and
some of them would be snoring,'' Weaver recounts. ``We'd sing and
preach to them or whatever else needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver had no intention of following his father's footsteps.
He realized that ministry was 24-hour-a-day work. ``I really didn't
want to go into the ministry,'' he said. ``God just about had to
send a lightning bolt with a note on it in order for me to get the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he graduated from high school in 1972, Weaver had
changed his mind and followed his older brother to a California
Bible college. He eventually graduated in 1987 from a
correspondence Bible college. To meet college expenses, Weaver
worked as a horse trainer. He and his brother also indulged their
passion for rodeos by competing in calf-roping, team-roping and
steer-wrestling events. ``It is part of the talent God gave us in
order for us to have inroads to horsemen, cowboys and racetrack
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, at the national rodeo collegiate finals in Bozeman,
Mont., the brothers launched their ministry to cowboys by hosting
church services that attracted about 90 students.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers then went on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association circuit, competing in Houston, Cheyenne, Wyo., and
other major rodeos. In 1980, the brothers received funding from the
Assemblies of God for a ministry to rodeo cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodeo cowboys who do it as a profession are on the road 48
weeks out of the year,'' said Weaver, who lost part of his right
middle and small fingers during calf roping practice four years
ago. ``Most of them don't have a home church, and the rodeos are
held on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weaver brothers then were among just a handful of chaplains
with a cowboy ministry. ``Now there is a Christian cowboy magazine
and about 50 ministers in different segments of the (cowboy)
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years on the circuit, Weaver became chaplain at Manor
Downs quarter-horse racetrack in Austin, Texas . ``I mostly got
tired,'' Weaver said of his rodeo traveling. ``I saw a need to slow
down.'' By that time, he was married and had two small children.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he became chaplain at the Houston race park. His
brother now pastors a cowboy church in Bembrook, near Fort Worth.
But Weaver still finds time for two or three calf-roping events
every year. He recently won a saddle and a horse trailer at an
event in the Houston-area city of Katy.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and his new assistant, John Shumaker, are members of the
National Racetrack Chaplaincy of America. There are 39 racetrack
chaplains nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ann McGovern, the race park's vice president of operations, said
chaplains are necessary because many track employees rarely have
time to find a nearby church. ``Working racehorses is a life,'' she
said. ``It is a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week job. Animals
don't get put on the shelf on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a local community church would be hard-pressed to
provide the services Weaver provides to the highly mobile racetrack
community.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's ability to relate to the horse-centered business is
unique, she said. ``He is more than smiles and hugs,'' she said.
``He has enough life experiences, and he knows the lifestyle in
racing that he can make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver begins the race park workday with an 8 a.m. prayer over
the park's public address system.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday nights, Weaver and Shumaker hold a 6 p.m. Bible study
and gospel concert at the Homestretch that draws about 70 people.
At 11 a.m. Thursdays, the men host a lunch for backside employes.
The chaplains also maintain a clothes closet for employes in need.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said more than $15,000 in benevolence funds, raised by
church members and horsemen, went to backside employes last year
who needed help with medical bills, emergency trips back home or
other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Darla Weaver also ministers to women who seek her out for
counseling. ``True religion is taking care of widows and orphans
and loving God above everything else,'' she said. ``That's what we
try to do; try to take care of people and not just quote Scriptures
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband prays about the future of his church. The
Homestretch is at capacity with worshipers. ``We are bulging out at
the seams,'' he said. ``I don't know what God has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is not defensive in the least that horse racing involves
betting, an activity some Christians consider sinful. ``I don't
think anyone here at the park wants someone with a gambling problem
to go to the betting window,'' he said. But betting doesn't
preclude bringing Christ to employes or fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would Jesus be?'' Weaver said. ``I believe he would be
out on this racetrack telling people how much he loved them and
cared about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is, `Helping people run the race,''' he said. ``And
we are here to help people run the race.''

unique, she said. ``He is more than smiles and hugs,'' she said.
``He has enough life experiences, and he knows the lifestyle in
racing that he can make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver begins the race park workday with an 8 a.m. prayer over
the park's public address system.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday nights, Weaver and Shumaker hold a 6 p.m. Bible study
and gospel concert at the Homestretch that draws about 70 people.
At 11 a.m. Thursdays, the men host a lunch for backside employes.
The chaplains also maintain a clothes closet for employes in need.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said more than $15,000 in benevolence funds, raised by
church members and horsemen, went to backside employes last year
who needed help with medical bills, emergency trips back home or
other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Darla Weaver also ministers to women who seek her out for
counseling. ``True religion is taking care of widows and orphans
and loving God above everything else,'' she said. ``That's what we
try to do; try to take care of people and not just quote Scriptures
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband prays about the future of his church. The
Homestretch is at capacity with worshipers. ``We are bulging out at
the seams,'' he said. ``I don't know what God has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is not defensive in the least that horse racing involves
betting, an activity some Christians consider sinful. ``I don't
think anyone here at the park wants someone with a gambling problem
to go to the betting window,'' he said. But betting doesn't
preclude bringing Christ to employes or fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would Jesus be?'' Weaver said. ``I believe he would be
out on this racetrack telling people how much he loved them and
cared about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is, `Helping people run the race,''' he said. ``And
we are here to help people run the race.''

 &HT;    Papa at 100: His work lives on in print, on film
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago this month, Ernest Hemingway was born.
Thirty-eight years ago this month, Ernest Hemingway died. A
suicide. In the intervening years, he became a world-famous writer,
won the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes and saw most of his work turned
into movies. Because bar-crawling in Havana and shooting endangered
species in Africa aren't as easy as they once were, why not try a
video homage to Papa's memory?
</P>
<P>
   ``A FAREWELL TO ARMS'' (1932)
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes play ill-fated lovers _ an American
ambulance driver and an English nurse _ in Italy during World War
I. The 1957 remake starred Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Fredric March and Claudette Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: Coop was paid a mere $15,000 because he was a
mere movie star; Hayes, imported from the theater, got $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: He wasn't exactly thrilled that,
unlike in his book, Hayes' character lives. When the film was
re-released in 1948, she quite properly died (two endings had been
shot). In a letter to a friend, Hemingway also protested other
changes: ``The movie hero deserts because his girlfriend won't
write him any letters. When he goes to look for her, the entire
army tags along so he won't get lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FOR WHOM
</P>
<P>
   THE BELL TOLLS'' (1943)
</P>
<P>
   Cooper plays a soldier of fortune fighting the Fascists in Spain
and becomes romantically involved with a fiery Spanish peasant
(Ingrid Bergman).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Coop, who by then was a Hemingway buddy, and
Vera Zorina, a ballet dancer. After viewing the early rushes, the
filmmakers switched to Bergman _ who was, incidentally, the
novelist's first choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: Hemingway was paid $150,000 for the rights to
his book. David O. Selznick was paid the same amount for loaning
out Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: Bergman recalled that Hemingway
told her he saw the movie five times. It was not a compliment:
``After I'd seen the first five minutes, I couldn't stand it any
longer so I walked out. ... Later I went back again because I
thought I must see the whole movie and I saw a bit and again I
walked out. It took me five visits to see that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE KILLERS'' (1946)
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's short story is stretched into a neat film noir
starring Burt Lancaster as an ex-boxer, the doomed target of two
hired killers, and Ava Gardner as the woman who done him wrong.
Loosely reworked by Don Siegel in 1964 with Lee Marvin and, in his
last Hollywood role, Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Lancaster was a virtual unknown, so the
studio tested ``bigger'' stars _ such as Wayne Morris and Sonny
Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: One reason Morris wasn't cast was that his
studio wanted $75,000 for the loan-out. Lancaster could be had for
$2,500 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: According to Gardner, another
Hemingway chum, he considered it the best of all the movies based
on his work and often screened his personal print for friends.
Added Gardner, ``Of course, he'd usually fall asleep after the
first reel, which made sense because that first reel was the only
part of the movie that was really taken from what he wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SUN ALSO RISES'' (1957)
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Power is the hero with the symbolic groin wound who's in
love with Ava Gardner, who has a thing for bullfighters (notably
Robert Evans, who later turned to producing and, reportedly, was
the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Wag the Dog'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Originally cast: Gardner said her part was first offered to
Jennifer Jones, who turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money matters: At $5 million, it was, at the time, the most
expensive location picture ever made by 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What Hemingway thought of it: ``Darryl Zanuck's splashy Cook's
tour of the lost generation ... the silliest damn thing I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios eye Kubrick catalog
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes on ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' three different studios
have shrewdly brought director Stanley Kubrick's earlier work back
to the marketplace in both the DVD and VHS formats.
</P>
<P>
   From MGM come ``Paths of Glory'' and ``The Killing.'' Columbia
has re-issued ``Dr. Strangelove.'' The juiciest collection is being
offered by Warner's: ``Lolita,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``Barry
Lyndon,'' ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and, my
personal pick, ``The Shining,'' which includes a terrific ``making
of'' featurette.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Kubrick's daughter Vivian while the movie was being shot
in the late 1970s, the documentary originally aired on the BBC.
Along with the rare chance to watch the notoriously secretive
Kubrick at work, there are some extremely entertaining bits with
Jack Nicholson, who impishly hams it up for Vivian's camera every
chance he gets. Facetiously sharing some of his tricks of the trade
with his daughter, Kubrick explains, ``I always brush my teeth
before I report back into work. Consideration for my co-workers.
It's grueling enough without a face full of lamb cutlets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ When Jiggs is in the house, everybody gathers
around.
</P>
<P>
   He's old and moves slowly, but has a winning personality that
makes his friends want to cozy up to him and shoot the breeze. He
can be stoic and detached, but if you're dancing, he likes to join
the party. If you're eating grapes, he may try to sit in your lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice guy,'' says Frances Peacock, giving him a gentle
pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Jiggs has lived among the elderly residents of the
Alterra Sterling House, an assisted living center, where he spends
his days idling in the courtyard, noshing on grass and plants or
snuggling into a doghouse for one of his frequent naps.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not a dog and he's not a retiree scraping by on Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Jiggs, precise age unknown, is a desert tortoise who checked
into the North Texas retirement center with his old pal, Ken
Connor.
</P>
<P>
   They've been hanging out together for 66 years, ever since
Connor found him wandering the streets of Hawthorne, Calif. Both
were tykes back then: Connor was a skinny 5-year-old and the
tortoise was barely 5 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Connor took him home and gave him a name, chosen from a popular
comic strip, ``Maggie and Jiggs.'' He painted Jiggs on the shell,
and a lifelong friendship was born. Desert tortoises are now
protected by federal law and it is illegal to remove them from the
wild, but no such restriction existed in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a big yard, and I always had a doghouse _ and dogs,''
Connor says.
</P>
<P>
   The tortoise and the canines coexisted peacefully, but as Jiggs
grew and matured, the back yard apparently became too small for
him. One evening in 1946, he hit the road, vanished, a probable
victim of wanderlust.
</P>
<P>
   How far he wandered, Connor never knew. Maybe it was just a few
blocks. After all, he was only gone two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was standing in the yard and there he was, in a
ditch by the street,'' Connor said. ``His name was still painted on
his back.''
</P>
<P>
   They've not been separated since.
</P>
<P>
   As the decades came and went, Connor pursued careers in real
estate and part-time acting, usually playing small roles of drover
or wagon master in TV and movie westerns. One of his most memorable
roles, however, was that of mediating a dispute between Bette Davis
and the producers of the television series ``Wagon Train.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress, unsatisfied with her pay, was threatening to walk
off the set and Connor, mild-mannered and ingratiating, was asked
to persuade her to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up telling her to go to hell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Life with Jiggs was far less stressful, and he brought the
tortoise along when he moved here to be near relatives and to help
settle the business affairs of his late brother, Ross, who ran a
flight school in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought nobody here would want him,'' Connor says, referring
to the other residents of Alterra Sterling House.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves him,'' says Erin Erickson, the center's
activities director, as she lifts the 19-pound, 10-inch diameter
tortoise through the doorway from the courtyard into a sitting
area. ``I think he wants to be a house pet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, Jiggs ambles aimlessly, exploring the underside of
a small table, pausing to greet the center's residents who come out
of their rooms, and approaching a stranger who might be good for a
handout.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jiggs has never been ill, Erickson consulted a
veterinarian to be sure he was getting the proper diet and could
tolerate the torrid North Texas summers. Under ideal conditions,
the vet told her, a desert tortoise can live to be 150 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions at the retirement home are close to ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eats lots of greens,'' Erickson says. ``Kelp, spinach,
mustard greens. We also give him carrots and watermelon and grapes.
Grapes are his favorite. When I have grapes, he tries to crawl into
my lap. He likes to be hand-fed.''
</P>
<P>
   When dance or exercise classes are in progress, Jiggs, drawn by
the motion and the music, scratches at the door begging for entry.
At other times, perhaps to escape the heat, he persuades someone to
open the door and he makes his way down the corridor to Connor's
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows Ken,'' Erickson says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the center encourages pets for its residents, Jiggs and
a parakeet currently are the only ones in residence. Jiggs appears
to be the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our mascot,'' Erickson says.
</P>
<P>
   The center's residents, gathering in the sitting room beside the
door to the courtyard, refer to Jiggs not as a turtle or tortoise,
but in more human terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny little guy,'' one of them allows.
</P>
<P>
   Bending to stroke his head, another says, ``Yeah, we all like
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Animals are known to be of therapeutic value to the elderly,
particularly those who are ill or alone.
</P>
<P>
   Old reptiles may also benefit from human contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really likes it here,'' Connor says.

TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY TO CONSTRUCT DRAG STRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway will add a
multimillion-dollar drag strip that could be ready in less than two
years, speedway Executive Vice President Eddie Gossage said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said developer Bruton Smith, chairman of Speedway
Motorsports, which owns TMS, told him to proceed with plans to
build what Gossage called ``the finest drag strip in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas track will apparently mirror Smith's Las Vegas Motor
Speedway quarter-mile drag strip, which is under construction, and
the recently refurbished Bristol Dragway in Tennessee. Smith
reportedly spent $14 million to rebuild and upgrade Bristol
Dragway, and the price tag for the Las Vegas project has been put
at $10 million for a facility that is expected to seat 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he could not put a cost on the project at Texas
Motor Speedway but expects it to exceed the $14 million spent at
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what it would cost because we don't know
where it would sit on the property,'' Gossage said. ``We've begun
the design process and renderings. We've just sat down with the
design folks (at Speedway Motorsports) about some of the wrinkles
we want to put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he is unsure when ground will be broken and what
events will be run at the new strip.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Meyer, who owns the Texas Motorplex in Ennis, has a
15-year agreement with the National Hot Rod Association that gives
him exclusivity over its national events in a 150-mile radius.
Meyer, a former NHRA Funny Car driver, is attempting to complete a
master plan and financing with Grand Prairie officials that would
allow him to build a $74 million facility (including real estate
costs) on 500 acres at Interstate 30 and MacArthur Road.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prairie City Council has discussed having a sales tax
election in November. The sales tax, if passed, would help pay the
estimated $40 million cost for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, whose track hosts two national events a year, hopes to
have his new facility running in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who lost a race to build a superspeedway in North Texas
to the Speedway Motorsports group in 1994, had little to say about
Smith's latest project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on it. I'm not going to play games,''
Meyer said Tuesday. ``He can do what he wants to do. There's
nothing to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   NHRA President Dallas Gardner also reiterated his organization's
position on the North Texas market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Eddie (Gossage) today for first time,'' Gardner said
Tuuesday. ``I've never had any conversation that I can recall in
any depth with Bruton (Smith) about our contractural relationship
with Billy (Meyer). I talked with Bruton a few weeks ago, and I was
under the impression that Bruton wanted to see what happens with
the project that Billy is working on. And depending upon what
happened, maybe we'd talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruton knows we have a contractural responsibility to Billy,
as I've said before. I'm surprised at Eddie's comments and the
direction he took today. I would be surprised if they (Speedway
Motorsports) would do it. It would make no business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said that, if Meyer's project in Grand Prairie falls
through, he will go back to Meyer and see what he wants to do to
improve the Motorplex. That facility opened in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, if he says, `I want out' ... Billy is clearly in
control,'' Gardner said. ``Billy is where our agreement is, and
Billy has been a partner for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie Mayor Charles England said the proposed
development in Fort Worth will not affect the Texas Motorplex's
move to Grand Prairie because Meyer has an exclusive contract with
National Hot Rod Association to produce two major races a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big races will be done with Billy Meyer,'' England
said. ``Billy Meyer has an exclusive for 15 years with NHRA. I
don't know who's going to race'' in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   England said the city plans to continue talks with Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to have a facility here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie Councilwoman Teri Jackson said she doesn't know if
there is enough interest in the Metroplex to support two major drag
racing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would make Billy Meyer think twice about
whether or not he wants to invest here,'' Jackson said. ``And it
should make us think twice about whether we want to partner up with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he was not aware of the details of the contract
between Meyer and the NHRA. If TMS could not secure a national
event, match races between top NHRA stars would be a prime
attraction, as would events sanctioned by the rival International
Hot Rod Association. Gossage said Smith also could ask the NHRA to
move the Winston Showdown, an event which ran at Bristol Dragway
this month, to TMS on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is we will run drag races and we will fill the
stands. I assure you of that,'' Gossage said. ``I think our track
record attests to that. We want to have the biggest drag racing
event in the world. Whatever it takes for us to do that, we'll do
that. We've gotten the green light to move ahead at an aggressive
pace, and that's what we're doing.''

   Going out to dinner? Are you sure you can afford the wine?
</P>
<P>
   People spending any time in restaurants these days _ whether
upscale or midrange _ are getting used to the idea that a nice
glass of wine generally costs seven to 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   How'd that happen?
</P>
<P>
   Call it a trend, call it supply and demand. Because everyone
seems to be enjoying wine these days, nobody has to settle for a
scary, screw-top white. By-the-glass choices for whites and reds at
many places come from Washington, Oregon, Spain, Italy, Chile and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Baudouin, owner of The Grape Escape and Encore in Fort
Worth, says people have to pay for the status that comes from
drinking wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is that growing wine is a very
expensive farming process,'' Baudouin says.
</P>
<P>
   Baudouin, the man generally credited with introducing Fort Worth
to wines by the glass at his long-gone Le Chardonnay during the
late 1980s, notes that restaurants build in a markup to make up for
waste. A bottle opened to pour two glasses won't be as good a day
or so later and could be tossed.
</P>
<P>
   If a glass is $7 but the bottle is $25, the bottle's a bargain
at 4 1/2 glasses per. If you buy the bottle, it is legal _
according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission _ to cork the
unused portion and take it home.
</P>
<P>
   At Encore, a French bistro in Fort Worth's Cultural District,
Baudouin offers 10 by-the-glass wine choices from $4 to $7. He
keeps these prices low by staying away from overexposed (and
overpriced) merlot and chardonnay selections and sticking with
wines from smaller, less recognized vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Casey, restaurant outlet manager at The Worthington hotel in
Fort Worth, offers 17 by-the-glass wines at the Star of Texas
Grill, priced from $4.75 to $7. One of the more popular is a
Beringer Knights Valley cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   At Reflections, The Worthington's high-end restaurant, Casey
offers a Simi sauvignon blanc for $5.50 per glass and a Santa
Margherita pinot grigio for $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can match tastes to fit a price range,'' Casey says. ``Just
because a wine is high-priced doesn't always mean it's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all expensive restaurants hold you up for ransom on the
wine, however. Carlo Croci, owner-chef at the somewhat pricey Bella
Italia West in Fort Worth, says he keeps per-glass rates around $5,
even for glasses poured from a bottle selling for $40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice public relations to let customers have affordable
tastes of a nice chianti or barolo,'' says Croci, who changes his
by-the-glass selections weekly, if not daily.
</P>
<P>
   Five dollars is unheard of in Dallas' better restaurants, such
as the tony new steak and seafood place called Nick &AMP; Sam's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to strike a balance between less and more expensive
wines when I create the flight menus here,'' says Jody Pate, wine
steward at Nick &AMP; Sam's.
</P>
<P>
   Every two weeks, Pate creates eight flights of three selections,
so that diners always have 24 glass choices. The Caymus sauvignon
blanc and the Kenwood zinfandel are $7, while the Meritage from
Napa's Viader vineyards is $22 per glass.
</P>
<P>
   So, who orders a $20 glass of wine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it's someone who really knows their wines, but once in
a while it's someone trying to impress somebody else,'' Pate says.
</P>
<P>
   Some diners don't hesitate when it comes to quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll spend that extra buck _ it's worth it for a really good
glass of wine,'' says Christina Patoski, a Fort Worth photographer.
``I really like Ridge zinfandel, for instance, which is $29 at the
store, but I'll pay $10 a glass at a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Marcia Garrett, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of wines I like are very expensive, and I'm still
going to order by the glass,'' Garrett says. ``The whole purpose in
going to a place like that is to have good food and good wine, so I
plan on paying a lot.''

FUNERAL HOME'S SMALL GESTURE TURNS INTO BIG TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALY CITY, Calif. _ It started 36 years ago in Madeline Duggan's
kitchen as the smallest of gestures.
</P>
<P>
   After a close friend of the family died, the mortuary owner and
her husband wanted to do something more than just lay the loved one
to rest. So Duggan put on an apron, prepared a turkey and took it
to the grieving family's home.
</P>
<P>
   The deliveries haven't stopped since, even as Duggan's Serra
Mortuary has grown tenfold. The funeral home gave out more than
1,200 turkeys last year, and employees and clients swear by the
spiritual power of the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally started off as a mom-and-pop-type funeral home,''
said Madeline's son, Dan Duggan, who now supervises a 30-person
staff. ``There were two employees _ my mother and father _ and they
knew almost everyone who walked through the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference now is that there are many more strangers, who
are often the most thankful to receive the unexpected gift.
</P>
<P>
   Doska DiPasqua said her jaw dropped in May when a Duggan
employee showed up at her mother's reception with a cooked 14-pound
bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just completely dumbfounded,'' the resident of South San
Francisco said. ``We were just totally in awe of them doing
something like that. That's the last thing you think of, something
to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPasqua's husband, Eugene, starts to get choked up when he
talks about the turkey delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done with so much dignity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan's had six turkeys lined up on a small table in the
mortuary lunchroom one recent morning. The smell of Thanksgiving
wafted all the way down the hall to a viewing room, where a small
gathering for a funeral service was just starting to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, 33, has worked at the mortuary since 1985, but
knew about the turkeys long before that. It was 1978 when his
16-year-old brother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I ever worked here, unfortunately, I had some deaths in
the family and some dealings with the Duggans,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey stuck in Murphy's mind, and when he was 19 years old,
he got a job with the Duggans washing limousines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he manages the mortuary, and has seen plenty of surviving
family members in need of a kind act.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an older couple, and either the wife or the husband
has died, that's when it really matters,'' Murphy said. ``It'll be
just an old guy left, with no kids, sitting alone in the limo, and
it just breaks your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duggan, whose grandfather started the mortuary business in
1903, said he was surprised that other mortuaries didn't give away
turkeys or other main dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we get thank-you notes, the turkeys always seem to be
on there,'' Duggan said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sheer volume, the Duggans don't cook their own
turkeys anymore. Westborough Deli in South San Francisco drops them
by each morning. Duggan spends more than $25,000 per year on the
turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Duggan used to grind her own stuffing. Now, the turkeys
come with a side of cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   On its busiest day, the mortuary distributed 11 turkeys. On a
typical day, three or four are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The only clients who don't get 12-to-14-pound birds are those
who choose cremation without a service for their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Duggan is still a presence in the business. She knows
that her small gestures still make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go up and say a prayer, and pay my respects to people,'' she
said. ``I tell children, `make pests of yourselves _ your mother or
father would love that.'''

MEDIA OVERKILL ON JFK JR. IS UNWARRANTED BUT UNAVOIDABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was listening to the Mark Davis radio show the other day and
some of the callers were complaining about the news coverage of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the coverage has been not only excessive but also
too reverential. They wanted to know what President John F.
Kennedy's son had ever done that his demise should merit such
extravagant coverage and such worshipful treatment by the media.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question, and I hereby offer the short answer: not
much.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wasn't nearly so cavalier _ nor so blunt. He pointed out
that Kennedy was a pop culture icon and an heir to a Kennedy legacy
that, like it or not, is a significant part of our nation's
history. When John Jr.'s plane crashed into the water off the
Massachusetts coast, Mark said, it was a gigantic news story that
the media couldn't have downplayed if they'd wanted to _ and they
obviously didn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is no fan of the Kennedys' liberal politics, but he is
fair-minded enough to recognize a big deal when he sees one. JFK
Jr. was a big deal _ in life and in death _ even though any
objective assessment of his time on this planet would lead to the
conclusion that his fame far outran his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   He won some acclaim with his political magazine, ``George.'' He
won considerable respect as a low-key humanitarian who was helpful
to various charities. He was a devoted son to his famous mother,
the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, he was renowned for his selection as ``People''
magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive'' and for his longtime status _
until his marriage several years ago _ as the world's most eligible
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's face was embedded in the American psyche, of course,
long before he emerged as a ``People'' cover boy. His image was
etched forever in our collective memory by the heart-wrenching
photograph of young John saluting his assassinated father's casket
in November 1963.
</P>
<P>
   What was the question again? Oh, yes: What did John F. Kennedy
Jr. ever do to earn the wall-to-wall news coverage and reverential
media treatment that greeted his tragic plane crash?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't need to do much of anything after offering
that brave salute to his father at a moment of unbearable national
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, though, he did more than that. He grew up
to be a good man, which seems ordinary enough until you consider
how many of his relatives grew up to be trouble with a capital
``T.''
</P>
<P>
   Which surely brings us to the essence of the complaints about
news coverage. If there are lots of Americans _ including many in
the media _ who seem to worship the Kennedys, there are also plenty
who loathe the famous clan with every fiber of their beings.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly about politics, especially here in Texas, where the
Democratic Kennedys' bleeding-heart liberalism is anathema. But the
personal misadventures of certain family members have generated
widespread disdain as well.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems fair to tar John F. Kennedy Jr. with that brush.
Unlike some of the other Kennedys, he exhibited considerable
dignity and self-control.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I'm of the opinion that folks who didn't complain
about media excess in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death have
no business complaining about coverage of the latest Kennedy
tragedy. Compared with the media-induced hysteria over Di's demise,
the JFK Jr. coverage has been restrained.
</P>
<P>
   We could argue all day about which of these magazine-cover icons
was more or less deserving of such media overkill, but what's the
point? These things are highly subjective.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, there was a time when the press made arbitrary
judgments about the newsworthiness of people and events. Nowadays,
in this age of round-the-clock TV news and Internet access to
previously unimaginable quantities of information, the media have
little choice from a competitive standpoint but to go all-out, all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   As Walter Cronkite used to say: That's the way it is.

ANDREW GELLER: HE THREW SAND IN THE FACE OF ARCHITECTURAL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

346-9867.) 
Alastair Gordon, an architectural historian, is the curator of
``Weekend Utopia: The Modern Beach House on Eastern Long Island,
1960-73,'' at Guild Hall in East Hampton, N.Y.  
 (bl)  
 By ALASTAIR GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a hot Friday in July, and we've been driving in circles
through the sandy sprawl of Beach Hampton, N.Y., near Amagansett,
somewhere between the ocean dunes and Montauk Highway, where
weekend houses are plunked on tiny lots, cheek by jowl.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Geller, quixotic designer-architect, is leading us on a
search for the innovative beach houses he created in the 1950s and
'60s. Geller, 79, is at the wheel of his vintage yellow Mercedes,
dressed elegant-shabby in seersucker jacket and English sandals.
His white beard and thick mustache are brushed neatly into place.
</P>
<P>
   We're hoping to find one of his eccentrically free-form and
eye-grabbing homes that may have survived in pristine condition. In
fact, we are looking for a lost period of civilization, a period of
innocent expectation, of family beach picnics, coleslaw, outdoor
showers and bunk beds, before real-estate prices skyrocketed,
before the traffic became unbearable, before setbacks or
environmental consciousness _ when houses could still be designed
to burrow into the side of a dune or hover over wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to the past is never as easy as you think. Geller
cranes his neck to see behind a promising clump of Russian olive,
but, no, it's another one of those mini-Palladian manors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the development, these narrow lanes with names like
Treasure Island Drive, are filled with pleasant memories. There was
the house he designed for Stanley Schlacter, a psychology professor
at Columbia University, separate pavilions connected by a bridge.
The bridge contained a dining room that floated above the property,
and it was in this setting that Geller met Benny Goodman, ``sitting
quietly all through the lunch party,'' Geller said. ``After
dessert, he began to whistle a jazzy tune. Everyone at the table
stopped and stared at the famous band leader, who finished his tune
and said, `Now I've given you a Benny Goodman concert in return for
being in your marvelous house.'''
</P>
<P>
   Free spirit or loose cannon, depending on one's point of view,
Geller has always followed his own set of rules and never really
fitted in with the architectural mainstream. He and his wife,
Shirley, still live like Bohemian artists in an old Victorian house
in Northport, N.Y., far out of reach of Manhattan power lunches or
academic cliques.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an inherent sweetness in his work that is
uncharacteristic of the profession. In all of Geller's beautifully
rendered drawings, there is the same little logo of a mermaid
holding a spear in one corner. The spear indicates north but there
is another meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Shirley, and I used to bury secret treasures for our
children in the dunes,'' he said. ``Shirley once made a little
mermaid doll out of cloth with orange yarn for her hair and
seashell eyes. It was my daughter's favorite treasure, so I
incorporated it into my drawings.'
</P>
<P>
   Geller's father was a sign painter and artist, who emigrated
from Hungary in 1905 and became a follower of Norman Thomas, the
Socialist candidate for president. ``The day I was born, my father
was in jail doing time for his political activism,'' Geller said.
He remembers helping his father transport bootleg beer in Brooklyn
one night.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the architecture program at Cooper Union, worked
after World War II in the Fifth Avenue office of Raymond Loewy, the
industrial designer. Among the projects Geller worked on were the
interiors and garden scheme for the glass-and-metal Lever House,
done with Isamu Noguchi. Later, he specialized in designing
department stores for shopping centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in his spare time, he began designing ``summer use
playhouses,'' as he liked to call them, which were pure sculpture,
objects in the landscape and very whimsical. He christened each one
with a pet name like the ``butterfly,'' the ``box kite,'' the
``milk carton.'' On first impression, these beach houses seem like
caricatures, one-liners. They represented a kind of everyman
modernism, which was both playful and accessible, with most houses
costing less than $10,000. Some, like the house of Irwin Hunt on
Fire Island, a box with lids that swung down from the roof, could
be closed easily for the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '50s, Geller designed the prototype for the
Leisurama houses in Montauk, perhaps the first mass-produced
vacation houses in the United States. Sold by Macy's, they came
complete with sheets, flatware and brightly colored toothbrushes.
(``Ready for your leisure pleasure.'') A model Leisurama house in a
United States exposition at a park in Moscow in 1959 touched off
the ``kitchen debate'' between Vice President Richard Nixon and
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on the merits of capitalism over
socialism. (Khrushchev refused to believe that American workers
could afford such luxury.)
</P>
<P>
   Geller's most ingenious fabrication of the '50s was his house
for Arthur Pearlroth, who was a Port Authority executive, with two
diamond-shape pods hovering on point above the dunes of Westhampton
Beach. A lunar-landing staircase added further to the impression
that spaceships were on the attack. Geller refined his escape-pod
esthetic in 1958 with the Esquire Weekend House, commissioned by
the magazine as a design for swinging bachelors: a portable unit on
stilts, which could be constructed on any beach, for $3,000. (``The
Esquire Weekend House has no lawns to mow, no sash to paint and can
be opened for the season in four minutes flat,'' the magazine
wrote. ``A ship's ladder can be drawn up through the house's
trapdoor in case of prowling wolves.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was the house in Sagaponack that Geller did for
Irving Elkin, a photographer, as a wildly pitched succession of
Cubist forms, which vaguely resembled a reclining nude by Picasso.
It was singled out for condemnation by local citizens and critics
and was compared by some to the Titanic hitting an iceberg. But
perhaps that was the point. A summer house was meant to make you
smile.
</P>
<P>
   We are still on our quest for that simpler, less complicated
age, crawling along Marine Boulevard, when Geller slows down and
cries out, ``There it is!'' A small, odd-shape house that he
designed for Leonard and Helen Frisbie in 1958 sits at the very top
of a dune, like some weatherbeaten artifact washed up in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   He walks in cold and introduces himself to the slightly startled
looking family on the deck. The woman turns out to be Lenora Pearl,
daughter of the original owner, who recognizes Geller's name and
gives him a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Pearl was only 6 or 7, her father saw a Geller beach
house in a newspaper and commissioned him to design a simple
geometric shape with a small deck reaching over the ridge of the
dune. It cost less than $10,000 to build. Her father, a
stockbroker, paid Geller's design fee with shares of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearl explains how, after her parents died, she and Bill
Frisbie, her brother, decided to keep the house as it was, without
fancy additions, and then to pass it on to their own children. She
and her husband, Terry, now commute every July from Seattle,
spending the month in a very intimate relationship with the ocean,
sand and sky. (Her brother's family uses the house in August
because it is too small to hold everyone at the same time.)
</P>
<P>
   The house is the color of driftwood with cedar shakes on its
steeply pitched roof curling back at the edges like fish scales.
There is simple board and batten siding, making the structure look
more like a campsite than a house. A deck is cantilevered
precariously toward the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real honest-to-God beach house,'' Pearl says, leading
us through the small living room, with a huge window spilling out
onto the ocean dunes. No heating, no insulation. Daylight shines
through cracks in the shingle roof. The living was designed to
happen on the broad sun deck or on the beach. On rainy days,
everyone would gather inside and play Twister or Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs are a few tiny bedrooms with bunk beds. A single
indoor-outdoor shower serves the whole family. A simple wood flap
along the kitchen counter can be turned into a little table, and an
ingenious system of ladders leads to loft spaces and can be pulled
up or down by a Flintstone system of pulleys and counterweights. In
October, the house is closed down, the pipes are drained, the big
windows covered with plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only house along this stretch of beach that wasn't
swept away by a hurricane or moved back from the dune,'' said
Geller, sitting at the edge of the deck, his feet dangling in the
dune grass. ``Bigger is not always better,'' he said. ``Most of
these new houses are ridiculously oversized for their lots, with no
relationship between the house and the property. A house ought to
occupy no more than a fifth of the given surface. What they're
creating now is an instant slum,'' he said with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   How did he manage to design these houses while holding down a
full-time job in Loewy's office?
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, I only required five hours of sleep,'' he said.
``Three a.m. was the best time to be at the drafting table, and the
music was always good on WQXR. I remember starting out east in
Montauk at 5 a.m., working on one house, then driving all the way
into the city to work at Loewy's studio. After 5, I would drive to
the Jersey shore, where I was designing another beach house. I
didn't know if I was coming or going.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he regret finding many of his creations demolished or badly
altered? ``I feel like I've lost a brother or sister, or a child
you have watched grow up,'' he said. Ms. Pearl, all grown up, in
her 50s, sat down beside him, and we watched her children run back
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a pleasure to see people, after 30 years still
living in the same house, enjoying it,'' he said. ``You feel that
you've done something special for that family.''

ATTACHMENTS ARE FULL OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine receiving an envelope that just will not open, or a
sheaf of papers folded so intricately that they require an
instruction manual to unfold, or a letter containing nothing but
gobbledygook _ symbols and letters that are completely
unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   The situations may sound far-fetched in the physical world, but
for e-mail users they are frustratingly common. As more and more
people use e-mail to send photographs or word-processing documents
as attachments to their messages, tech-support managers say, more
and more people are faced with attachments that just won't open.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, attachments are computer files that use e-mail
messages for transport over the Net. Just as e-mail messages carry
text from one computer to another, attachments carry files of many
sorts, including word-processing documents, images and software
programs. People usually use attachments when they are sending a
file that contains something more than simple text, like a memo on
special letterhead or a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, attachments are supposed to make life easier. They
can enable scientific collaborators to send one another graphs
showing research results. They allow friends and relatives to send
photographs over the Internet. With just a few clicks of the mouse,
they can eliminate the cumbersome job of sending floppy disks
through regular mail or the intimidating prospect of sending
something via FTP, a file-transfer protocol favored by more
sophisticated Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory. The reality is often much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that can go wrong,'' said Greg Smith,
a computer-support consultant at Stanford University. ``It's not as
easy as it is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even experienced computer users become frustrated. John
Mainwaring, a longtime technology professional at Nortel Networks,
said that when he and his colleagues first tried to share
information via attachments, ``it was a very hit-or-miss affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Day, an English professor at Northern Illinois
University at Northern Illinois University, has been using e-mail
in his classes for years, but said in an e-mail interview, ``There
are still attachments that defy my efforts, such as Word Perfect
files converted to MS Word that arrived the other day and
completely crashed the two computers on which I tried to open
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Attachments usually show up in e-mail messages as icons. E-mail
programs like Eudora, or those that come with Microsoft Office,
America Online or Lotus Notes, are designed to enable people to
simply click on those icons, triggering the file to open in a
separate window. Click on a file that was created using a word
processor like Microsoft Word, and if you have Word on your
computer, the file should open immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, that click opens nothing but the door to
confusion. Sometimes the file does not open at all. Sometimes a
dialog box opens on the computer screen, asking the user which
program should be used to open the file.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, a message appears asking for the file to be
decompressed, or unzipped. And then there is the gobbledygook
response _ the file actually opens, but displays a useless jumble
of keyboard symbols, looking something like a series of profanities
written comic-book style.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated users should at least take comfort in one fact:
Recipients are almost never to blame for attachment problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it is the sender's fault, whether the problem is
intentional or unintentional,'' said Kenneth Breshears, manager of
technical support for Eudora.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, e-mail experts say, the problems can be traced to
three technological glitches: The file may be incompatible with the
software on your computer, the file may not have been encoded or
decoded properly as it journeyed across the Internet, or the file
has been compressed and requires decompressing before it can be
read.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases of attachment aggravation, incompatibility is the
culprit. Consider the exchange of files via floppy disks. If you
were to give someone a disk containing a document created in
Microsoft Word, but that person used Word Perfect, the file would
probably show up as a page with gibberish or not open at all. The
same goes for attachments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge here is that we have an unlimited amount of
software developers that have an unlimited amount of file
formats,'' said Jeffrey Belk, Eudora's president and general
manager. His suggestion: senders should check whether the
recipient's computer has software that will open the file.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid incompatibility problems altogether, some technology
experts recommend purchasing software that lets you view attached
files of myriad types without having to open them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Z. Gottesman, technical director of software for PC
Magazine, suggests trying Keyview, created by Verity
(www.keyview.com), or Quick View Plus, by Jasc Software
(www.jasc.com). Each program, which displays the file but does not
allow you to edit or otherwise alter it, sells for $59.

   ``These programs are quicker to use than launching a big
application,'' Gottesman said, ``and they can avoid the spread of
worms, like Melissa,'' which cannot be activated when a file is
merely viewed without actually being opened.
</P>
<P>
   Encoding can also wreak havoc, though most e-mail programs are
now sophisticated enough to eliminate the need for users to even
know what encoding means. To encode a file is to repackage it as a
text file so that it can travel across the Net as quickly and
easily as a regular e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Most attachments are wrapped up using one of three encoding
standards _ MIME, BinHex or Uuencode _ which are recognized by most
e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most programs automatically decode encoded files before they
arrive in e-mail In boxes. But some users may come across an
attachment that they must decode themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If a user of America Online's e-mail program receives one
message with three attached photographs from someone using a
different e-mail program, for example, those files will be in the
form of a MIME package that must be decoded. To do that, users need
to have decoding software. AOL's e-mail help pages tell users to
download Winzip (www.winzip.com).
</P>
<P>
   In rarer cases, files will arrive that were not packaged
correctly by the sender's e-mail program. Gibberish or a message
about corrupted files results. ``That's where people bail, and say,
`Just fax it to me,''' said Smith, who regularly conducts a clinic
on e-mail attachments at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   An attachment may need to be decompressed as well as decoded.
Compression is a method of squeezing computer files into tiny
packages so that they can move over the Net and be downloaded as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some e-mail programs will decompress files automatically. Others
will show you an icon with the extension .zip (common on
Windows-based files) or .sit (common on Macintosh files).
</P>
<P>
   As with decoding, decompressing files requires special software.
Several decompression programs have decoding mechanisms.
Tech-support experts suggest using PKZip (www.pkware.com) or Winzip
for Windows users and Stuffit Expander
(www.aladdinsys.com/expander) for Macintosh users. Typically these
measures are taken by experienced computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are clever enough to use compression are usually
clever enough not to send it to someone who doesn't know how to
deal with it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But even computer gurus will admit that sometimes e-mail
attachments can create more work than they are worth. Day at
Northern Illinois University tells his students and colleagues to
send attachments only if absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember that the Internet lines are getting crowded,''
Day said. ``Plain text e-mail messages take up a lot less space and
bandwidth than e-mail messages with fancy attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips for avoiding attachment aggravation:
</P>
<P>
   KNOW YOUR SENDER Do not open an attachment if you don't
recognize the sender. Some of the most dangerous computer viruses
have been spread by e-mail attachments, which are activated only
upon opening.
</P>
<P>
   BE DISCREET Do not send an attachment to a large number of
people simultaneously. A one-megabyte file sent to a 500-person
mailing list creates 500 copies of that. That many megabytes moving
through the e-mail system at one time, which could clog or even
cripple the mail server.
</P>
<P>
   TALK IT OVER Let recipients know that an attachment is coming.
You may even want to determine whether a package of compressed
photographs, for example, can easily be decompressed or whether the
pictures should be sent individually.
</P>
<P>
   LEND A HAND Let recipients know what they need to do to open the
attachment. They may need to know what word-processing program, for
example, was used.
</P>
<P>
   WARN OF WHOPPERS Indicate the file's size. People with slow
Internet connections can then decide whether to download the file
later, instead of clicking on the file and discovering that they
have started a 15-minute download. And some e-mail programs are
designed to filter out files over a certain size.
</P>
<P>
   AVOID EMBARRASSMENT If you get an attachment with an .exe
extension, be prepared _ especially if you are at the office. The
file might be an animated program or video, complete with sound.
You may want to turn down your speaker volume or wait until the
office is empty.

   WORLD'S LONGEST RULING PARTY REINVENTS SELF FOR MEXICO'S
GRUELING ELECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   1200. w/MEXICO-ELECT-BOX-$ADV25
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY Besides tortillas and Coca Cola, there are few
things more constant in Mexican life than this country's
70-year-old Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Coke and tortillas have nothing to fear. But this year the PRI
could enter its supreme battle to remain ``part of every Mexican's
permanent diet,'' as one analyst here puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The test has begun, as Mexicans prepare for the PRI's first ever
primary election on Nov. 7 to select a presidential nominee for
Mexico's July 2000 general election. Competition among PRI members
is expected to be the stiffest ever in 2000, and some experts say
it is possible the PRI could lose an event tantamount to a
revolution next door to the United States. So far, four men have
announced their candidacies in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could really be the first time society decides who is
president,'' said Vicente Licona of Mexico's Lou Harris polling
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dust settled from the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the PRI
has supplied all of Mexico's presidents, often under a cloud of
alleged fraud. It is the world's longest-ruling party and has been
flexible in ideology, borrowing from nationalism, capitalism and
socialism to suit the needs of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, every president has picked his successor to run as
president a secret exercise nicknamed the ``dedazo,'' or the big
finger and every successor has won.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure to change has been mounting within the PRI, which
has lost key gubernatorial and congressional races in recent years
and is saddled with blame for corruption, crime and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So the PRI is attempting yet another make over as a democratic
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several months, Mexico is expected to see an
unprecedented level of intra-party squabbling as PRI aspirants hit
the campaign trail leading up to the primary. The PRI has
splintered before, but public displays of friction even as simple
as debate among opponents are rare. Once the president has chosen
his successor, party loyalists usually fall lock step behind the
heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his promise not to use a dedazo, Mexicans widely believe
President Ernesto Zedillo indeed has a favorite, Francisco
Labastida. Zedillo's former Interior Secretary announced his
candidacy for the nomination in May, just days after the PRI
declared it would hold a primary.
</P>
<P>
   But in a June Lou Harris poll, Labastida was running neck in
neck with another PRI aspirant, Roberto Madrazo, former governor of
Tabasco state.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Madrazo officially registered for the primary,
surrounded by supporters who held aloft a coffin with a giant
finger on it and the slogan, ``With Madrazo, the end of the
dedazo.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo is the son of Carlos Madrazo, a PRI politician who was
killed 30 years ago in a plane crash. Mexicans still whisper that
the elder Madrazo's death was no accident and that he was killed
because he pushed for more democracy within the party long before
his colleagues were ready.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, speaking to foreign reporters, Madrazo said attempts
to rig the PRI's primary could fracture the party beyond repair and
alienate voters in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there isn't real democracy, then frustration within the
party will be enormous,'' he said. ``Millions of Mexicans are
betting on the party becoming more democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo called Labastida the product of the ``old PRI'' because
he is already enjoying support from powerful ministers in Zedillo's
administration and high-profile advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But being close to the president can also hurt Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Madrazo can earn points by attacking some
free-market economic reforms instituted by Zedillo that Mexicans,
including some PRI followers, believe have hurt them. He also can
openly question Zedillo proposals, including plans to privatize
electricity and bail out mismanaged banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madrazo is the opposition inside the PRI,'' Licona said.
``Labastida is at a disadvantage because he can't criticize the
administration. He was the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike U.S. primaries, the election is going to be open to all
Mexicans who can show voter credentials, not just PRI loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI will set up booths at 300 precincts throughout Mexico,
and the candidate who wins the largest number of precincts will
become the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The open nature of the process could encourage opposition
parties to flood precincts to vote for whoever is perceived as the
weakest PRI candidate. But PRI officials said the voting had to be
open because political parties in Mexico don't maintain
registration lists.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI will police the balloting, which arouses instant
suspicion in most Mexicans. However, as Licona notes, all the
candidates will have representatives keeping an eye on one another
as ballots are cast and votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among themselves they will establish controls,'' Licona said.
``One scorpion doesn't bite another.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The irony is the PRI, the least democratic party of
all in Mexico, is now the most democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   If the process is viewed by most voters as fair, said analyst
Riva Palacio, the primary could give the PRI ``enormous
legitimacy'' in 2000. But most important, he said, the party must
emerge from the primary unified and ready to take on the
opposition, especially Vicente Fox of Mexico's conservative
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Fox, the governor from Guanajuato state, is a serious
threat to the PRI, a phenomenon analysts credit to his personal
charisma and nearly two years of campaigning independent of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fox is the only PAN politician to register to compete
for his party's nomination, which will be decided at a convention
later this year. In polls, Fox already outscores Madrazo, Labastida
and other presidential candidates on questions about honesty and
the ability to deal with chronic problems such as crime and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The left's likely nominee, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has dropped in
polls behind Fox, Labastida and Madrazo. Cardenas is mayor of
Mexico City and spiritual leader of the Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, which made dramatic gains in recent elections by
questioning Zedillo's free-market policies. So far, Cardenas has
one opponent for his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who broke with the PRI in the 1980s, has a reputation
for ``virtue,'' Riva Palacio said, but he's considered a poor
campaigner with weak communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance between the PRD and the PAN, created solely to beat
the PRI, could be a wild card in the 2000 election. In Nayarit
state, such a right-left alliance beat the PRI in a gubernatorial
race earlier this month. But chances of a PAN-PRD alliance in a
race as important as the presidential election are slim, most
analysts say, given the profound ideological differences between
the parties.

<P>
   ``To forge an alliance, they would have already had to agree on
how to divide up the political pie,'' Riva Palacio said. ``It's too
late now.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite its troubles, the PRI, Riva Palacio also cautioned,
should not be underestimated. It's the only party with a nationwide
presence, and a history of doing whatever it takes to get the vote
out whether it's paving a road or building a school right before an
election, busing voters to polls or providing them with sacks of
beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is a lifestyle,'' Riva Palacio said.

FIGHTERS, CUSTOMIZED AND CHOREOGRAPHED

   Fighter Maker does for martial arts what a deejay's turntable
does for records: it takes you from simple play into a playground
of mixing, matching, sampling, editing and recombination.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's a typical combat game with the standard
multicultural cast: black belts from China and Japan, a Thai kick
boxer, a Brazilian capoeria champ, a curvy blond commando from the
United States and a pro wrestler from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In this rainbow of fighting styles, every martial artist has a
unique set of punches, blocks, kicks and throws, not to mention
special combinations and victory poses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good combat game. But the real action happens in edit
mode, where you can customize and choreograph every facet of a
fighting character's movement: the sweep of a limb, the curl of a
wrist or foot, the body's speed of rotation during a roundhouse
kick, the force of impact or the way an opponent's body responds.
Everything from the smallest shift in stance to the most balletic
leap can be programmed, frame by frame, with a game controller.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most compelling things about fighting games is how
they play with ideas about the human body. In virtual combat you
can push (or break) the laws of physics and the limits of human
momentum. By selecting a different character, you can alter your
dimensions. With no more effort than a chameleon, you can change
your skin.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter Maker goes one step further. It gets under the skin,
down to the wire frame model of a computer-generated character. And
even though that digital skeleton has no substance, it conveys a
palpable sense of the body as a mechanism. Adjust certain body
parts, and nearby connected parts will also move, according to the
principles of human anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as two points define a line, two poses define a motion _
the Playstation will generate intermediate frames of animation,
unless you'd rather program them yourself for more realistic
results. In animation, as in architecture, the difference between
good and perfect often comes down to fine tuning: readjusting the
shoulder, changing the toes or fixing the wrist. God is in the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Patterns of motion, thus refined, combine to form action
sequences: a crouch, a guard, a roll. If you don't want to start
from scratch, you can borrow a programmed move (there are 800) and
tweak to your heart's content. (Once you've triggered five levels
of Undo and Redo with your index fingers on a game pad, you're
spoiled for a computer mouse.)
</P>
<P>
   Motion sequences can be edited like sound files, cut from one
place and pasted into another. They can be played or paused,
backward or forward, in slow motion or high speed. Directional
buttons and a movable camera position the fighter in 3-D space. A
frame-management window positions the figure in time. Pop-up charts
display coordinates, frame numbers and time codes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these variables, the process is remarkably
intuitive. It's just a matter of dragging body parts into position
and deciding how long they should take to get from point A to point
B. Given that there are 60 frames of animation per second, a
30-frame pose will run for half a second. Increase the frame count,
and the model slows down. With fewer frames, the action is faster.
</P>
<P>
   There are decisions about the timing of sound effects, the frame
number when damage occurs and the location from which smoke will
emerge if you connect with your target. There are decisions about
force and acceleration, momentum and gravity, and rate, time and
distance. At the end of the day, a back flip is a multivariable
equation.
</P>
<P>
   A dog can catch a Frisbee without solving differential
equations. Similarly, a 13-year-old doesn't have to master
three-dimensional geometry and calculus to do digital kung fu. But
most players figure out that it's a good idea to have the damage
occur around the 10th frame of an attack sequence, and that's the
solution to a calculus problem. By the time you've honed a custom
fighter, you've spent hours testing timed functions on an X-Y-Z
axis.
</P>
<P>
   You're more likely to greet textbook parabolas with a
contemptuous snort because you can see how dry and stale these
concepts can be in a classroom situation. If Fighter Maker provides
any real-world value, it is the idea that math does not equal word
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Math is not (italics)inherently(end italics) boring. It can be
combat. It can be kinesthetic sculpture. It can be cinema. It can
bring to life images that exist only in your imagination. It can be
a form of self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, you can use it to show off. On the Web, groups
of people are already trading Fighter Maker characters, swapping
signature moves and collaborating on attack sequences. For
evangelical fervor, the Linux development community has nothing on
the Fighter Maker Web dojo
(www.angelfire.com/on2/fightermaker/index.html), an unofficial site
where regular contributors announce their work with unparalleled
brio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my most proud creations,'' a recent posting
began. ``It's a move for this vampire type guy who jumps up and
latches on to his foe biting his neck, then climbs him and kicks a
back flip off his enemies' skull straight up into the ground, then
comes down pummeling the poor sucker into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Other home-brewed action sequences include a disco finishing
pose, pile drivers and gross-out victory taunts _ all masterful
pieces of computer-aided design.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the adolescent humor and combat trappings, the primary
goal of this online community is good design, rather than
competition. Anyone can make a character powerful by increasing the
damage count or by rigging one button to a lethal combination move.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more difficult, and hence more prestigious, to create
idiosyncratic moves that no one has seen before, or a sequence that
no one thought was possible. With custom fighters, as with custom
cars, style is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. It's how
you program the game.

<P>
   ELTHAM, England _ Eltham Palace is one of the greatest modernist
houses in England, a country in which domestic modernism was mostly
a wan affair. Inside the restrained red-brick and stone building,
11 miles from the center of London, is a newly restored
platinum-blond Art Deco interior. The palace offers a rare insight
into what was avant-garde in the 1930s and is a tribute to an
idiosyncratic and modernist couple, Virginia and Stephen Courtauld,
philanthropists whose wealth was based on rayon.
</P>
<P>
   A shimmering aluminum-leaf ceiling crowns Eltham's dining room.
A bathroom is embellished with onyx. Bedrooms are lined in
sycamore, maple and aspen, and dining chairs are cushioned with
peach-colored leather. In a boudoir is a map of Eltham made of
delicately stitched colored leathers, executed by a 1930s
craftswoman, a Mrs. Classen Smith, whose needlework was used in the
interiors of Jean-Michel Frank.
</P>
<P>
   The house, built in the 1930s by the Courtaulds, is surrounded
by a moat and has an attached medieval banqueting hall with a
hammer-beam roof. Constructed in the 15th century by Edward IV,
this medieval relic is all that remains of a royal palace once
occupied by, among others, Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a contemporary house would never be built on such a
historic site,'' said Treve Rosoman, a curator for English
Heritage, a government-sponsored agency, who was responsible for
recreating Eltham's ``Metropolis''-chic interiors during a
three-year, $3.4 million makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Born the youngest of six children in 1883, Stephen Courtauld
inherited a fortune from his family's textile firm. His older
brother Samuel ran the business, collected Impressionist paintings
and founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Stephen, who
studied natural science at Cambridge University and fought in World
War I, was an investor in the Ealing film studio. His other
interests lay in orchids, mountaineering, majolica and Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the former Virginia Peirano, was every bit his equal.
Vivacious, older and somewhat racy for her time, she was a half
Italian, half Hungarian divorcee with a snake tattoo on her ankle.
They met in the Alps. The shy, cautious Courtauld was bewitched. In
1923, when he was 40 and she perhaps a decade his senior, they were
married. They had no children, but they did have a Great Dane and
an ill-tempered ring-tailed lemur named Mah-Jongg. And they had
Eltham.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after their wedding, the couple began looking for a
place within easy reach of London, large enough for lavish
entertaining and a big garden. In 1933, they took a 99-year lease
on Eltham and were allowed to build, as long as they restored the
great hall, which was all that remained of the Tudor palace
destroyed by the Puritans in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   The architects Seely &AMP; Paget were given the remarkable
commission, which included 10 bathrooms, nearly one for each
bedroom, then a startling innovation in English residential design.
So was the under-the-floor heating, the centralized vacuum-cleaning
system and intercom and the fireplaces, with their electric grates
and fake logs. Electric wall clocks were synchronized throughout
the house. Music was piped into the main rooms through hidden
speakers. In their use of domestic gadgets, the couple were the
Bill Gateses of their day.
</P>
<P>
   With this house, English Heritage has begun adopting some of
England's best early modernist houses. At Eltham, antiques are rare
and chintz is nowhere in sight. Instead, visitors are greeted by a
curved entrance hall by Rolf Engstromer, a Swedish designer, where
a concrete dome punctuated with hundreds of circles of clear glass
hovers over amber-colored walls made of black-bean veneer. There
are marquetry figures, including a colossal Roman soldier and a
Viking and scenes depicting the Courtaulds' favorite spots in Italy
and Scandinavia as seen from the deck of the Virginia, their steam
schooner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the hall is a reproduction of a circular rug
by Marion Dorn, a celebrated '30s designer. ``I discovered the
original _ too fragile to be on show _ in storage at the Victoria &AMP;
Albert Museum,'' Rosoman said. A replica was made in Ireland by
Donegal Carpets. Like much of the furniture in the home, the plain
curved sofas and chairs, upholstered in white matelasse, were
copied from photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Some vital decorative features of Eltham Palace's rooms were
found intact, like the ultramodern built-in sofa in Ginie
Courtauld's boudoir that had bookshelves attached. The restorers,
Schlapobersky &AMP; Boux, retouched paint on the black lacquer and
silver leaf doors in the dining room, with their Greek key design.
``I've seen decorative panels and screens like this before, but
never on a door,'' said Colin Schlapobersky, the owner of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's possessions were mostly scattered after they
abandoned Eltham in 1944 and moved, first to Scotland (which Ginie
thought too cold) and then to what is now Mutari, Zimbabwe, where
they built another grand house, La Rochelle. (He died in 1967, she
in 1972.) In 1995, English Heritage assumed management of Eltham
Palace from the Royal Army Education Corps, which moved in after
the Courtaulds. English Heritage commissioned designers and
manufacturers _ Restall, Brown &AMP; Clennell for sofas and armchairs,
Neil Stevenson for tables and chairs, Mulberry for textiles _ to
copy missing items. The dining room table by Stevenson has
practical modern touches like medium-density fiberboard under the
walnut veneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have bought look-alike pieces, but they can be
awful,'' Rosoman said. ``So we decided to re-create.'' Those
re-creations included paintings by artists like J.M.W. Turner,
which are integral to the scheme of the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed black-and-white photographs in a 1937 Country Life
magazine proved invaluable, as did drawings by John Seely and Peter
Paget, and by Engstromer, the Swedish designer. Rosoman tracked
down members of the Courtauld family, one of whom had a 1939
inventory listing every item in the house. Also useful were home
movies of the Courtaulds cavorting with relations, friends and
their Great Dane.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtaulds gave up their lease in 1944 after the palace,
situated on a hill with a view of St. Paul's Cathedral, was bombed.
And now Eltham Palace is reborn, a monument to the streamlined
esthetics of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Nine rooms at Eltham Palace are open to the public, including
two elaborate bathrooms and the great hall. The house is 20 minutes
by train from Charing Cross station in London. Information about
hours and admission prices is available from (011) 44-181-294-2548.
Eltham Palace is not open on Mondays, Tuesdays or Saturdays.

 FOOTPRINTS IN THE SAND FROM THE '60s  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMAGANSETT, N.Y. _ Up a sand drive that peels off a back road
there is a relic from a vanishing world: a modest 75-by-25-foot
glass-walled pavilion _ one story, two bedrooms, two baths, a
sunken living room, a galley kitchen and a perfect view.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built in 1963 for Beatrice Simpson, then a fashion
editor at Vogue, and she has been safeguarding it ever since.
Greeting visitors outside her front door, she was quick to ask them
not to kick the alternating lines of loose white and gray gravel
that she painstakingly maintains exactly as they were laid down by
her architect, Paul Lester Wiener. The gravel walk, the only paving
on the property, bleeds off into a long field of wild grasses and
Queen Anne's lace.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of Manhattanites who followed their artist
friends out to the South Fork of Long Island in the decades after
World War II, this was the Hamptons: a chunk of land and just
enough house to enjoy it. ``Weekend Utopia: The Modern Beach House
on Eastern Long Island, 1960-1973,'' an exhibition at the Guild
Hall Museum in East Hampton through Aug. 1, is a catalog of this
uneven period of architectural experimentation and a window into
the light heart of 1960s weekend style.
</P>
<P>
   The houses on display, by architects like Peter Blake, Andrew
Geller, Charles Gwathmey, Norman Jaffe and Julian and Barbara
Neski, are examples of that interesting mid-century moment when
American architecture had shaken the dogmas of modernism but had
not yet calcified into postmodern pastiche. As more gabled trophy
houses shoulder their way each month into the potato fields along
Montauk Highway, houses like Richard Meier's abstract yet fussy
Saltzman residence from 1969 _ which might once have been the last
word in chilly formalism _ are actually beginning to seem whimsical
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, it looked like it was going to take off as a hot
architectural colony,'' said Frank Newbold, the manager of the East
Hampton office of Sotheby's International Realty, who has 20 years
of experience with local property deals. ``But it didn't. People
took the safe route.'' They built and purchased middle-of-the-road
houses that many believed would be easier to resell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Newbold thinks the tide may be turning. He has noticed a
resurgence of interest in homes from the 1960s, particularly among
buyers in their 30s _ the same demographic, he noted, that is
driving the current demand for modern furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's like `The Jetsons,' icons of a bygone era,''
he said, adding, with some exaggeration, ``Five years ago you
couldn't give those houses away.''
</P>
<P>
   Alastair Gordon, the guest curator of ``Weekend Utopia'' and a
lifelong summer resident of the area, is frank about the polemics
of the show. ``Why are we so serious now?'' he asked, looking
around him at the new shingled mansions of East Hampton. ``There is
all this money and we're not under some politically oppressive
regime, but people on their own decide to do this retro style. I've
never understood it. All it takes is for people with enough
security in their own taste to start doing some experimental
building again.''
</P>
<P>
   For this younger, braver generation of homesteaders, ``Weekend
Utopia'' offers alternatives to home sweet home. The earliest
houses in the show were designed by Peter Blake, an architect and
writer. Reached at home in Riverdale, the Bronx, Blake reacted with
quiet rancor to the current state of Hamptons development.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole area, before all the twits came in, was all about
landscape, views of the water, and so on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his houses can be seen, with apologies to Le Corbusier,
as pared-down machines for looking. The Blake House of 1960, the
second he built for his family in the area, is a one-story wood and
glass slab, raised slightly off the wet turf on the edge of Mecox
Bay in Bridgehampton. A passageway _ Blake balks at referring to it
as a dog trot _ divides the living and sleeping areas and focuses
those arriving on a preferred view of the sea, now obscured in the
distance by more recent construction and, mercifully, a stand of
tall marsh grass at the edge of the property.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Blake added a 12-foot-long skylight that captured the
sunset, reflecting it down against a white wall, like a device for
watching a solar eclipse. Several of his other houses _ the nearby
Russell House, designed in collaboration with Julian Neski in 1956,
and the 1961 Armstrong House in Montauk _ were built, as he says,
``upside down,'' putting the living areas on high to capture
elusive views.
</P>
<P>
   This brand of idiosyncratic design may be impossible in an era
of jaw-dropping land prices and the related anxiety over resale
values. In 1954, Blake built his first Hamptons getaway, called the
Pinwheel House, in Water Mill for under $8,000. It is currently on
the market for $1.9 million. In June, a property just up the road
from his Bridgehampton house sold for $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Julian and Barbara Neski's own house in Water Mill, completed in
1965, is equally spare _ a simple, 1,350-square-foot box along the
modest lines of the Simpson and Blake houses. The once-aloof house
has struck a perfect chord with the wild privet and rhododendron
that surrounds it, seeming to melt back into its marshy site.
Unfortunately for the Neskis, who have maintained the house almost
exactly as it appeared in a photograph on the cover of The New York
Times Magazine in 1966, the foliage cannot hide the many
heavy-handed homes built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're in the estate section,'' Barbara Neski said when
reached at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That style makes them look aristocratic,'' she said of her new
neighbors in a row of shingle houses across an arm of Mecox Bay.
``They're going to come out in their hoop skirts and do their Jane
Austen thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the Joneses, the Neskis are planning their first
addition: a single guest bedroom that fits snugly onto the original
house.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the houses in the show, particularly Andrew
Geller's ingenious wooden spacecrafts, the Blake and Neski houses
seem at first to ignore their surroundings, stepping down gingerly
to the ground on the slender piles that were the fashion of the
day. But in their light touch, they show a respect for the area's
shifting sands that makes more massive contemporary construction
seem out of place.
</P>
<P>
   The singular revelation of ``Weekend Utopia'' is this
understated connection to the distinctive Hamptons landscape.
Norman Jaffe, the sought-after Hamptons architect, who drowned in
1993 while swimming off a Bridgehampton beach, built dozens of
houses in the area from the 1960s through the 1980s. His large
perspective renderings for several of the houses, never before
exhibited, show his love for the flat vistas and horizontal evening
light of the South Fork. A drawing of his Osofsky House, built on
Shelter Island in 1970, devotes most of the page to deeply worked
graphite smudges that depict an angry seaside sky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another treasure of the show, which was designed with a light
hand by John Cays and David Giovannitti, is the gorgeously beat-up
cardboard model of the house Charles Gwathmey built for his parents
in Amagansett. (The model was rescued from the trash by a Gwathmey
employee and is now safe in the collection of the Museum of Modern
Art.) The small house, unnervingly abstract and forcefully
vertical, was a magnet for controversy when it was completed in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gwathmey House hit an enormous nerve,'' Gordon said. ``It
became the subject of so much debate. I remember people saying,
`You should go up to Bluff Road because they're building some kind
of power station up there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Modern architecture was feared to be the ruination of the
Hamptons in the 1960s. ``It wasn't about fitting into the local
vernacular,'' Gordon, an architectural historian, explained. ``It
was `Hey, I'm a total urban cat, and I'm expressing my urbanism
here in a flamboyant way.'''
</P>
<P>
   The wittiest and most flamboyant houses in ``Weekend Utopia''
are without a doubt those designed by Andrew Geller, a local
architect and builder who is the closest thing in the show to a
grass-roots 1960s idealist. His houses, particularly the peaked and
faceted Elkin House, were often met with skepticism in the local
papers, though today it is hard to see how their good-humored
eccentricity could be seen as a threat. The 1,200-square-foot Elkin
House, nicknamed Reclining Picasso by Geller, was built in 1966, a
few hundred yards from the site that is being developed today for
Fair Field, Ira Rennert's 66,000-square-foot superhouse that has
redefined Hamptons excess. The Elkin House itself was torn down
several years ago to make way for what Gordon characterized as
``another McMansion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weekend Utopia'' has its own share of grandiose houses. The
1963 Bunshaft House in East Hampton, currently being refurbished by
Martha Stewart, is like a castoff lobby from one of the large
commercial buildings that made Gordon Bunshaft famous. Jack Lenor
Larsen's well-known Round House is an elaborate African fantasia
lost in intricate groves of bamboo. The show also includes several
projects that hint at the transition that would come when clients,
either as a result of skyrocketing property values or as simply a
loss of nerve, began to favor traditional styles over the personal
expressions of taste that had taken root in the area. The Seltzer
House by Jaquelin Robertson and several houses by Robert A.M. Stern
show those two architects groping toward the historicism that would
make them stars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The show, and those houses that, like Ms. Simpson's, have
survived in pristine condition, are a welcome antidote to the
uninspired bravado that followed the experimentation of the 1960s.
The Hamptons residents and would-be residents are beginning to see
what they've been missing, Gordon said. ``One of the great
surprises is how unhappy people are with the development that is
going on right now,'' he added. ``People are calling to say, `Maybe
we won't do that English country manor after all.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weekend Utopia: The Modern Beach House on Eastern Long Island,
1960-1973'' will be on view through Aug. 1 at the Guild Hall
Museum, 158 Main St., East Hampton. Information is available from

MIND OVER MATTER: A COMPUTER MAKES IT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The control of a mechanical device by the brain has long been
relegated to the realm of science fiction, and for good reason.
Measuring the signals from individual neurons over time presents
enormous technical challenges. Even more daunting, brain-hardware
interactions would seem to require a much deeper understanding of
the brain's basic messaging system than currently exists.
</P>
<P>
   But nevertheless, a group of researchers led by Dr. John K.
Chapin of the MCP Hahnemann School of Medicine in Philadelphia has
taken critical steps toward allowing the precise control of a
mechanical object by the brain alone. The study was reported in a
recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope that patients who have lost limbs will
someday be fitted with prosthetic limbs that they will control in
much the same way as they would real arms or legs. But the work
done so far involves only a small number of neurons in the brain,
and the experiments have been done only in rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that it can be done, but we need more neurons
involved to enable the precise control of a limb,'' explained
Chapin, a neurobiologist. ``There's a lot of pure technology needed
to get to the point where it can be done in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first example in which a mechanical device has
been controlled in real time through recordings of neuronal
impulses from many sites in clusters of nerve cells. That was made
possible in part by recent advances in implanted electrode
recording techniques. These advances allowed Chapin's team to
record and process signals from many neurons simultaneously,
following the same neuronal population over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To register brain signals over time reliably, you have to worry
about scar tissue and other changes in the brain in reaction to the
implant and about electrodes moving out of position, said a
neurobiologist who was not involved in the study, Dr. Jonathan
Wolpaw of the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of
Health in Albany. ``These issues have frustrated people for a long
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology isn't the only barrier. Controlling a mechanical
object with neural signals requires a deeper understanding of how
neurons work together in coordinating movement.
</P>
<P>
   Correlating movements with the actions of a group of neurons,
rather than just analyzing nerve cells in isolation, appears to be
a useful approach to the problem. ``It's a paradigm shift,'' said
Dr. Miguel A.L. Nicolelis, a professor of neurobiology at Duke
University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and an author of the
study. ``Just as one cannot predict the behavior of a galaxy by
tracking a single star, some of us believe that understanding the
brain requires looking at many neurons acting together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their experiment, the researchers trained rats to manipulate
an independent robotic arm to bring water from a dropper to their
mouths. The rats manipulated the arm by pressing on a spring-loaded
lever, a task that required careful positioning. At the same time,
the researchers measured the activity of up to 46 neurons with tiny
implanted electrodes. The neurons were from brain areas linked to
voluntary movement.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers built a device capable of translating the
neural signals into the language of computers as they were being
generated. The signals came from 32 neurons that seemed most
related to the pressing motion. The robot arm was eventually
disengaged from the lever and became directly controlled by the
rats' brains; the neural signals recorded drove the device.
</P>
<P>
   The rats could produce the neural signals when they thought
about pressing the lever but did not actually press it. So some of
them discovered that they could stop pressing the lever and could
control the arm directly through thought.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin said that indicated that the thought of moving could be
separated from the movement itself. The animal can activate the
neurons, he said, ``just by thinking about movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But using brain signals to control a device may lead brain
activity to change in response, which would make it harder to
develop a system for human prostheses. ``Once you've gone into the
system and changed the rules, it's not clear it's going to function
in the same way,'' Wolpaw said. ``It's a big unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   In studies of amputees, researchers have found that the brain
reconfigures itself once sensory input is shut off or changed.
Often neurons that used to control one limb will rewire themselves
to control other parts of the body, which leads to the phenomenon
known as phantom limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolelis hopes to address this issue, in part, by building in a
feedback mechanism that will introduce a dialogue between the brain
and the limb. That will be a component of his current project,
which uses owl monkeys instead of rodents. In it, they perform a
more complicated task, and signals are received from a much larger
group of neurons for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Since primate brains are nearly as complex as human ones, that
brings the researchers one step closer to their goal of making it
possible for people to be fitted with prostheses they can control
by thinking about them. But before the researchers can turn to
humans, they must address the invasive nature of the apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want cables coming out of someone's head,''
Nicolelis said. ``You want something safer and more comfortable.''
He is collaborating with biomedical engineers at Duke to build
brain implants that would communicate with a computer through radio
signals, eliminating the need for a tether.
</P>
<P>
   Noninvasive techniques already make it possible for people to
control devices by thinking. Wolpaw trains paralyzed people to use
their brains to move cursors on monitors; the thinking generates
electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity that are used to
move the cursors. But such methods can tire patients and be
imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   But these researchers believe that disabled people will someday
be able to control robot limbs by thinking about moving them. Who
knows? It may someday be possible to do word processing without
moving a muscle.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Recently I noticed a large number of what looked like flying
ants along the edge of my driveway and near my garage, although
they were not flying at the time. A neighbor told me he thought
these were termites and warned that I should call in an
exterminator as soon as possible to avoid serious damage. What do
you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: Subterranean termites (the kind that do the most damage to
homes) live in the soil and do grow wings once a year to fly away
from the nest and establish a new nest in a different location.
They are often mistaken for flying ants, but if examined closely
you can tell the difference between flying ants and termites. As
shown in the drawing, ants have a thin pinched waist that looks
like the body is in two parts, while termites have a one-piece body
that is relatively uniform in width. Both have four wings, but the
ant's rear wings are smaller than the front ones, while the
termite's wings are all uniform in size.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of months ago you wrote about a replacement sash and
jamb kit for old double-hung windows _ kits that enable one to
install new window sash without need for replacing the entire
window frame. I have checked the lumber yards in my community and
no one seems to carry these sash replacement kits. Do you know
where I can buy them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Numerous readers have written to me about this, so here is
the name of at least one manufacturer I know of who still makes and
distributes this type of kit. It's called Tilt Pac and is
manufactured by Marvin Windows and Doors, Highway 11, Warroad, MN
56763 (Phone number: 1-800-346-5128).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our backyard fence is coming apart because the original wood
posts are starting to rot where they go into the ground. So, I am
going to put up a new wood fence. Can you tell me the best way to
install the new posts so they will not rot?
</P>
<P>
   A. The posts and rails should be made of pressure-treated lumber
so they will be more rot-resistant. Make the post holes anwywhere
from 24 to 36 inches deep (depending on the height of the post and
the depth of the frost line in your area). In addition, the bottom
of each post hole should have another 6 inches of gravel poured in
and the post set on top of this. Then plumb each post to make sure
it is level and nail temporary braces to the side and back of the
post to hold it in position. Fill the hole around the post with
freshly mixed concrete. Trowel this off at the surface so that the
concrete slopes away from the post on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Q. An aluminum ladder left black marks on the ceramic tile floor
of my kitchen floor and although I have tried many cleaners,
nothing has worked to remove these marks. What can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most aluminum stepladders have rubber pads on the bottom of
each leg and this is probably what caused the black marks. In most
cases such marks can be removed with a solvent such as paint
thinner or kerosene, rubbing this on with a kitchen abrasive pad
and allowing it soak on the stain for a minute or two before wiping
off with a coarse rag. Repeat if necessary, using a pad of fine
steel wool and rubbing more vigorously.

GUESSING WHO IS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people have heard of the Turing test, the famous probe of
computer intelligence named after Alan Turing, the British
mathematician who suggested it. He proposed that if a computer
could carry on a typed conversation with a person and successfully
impersonate a human, that computer could be called intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Not as many people know that when Turing wrote a paper in 1950
proposing the test, he said readers could gain an understanding of
what he was driving at if they played a game in which the object
was to guess a person's sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator,
the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten,''
Turing wrote. ``The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter
communicating between the two rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a computer science graduate student at the Georgia Institute
of Technology in Atlanta has invented the Turing Game, an online
multiplayer game whose goal is to separate posers from the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, three or four people, some pretending to be what
they are not, answer questions from other players, who try to spot
the impostors. If the object is to find the women on the panel,
players might ask, ``Describe your last really bad haircut'' or
``What was your last boyfriend's biggest flaw?''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Turing Game seems like a trivial parlor
game, a little like an online version of ``The Dating Game.'' But
Joshua Berman, the 28-year-old doctoral candidate in computer
science who created the game, said he had loftier goals.
</P>
<P>
   The game is fodder for Berman's dissertation, which examines
identity and culture in online communities. ``I'm looking at parts
of our identity and culture we take with us when we go online and
what we leave behind,'' Berman said. Prospective players are warned
that what they say is immediately posted on the Web site _ people
are identified by their online names _ and may be used in Berman's
study.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the Internet itself, where identity is
routinely obscured and manipulated, is one big Turing Game. But
Berman's game brings structure, as well as a little applied
sociology, to the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   When people guess incorrectly, Berman said, they spend some time
thinking about why. ``It's more interesting to lose than to win in
this game,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's trial phase, most of the play has centered on
people's sex, but not on their sexuality. The game is definitely
rated G, concentrating on questions involving relationships or
behavior. Other possible variations would have players
distinguishing adults from teen-agers, gay people from
heterosexuals, East Coasters from West Coasters, American players
from British players or Northerners from Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had the guts to try a race game yet,'' said Amy
Bruckman, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech who is Berman's
thesis adviser and co-designer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although his research has been sponsored in part by Microsoft,
Berman said he had no plans to commercialize the Turing Game. He
said he looked at the game as an educational tool for examining
issues of culture, sex roles, ethnicity and identity. ``One of the
joys of being in graduate school is I can do something like this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Turing Game, which is available in a public trial version,
can be downloaded at www.cc.gatech.edu/elc/turing for PCs.

<P>
   Q. I have a new iMac and need to install Virtual PC so I can use
a Windows accounting program. What do I need to run Virtual PC?
</P>
<P>
   A. For Macintosh users who need to run Windows-only programs,
software like Virtual PC from Connectix (www.connectix.com) and
Soft Windows from Insignia Solutions (www.insignia.com) can
transform the Mac into a temporary PC.
</P>
<P>
   These programs emulate Windows and run best on a Mac with a fast
processor, plenty of RAM and a good chunk of hard drive space.
Although these software solutions won't run Windows programs as
fast as a real PC or a Mac with a special hardware card installed,
the programs do let Mac users visit the ``other side'' from the
comfort of their own machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual PC program will let Mac users drag and drop files
between their Mac and Windows desktops, copy and paste text and
graphics from one platform to the other, run Windows CD-ROMs and
games, and surf the Web in the PC environment. It comes in versions
for Windows 95 and 98 (there's also a version for DOS).
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 98 edition of Virtual PC, which sells for about
$180, needs a Mac with a G3 processor (which the iMac has) and a
minimum of 48 megabytes of RAM, although the manufacturer
recommends 64 megabytes for better performance. The program needs a
minimum of 280 megabytes of hard drive space, but a full 300
megabytes of space is recommended.

   MIAMI _ It wasn't so long ago, in the 1980s, when even the
tiniest of the Caribbean's sun-splashed islands enjoyed a spot on
America's front burner.
</P>
<P>
   After the island of Grenada fell into the hands of some
homegrown communists, prompting the 1983 U.S. invasion, the United
States lavished the region _ considered a strategic buffer against
perceived communists _ with economic aid like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every U.S. government agency had a department devoted to
Caribbean-based programs.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than that for the financially strapped region
was President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offered
unprecedented trade preferences to 24 friendly nations in both the
Caribbean and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to promote U.S. investment _ and it worked.
Caribbean exports shot through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   But the luster began to dim in 1994 with the implementation of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which handed
Mexico the competitive edge of more elaborate trade preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Mexico's exports that began to soar, while countries
such as Jamaica and Trinidad began to lose jobs, markets, and
income.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.' small neighbors have pressed for a ``NAFTA-parity
bill'' ever since, but it's been hard to get Washington to re-focus
on a region that's been away from the spotlight since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after languishing for years, it looks like legislation
designed to enhance Reagan's 1983 program finally stands a chance
on Capitol Hill, where it has drawn strong support from Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the measure would jump-start the fragile
economies of vulnerable nations such as Dominica and Honduras
during a period of increasing crime, unemployment, and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, they say it would also benefit U.S. consumers by
reducing the prices of Caribbean imports, such as clothing, while
giving a boost to businesses in several states. From the cotton
fields of Texas, to the large seaports of Florida, to the textile
industries of both Georgia and North Carolina, the effects would be
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is a cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Unions fear the expansion of trade benefits will lead to a loss
of jobs to the Caribbean as well as reduced wages in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Congress, deep divisions remain over the specifics of
the legislation, meaning it may be difficult for supporters to win
approval by Aug. 6, when Congress adjourns for its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate version, which cleared the Senate Finance
Committee last month, tariffs would be eliminated only on imports
such as apparel and luggage that are assembled in the Caribbean
using yarn, cotton and fabric grown or processed in the United
States. The House version, passed by the House Ways and Means
Committee, would allow fabric produced in the Caribbean and Central
America to be used as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions would eliminate tariffs on items such as footwear,
apparel, textiles, canned tuna, leather goods, and petroleum that
were excluded under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   All this has leaders in the Caribbean and Central America, still
reeling from the devastation wrought last year by Hurricanes
Georges and Mitch, holding their collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for our economies to recover without
this bill. If it doesn't go through, you could see more people
migrating to the United States.'' said Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa,
Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States. ``It also means good
opportunities for American companies because we will buy more
equipment from the United States and retain services of U.S.
consultants and contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to Caribbean trade legislation, it's not
always easy to see what the fuss is about. After all, the
legislation would extend benefits to economies that together equal
only 2.5 percent the size of an $8.5 trillion superpower.
</P>
<P>
   . Yet the region's far from inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Basin _ a region made up of 24 countries in both
the Caribbean and Central America, including the Bahamas, Haiti,
and Nicaragua _ is the United States' sixth-largest export market.
Indeed the United States sells 1.5 times as much to Caribbean Basin
countries as it does to China.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports to the region have grown from $5.8 billion in 1983
to $20.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that growth is due to the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
which reduced tariffs for some 70 percent of imports from the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   That initiative, coupled with low labor costs, drew all sorts of
U.S. industries to the region and allowed them to capture business
that had previously been lost to lower-cost Asian competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, the growth of apparel
manufacturing has slowed, as garment makers have increasingly
turned to Mexico, where clothing is about 40 percent cheaper to
make.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, while the volume of apparel imported from the region to
the United States continued to grow, the Caribbean Basin nations'
share of U.S. apparel imports declined for the first time since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexico's garment sales to the United States topped $6
billion last year, rivaling that of all the Caribbean nations
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to Jamaica, where wages are higher and unions are
stronger than they are in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The island, once an apparel powerhouse, saw a 10 percent drop in
its apparel exports to the United States last year. It also has
seen its number of apparel jobs slip by about one-third since
NAFTA, to 22,000 last year, said Peter King, chairman of the
Jamaica-based Caribbean Textile and Apparel Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say economic declines like this one portend more growth
in drug trafficking and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Already, between 25 and 30 percent of the illegal drugs in the
United States transit the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, any economic decline will mean a growth in drug
trafficking and a growth in illegal immigration because people have
to find a way to survive,'' said Larry Birns, head of the Council
on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based research group.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its close proximity, Florida is the first to feel the
impact of immigration pressures and the flow of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other reasons why the state, which is the largest
trading partner with the Caribbean, stands to gain from the trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small- and medium-sized exporters and
manufacturers in Florida who can't get into big markets like
Brazil's, but they do operate successfully in the smaller markets
of the Caribbean and Central America,'' said Manny Mencia, vice
president of international trade for Enterprise Florida Inc., the
state's economic development group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, nearly half of everything the Caribbean Basin
buys from the United States goes through Florida's ports and
airports,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Florida provides everything from computers to beauty supplies to
the region, while the Caribbean Basin in turn provides flowers,
fish, fresh produce, and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, too, have a lot riding on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel and textile industry representatives in both Georgia and
North Carolina say the legislation will help to keep them
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our products become more competitive with products from the
Far East if we can take the fabric made from U.S. yarn and cotton
and send it to the Caribbean to be sewn,'' said Roy Bowen,
president of the Georgia Textile Manufacturers Association in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If apparel making grows in the Caribbean, so will consumption of
U.S. and Caribbean-produced textiles, including U.S. yarn and
cotton.
</P>
<P>
   And that bodes well for Texas, the largest cotton-producing
state, as well as for Georgia, the second-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Ellis, president of the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute and chairman of Southern Mills Inc. in Atlanta, said the
legislation could save the U.S. textile industry as much as $500
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is a savings that could be passed on to consumers,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   That savings could come in the form of lower prices on items
like apparel, carpets, draperies, and sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that the textile industry forms the backbone of many
communities in the less-developed parts of Georgia, such as in and
around Albany and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The textile industry employs about 104,000 people in Georgia;
the apparel industry employs another 27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sorini, senior vice president for Chicago's Fruit of the
Loom, said the legislation would increase U.S. textile exports by
an estimated $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be important for all the port towns along the Gulf
Coast because there will be a lot more trade going back and forth
between the United States and the Caribbean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another rationale for expanding Caribbean trade looms in 2005,
when all quotas on apparel and textile exports from World Trade
Organization members are to be lifted. Once this happens, cheaper
products made in places like India and elsewhere produced from
fabric and thread from the Far East could flood U.S. markets,
driving out apparel made from U.S. textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do nothing before 2005 to enhance the Caribbean's
assembly sector, then we'll all be out of work because all the
business will go to the Far East, where the cotton will be grown
and the textiles will be spun,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., one
of the measure's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he is optimistic that the legislation will pass this
year.

   Yet the Clinton administration has tried more than once to slide
NAFTA-parity past Congress since 1994, efforts usually quashed by
southern legislators representing union interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overriding objective is to get a bill passed and signed
this year that will eliminate tariffs on textiles and apparel, and
we feel the momentum is finally there to do just that,'' said one
U.S. trade official.
</P>
<P>
   This year the initiative has something new going for it:
Hurricanes Georges and Mitch. Last year they killed thousands of
people and laid waste to whole communities, prompting sympathetic
calls in Congress for long-term reconstruction assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on July 16, the House approved a far-ranging American
economic initiative for Africa that offers enhanced trade benefits
to African nations, the first major trade-promotion measure passed
by the House since NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hopes to incorporate the Caribbean trade bill into
this measure. More important, though, is that Lott has vowed to
bring the legislation to the Senate floor and help secure final
passage this year. Differences between the House and Senate
versions would be worked out in committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bill's future is uncertain in a Congress that has
decidedly mixed feelings about the benefits of trade agreements,
especially when they involve a region no longer on Washington's
radar screen. The Caribbean, for example, has experienced a 90
percent drop in U.S. economic aid over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Caribbean feels like the United States has pretty much
forgotten about it,'' said Anthony Bryan, professor of
international relations at the University of Miami. ``This is
Congress' chance to show the region that the United States hasn't
turned its back on it.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ It wasn't so long ago, in the 1980s, when even the
tiniest of the Caribbean's sun-splashed islands enjoyed a spot on
America's front burner.
</P>
<P>
   After the island of Grenada fell into the hands of some
homegrown communists, prompting the 1983 U.S. invasion, the United
States lavished the region _ considered a strategic buffer against
perceived communists _ with economic aid like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every U.S. government agency had a department devoted to
Caribbean-based programs.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than that for the financially strapped region
was President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offered
unprecedented trade preferences to 24 friendly nations in both the
Caribbean and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to promote U.S. investment _ and it worked.
Caribbean exports shot through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   But the luster began to dim in 1994 with the implementation of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which handed
Mexico the competitive edge of more elaborate trade preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Mexico's exports that began to soar, while countries
such as Jamaica and Trinidad began to lose jobs, markets, and
income.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.' small neighbors have pressed for a ``NAFTA-parity
bill'' ever since, but it's been hard to get Washington to re-focus
on a region that's been away from the spotlight since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after languishing for years, it looks like legislation
designed to enhance Reagan's 1983 program finally stands a chance
on Capitol Hill, where it has drawn strong support from Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the measure would jump-start the fragile
economies of vulnerable nations such as Dominica and Honduras
during a period of increasing crime, unemployment, and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, they say it would also benefit U.S. consumers by
reducing the prices of Caribbean imports, such as clothing, while
giving a boost to businesses in several states. From the cotton
fields of Texas, to the large seaports of Florida, to the textile
industries of both Georgia and North Carolina, the effects would be
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is a cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Unions fear the expansion of trade benefits will lead to a loss
of jobs to the Caribbean as well as reduced wages in this country.

A BULB WITH A DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: sidebar at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many light bulb jokes does it take to change a halogen?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: a lot. Jokes may help to control your
frustration if the replacement bulb from the hardware store turns
out to be the wrong size, or if snapping out the old bulb and
putting in a new one proves to be difficult or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Halogen bulbs (or lamps, as they are more properly called) have
been around for about 30 years, but they are still largely
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halogen is a type of chemistry, not a type of light bulb,''
said Daniel Blitzer, a lighting designer and consultant. ``In the
same sense that you wouldn't routinely tell someone to pick up an
incandescent bulb or a fluorescent bulb and expect that whatever
came back would be appropriate to the lighting fixture, you can't
do that with halogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Joseph ReyBarreau, the director of the Lighting
and Design Center at the University of Kentucky, said: ``Halogens
by their nature are not any more complex than standard
incandescent, but as halogens have become more popular, more shapes
and sizes are available.''
</P>
<P>
   But because halogens operate at higher temperatures, the lamps
can bind themselves to the fixtures, making them harder to remove.
And John Massie, a principal in Edwin Jones Co. in Dallas, which
designs and sells theatrical lighting and lighting control systems,
said consumers may have trouble with replacements for a simpler
reason: ``People are buying these things at Kmart and not reading
the instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   (For consumers who are stumped by changing the lamp, the
American Lighting Association maintains an information line:
800-274-4484.)
</P>
<P>
   Changing the lamps is only part of the problem. Another
peculiarity of halogen is high wattage and high operating
temperatures. Air-conditioning systems are straining these days to
keep up with the summer heat, and for every 3 watts of electricity
used in a house or office, the air-conditioner will use another
watt to move the heat out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   A solution for the environmentally conscious, or for people
whose homes or offices are too hot, is compact fluorescents, which
are now available in models that can be dimmed or work at three
different light levels. They are available from Real Goods, a
catalog specializing in environmental products: (800) 762-7325 or
www.realgoods.com.
</P>
<P>
   Halogen lamps come in a profusion of shapes partly because they
are smaller than ordinary lamps, and as a result, there are new
design possibilities for track lights, spotlights and other
applications. The light they produce is much closer to natural
light, Massie said, and with their small size, they can be focused
more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Small size is inherent in the technology. Like ordinary lamps,
halogen is an incandescent, meaning that it passes electrons
through a tungsten filament, which gives off light and heat. Over
hundreds of hours, the filament in an ordinary lamp evaporates into
the gas inside the bulb. Mixed with inert gas _ usually nitrogen _
the tungsten is gradually deposited some place cooler, generally on
the inside surface of the glass. That makes the glass appear darker
and reduces the light output. Eventually, the filament breaks.
</P>
<P>
   If the gas is halogen, however, the tungsten burning off the
filament binds with the halogen and is then redeposited on the
filament itself, extending the lamp's life _ and keeping the
tungsten off the glass, which means the lamp is bright through its
entire lifetime. But the lamp has to stay hotter to prevent the
tungsten from being deposited anywhere but on the filament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to keep the temperature up to make the halogen cycle
work,'' said David Van Horn, an electrical engineer in Hartford
City, Ind. This is one reason they consume such prodigious amounts
of electricity, he said. ``You can't get something for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   High temperature also dictates the choice of glass. The nitrogen
of ordinary lamps is at normal atmospheric pressure, allowing the
use of ordinary glass. But for the halogen lamp to be hotter, the
gas is kept under pressure. That means special glass, which is
vulnerable to the salts carried on the human finger. So, from
torchiers to automobile headlamps, that glass, which is made with
quartz, is a problem. It won't last if it picks up fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else: the lamp is so hot that it can ignite
draperies or flammable materials. The glass envelope in a halogen
lamp can reach 1,000 degrees, double the temperature in some
ordinary lamps. Yet the hotter filament also gives the lamp its mix
of colors and makes it seem whiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer wants that very bright, white light,'' said Larry
Lauck, spokesman for the American Lighting Association. ``Even a
75-watt incandescent, if you go and put your hand on it, is going
to burn you.'' A halogen, he insisted, ``will not start a fire if
you use it properly.'' To make sure they are used properly,
torchiers, which caused most of the problems, are now supposed to
come with grids to keep flammable materials away from the lamp.

   A DUMMY'S GUIDE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ELAINE LOUIE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Each year, at least 500 frantic people call Lee's Studio, a
lighting and furniture shop in midtown Manhattan, for help in
changing halogen bulbs. ``They are afraid the bulb will break in
their hand,'' said Mitchell Steinberg, the buyer for the store,
``or that the bulb and the socket have fused together.'' His staff
explains over the phone how to change the bulb, or invites them to
make an appointment with the shop's electricians who will do the
job for them, for free (212 581-4400).
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg offered some general tips. ``First, unplug the lamp,''
he said sensibly. Have either a cotton glove or a tissue handy, so
the salts on your hand won't damage the glass. If you must touch
the glass, wipe it off with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the design of the lamp, here's a dummy's guide to
changing the bulb:
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sapper's 1972 Tizio lamp (very difficult)
</P>
<P>
   1. Use a screwdriver or fingernail to lift up the 2-inch-square
piece of metal.
</P>
<P>
   2. Push down the tiny button on the second metal rectangle,
which releases the reflector.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pull out the bulb backward, from the rear, and detach the
bulb from the socket by pulling the socket away from the bulb. (The
socket is attached to a wire.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Insert the new bulb. Lock the reflector in place. Line up the
bulb and socket, and slip the socket over the metal end of the
bulb, the closed part of the socket on top, the open part beneath.
</P>
<P>
   5. Insert the counterweight, and close the lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sapper's 1992 Tizio lamp (fairly easy)
</P>
<P>
   1. Pull out the spring clip, which releases the piece of glass.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove the bi-pin bulb, wiggling it gently side to side,
while at the same time pulling it out.
</P>
<P>
   3. Put in the new bulb, wiggling it from side to side while
pushing.
</P>
<P>
   4. Replace the glass and the spring clip.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Meda and Paolo Rizzatto's 1985 Berenice lamp (difficult)
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to remove the bi-pin bulb without touching the
glass. Pull the bulb from the two center slots, which conceal the
holes for the pins. Replace by inserting a new bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Two sockets (fairly difficult)
</P>
<P>
   Popular for floor lamps, the bulb is a 4-inch-long tube, the
diameter of a pencil. It slips into spring-loaded sockets at both
ends. Replacing the bulb is like replacing a roll of toilet paper
in a spring-loaded holder, but people are afraid of breaking the
glass tube.

COMPUTER COLUMN: COOKING UP NEW HELP FOR HOME PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than one-third of America's 120 million workers do all or
part of their work at home. While they may go to work in fuzzy
slippers and bathrobes from time to time, home-office workers who
want to compete with larger companies cannot afford to be casual or
sloppy in their business correspondence. They need to produce the
same high-quality reports and brochures as the big corporate
offices do, but with fewer resources. They want to look like a
million bucks without spending a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Many software packages are available that can guide users
through the creation of standard business documents. Templates for
letterheads, envelopes and common consumer publications like
calendars, greeting cards and newsletters are standard features on
many word processing programs and simple desktop publishing
packages.
</P>
<P>
   But big differences remain between a professionally created and
printed brochure, for example, and one that has been cranked out of
an inexpensive color inkjet printer, differences that are magnified
when one is bidding on a big contract or trying to impress a new
client.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe Systems recently introduced a new version of its Pagemaker
desktop publishing program, Pagemaker 6.5 Plus, with home offices
in mind. It comes with scores of professionally designed document
templates, thousands of royalty-free images and illustrations, and
more than 100 high-quality type fonts that can be used to create
impressive business documents, including letterheads, business
cards, reports, fliers, brochures, labels and even Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The cost varies. The list price is $499, but for users upgrading
from a recent version of Pagemaker, it is $99. For registered users
of Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, it is $199. And for
current users of Microsoft Publisher, $299.
</P>
<P>
   The templates are finely crafted electronic documents whose main
elements can be customized and replaced with the user's material,
while retaining all the fancy and sometimes esoteric computer
coding that would otherwise take a beginning Pagemaker user weeks
to master.
</P>
<P>
   While making it easier for novices to create high-quality
business documents, Pagemaker 6.5 Plus remains, at its core, a
complex and powerful desktop publishing program that requires
considerable effort to learn. It is not intended for casual
computer users who need to create holiday newsletters for friends
and family once a year. Simpler, less expensive programs are
available for such tasks, including Broderbund's Print Shop and
Microsoft's Publisher. Nor is Pagemaker Plus intended for
professional graphic artists, who are more likely to use an
industrial-strength layout and publishing program like Quark Xpress
or Adobe's new Indesign program.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Pagemaker 6.5 Plus is intended for use in home offices
and small businesses that have to produce professional-looking
documents regularly without having a professional graphic designer
on staff.
</P>
<P>
   One could certainly hire a good graphic designer to create a
custom business document for much less than the cost of the
Pagemaker program. And there are certain kinds of documents, like
price lists, that Pagemaker Plus ignores in its template
collections, leaving the user the choice of hiring a professional
or trying to design one from scratch. But over time, for a wide
range of projects, the built-in design capabilities of Pagemaker
almost certainly will be more cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   And, if my home office is typical, a report or document often
must be created at the last minute for a meeting or presentation
the next day. Unlike many human graphic designers, the Pagemaker
Plus CD-ROM disk can be called on at 2 a.m. when a next-day
deadline looms.
</P>
<P>
   I found the templates very easy to use, once I figured out what
each one was. While the document templates and digital images are
well organized in general categories, Adobe could have done a
better job of identifying specific templates, which show up on
screen initially as miniature pictograms labeled only by number.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the templates serve double duty as impromptu
graphic design tutorials. Design tips, in the form of text boxes,
are attached to particular features in the templates, so users get
an education in graphic design as they go along. The tips are
hidden when the finished document is printed.
</P>
<P>
   Pagemaker Plus also comes with a clearly written Getting Started
guide that offers creative design guidance for novices, including
before and after examples of bad design and good design. I was
chagrined that many of the before examples looked nearly identical
to the documents I had produced, proudly, when Pagemaker first
transformed a Macintosh computer and a laser printer into a
personal printing press more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bones of the template are fleshed out with the user's
text and graphics and the file is saved, the document is ready to
be printed. Inexpensive laser and inkjet printers today are so good
that one can get adequate results from almost any printer.
</P>
<P>
   But for professional quality results, the files created in
Pagemaker can be taken on a disk or sent electronically over the
Internet to a service bureau, like the nationwide Kinko's or
Alphagraphics chains, which specialize in quick, high-quality,
relatively low-volume printing on commercial job presses or color
copiers.
</P>
<P>
   All the coding and file information that a professional printer
needs are embedded in the Pagemaker file, so the documents will
look exactly in print as they did on the computer screen. That is
not always the case with the beginner desktop printing programs,
which are not designed for high-resolution, top-quality printing.
</P>
<P>
   So, after a 4 a.m. trip to Kinko's, we come home with a cleverly
designed, professionally printed document that no one would guess
was created by a graphically challenged klutz working in his
underwear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next step, of course, is to ruin the effect by stuffing the
gorgeous document into an envelope with a scribbled address and a
stamp that looks like it was applied with drool from a Labrador
retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Many home office workers would like to create a more
professional look on the envelope. But postage meters, the kind the
big companies use, are expensive and impractical for home offices
or small businesses that do not generate a lot of mail. The meters
have to be carried back to the post office periodically to be reset
with credits for printing more electronic stamps.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Postal Service, about 7 million people
walk into a post office every weekday, and 70 percent of them go to
buy stamps or to have their postage meters reset. Amazingly, it
seems that all of them arrive online at my post office just before
I get there.
</P>
<P>
   In the next couple of months, the Postal Service is expected to
approve national trials of new Internet-based technologies that
seek to make standing online for store-bought, tongue-licked stamps
a thing of the past. If all goes well, any home office or small
business worker will be able to buy postage via the Internet at any
time, day or night, and use nearly any common office printer to put
a barcodelike electronic stamp, along with the recipient's address,
on an envelope or mailing label. It would be the perfect finishing
touch for all those beautiful Pagemaker-created documents.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, E-stamp of San Mateo, Calif. (www.estamp.com) and
Stamps.com of Santa Barbara, Calif. (www.stamps.com) are leading
the pack in preliminary trials of their electronic stamp systems.
The trials are open only to consumers in certain ZIP codes in
California and the Washington, D.C., area, but demonstrations are
available on their respective Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   E-stamp uses special software and a small hardware device, a
digital stamp vault, that attaches to the user's computer. The user
buys a block of postage via the Internet and stores it in the vault
for use any time, paying a small surcharge (probably 10 percent
over the face value of the stamps) for the convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com, in contrast, is a software-only system that enables
customers to buy stamps as needed, even one at a time, at face
value, but with a service fee of several dollars a month. The
Stamps.com system avoids the need for a hardware dongle, but the
tradeoff is that a user must connect to the Internet each time a
stamp is needed.
</P>
<P>
   If either system is to succeed, it must be as easy to use as the
lick-and-stick method of conventional stamps, noted Bonnie Brooks,
an analyst with Creative Strategies Inc. of Campbell, Calif.

COURT RENEWS EFFORT TO CULL JURY FOR CISNEROS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. District Court will send 2,000 summonses
to residents of the nation's capital in a second attempt at raising
a jury pool for the conspiracy trial of former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros, court officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 500 people responded to 2,500 jury notifications mailed
July 2 by the federal court, according to Jury Commissioner
Victoria Hairston. Of those, 161 were qualified, but 63 sought to
be excused from a trial that could last eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Stanley Sporkin seeks a pool of 300 prospective
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston said she would send second summonses to the 2,000 who
failed to respond to the first notice for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is accused of concealing $250,000 in hush money paid to
his onetime mistress, Linda Jones, to protect his nomination by
President Clinton to be secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   He has pleaded innocent to the charges of conspiracy and lying
to federal agents about the payments to Jones, a former San Antonio
political fund-raiser known by her married name, Linda Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, then the mayor of San Antonio, announced in 1988 that
he was having an extramarital affair with Jones, but he never
divulged the private payments he made after the relationship
soured.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is currently
president of the Spanish-language television network Univision in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sporkin has yet to rule whether the telephone
conversations with Cisneros that Jones had taped can be admitted
into evidence at the conspiracy trial. She is the government's key
witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is serving time in a federal prison in Texas for bank
fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Women identify with Melissa Bank, whether she likes
it or not. In the midst of a whistle-stopping, 16-city tour to
promote her best-selling 30-something Bildungsroman, ``The Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' (Viking), she has come face-to-face
with readers who all act as if they know her intimately. Not only
that, many of them seem to think she knows them really well, too.
</P>
<P>
   At book signings, fans proffer their brand-new copies of the
volume and ask Ms. Bank, a first-time author, to inscribe them,
``To my best friend.'' Sitting on an Arts &AMP; Crafts-style sofa with
a threadbare green cushion in her apartment in the Chelsea section
of Manhattan, Ms. Bank took a drag on an ever-ready cigarette. ``In
those cases,'' she said dryly, ``I always write, `I feel so close
to you right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of barbed verbal flourish one might expect from
the book's feisty heroine, Jane, as she makes her way through the
book's seven short stories. Whether a callow teen-ager observing
her older brother's inscrutable mating rituals or a world-weary
cancer survivor mustering the strength to let a nice guy who's
wrong for her go, Jane communicates in rapid-fire quips.
</P>
<P>
   At times she sounds like Groucho Marx. (Come work for me, a
lover says when Jane loses her job. Jane says, ``I could bring you
up on charges for that.'' What? ``Work harassment in the sexual
place.'') At others she's a smart-aleck sitcom child. (``Chips
Ahoy!'' Jane calls out, flirting with a charter-boat captain.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief to discover that Ms. Bank in person didn't talk
in zingers. Still, the 38-year-old author was a formidable
presence. The kind of ``girl'' that a favorite teacher might call
``healthy'' and a mother ``statuesque,'' she sat on the sofa in a
short blue sundress with bare tanned legs. A black Labrador named
Maybelline was curled up on the sofa at her side, panting heavily
into a reporter's tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel incredibly comfortable around Melissa,'' her
agent, Molly Friedrich, one of a clutch of women to whom the book
is dedicated, said by telephone. ``She becomes part of your life in
a very 3-D way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the cramped one-bedroom apartment suggested that
Ms. Bank is at the eye of a literary whirlwind. In February 1998,
her manuscript was auctioned for $275,000, rare for a novice, let
alone a book of short stories. Now in its 10th printing, the book
has already made it onto best-seller lists in the United States,
England and France.
</P>
<P>
   The title story, a romantic parody inspired by the 1996
how-to-get-your-M.R.S. book, ``The Rules,'' has been optioned by
Francis Ford Coppola. (In fact, the story was commissioned by
Zoetrope, a small literary magazine founded by Coppola to showcase
new talent.)
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker called ``The Girls' Guide'' far subtler than
``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' its British kissing cousin in subject
matter, which was published to just as much hoopla last year. In
the spring, Ms. Bank was paired with Helen Fielding, the author of
``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' for an appearance at the 92nd Street Y.
The event was mobbed with earnest young women.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last week, Ms. Bank, just back from the London leg
of her book tour, seemed about halfway through the roller-coaster
ride: her adrenaline was still high, but the thrill of being on top
of the loop was beginning to flag.
</P>
<P>
   Her place looked as if it belonged to someone who likes things
more for their personal relevance than their style _ thus a pile of
gray rocks in a bowl. A bicycle partly blocked the narrow entrance;
magazines and dog toys filled a basket on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her library consisted largely of recent-vintage paperbacks, with
a discreet stack of copies of her own book behind the double doors
to a small bedroom. (Approximate distance from bedside to bathroom
door: the length of an ankle to a thigh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of perfecting the skill of being alone writing,''
Ms. Bank said, as she blasely mopped up water spilled from a glass
knocked over by Maybelline's wagging tail, ``suddenly it's: `Be
very entertaining. Now.' And that's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the writer's nook that is Ms. Bank's home seemed under
siege by well-wishers. In the course of an interview, the phone
rang with requests to write, to comment, to appear at various
events. Roses arrived by messenger. ``Wouldn't it be nice if they
were from a boyfriend?'' Ms. Bank said, ripping open the card,
reading it and betraying not the slightest disappointment when she
added, ``or a publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bank grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia where, she said,
``you were supposed to be having a happy childhood, but you
weren't.'' She studied art at Hobart College, where she ``failed
miserably at art classes'' and then took up writing. Like Jane, she
has a can-do-no-wrong older brother and still muses about the
aftereffects of a four-year affair with a distinguished older man
(in her case, a professor, not a book editor).
</P>
<P>
   The parallels to her fictional character were obvious as soon as
Ms. Bank offered a diet ginger ale. (Jane drinks diet root beer.)
But it was soon evident how completely ``The Girls' Guide'' is an
act of the imagination, where the past has been filtered and
color-corrected to convey a sharper impression of growing up in a
world that doesn't always measure up to one's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The character of Jane's father comes closer to reality than any
other, Ms. Bank said. Like the father in the story ``The Worst
Thing a Suburban Girl Can Imagine,'' Ms. Bank's father died of
leukemia, having kept his condition a secret from his children for
nine years. It was a turning point for Ms. Bank, just as it was for
Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he got sick, he was kind of remote,'' the author
recalled. ``Knowing he was dying, I think, affected his sense of
his role as a father. He was always there for us in tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, after her father dies, Jane snaps to attention,
quits her job and dumps her alcoholic older suitor. Similarly, Ms.
Bank hit rock bottom and read herself the riot act. ``For a long
time, I treated life like it wasn't real yet, that I was on
standby,'' she said. ``My father's death made me realize it all
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ms. Bank was a copywriter at McCann-Erickson, the
advertising agency. Stayfree Maxi pads, Marriott hotels and AT&AMP;T
were some of the accounts she worked on. She wrote her own stories
in the office late at night. Richard Eber, her boss then, said he
was surprised how funny the book was. ``I told Melissa: `No wonder
you're still single. Most men wouldn't be able to handle that kind
of humor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Being cast in the role of Ur single gal doesn't interest Ms.
Bank. ``I'd rather be the voice of pet owners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced women in Wisconsin want to compare notes. Television
hosts ask if it's true that high-powered women are sexually
dysfunctional. (``How should I know; I'm not sexually
dysfunctional,'' she said, exasperated at the exchange.) And
everyone wants to know if she's dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm not _ for a few months, at least,'' said Ms.
Bank, who longs for the solitary routine of writing. Her next book
may or may not involve Jane but will certainly chronicle the
mixed-message mores of urban courtship that are her forte.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out for a dog walk _ a ritual that seemed for the
moment to rank above dating but below writing _ Ms. Bank told an
anecdote about men, women and hedges. A couple of single men were
sitting on the other side of the bushes that divided the deck of
her summer-rental in the Hamptons from theirs. ``People are always
advising you that really smart men are more interested in your
personality than your looks,'' she said, adding that she couldn't
resist tuning into their every word. ``Well, all they talked about
were women and their bodies.'' And when Ms. Bank heard one of them
remarking that a particular woman would be so much more appealing
if she'd just lose five pounds, she exploded. Her voice boomed
across the hedge, letting the men know what she thought of their
insights.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Ms. Bank's bright, clear
writing voice sizes up these players in the mating game.

   Peonies Yet to Come
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read that you should not cut more than a third of your
peony blooms or you will have fewer flowers the next year. Does
this mean you should not deadhead? The dead flowers look so
unattractive I'd like to cut them off.
</P>
<P>
   A. Plants get nourishment through roots and leaves and use it to
make flowers and fruit. The flowers are takers, not givers, as far
as the plant's resources are concerned, and you could cut every one
without hurting the plant a whit. In fact, when flowers are
removed, perennials can use the strength that would have gone into
making seeds to do things like fight diseases, put out replacement
foliage and build up its underground resources.
</P>
<P>
   The one-third business probably got started because peonies have
short stems. When you cut them for the vase, you usually take a lot
of the foliage, too, and a plant does need its leaves to stay
healthy. So leave the leaves, take the flowers and don't forget the
``get rid of it'' rule: even healthy-looking peonies usually harbor
fungus spores that should not stay nearby or be composted. Send all
peony cutoffs to the landfill, bury them a foot deep or burn them.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget that fall is the time to plant new peonies.

paring down in time to order. An excellent source is Klehm Nursery,

<P>
   The Dry Hand of Death
</P>
<P>
   Q. The drought is hurting my annuals and vegetables. Perennials
look OK but not great. The water supply is limited, so I can't
water everything. I have put on lots of mulch. Is there anything
else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keep your eye on the long term and give that rationed water
to the most important plants. Keep in mind that annual flowers and
vegetables will be history by winter, no matter what, while
expensive and slow-growing items like Japanese maples should be
once-in-a-lifetime purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to try to rescue the neediest; yellow-leafed
plants with hanging heads are heart-wrenching, but plants already
stunted by drought are the least likely to thrive even if they do
survive. It's better to water things that are OK but just a little
peaked. And don't forget that spring-flowering shrubs like lilacs
are, right this minute, building next year's blossoms. They need
water to do it, so don't let appearances deceive you into
shortchanging them.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, water whole areas rather than single plants. Dry
soil wicks moisture away, so spots watered in isolation are
surrounded by the enemy. Select the few healthiest tomatoes,
peppers and eggplants, give those all the water they need and let
the others go. Your crop will be smaller but better tasting; it
takes a lot of water to make good fruit. If you're determined to
save annual flowers, shear them back. Once rain comes (if it does),
they will rapidly put on new growth and a burst of bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A Mystery: Tomatoes Roll Away
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some animal _ we suspect a skunk _ ruined a lot of our
tomatoes, in one case eating all the way around the middle while
rolling the tomato at least 100 feet from the garden. It also took
bites out of many tomatoes. If it's not a skunk, what is it and
what can we do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Raccoons are adept at carrying things and are more partial to
takeout than skunks, so if the fruit keeps traveling a raccoon
could be the culprit. But it could be opossums, and you might also
keep an eye out for porcupines. Though porcupines mostly eat the
new growth of trees and are supposed to be indifferent to garden
produce, I have caught them red-toothed in the tomato patch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of these unwanted guests are easy to banish.
They rapidly grow used to lights, radios and any dogs that can't
get at them. Predator (or human) urine, promoted as a repellent, is
only sporadically effective.
</P>
<P>
   Four feet of wire mesh fence in a tight weave (8 inches buried,
the rest above ground) will probably work against skunks,
porcupines and opossums. Raccoons are more of a challenge: add two
strands of electric wire to that fence. Or just wait a while.
Before long the corn will be ripe and they'll concentrate on that.

KENNEDY FAMILY TOUCHED OUR LIVES BECAUSE THEY WERE REAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There never was a Camelot. It didn't really exist, except ...
</P>
<P>
   Except in the minds of storytellers from the Middle Ages who
dreamed it, and generations of listeners and readers who imagined
it.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the heart of a bereaved 20th century widowed first
lady who wished it, and even spoke it into a modern day legend for
others to cling to.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the pen of an American writer/historian who captured
the first lady's wishes, and then gave the fable to an America that
needed make-believe, royalty and anything else to help it forget
(or at least accept) one of its most horrible tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   But there never was a Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was not a character from an ancient tale,
and despite our inevitable comparisons with the Windsors of
England, he was not born into royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Neither were his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   Although they could be regarded as anything but commoners, they
were real; they were human; they were, by all means, mortal.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they were able to touch us in life. That is why the
very thought of their deaths carries such a wallop to our spirits.
That is why, once again, a nation (and much of the world) is in
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what one thinks of the JFK presidency, or any
subsequent revelations about his personal life, most of us can't
help but grieve this day.
</P>
<P>
   We grieve for a young man whom many of us knew _ yes, ``knew'' _
as a child running around the Oval Office and the White House lawn;
a young man who showed the strength, drive and intelligence of his
father; and a young adult who proved he had inherited a sense of
public service without running for political office.
</P>
<P>
   The nation would come to love him, and it seemed that he
returned that love with grace and humility.
</P>
<P>
   His public demeanor was regal, without being royal, for he was
not a prince.
</P>
<P>
   And although he was not a character from a fable, he most
definitely is part of an American legend, and an American legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Without being too crass during this moment of national mourning,
I must remind the people of North Texas that this region will be
forever linked to the John F. Kennedy story.
</P>
<P>
   I won't mention the Big D-word. That speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, I have to remind my fellow citizens of Fort Worth
that our town represents the ``life'' of JFK. Just remember all
those smiles from the president the night of Nov. 21, 1963, and the
morning of Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, on more than one occasion, I've reminded our leaders
that we are about to destroy the city's only memorial (the
convention center's JFK Theater) to the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   Because this city is inextricably tied to the name of John F.
Kennedy, we must think seriously about erecting a fitting monument
to him in the city where he was so full of life shortly before
death.
</P>
<P>
   This latest tragedy is another reminder as to why we should
never shun or reject the connection. We, too, are part of the
legacy.

IN E-MAIL, MANY WAYS TO SAY GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Wash., Mass., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (Eds: The (plus) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the emerging traditions of electronic mail, the proper way to
say good-bye is still under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of the verbose valediction, the long-lasting
leave-taking, the near episcopal rhythms of letter writers like the
founding father Benjamin Rush, writing to John Adams: ``Adieu! My
dear old friend, and believe me to be with unabated respect and
affection, yours truly, Benjn: Rush.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the '90s. Time for ``C-Ya L8R.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign-off and signature are the electronic equivalent of
bumper stickers or T-shirts,'' said Dr. Vinton Cerf, one of the
creators of MCI mail and senior vice president at MCI Worldcom. ``I
find most tag lines as much fun or more fun than reading creative
license plates. They're very compressed representations.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronically, there must be 50 ways to end your letter. An
informal survey yielded the following collection of closings:
Onward and upward, Good Buy! (when selling something), Keep on
keepin' on, Thanks a metric ton, Mahalo and Aloha (in Hawaii),
Cheers (among Anglophiles, with the Australian variant Chiz!),
Tootles (from ``Gidget'' fans, though the word is derived from
toodle-oo, supposedly a bastardization of a tout a l'heure, French
for C U soon), Peace, Pax, Peace and chicken grease, and Peace,
love and information (in the tech industry).
</P>
<P>
   Such creative send-offs can be, well, irksome, said Judith
Martin, also known as Miss Manners. ``We're a little bit suffering
from the early answering machine phenomenon, in which people said,
`Ah, a format in which I can be cute and get my personality
across,''' she said. ``This is not your opportunity to make
declarations. It's just a conventional way of signing off.'' For
personal e-mail, it's best to sign an e-mail message the way you
would sign a postcard, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Acronyms are particularly popular electronic farewell devices,
though senders run the risk of annoying the recipient with
sign-offs that take more time to figure out than they would to
spell out. Common and not-so-common TLA's (three-letter acronymns)
include BFN (bye for now), TIA (for thanks in advance or that is
all), mimicking old public address systems) and FYB (follow your
bliss, borrowed from the philosopher Joseph Campbell).
</P>
<P>
   Longer alternatives include TTFN, for ta-ta for now, TTYS (talk
to you soon), PDAR (please destroy after reading) and C-Ya, for see
you. L8R and Latah are commonly used for ``later'' (variations: E
you later and Type at ya later). L2 (plus) P has also been spotted,
for live long and prosper. Then there's g/g, for got to go, and WB
(write back) soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cerf explained the popularity of such truncated endings.
``You'll recall that abbreviations were very common in the days of
Morse code and teletype exchanges,'' he said, ``because things were
very slow, so anything you could do to make for a terser
representation was helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a handful of writers are sticking with business-letter
conventions like ``Sincerely yours'' for their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two feelings about the people who still do those kinds
of closings on e-mail,'' Mrs. Martin said. ``Oh, the poor, sweet
dears, they still think it's a letter and they're still using the
correct form of a letter.'' The other feeling is not quite as
kindly: ``Aha, they think they can get away without writing a
letter in a formal situation. Well, they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most creative ta-ta's emerge from close family
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 12-year-old niece and I have developed our own little
sign-offs,'' Karin Rex, owner of Computerease, a computer training
and technical writing company in the Philadelphia suburbs, wrote
via e-mail. ``This started as a joke between us because she _ in
all her 12-year-old techno-wizardry _ was always sending me
messages with computer acronyms that I could not understand. So I
started to make some up with her. One of our favorites was `EHLTB'
(Elvis has left the building), which we would save as our last
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Keydel, a Seattle financial analyst whose husband, Kurt,
works on a fishing boat in Alaska, shares a special sign-off with
him when he's at sea: FYI, which stands for ``forever you and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Among people who see each other regularly, sign-offs tend to be
shorter, if they appear at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people you see every day, that you have the most contact
with, that you have the least amount of sign-off for,'' said
Gregory Ward, a linguistics professor at Northwestern University.
``It's like in an office, you don't say `bye' or `see you later' or
`take care,' because those close off the interaction much more than
is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best'' and its cousins albest, all my very best, all bests and
best of the best are, in general, highly regarded. Jack Jackson,
who used to work at the UPI wire service, recalled: ``We commonly
ended notes with `bests' _ a shorthand for `best regards.' I also
recall combining sign-offs, as in `chrs et rgds,''' he wrote via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But Collin Earnst of the Boston office of IXL Inc., an Internet
services company, thinks `best' is the worst. ``When someone signs
their e-mail `Best' it drives me nuts. Best what? They don't have
time to write the second word? `Best regards?' `Best be going
now?''' he said in an e-mail note.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail sign-offs can be too friendly, sometimes inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I held the wrong key down instead of Command X, which
would usually insert a signature,'' wrote Rachel Hernandez, a
doctoral student at a molecular genetics lab at the University of
Washington. `I held Shift X. There was a delay in the computer, so
just as I pressed Send, the XXXX appeared after my name. I haven't
heard from that scientist again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some e-mail correspondents prefer not to limit themselves to
human conventions. When Sue Russell of Los Angeles sends e-mail to
her friend Sandra Lamb of Denver, she signs off with ``All the paws
here are crossed for you,'' in deference to her cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy and I both freelance writers, so we give each other
mutual support,'' Ms. Russell said. ```Keep your fingers crossed'
metamorphosed to `Tell your cats to keep their paws crossed,'''
said Ms. Russell, ``the subtext being `I support everything you're
struggling to do today.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are also devotees of the foreign farewell, particularly
Ciao, or the Brazilian Portuguese version thereof, Tchau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also common in Latin America (especially Argentina) to
sign off with `un beso' ... a kiss,'' Allesandra deSantillana, who
works for Nortel Networks' Caribbean and Latin America division,
wrote via e-mail. ``This surprised me at first when I received this
from colleagues in Latin America (it felt too personal). In Brazil,
`abraos,' or hugs, is a common sign-off I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Aaron, a high-school English teacher in Mercer Island,
Wash., has always been fond of bastardizing foreign languages.
``For example, `hasta la bye-bye,''' she wrote. Cerf admits to
having used ``hasta banana.''
</P>
<P>
   If translations of foreign sign-offs ever catch on here, one
candidate might well become common in the harried United States
world of e-mail correspondence. ``A friend of mine uses a nice
sign-off,'' wrote Pekka Silven, a Webmaster in Finland, in an
e-mail message. In Finnish it's ``Ala soita minulle, alaka missaan
nimessa tule kaymaan!'' A rough translation to English yields
``Don't call me and never ever come for a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the final word on final words should come from the
pre-eminent cartoonist of the e-mail set. Scott Adams, who draws
Dilbert, draws the line at sign-offs. ``I just use my name,'' he
wrote, via e-mail, of course. ``The other options make me gag.''

`THE WOOD' COULD STAND A LITTLE TRIMMING AND SHAPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Wood,'' a good-natured, African-American-cast nostalgia
piece about life in Inglewood, Calif., follows a rigid formula:
I.MDNM/ngratiate, then alienate. Although it doesn't push the
bounds of taste like ``American Pie'' or the latest ``Austin
Powers,'' it tempers its sweetness with occasional crassness. It's
a likable movie, but these downshifts keep it from hitting the
bull's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s ended just 10 years ago. It sounds odd to use the word
``nostalgia'' when talking about them, but the makers of ``The
Wood'' have an obvious affection for the decade. Not surprisingly,
this affection is revealed in flashback: Roland (Taye Diggs), one
of a trio of running buddies, freaks out and disappears on his
wedding day, inspiring pal/narrator Mike (Omar Epps) to reminisce
about what life was like back in the '80s. Mike moved to Inglewood
from North Carolina in 1986.MDNM/ and became fast friends with
smooth Slim (Richard T. Jones) and clownish Roland. The movie
alternates their present-day escapades with their high-school
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Rick Famuyiwa based ``The Wood'' on his own
experiences growing up, and the labor-of-love aspect shows in the
low-budget look of the film (which could explain why the lead
actors look nothing like their youthful counterparts). The
familiarity of the present-day scenes, which include a memorable
barf sequence, makes them seem unnecessary, although it probably
helped attract familiar but not-yet-stars actors such as Diggs and
Epps. The '80s scenes work better.MDNM/ and are ably handled by
young actors Sean Nelson (Mike), Duane Finley (Slim) and Trent
Cameron (Roland).
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa is refreshing in his treatment of the movie's teen
girls and women, who continually stand up for themselves and are
much more together than the guys. Tamala Jones is especially good
as Roland's knowing ex-girlfriend, who winds up helping the guys
get him back to the wedding. But Famuyiwa can't resist a little
sex-object action, with an extended teen-sex scene that's a
variation on the entire plot of ``Booty Call.''
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa's fondness for the old times makes up for a lot of the
movie's derivativeness and his erratic pacing; a first-time
director, he often lets scenes run far too long, succeeding only in
sustaining the above-mentioned sex scene. Still, he's managed to
make an MTV Films production that sounds as if it was written
before the soundtrack songs were selected. If he can get away from
his fondness for crude humor, he might become somebody to watch _
not that crude humor stops anyone from becoming big these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' is rated R for strong language, sexual situations,
alcohol abuse and mild violence.

LAWMAKERS IN A DOGFIGHT OVER FIGHTERS OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ When Washington lawmakers look at Lockheed
Martin's F-22 Raptor and the defense giant's proposed design for
the Joint Strike Fighter, the X-35, the differences may seem as
hard to recognize as a stealth fighter on a radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes look like twins to the untrained eye. Both are
sleek-looking next-generation fighters with dominating tail designs
and curved surfaces that blend fuselage and wing.
</P>
<P>
   The two fighters, being developed to complement each other in
the 21st century, are being pitted against each other in a Pentagon
budget battle that has some lawmakers questioning why the Air Force
needs the F-22, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers will vote Thursday on a defense spending package
that seeks to eliminate $1.8 billion in funding for production of
the first six F-22s, a plane intended to replace the F-15E War
Eagle as America's air superiority fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Approval, which is expected, would set off a House-Senate
conference committee battle this summer. That fight might well
determine the fate of the Raptor, an aircraft Lockheed has been
aiming to produce since it won the F-22 contract in 1991 over
McDonnell Douglas, now a part of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 will be produced partly at Lockheed Martin Tactical
Aircraft Systems in Fort Worth, Texas. Today,the program employs
1,900 workers there. But by 2005, it is expected to employ 4,000.
Boeing will build part of the plane in Seattle, and the Lockheed
plant in Marietta, Ga., will build one-third of the plane and act
as a final assembly point.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, a defense analyst with the Teal Group of
Fairfax, Va., said the F-22's problems on Capitol Hill come mainly
from the difficulty of getting lawmakers to understand the
differences between the F-22 and the JSF, which is intended to be a
low-cost replacement for the Air Force F-16, Navy F-14 and the
Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-22 is a very expensive, money is no object, twin-engine
air superiority machine,'' he said. ``The JSF is the exact
opposite. It is not everything we can get. It is everything we can
afford.''
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine F-22 is expected to be able to fly at Mach 2,
twice the speed of sound, and supercruise at speeds of Mach 1.5.
Such capability would allow it to operate at speeds that create
tracking problems for enemy radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   The plane will also have radar-evading stealth characteristics
beyond those seen in the B-2 stealth bomber, meaning it will be
nearly impossible for enemy forces to lock onto with a
surface-to-air missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptor also will contain the most sophisticated cockpit
radar system ever built onto an airplane. It is intended to provide
pilots with detailed information about multiple threats well in
advance. That would allow pilots to shoot down enemy planes long
before they see them.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine JSF, whether the Pentagon selects the Lockheed
X-35 or the rival Boeing X-32, will fall far short of the Raptor in
on-board technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although the JSF is still a ``paper airplane,'' early in
development, it is not expected to fly nearly as fast, have
supercruise capability, display a leap-ahead in stealth, or house
the expensive advanced radar that the F-22 will have.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, the F-22 is also expected do more than fire
air-to-ground missiles or take on enemy fighters. It must ensure
that American forces will face no air or ground threat in the early
hours of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to fly the JSF on air-to-ground missions
after the F-22 has controlled the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-22 means dominance over other air-to-air threats,
air-to-ground threats, surface-to-surface threats, radars and
surface-to-air missiles,'' said Richard Bethurem, a retired Air
Force general in Lockheed Martin's Washington office. ``It attacks
the whole spectrum of threats to ground, naval or air forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethurem, who spent 20 years flying the F-15, said equipping the
JSF to do what the Air Force needs the F-22 to do would require a
huge change in the JSF program.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials say that using the JSF to fill the F-22 role
would be impossible. They say that the F-16 replacement could be
outgunned by the French Mirage 2000 or the Rafale, the Swedish
Gripen or the Russian Su-35.
</P>
<P>
   And they also disagree with proposals to upgrade the F-15,
purchasing more Eagles from the Boeing plant in St. Louis, an idea
that is popular with Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force reports show that by 2005, the French-made Mirage will
have greater maneuverability, better radar and a more stealthy
composition than the F-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment, if you match airplane to airplane,
we're at near parity with the MiG-29, the Su-27, the airplanes that
are deployed around the world in large numbers,'' said Maj. Gen.
Bruce Carlson, director of Air Force operational requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But Eugene Carroll, a retired Navy rear admiral who is an
analyst with the Center for Defense Information in Washington, said
the Air Force could survive after scaling back plans for the
Raptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole justification for the F-22 program was that it was
needed to maintain dominance over a family of new Soviet fighters
in the 21st century, but none of those fighters has materialized,''
he said, adding that the JSF will be more than capable of
establishing American air dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional foes of the Raptor also believe that the aircraft
is overkill. Moreover, they complain that technical problems and
schedule delays have raised the price beyond what the Pentagon
should expect to pay for any fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a program today which has grown from a unit cost of
about $68 million a copy to a projected $200 million,'' said John
Warner, R-Va., the longtime F-22 critic who is chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says this program has problems _ that's my take.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Bill Cohen disagrees and says the F-22 will be
needed to battle 21st century fighters from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``'We need to stay a generation ahead of all the potential
competition,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   William Blake, the British poet, painter, engraver and
printmaker who died in 1827, has been called the first multimedia
artist for his hand-produced books of elaborately illustrated
poems. Students who study Blake in high school or college, however,
seldom fully experience his work, reading texts that are
accompanied by poor-quality reproductions of his artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll read Blake in an anthology and you'll get a typeset
version of `The Tiger,' or `The Lamb' that looks nothing like the
original gorgeous, illuminated plates,'' said Matthew Kirschenbaum,
a doctoral candidate at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschenbaum and other scholars are out to change that, giving
Blake's life work a much-needed transfusion from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some two centuries after he printed them, Blake's illustrated
poems are coming to life, in full color, in The William Blake
Archive (http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/blake/).
</P>
<P>
   Blake is best known for his lyrical collection of short poems,
``Songs of Innocence and of Experience.'' Like his other works, he
printed each copy by hand, and painted each individually using
watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   He called these books of poetry ``illuminations'' and produced
in all 175 copies of 19 books, each with different colors, details
and, in some cases, different orderings of the poems. The actual
books are largely inaccessible and often prohibitively expensive to
reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The web, however, is changing all that. The William Blake
Archive completed its first-phase goal of posting at least one copy
of each of the first 18 of Blake's 19 books in June (the last book,
``Jerusalem,'' has over 100 plates and should be posted later this
year).
</P>
<P>
   The archivists plan to make a standard printed edition of
Blake's works (with notes on the text) available online before the
end of the summer, and will continue posting other copies of
illuminated books through 2002, when the second phase of the
project is to end. Plans for phase two also include posting 3,000
images that form the remaining one-third of Blake's body of work _
paintings, drawings, engravings, manuscripts, and typographical
works.
</P>
<P>
   The William Blake Archive was born in 1995 when three of the
country's top Blake scholars, Morris Eaves of the University of
Rochester; Robert Essick, of the University of California at
Riverside; and Joseph Viscomi, of the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill, along with John Unsworth, the director of the
University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the
Humanities, decided that Blake scholarship and electronic
technology were each mature enough to create an electronic Blake
resource.
</P>
<P>
   The three editors had recently completed work on two printed
volumes of Blake's work and had been frustrated by the limitations
that the print medium imposed. ``There were economic constraints on
print versions of Blake that the electronic medium would let us get
around,'' Unsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   With a grant for $250,000 for the first three years from the
Getty Grant Program, the project got off the ground (it has since
received support from Sun Microsystems, Inso Corp., the Paul Mellon
Center for Studies in British Art, and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill).
</P>
<P>
   The Web is uniquely suited to dealing with the problems that
Blake scholars have encountered in the past. The Internet is not
subject to the space considerations that print books are, so it is
possible to post as many different copies of a poem as exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the electronic editing, we can afford to reproduce
30 different versions of `The Tiger,' '' Eaves said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blake researchers can easily compare versions of the same poem,
something that previously would have required trips to collections
all over the United States and Britain. And the Web gives scholars
a chance to compare them simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Another remarkable feature of the archive is the ease with which
textual or bibliographic searches can be conducted. It is also
possible to search the archive for images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is searchable,'' said Viscomi. ``You could look for
sunflowers, lambs, and birds that all appear on a plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, according to Kirschenbaum, receives between 425 and
450 visitors everyday. ``The site statistics spike for the first
week of September and the first week of January,'' he said.
``That's when Blake is usually taught in Romantics period courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the early Romantics.'' Kirschenbaum paused, and
added, ``He's also a good way to scare people off if your class is
over-enrolled.''

I LINK, THEREFORE I AM: A WEB INTELLECTUAL'S DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The (star) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once in a great while a Web site appears, seemingly out of
nowhere, and casts a spell. Such is the case with Lemonyellow.com,
an online intellectual diary that makes the reader want to dig
deeper and deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Lemonyellow.com, a collection of words, links and little else,
is the creation of Heather Anne Halpert, 26, a software designer in
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert began the site, at www.lemonyellow.com, last April
as a repository ``for all of the ideas and ephemera that would
otherwise pop off the top of my head and float away,'' she said.
Every evening, she writes down whatever may have crossed her mind
or happened in the course of her day: a book she once read, like
``The Names of Things,'' by Susan Brind Morrow, or wants to reread,
like ``Feminism and Deconstruction,'' by Diane Elam; the surrealist
poet and artist Georges Hugnet; her encounter with a scrap metal
dealer, a design project she is working on. Whatever she writes
that seems to lend itself to a hyperlink gets one.
</P>
<P>
   Lemonyellow.com (so named, Ms. Halpert said, for no particular
reason) makes one wonder what would have happened if Franz Kafka
had had a Web site. In fact, there's some similarity between Ms.
Halpert's journal and Kafka's, which also careers in dreamlike
fashion from topic to topic.
</P>
<P>
   (From a 1914 entry: ``Aug. 2: Germany declared war on Russia. _
Swimming in the afternoon.'') If Kafka had lived in the age of
hypertext, who knows where his prose might have led his readers.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertext, the technological engine that drives the Web, has
been around as a concept since 1945, when Vannevar Bush, who was a
science adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrote an essay
anticipating a device that would mimic the associative way people
tend to think.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertext as a term has been around since the 1960s, when a
computer prophet, Ted Nelson, envisioned it as a kind of
nonsequential layering of information. Using hypertext, words and
phrases in a document could be highlighted to let readers skip from
one source to another, rather than read in a traditional, linear
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the Web's lingua franca has been
hypertext markup language, or HTML, a standardized way of
representing hypertext.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert's site, an intellectual layer cake, seems to fulfill
the original promise of hypertext more completely than most others
on the Web, where all roads lead to an Add to Shopping Cart button,
or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert holds an undergraduate degree in architecture from
the University of Texas at Austin but now designs software at Human
Code, a multimedia design firm there.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, Ms. Halpert changed the subject
frequently and unexpectedly, which she said was just another
indication that the Web is the perfect platform for a mind like
hers. ``I consider the Web this great justification for the way
I've thought my whole life,'' she said. ``No, you're not nuts.
There's a medium to accommodate this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert's stream-of-consciousness narrative is one of her
site's most compelling aspects. One moment you are reading her
ruminations on the film ``The Matrix'':
</P>
<P>
   ``They run up the walls and do aerials as they mow down armies
of (ambiguously) bad guys. Then they throw their guns away and grab
fresh ones _ all in slow motion. I tried to run up the outside wall
of the theatre afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   A click later, the reader finds Ms. Halpert referring to ``C'est
Tout'' as Marguerite Duras' ``meditation on sex, death and
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The site has the distinction of really trying to weave a
pastiche of sources into something readable rather than just an
index,'' said Cathy Marshall, a researcher at the Fuji Xerox Palo
Alto Laboratory who has been working with hypertext for 20 years.
``She's doing more than playing a librarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Halpert's journal is an intense mixture of personal
and public references, there is nothing exhibitionist about it.
``It doesn't have that cloying memoirlike quality that some
people's Web stuff has,'' Ms. Marshall said. ``You don't feel like
a voyeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert said she tried for a balance between personal
tidbits (her reasons for wearing red lipstick on occasion, for
example) and purely intellectual ruminations: ``Is there such a
thing as a tactile object-oriented programming environment?''
</P>
<P>
   Hang around long enough on Lemonyellow.com and you'll feel the
power and depth of the Web in a way that is very different from,
say, a day spent bidding on old comic books at Ebay or managing a
stock portfolio at E(star)Trade. The links on Lemonyellow.com go to
very few commercial sites, with the exception of Amazon.com, which
is the link for the site's many book titles. To find just the right
link, Ms. Halpert uses a search engine _ usually Google, her
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   There is no yellow on the site. Nor is there a photo of Ms.
Halpert. ``I don't think my appearance is relevant to what I make
or write,'' she said. ``Or not to anyone who doesn't know me fairly
intimately. People write me asking for context: who I am, what I
look like, what I do for a living. I sort of give general answers
but so far I've just kind of ignored the `what do you look like'
queries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpert does not track the number of visitors to
Lemonyellow.com, but the site evidently strikes a chord among
certain Web surfers. She said she gets a constant flow of e-mail
from people around the world who want to tell her about their own
daily encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I don't know will send me beautiful e-mails telling me
some story about what happened to them, and I'll have no clue what
the context of what they're talking about is,'' Ms. Halpert said.
``That's a level I really love to interact with people on. I like
being able to sketch in the rest myself, and I like other people
being able to do that with me.''

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely across the
northern Plains on Thursday, as a weak area of low pressure slides
along the Canadian border. Some of these showers may produce brief
periods of heavy rainfall. In addition, clouds will persist across
the Great Lakes, as moisture from the tops of these thunderstorms
is transported toward the southeast by the jet stream.
</P>
<P>
   New England will also have a few showers and isolated
thunderstorms, as a weak warm front crosses from southern Quebec to
the Atlantic Coast. To the north of the front, clouds will increase
in northern Maine, while to the south of the front, temperatures
will start to rise, marking the beginning of a brief warming trend
along the Northeast Seaboard. Scattered thunderstorms are likely
near the Chesapeake Bay as a jet stream disturbance at about 18,000
feet passes over the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will remain partly cloudy with scattered
thunderstorms erupting. Showers and storms will be most numerous
along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. The Central Plains will become
very hot, and some readings will reach triple digits. Meanwhile,
the monsoon will continue in New Mexico and eastern Arizona, as
showers develop during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will push inland along the coast in the Pacific Northwest
as winds turn onshore, bringing ocean air inland. Skies will be
sunny and temperatures will increase over the interior Northwest
and in the Central Valley. However, a widely separated shower is
possible over the mountains of Oregon and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET OR DRY
</P>
<P>
   While rain in most of the Middle West has been plentiful,
unusually arid conditions have gripped the Northeast this summer.
Heavy rain from thunderstorms has pushed July's precipitation total
to nearly 7 inches at Waterloo, Iowa. Meanwhile, in parched
Pennsylvania, where the governor issued a drought emergency for
much of the state on Tuesday, less than a quarter-inch has fallen
at Allentown. Interestingly, a similar weather pattern occurred in
the summer of 1993 when excessive rain produced flooding in the
Mississippi Valley while hot and dry conditions affected much of
the Northeast. &QL;

<P>
   Many new homes have interior hollow-core doors. Though
functional and lightweight, the doors are also plain looking and
not particularly sturdy. Usually, homeowners like to replace them
with something more decorative and substantial.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of replacement doors: prehung doors and door
blanks. Prehung doors come with the door mounted on hinges
connected to a door frame. Replacement consists of removing the old
door and the jamb, then fitting the new jamb-door assembly in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Because the door is already hinged to the jamb, you are relieved
of the painstaking task of measuring the location for the hinges
and chiseling out mortises for them. Prehung doors are more
expensive than door blanks and the choice of door styles is often
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to install a door blank. A door blank is
simply a basic door without the jamb, hinge mortises, lock holes or
hardware. While door blanks come in a variety of styles (like six
panel, four panel, flat or raised panel) and woods (oak, fir,
pine), they may have to be specially ordered.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a door, make sure you know the measurements of
the old one. Standard door blanks are available in widths of 28,
32, 34 and 36 inches. They are usually 6 or 8 feet tall. Doors with
other dimensions can be specially ordered, but they are invariably
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The new blank will be larger than the existing door, and you
will have to trim it to fit. This can be difficult if the jamb
around the opening is not perfectly square, which often happens
when a house settles. Making sure the door fits properly requires
taking precise measurements, then trimming the new door exactly so
it mates with the jamb. Often this is a process of trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   One way to take the guesswork out of this job is by using the
old door as a pattern. First make sure it fits the frame properly;
open and close it to see if it binds against the jamb. You will
want to trim the surfaces where the door rubs, but before you do,
try tightening the hinge screws on the door and the jamb. Sometimes
a door binds because the hinges are slightly loose. If the hinges
are secure, then the door edges need to be shaved so the door
swings freely. It is best to use a plane for this task.
</P>
<P>
   Next, close the door and look for obvious gaps between the door
and the jamb. Label those areas _ either directly on the door or on
attached pieces of paper _ where the door needs to be wider. A
typical notation might read: ''add an eighth inch here.'' Check the
door bottom; it should be about three quarters of an inch from the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trim a door mounted in place. Remove the door by
driving the hinge pins from the hinge knuckles. This will separate
the hinges so you can remove the door. Leave the hinge leaves
attached to the door jamb, but remove those on the door. Also
remove any other hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the old door on top of the new blank and carefully align
both along the hinge sides. Trace the outline of the old door onto
the new one, using your notes as a guide to add extra thickness
where necessary. Also mark the position of the hinges on the new
door edge.
</P>
<P>
   If the new blank is only a bit larger than the old door, use a
plane or rasp to trim it. Use a circular saw to remove wide
sections. First, however, score along the cutting lines with a
straightedge and utility knife. The score lines will slice the
surface fibers so the circular saw will not splinter the wood as it
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clamp a straightedge in position to guide the saw then trim the
door to size. Smooth and bevel all edges with medium-grit
sandpaper; the bevel will keep the edges from chipping or
splintering.
</P>
<P>
   Prop the door in position in the doorway using wedges to keep
the door the correct distance from the floor. Check to make sure
that the hinge marks on the door align with hinges on the door
jamb. Precise alignment is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the door, then chisel out the mortises for the hinge
leaves. Screw the leaves in place, then position the door and drive
the hinge pins home. Check the door for fit, and plane any surfaces
that bind. &QL;

ROYAL CARIBBEAN ADMITS TO DUMPING OIL AND CHEMICALS OFF COAST

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno castigated Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Wednesday as she announced that the company
had agreed to pay $18 million in fines for dumping oil and
hazardous chemicals off the coasts of New York, Miami and other
U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Caribbean polluted the very environment on which its
business relies,'' Reno said of the Norwegian company, one of the
world's largest ocean cruise lines. ``They dumped everywhere; at
sea, in port, at sensitive environmental areas ... they didn't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said at a news conference that besides
accepting the record fine, Royal Caribbean, in agreements filed in
U.S. District Courts in six cities, also pleaded guilty to 21
felony counts for dumping the waste from its ships and lying about
it to the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Besides New York City and Miami, the plea agreements were filed
in Los Angeles, where the company admitted lying to the Coast Guard
about its dumping logs; and in other cities where dumping occurred:
Anchorage, Alaska; St. Thomas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the cruise ships used ``secret bypass pipes'' to dump
the waste overboard, often at night, and that ship personnel then
falsified the log books.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Solow, chief of the Justice Department's environmental
crimes section, said crew members on the cruise ships would wear
buttons that said ``save the waves.'' However, he added, ``below
deck, business as usual was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Solow said the hazardous chemicals dumped by the ships came from
dry cleaning, photographic developing and print shops.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, the largest ever paid by a cruise line on charges of
polluting U.S. waters, is in addition to a $9 million fine Royal
Caribbean agreed to pay in Miami in June 1998 to settle previous
charges of dumping hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   This past March the cruise line also agreed to pay a $1 million
fine for falsifying discharge records on a cruise ship that stopped
in Los Angeles. That sum was part of the $18 million in fines
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreements stem from a federal investigation that began
in October 1994, when the Coast Guard caught one of Royal
Caribbean's ships, the Sovereign of the Seas, dumping waste off the
coast of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that because of Royal Caribbean's crimes, it will
operate for the next five years under a special environmental
compliance plan, which subjects the company to increased
inspections of its ships and records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Caribbean used our nation's waters as its dumping
ground, even as it promoted itself as an environmentally `green
company,''' she said. ``This case should send a message to the
entire cruise ship industry that illegal dumping does not pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International President Jack Williams said
Wednesday that the company was ``committed'' to protecting the
ocean and that it would step up its enforcement efforts to prevent
any future violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are profoundly sorry that a group of our employees
knowingly violated environmental laws and our own company policy,''
he said. The majority of these violations reflect a lapse in our
enforcement efforts _ not a lapse in our corporate conscience or
our commitment to protecting the ocean.''

LIVING THE EIGHT-BIT DREAM IN A 32-BIT WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Numeral `8' as middle initial in byline is correct) 
(yn) 
 By JENNIFER 8. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a mathematician at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Steve Judd
harnesses the power of Unix work stations and Cray supercomputers
to detect and prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes home, he basks in the light of his 15-year-old
Commodore computer, a one-megahertz machine with 64 kilobytes of
RAM. It can move chunks of data in the same size packages as a
Nintendo Game Boy and has 3 percent of the memory capacity of a
Palm III organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Judd creates three-dimensional graphics on his obsolete
Commodore and calls it a real programming challenge. ``It's like
building a radio from scratch,'' he said. ``You are designing from
the most fundamental level. You have to take advantage of every
ounce of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fender Tucker, who runs a Commodore software company called
Loadstar, said, ``Commodores are for people who aren't all that
sure that the computer revolution has made our lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people appear to have turned to old computers (or
stuck with them) out of nostalgia, a desire for simplicity and an
appreciation for classic design. In the realm of digital machines,
where today's computer is out of date tomorrow, there can be great
satisfaction in taking a digital Model T out for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cotton, editor of Commodore World magazine, estimates
that a million Commodores are still in service around the world.
Their owners include people who remember their first computers more
fondly than their first girlfriends (most users are men), as well
as people who have handed them down to their children or have set
up miniature computer museums in their basements, much to the
dismay of their wives.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not only the Commodore. Old Apple computers and
Sinclair Spectrums are also popular. ``Some people like to drive
classic cars, like the '60s-era Mustang or the original Beetle,''
said Scott Gamon, 24, who still uses an Apple II GS. ``I think the
main reason is that the cars are classic vehicles that made
history. The Apple II computer is the same in the computer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners are active users of the old computers, and some
participate in international programming competitions.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who cannot afford a new computer or do not
know how to use them. Many actually own up-to-date computers that
are hundreds of times as fast and much more powerful than their old
ones, but they keep their eight-bit machines around to remind them
how they started with computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't buy that machine with my paper-route money when I
was 11, I likely wouldn't have gotten into computers, a university
scholarship and a decent-paying job,'' said Robyn Harbron of
Thunder Bay, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, who is also a co-owner of Creative Micro Designs, a
Commodore hardware company, said, ``We have a number of people who
have called us up saying, `Windows is nice for work, but I miss
that old Commodore.'''
</P>
<P>
   A number of fans of eight-bit machines are sophisticated
programmers who praise the computers' timeless elegance and
efficiency. ``You don't say Mozart, Shakespeare or van Gogh are
good for their time,'' Judd said. ``They are just plain good. I
make the claim for the Commodore 64.''
</P>
<P>
   All software, whether Windows 98 or Lotus Notes or Doom, is
based on simple mathematical calculations like addition and
multiplication. Computers express information in binary numbers;
each digit is a 0 or a 1, and each place is a power of 2. Eight-bit
computers handle data in binary numbers that have eight digits. For
large calculations, an eight-bit computer has to break down the
problem into simpler pieces, and that is one factor that makes
eight-bit computers slow, compared with modern 32-bit machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the sluggishness is that those old
computer chips did not have many transistors, or switches, and the
transistors they did have were far apart, lengthening the paths the
signals had to travel. Modern chips pack transistors tightly
together, which speeds up processing times.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you could make them compatible, it would take about a
thousand Commodores to run the equivalent of today's Microsoft
Word, and even then it would run very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many users insist that the eight-bit classics are on the verge
of becoming collectibles. Searches on auction sites like Ebay
unearth hundreds of items in the classic realm, like floppy disks,
printers and actual computers, for generally low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of trailing-edge technology have their own magazines,
conventions, weekly on-line discussions, Web sites and newsletters.
In Europe, dozens of programmers meet regularly for competition
parties, where they see who can stretch the capacities of the
eight-bit computers the furthest. Some are on a crusade, contending
that the old computers should be preserved for posterity. The
Vintage Technology Center, a computer nostalgia group in Santa
Clara, Calif., recently announced plans to build a supercomputer
out of Commodore 64's. ``Sixty-four 64's'' is its motto.
</P>
<P>
   All of that would be mere nostalgia, or a hobby like collecting
Pez memorabilia, except that the eight-bit die-hards actually use
their computers. In a sense, their devotion to the simple machines
is an active refutation of the Wintel world of quick obsolescence
that frustrates many computer users.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, programmers looked for creative software
solutions instead of glitzier hardware. ``In a way it was simpler
back then,'' said Lane Denson, a Nashville farmer who has set up a
computer museum in his basement. ``You didn't have 20 or 30 sound
cards and you didn't have to worry about upgrading every other
week.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when mega, giga and tetra are the popular prefixes,
the software available for the kilobyte clunkers is surprisingly
sophisticated. Commodore users can send faxes via modems, use laser
printers and use a mouse to maneuver through an operating system
that looks a lot like Windows. And their computers can act as hosts
for Web pages. Accessories that increase the capacities of the old
machines are also available, including one that speeds them up by a
factor of 20.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Randall, who has an auto repair shop in Charlotte,
Mich., uses his Commodore for all facets of daily computing, for
things like designing newsletters and writing HTML pages. ``If you
don't need to do a lot of high-powered graphical work, they're
perfect,'' Randall said. ``They don't crash. They don't have
viruses, and they don't break down as often.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular eight-bit computers are the Commodore 64, of
which 20 million units were sold from 1982 to 1992; the Sinclair ZX
Spectrum, which was the most popular computer in Britain in the
mid-1980s, and the Apple II line, which went on the market in 1977
and became immensely popular for its educational software.
Production had stopped for all these models by the early 1990s
because of pressure from the IBM compatibles.
</P>
<P>
   Now as then, the various computer camps are fierce rivals.
European Spectrum fans periodically invade on-line discussion
groups of Commodore users, and vice versa _ each group engaging in
the electronic equivalent of nose-thumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about my mom all you want, but don't insult my
computer,'' Judd said.
</P>
<P>
   Many programmers insist that the limits of the old machines
force programmers to be more resourceful. Many of them, like
Randall, who spends 40 to 50 hours each week programming, write in
assembly code, the most fundamental programming language, because
it takes up less space than higher-level languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using assembly language, I can make the code real tight and
small on a Commodore,'' Randall said. The program he uses to send
faxes via modem is only 56 kilobytes in size. His software
releases, which include a fax program and an updated operating
system that looks much like Windows, earn him more than $20,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   For some, eight-bit programming represents a return to computing
as a personal experience and a move away from being a technodrone
in an information economy. ``Before, it was very much discovering
and experimenting for your own benefit,'' said Mark Lair, 40, of
Dallas. ``Now we're in a service industry. Most of us programmers
are providing for other people rather than ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But others acknowledge that there is not a high demand for
eight-bit programmers. ``Yes, I'm a Sinclair fan, but to earn a
living, I need to remain up to date in a rapidly evolving
industry,'' said Richard Jordan, 26, a programmer in Britain who
owns several Spectrums.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-bit computers draw their biggest chunk of fans because of
the classic video games they play. Fans say the older games,
unadorned by fancy graphics and sound effects, focused more on game
play. A result, they contend, was games that transcend their
technological simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   A few times each month, Jeff Lewis, 35, goes into his basement
to play some of the hundreds of Commodore 64 games he has
accumulated. His wife, Dianna, refers to the computer, which is
still connected to a working dot-matrix printer, as a ``Commodore
shrine.'' ``She actually thinks I'm kind of nuts for keeping it
up,'' said Lewis, who lives in a suburb of Cleveland. ``I just tell
her it's part of my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those who actually own old computers, there are hundreds
of thousands more who pretend that they do by using a generation of
emulators, which allow users to pretend that their 32-bit PCs are
primitive Commodores, Spectrums and Apples. Thousands of old games
are available for downloading on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the number of eight-bit fans and admirers, the most
dedicated enthusiasts sometimes bemoan the skewed demographics of
their ranks. Oyvind Vevang, 20, of Haugesund, Norway, meets many
friends though a common interest in classic video games, but they
are almost all male. Vevang lamented, ``If more girls were
interested in this, I'd have one hell of a pickup trick!''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pepon Osorio, who was awarded a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award last month, has had his art displayed in the
Whitney Museum of American Art and the Smithsonian Institution's
Museum of American Art. But to take in his latest mixed-media
installation, you have to head up to the Young World Store on Third
Avenue in East Harlem and look between the racks marked ``Girls 4
to 6X'' and ``Toddler Girls 2 to 4T.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and art lovers there have been greeted by
``Transboricua,'' a work that centers on a combative-looking figure
with boxing gloves, a backpack and a Puerto Rican-style hat called
a pava. A chain-link fence surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   The man _ Osorio refers to him as a mutant _ is decked in
symbols of assorted Latin American countries (a Mexican flag covers
his face); photo buttons of children with their eyes closed; tiny,
hand-beaded Puerto Rican flags, and cloth patches depicting
cartoonish eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the usual stuff of clothing stores, but for
Osorio the collision between conceptual art and everyday life is
normal.
</P>
<P>
   In ``El Cab,'' a 1997 memorial to a murdered livery cab driver,
Sergio Jimenez, he decorated seven taxis that cruised the streets
for about a month. Last year he placed ``Las Twines'' (``The
Twins''), an installation employing video and sculpture, in a
vacant storefront at Southern Boulevard and Tiffany Street in the
South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The video digitally duplicated and darkened the image of a
9-year-old girl. The result _ twin sisters, one light and one dark
_ addresses issues of racism and identity.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramirez, who owns a nearby barber shop, said that seeing
the piece taught people ``a lot about humanity, that there should
be harmony among the races because color doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio says he is equally at home in the art world and in Latino
neighborhoods. ``My art is for people who go to museums and for
people who don't go to museums,'' he said. ``It's an old notion
that people go to the museum. It should really be the museum going
to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio, 44, who stands 6 feet 2 and has a thick black mustache,
was born to a middle-class family in Santurce, P.R. In 1975 he
moved to the South Bronx, where he was a social worker. He
maintains a studio there but moved to the Upper West Side of
Manhattan about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was a co-founder in 1983 of the dance company Pepatian with
his wife of 12 years, Merian Soto, and Patti Bradshaw, who are both
choreographers. Osorio has built sets for the group's performances.
Increasingly, though, he has focused on his installations.
</P>
<P>
   Before making his artworks, he often conducts interviews,
talking to a wide range of people in tertulias (small town
meetings), sometimes in people's homes. He is easy to talk to, open
and friendly, with unfaltering politeness and expressive
mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   This work brought him to the attention of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which this year named him one of
32 fellows and awarded him a $315,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the artists who are appreciated in the museum
setting but whose works are created out of the community and for
the community,'' said Amalia Mesa-Bains, a California installation
artist who has exhibited with him. ``The art world tends to divide
artists into those who make objects related to the museums and to
the market, and those whose work appears in the community. But
Pepon challenges those false categories.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has a long history of public art, from 19th-century
cemeteries to contemporary works sprinkled around the city. But
recent efforts have not always been welcomed by the neighborhoods
that received them.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most pronounced cases, Richard Serra's sculpture
``Tilted Arc,'' outside 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan, was
removed in 1989 after government workers in the building complained
about the piece.

   Osorio's works are often embraced by neighborhood residents
before they reach established art institutions.

   His art, which frequently deals with racism against and among
Latinos, ``pushes the boundaries to an extent that is unusual even
in New York, where the experimentation level is very high,'' said
Susana Torruella Leval, director of El Museo del Barrio in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   His complex installations, mixed-media works that can fill
several rooms, are crammed with colorful detail. ``Transboricua,''
his first exhibition in a store, is on display until Sunday in the
Young World Store at 1915 Third Avenue, as part of El Museo del
Barrio's ``1999 Site/Studio/Street Festival,'' which is taking
place while the museum undergoes renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was commissioned by the Rhode Island School of Design
Museum of Art and the Providence Public Library. After it leaves
the store, it will be featured from Sept. 23 to Jan. 9 at El Museo
del Barrio, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Twines'' and Osorio's ``Fear and Denial'' will be on
display from Sept. 8 to Oct. 9 at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts Inc., a
gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio is also represented in New York by a re-creation of one
of his most powerful pieces, ``Scene of the Crime (Whose Crime?),''
which appeared in the 1993 Whitney Biennial and fills several rooms
with video, found objects and religious icons.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, which comments on the negative portrayals of Latinos
by Hollywood, is featured in the exhibition ``Urban Mythologies:
The Bronx Represented Since the 1960's,'' at the Bronx Museum of
the Arts until Sept. 5. It will become part of the museum's
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transboricua'' combines the words ``transformation'' and
``Boricua,'' the name for Puerto Rico in its native Taino Indian
language. Osorio said that ``Transboricua'' addressed issues of
consumerism and the transformations that Puerto Ricans and Latin
American immigrants undergo as they adapt to living with one
another in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go into a transition and cultural negotiations with other
groups,'' he said. ``What was once El Barrio is now shifting to a
different cultural representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fence in the installation, he said it
``represents the walls people put up to guard their territory,
their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want people to be able to experience the work up close,
too, and to feel a sense of ownership of it,'' he added. He is
distributing 100 keys to allow community residents inside the fence
to see the figure.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers at Young World said that they were puzzled at
first by ``Transboricua'' but that they appreciated its message.
They seemed to connect with what was most accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see the different cultures represented, and the
kids can learn from this,'' said Janet Rivera, 34, who is Puerto
Rican and lives in East Harlem, as her four children watched a
video that is part of the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Alonzo, 33, a Mexican-American resident of East Harlem,
said, ``It's nice to see the Mexican flag and the other Latin
American flags together, because the different cultures don't
always get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio accepts that the different layers of his work might be
hard to perceive and interpret at first. ``If people don't
understand the work right away, that is not as important as getting
them to think and talk about things like racism and identity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of humor in Osorio's pieces, but he is more
concerned with raising issues for public discussion. He is planning
a video work called ``Home Visits,'' which will be mailed to people
across the country, starting in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to invite their friends over and have openings
in their own homes,'' he said. ``It's all about accessibility and
finding how people will care for this work.''

LOOKING AT EARTH FROM AN ORBITAL PERCH

   One of technology's recurring effects is to offer new ways of
seeing. In the 18th century, travelers used a mirror called a
``Claude glass'' to enhance the painterly aspects of what they saw
as ideal landscapes. The stereoscope, invented in 1832 by the
British scientist Charles Wheatstone, was an attempt to convey
three-dimensional imagery using two lenses. In the early 20th
century, air travel led to aerial panoramas, used by military
planners in World War I to map battlegrounds. Perhaps the most
revelatory image of all was the first photographs of our planet
from space. Here was the ``whole Earth,'' to use the subsequent
metaphor, truly seen, for the first time, as a single object.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Internet is becoming the dominant medium through
which we ``see'' the world, it somehow seems appropriate that it
should also prove to be a storehouse for any number of previous and
current technologies for seeing the world. We can not only view
reproductions of stereographic images or turn-of-the-century
panoramas, we can tap into one of the myriad satellites now
orbiting Spaceship Earth to get a personalized, localized version
of a photo from space. Geographically, the world is no smaller than
before, but through the Internet _ the latest trompe l'oeill
technological apparatus _ we make it seem so.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a computer image does not suffice, however, and there
are qualities of texture and tactility that only printed
photographs can offer. Fortunately for that, there are a number of
sites that not only store a variety of photographs taken throughout
the history of the medium, but allow the viewer to order
reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   WWW.LCWEB.LOC.GOV
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, a decade after historians declared the closing of the
frontier, Detroit Publishing Co. sent a specially outfitted
railroad car across the country to take millions of photographs,
ranging from Western copper mines to Kansan prairies to New York
City streetscapes. The historian Michael Lesy writes in
``Dreamland: America at the Dawn of the Twentieth Century'' (New
Press, 1997) that to look at the images now is to feel the haunting
weight of history. ``It is the world we have lost: its safety, its
self-confidence, its vigor, its serenity, its possibilities _ its
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Publishing Co., for nearly a decade, sent a copy of
every ``scenic view'' it captured to the Library of Congress.
Nearly a century after they were taken, the lost world of these
photographs _ about 28,000 images _ has been preserved online in
the library's omnibus ``American Memory'' Web site. There are two
ways to gain access the vast collection: by entering a key word
(e.g., Brooklyn Bridge) or using the site's subject index (e.g.,
diving suits). Perhaps the best method of exploration is just to
randomly sift through, like paging through a musty photo album
found in some antique shop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Detroit collection, the library has digitized
part or all of scores of other collections. One of my favorites is
``America's First Look into the Camera: Daguerreotype Portraits and
Views,'' a collection of more than 600 examples of the medium,
unveiled in Paris in 1839, that promised a ``truthful likeness''
through a complicated process involving silver-plated copper sheets
and a variety of chemicals. (Because exposure times could reach 10
minutes, portrait subjects were often outfitted with a restraining
brace to keep them still.)
</P>
<P>
   Another rich trove is the collection of Farm Security
Administration and Office of War Information photographs, an epic
documentary project undertaken by the federal government in the
1930s that employed photographers like Dorothea Lange and Walker
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable feature of this collection is that a reproduction
of any photograph can be ordered simply by calling or sending a fax
to the library's photoduplication service. The print will arrive
four to six weeks later. In selecting an image for myself, I turned
to a universal icon that happens to be down the block _ the
Brooklyn Bridge. The photograph, which is uncredited, is taken from
what was known as a mammoth plate negative, a glass negative
measuring up to 18 inches by 22 inches whose use was pioneered by
the landscape photographer (and Detroit Publishing Co. stalwart)
William Henry Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, which captures only part of the bridge, shows
ships churning through the harbor and black smoke pouring from
stacks in the foreground. While the bridge still stands, nearly
everything else seems a part of that lost world of which Lesy
writes.

</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wanted to see ``The Perfect Storm''? I am not
referring to a film version of the book by Sebastian Junger, but
the storm itself, which ravaged the Eastern Seaboard in 1991. A
color-enhanced infrared photograph of the storm is just one of the
many striking images one can find scattered throughout the
exhaustive Web site of the National Climatic Data Center (itself
part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
is itself an agency of the Department of Commerce). The NCDC is one
of those peculiar government agencies of whose existence one is
unaware _ at least until its scientists become the villains of a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Storm is found in the site's ``Satellite's Eye Art
Gallery,'' which uses images from Geostationery Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) that orbit the earth, acting as
sort of extraterrestrial landscape photographers, documenting the
rude swirls of nasty weather, the darkened pixels that represent
the ``hot spot'' of a forest fire, and the brightened focal points
of volcanic activity. One of the site's most useful features is an
archive of GOES data dating back to 1992, which means one can view
(and order a print, for about $50) the weather patterns in just
about any place at any time for much of this decade. In one case, a
user ordered a photo of the Eastern United States on the day his
sister's baby was born. As a bonus the NCDC will highlight
particular geographic areas, in this case an arrow pointing to
Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For my own image, I relied on imagery provided by the Pentagon's
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (I'll bet you didn't know
that existed, either). The program keeps a number of ``birds''
floating in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit about 500 miles
above the earth, each capable of covering more than 1,800 miles of
cloud distribution in a single sweep. One of the defense agency's
products is a collection of images called the Nighttime Lights of
the World, which uses photographs of everything from cities to gas
flares as a ``global inventory of human settlement.'' The one that
caught my eye was a poster-sized reproduction of the lights of the
United States, a black-and-white image with collections of lights,
in clusters and interlinking strands, that look like a
drip-painting map of America by Jackson Pollack.

   In the film ``Enemy of the State,'' a rogue force within the
National Security Agency uses a bewildering array of electronic
surveillance to track the heroes played by Will Smith and Gene
Hackman; in one scene, their supposed escape by car is later
meticulously retraced through the help of satellite photography. In
this world, the only way to get off the grid is to go down into a
sewer.
</P>
<P>
   High-altitude satellite imagery is being put to a more benign
use, which is not to say there are not more sinister activities
happening somewhere. The Internet offers imagery to geologists,
news-gathering organizations, people involved in zoning disputes,
and just about anyone interested in seeing how the world looks from
hundreds of miles high. The U.S. Geological Survey, in a kind of
modern analogy to the photographic surveys of the West in the last
century, has even undertaken what it calls the National High
Altitude Photography program, launched with the goal of obtaining
uniform photographs of the 48 contiguous states. Another common
source of imagery is gleaned through satellites that were once
solely the province of the military. Terraserver, for example, uses
a Russian Sputnik while SPOT uses French military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of resolution and range of coverage varies. In
general, each of the various satellite imagery sites allows the
user to locate a place by coordinates, place name, and, often,
address; not every site, however, allows the user to view the image
before purchasing it.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, the sites are heavy on landmarks and
natural phenomena, like the Statue of Liberty and Niagara Falls.
News-related events are also favorites: Terraserver, for example,
features the Pristina Airfield in Kosovo, while SPOT exhorts users
to ``View SPOT's latest imagery of the Oklahoma City tornado
damage.'' Since most of the sites cover almost the entire United
States, though, basically anything can be made a landmark in the
user's eye. The image I ordered, from Terraserver, is of the
Bingham Pit near Salt Lake City, the second-largest open pit copper
mine in the world. Since I had been told on a visit last year that
Bingham was one of only a handful of manmade phenomena visible from
space, I was subsequently curious to see just what it looked like.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting photograph looks rather like a giant being has
pressed its finger to the ground, leaving a vast print of flattened
whorls in an otherwise rocky landscape. For a relatively low price
($25) and a few minutes worth of data entry, you can bring this _
or any other small corner of the world __ into your home.

   Stereoscopic, or 3-D photography, was the virtual reality of the
19th century. As the New York Public Library notes in the
introduction to its online collection of stereoscopic views,
``stereos were a mainstay of home entertainment, perhaps second
only to reading as a personal leisure activity.'' Given that the
Internet now fulfills a primary role in home entertainment, it is
ironic that it should be used to view a medium that was perhaps its
rough equivalent more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The library's Robert Dennis Collection has more than 12,000
stereoscopes. The collection is focused on small-town life in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut, covering everything from
aerialists to zoos. Like the Detroit collection, the stereoscopes
form a fascinating portrait of American life, including Niagara
Falls daredevils and the ``idiot asylum'' in Syracuse, N.Y., and
feature portraits of fascinating Americans, like Edgar Allan Poe
and Mark Twain. Curiously, the stereoscopes cannot be viewed in 3-D
on the computer screen, but the site sells an inexpensive cardboard
viewer that will accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Library has also digitized other noteworthy
collections, including works from Berenice Abbot's ``Changing New
York'' exhibit and Lewis Hine' ``Construction of the Empire State
Building, 1930-1931.'' As with the Library of Congress,
reproductions can be ordered for a reasonable fee. Browsing through
Abbot's collection, which documents the city through the Great
Depression, the city seems in limbo, one foot rooted in the past _
a horse-drawn milk wagon on Grove Street, for example _ the other
striding confidently into an age of technology, with sleek office
buildings rising from the historical clutter.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite photograph, ``Rope Store,'' depicts a rope vendor on
New York City's South Street. Perched in front of a wood-burning
stove with a cigar in his mouth, the merchant is surrounded by
stacks of rope, riggings, life preservers and a few marine
instruments. He looks content, with no idea that half a century
later, his visage would appear on someone's desktop computer,
pulled from the ether. His rope store, meanwhile, would be long
shuttered, serving no use on a street that had long ago replaced
shipping with shopping.

`HEMINGWAY: THE FINAL YEARS': THE LAST 20 YEARS OF A
LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a bad time of Hemingway's life that Michael Reynolds
covers in the fifth and final volume of his biography of the
writer, ``Hemingway: The Final Years,'' which begins with the
completion of the novel ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' in the summer
of 1940 and ends with Hemingway's death at 61 on July 2, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at these two decades, Hemingway's life makes a
depressing story. In the World War II years, from 1940 to 1945, he
found himself in the frustrating situation of wanting to be part of
the action yet not being able to find a suitable role. This
produced the dubious heroics of his Caribbean U-boat hunting aboard
his fishing craft, the Pilar, and his questionable taking up of
arms in Europe when he was supposed to have been strictly an
observer.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer, he went through a long fallow period and then in
almost manic bursts of productivity turned out the uneven work that
would be published posthumously (``A Moveable Feast,'' ``The
Dangerous Summer,'' ``Islands in the Stream,'' ``The Garden of
Eden'' and ``True at First Light''), as well as ``Across the River
and Into the Trees'' and ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' two novels
that sold well but were inferior to his best earlier work.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Martha Gellhorn fell apart over his demands that
she serve him instead of pursuing her own career as a writer, and
his subsequent marriage to Mary Welsh was a hell of betrayal and
helpless need on his part. When he wasn't recuperating from
concussions and other injuries suffered in boating, driving and
flying accidents, he was drinking too much and abusing himself with
a ``pharmacological stew'' of drugs that often didn't mix.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing everything was Hemingway's inexorable physical and
mental decline until, on the morning of July 2, 1961, he woke up
early in his house in Ketchum, Idaho, fetched his favorite shotgun
from the storeroom, slipped in two shells and snapped the breech
shut. In Reynolds' words: ``The taste of gun oil and powder solvent
filled his mouth as cold steel made contact against his hard
palate. The clock on Mary's bedside table clicked as the minute
hand moved to 7:30. Then two, almost simultaneous explosions woke
her to her widowhood, her world, changed, utterly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Reynolds have to add to this grim story that previous
biographers like Carlos Baker, Kenneth Lynn and Jeffrey Meyers have
not already told? Not a great deal, as far as the overall shape of
the story goes. Proceeding chronologically and allowing events
rather than themes to form his narrative, Reynolds avoids critical
judgments of Hemingway's work and offers no startling new theses to
explain him as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he sharpens many details. He reveals how astute Hemingway's
judgment was in predicting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and
the Chinese civil war, after a tour of the Far East with Martha
Gellhorn in 1941. He sets a scene of heavy German submarine
activity in the Caribbean in the early 1940s, making Hemingway's
patrols in the Pilar seem slightly less quixotic than in previous
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly he offers fresh and vivid details surrounding
Hemingway's deterioration. He shows how the pattern of dark
depressions changed, striking their victim in the midst of his
writing projects instead of upon their completion. He traces the
losing battle with alcohol and the increasing dependence on
prescription drugs to lift or soothe his spirits. He offers fresh
evidence of the abuse of Mary, citing how on one occasion he threw
wine at her and how another time he spat in her face.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination lies in looking for a cause, a decisive
incident, a concussion that changed Hemingway's brain.
Tantalizingly, Reynolds reports that Hemingway's son Gregory
``firmly believed that his father changed during that 1943-44
period into a different person.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds adds, ``It was as if some inner, furious animal was set
loose, an animal over which Hemingway had some control in public,
but little at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no single event or moment stands apart in Reynolds'
narrative. The deterioration appears as always to have been
cumulative, a series of insults to the brain delivered by physical
and psychological events that gradually drove Hemingway into a hell
of depression and paranoia from which self-murder was the only
possible escape.
</P>
<P>
   Or else his destruction went back to early in his life, to what
some would describe as Hemingway's hairy-chested embrace of
hyper-masculine values and his denial in himself of the soft and
feminine. This is certainly the picture that Clancy Carlile has
recently painted effectively in his somewhat heavy-handed fictional
portrait of the young Hemingway in the novel ``The Paris
Pilgrims.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Reynolds describes a scene during World War II in
which Hemingway encounters a psychiatrist who is probing soldiers
for signs of battle fatigue. Reynolds writes: ``Fellow journalist
Bill Walton remembered the psychiatrist calling courage and
cowardliness false values with which people kidded themselves. An
argument developed, which led to the psychiatrist saying, `Every
damn one of you is going to break sooner or later. ... Including
you, Hemingway!'''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds quotes Walton: ``Hemingway exploded. He flushed deep
red and pounded on the table so hard the wine bottle jumped around.
... The captain was an ignoramus, an uneducated fool, a pervert, an
enemy spy, and anything else unpleasant he could think of. ...
Something that was very deep in him had been touched. He couldn't
forget it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the power that Hemingway's persona still
exerts that just for a moment you agree with his judgment of that
psychiatrist. Even his sad and desperate end still evokes some
sense of heroism, the shaking of a fist in the faces of cruel gods.

 &HT;    ``Action'' shocking take on Hollywood
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Two months before its debut, the new Fox
comedy ``Action'' is already getting plenty: Plenty of flak for its
profane, sometimes shocking take on the Hollywood film business,
plenty of praise from some television critics for its outrageous
humor, plenty of grief from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Action,'' Jay Mohr, who played sleazy sports agent Bob
Sugar in ``Jerry McGuire,'' stars as an obscenity-spouting film
producer who hires a hooker to evaluate movie scripts. Running gags
in the pilot episode include the size of a studio owner's private
parts and restaurant workers urinating in the food; obscenities
that ``NYPD Blue'' would never even attempt are said but bleeped,
although it's usually pretty obvious what's been deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to make the most shocking show on
television,'' said creator Chris Thompson, who worked for HBO's
``The Larry Sanders Show,'' another scabrous, inside-showbiz
series. ``We're trying to make the funniest show on television.''
</P>
<P>
   They may have made both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out of our way not to go too far,'' added Mohr,
who like Thompson, was part of Fox's presentations at the annual
Televison Critics Association meetings here. ``I don't think
there's anything wrong with what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But TV commercial buyers are comparing ``Action'' to the launch
of ``NYPD Blue,'' which scandalized mainstream advertisers when it
debuted brief partial nudity and realistic cop language. ``NYPD''
didn't make a lot of the ad revenue its first two seasons, but
recently has become a premium buy. Fox officials admit some
advertisers don't want to be associated with ``Action,'' but they
anticipate selling out the show at full rates.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the series is accurate to the way people talk in
the film business: ``I don't know anybody I deal with who says
'frikkin' or 'That guy is a real doody-head.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The show, was developed for HBO, which has no language barriers,
but didn't work there and went to Fox instead, a mainstream
broadcaster. Fox promotions running now carry the label ``for
mature audiences,'' and Doug Herzog, president of Fox Broadcasting
Entertainment, is blunt about not wanting children to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you're going to be offended, please don't
watch,'' he said. ``We don't want to field the phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the show's depiction of Hollywood as a vile cesspool of
treachery and amorality, Mohr, who shuns much of the Hollywood
game, says it's pretty accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is a horrible town, full of filthy people, where
good men die like dogs and people who have a famous brother get 16
shows. I would say I loathe Hollywood but loathe is too mild a
word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' isn't the only new show from Fox that has
questionable material. In ``Malcom in the Middle,'' airing at 7
p.m. Sundays, a mother walks around nude from the waist up, holding
a strategic pile of laundry, in front of her children. In
``Manchester Prep,'' a toned-down version of the movie ``Cruel
Intentions'' (itself a teen version of ``Dangerous Liasions''), a
teenaged girl eyeballs her step-brother in the shower. Chris
Crater's ``Harsh Realm'' has been called the most violent new fall
series,'' and ``Get Real,'' a family drama, has a high school girl
spending the night in her boyfriend's bed, then joining his family
for breakfast the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing the envelope means a lot of different things,'' said
Herzog, ``but it's what we're gonna do. We need to be
differentiated and keep on exploring and experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started in this business doing 'Laverne &AMP; Shirley,' `` said
veteran producer Thompson. ``The line (of what is acceptable)
always does move, the line always moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation draw stars
</P>
<P>
   As the number of prime-time animated shows expand, so does the
opportunity for stunt guest voices, something ``The Simpsons'' has
been doing for years. Next season, Fox's three animated shows will
be drowning in guest voices.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Simpsons,'' Mel Gibson will play himself on Sept. 19
when Homer beomes a Hollywood consultant and helps Gibson with his
new movie, ``Beyond Blunderdome.'' Lucy Lawless, Dick Clark and Tom
Arnold will guest on the annual ``Treehouse of Horror'' anthology
Oct. 31. Also coming on: Penn &AMP; Teller, baseball player Mark
McGwire, John Goodman and Henry Winkler.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep is the unlikeliest guest voice coming next season
on ``King of the Hill.'' Also scheduled are Drew Carey, Heather
Locklear, Kathleen Turner and country music stars the Dixie Chicks,
Clint Black and Mac Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy'' will re-unite the cast of ``Murphy Brown'' as an
animated version of themselves for an upcoming episode, with
Candice Bergen, Faith Ford, Joe Regalbuto and Charles Kimbrough
playing their old roles. Also re-uniting will be Patrick Duffy and
Victoria Principal of ``Dallas.'' Sam Waterston, Robin Leach, Ben
Stein, Tim Curry and the rock group Kiss have also signed for the
new season of ``Family Guy.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the 1980s, when he was flush with cash, the
television magnate Emilio Azcarraga Milmo decided to create a
modern-art museum that would give Mexico City a new aura of
sophistication and make it a respectable stop on the international
art circuit.
</P>
<P>
   To direct his museum, Azcarraga plucked Robert R. Littman from
New York art circles and brought him to Mexico. Littman, the former
director of the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New York
University, became the director of the Cultural Center for
Contemporary Art, which opened here in 1986. Before long, the new
museum was filled with traveling and other exhibitions involving
artists of the global stature of Robert Motherwell, Salvador Dali
and Anselm Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   Persistently but rather quietly, Littman also put his eye and
Azcarraga's largesse to work on building a permanent collection for
the museum. In time it came to include about 1,800 works of modern
art and a collection of photographs assembled by the nonagenarian
dean of Mexican photographers, Manuel Alvarez Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga died in 1997. His son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, took
over his media empire, closed the museum as a luxury he could no
longer afford and let Littman go. The museum went out of business,
and its permanent collection was locked away in the basement of the
headquarters of Grupo Televisa, the Azcarragas' media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   But the collection, in a sense, has been reborn, in an
incarnation that befits the times in which it will live:
financially leaner, but with more fluid artistic interchange
between Mexico and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing proposals from several museums and libraries,
the Televisa Cultural Foundation, which owns the collection, signed
a 25-year agreement to turn over its management to Casa Lamm, an
institute run by five Mexican women who show art and teach art
history. The institute is in an aristocratic turn-of-the-century
mansion in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the generous spaces of the Cultural Center for
Contemporary Art, Casa Lamm (which is named for its architect,
Lewis Lamm) is far too small to serve as a museum to show the
collection. So instead of exhibiting it, Casa Lamm will lend the
works to other museums in Mexico and the United States. Rather than
having an ample supply of Televisa's money, as Littman did, Casa
Lamm will spend its time searching for funds to support the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Its new curator is Victor Zamudio Taylor, an American-Mexican,
as he calls himself: an American of Mexican descent who grew up at
the border in San Diego and later lived in Mexico. One of Zamudio
Taylor's goals is to close the circle that Littman began drawing,
by taking the Mexican art that is part of the Televisa collection
and sending it to be shown in the United States, especially in
areas with many Latino residents.
</P>
<P>
   In the Televisa-Casa Lamm deal, there is a something of a
parallel with the past. For the chairwoman of his museum, the
senior Azcarraga had chosen Paula Cussi, who eventually became his
wife. Although her only professional experience had been in reading
horoscopes on a Televisa variety show, over the years Ms. Cussi
proved herself to be an astute museum manager. Now one of the
directors of Casa Lamm is Germaine Gomez Haro, the wife of
Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, a cousin of the younger Azcarraga.
Burillo is the vice chairman of Grupo Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can do half the job that Paula did,'' Ms. Gomez Haro
said, acknowledging that she was part of a kind of succession.
``She threw herself into it and made that museum out of her pure
talent and with a lot of love. But we are facing different times.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Casa Lamm role is not mere nepotism. The institute offers a
master's degree in art history, one of the few genuinely
professional programs in that field in Mexico, which has a vast
artistic legacy but few scholars to study it. Among the credits of
Casa Lamm's in-house art director, Elin Luque Agraz, is an
intriguing exhibition she put together in 1996 of small paintings
representing pledges by Mexican Catholics to their saints. It was
shown, coincidentally, at the Cultural Center for Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone doubts that we do a serious job,'' Ms.
Gomez Haro said.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Lamm presented the only proposal to Televisa that did not
involve breaking up the collection into separate parts. There is
the contemporary art collection, with works by Mexicans like Sergio
Hernandez, Maria Izquierdo and Francisco Toledo, as well as
installations, video and other electronic pieces and more
conventional canvases by artists like Jasper Johns, Sigmar Polke
and Gerhard Richter. Among the unusual pieces are huge wall
tapestries woven in a Mexican workshop from designs by Francesco
Clemente and Ray Smith. Ms. Gomez Haro said many pieces in the
collection had never been displayed in public.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alvarez Bravo collection are works from photographers
like Guillermo Kahlo (Frida's father), Paul Strand and Tina
Modotti. The photographs will come to reside in a new building that
is going up at Casa Lamm, and Zamudio Taylor plans to digitalize
them and put them online at a bilingual Web site. Casa Lamm will
also house Televisa's 15,000-volume library on contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Lamm has already arranged for two-year loans of modern art
to the Carrillo Gil Museum in Mexico City and the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico. Casa Lamm will not charge
fees for the loans in Mexico and does not expect to get caught up
in the traditional competitive jostling among more established
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a museum, so we can actually work with museums,''
Zamudio Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Zamudio Taylor, who has been associated with museums in San
Diego, Los Angeles and New York, said that his vision was to show
the art Littman had assembled in order to enhance the glory of
Mexico on walls in Latino communities across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first generation had to achieve status,'' Zamudio Taylor
said. ``Ours has to balance intellectual rigor with creativity in
finding ways to show the work. And figure out where the money's
coming from.''

TRIAL PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON KILLING OF GAY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A closely watched case involving the death of a
gay San Francisco man is about to go to trial in the glare of the
publicity over the killing of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Only a courtroom is lacking for jury selection to begin in the
murder trial of Edgard Mora for delivering one lethal punch to the
jaw of Brian Wilmes outside a South of Market leather bar on March
12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both the district attorney's office and Mora's attorney agree
that the 27-year-old South San Francisco man was in a drunken,
self-pitying rage when he knocked Wilmes off his feet and, his
friend said, screamed ``faggot.'' Wilmes, 45, died two days later,
his head no match for the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides say Mora didn't intend to kill Wilmes. And
both say he deserves to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   But there, the agreement ends.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Murlene Randle will ask the jury to find Mora guilty
of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of 15 years to
life in prison. The jury also will be asked to decide whether the
homicide was a hate crime _ meaning if the use of an anti-gay
epithet proves it occurred because of Wilmes' sexual orientation.
That could add up to three years to any sentence.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Terence Hallinan, through a spokesman, said:
``All circumstances of the case indicated it was a hate crime. He
used an anti-gay slur and then he hit the guy for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Robert Dunlap will try to persuade the jury
that Mora is not guilty of murder, and certainly not a hate crime,
because Mora never intended to kill anyone, and his apparent use of
an epithet isn't proof of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being tried in an atmosphere sensitized to two
sensational crimes: the killing of young Matthew Shepard, left to
die on a Wyoming fence because he was gay, and the dragging death
of James Byrd in Texas, because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap said it was wrong ``for this case to even be said in the
same breath as the more obvious crimes as Matthew Shepard or James
Byrd, crimes so revolting it turns your stomach to think about
them. All this case has is the fact that Edgard apparently said the
word `faggot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mora, the record shows, was mad at the world, for a variety of
personal frustrations and failures. He had drunk an entire bottle
of schnapps, kept jumping from his girlfriend's car and lashing out
at anything in his path _ a bus shelter, a dance studio door, a
homeless man _ before Wilmes and his friend Tim Carroll, in
leather, crossed his path on their way toward the Loading Dock gay
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for the fact that Wilmes apparently was gay,
this case would have settled for what it is _ involuntary
manslaughter _ a year ago,'' Dunlap said. ``The fact that Wilmes
was gay doesn't make this a murder, or a hate crime, because Edgard
at some point did or didn't call him a faggot.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the case will be the testimony of Carroll, who lives in
Sacramento. In a November preliminary hearing, Dunlap focused on
the ways Carroll's story had changed.
</P>
<P>
   In three interviews with the police immediately after the
attack, Carroll mentioned only once that after Wilmes hit the
sidewalk, Mora appeared to reach down and shake him. When the
police asked whether Mora was ``hitting'' Wilmes' head against the
ground, Carroll said no, but then in the preliminary hearing he
said he'd only meant a semantic disagreement and that Wilmes' head
was ``knocking'' against the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the other witnesses saw any shaking. The autopsy
found no bruises or other damage to the back of Wilmes' head.
</P>
<P>
   Also in contention will be the use of ``faggot,'' which Carroll
alluded to hearing several times but under questioning from the
judge admitted he could remember hearing only once. Dunlap also
will raise a question in jurors' minds about whether Wilmes had
said something to provoke Mora, as seen by a witness who was out of
earshot.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney also will attack as a ``complete
fabrication'' Carroll's addition to his story at the preliminary
hearing that before hitting Wilmes, Mora had slapped Carroll's bare
behind peeking out from his leather chaps.

   BELLSOUTH _ BellSouth Corp. on Wednesday reported second-quarter
net income of $980 million, up 19.8 percent from a year earlier,
although more than half of the gain was from savings related to new
internal-use software. (Kannell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GEORGIAPACIFIC-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Group, the
second-largest U.S. paper and lumber company, said second-quarter
profit rose sevenfold, beating expectations, as prices and
shipments rose for most of its building products. Georgia-Pacific
said last month that its earnings would exceed estimates because of
increased home building as well as higher demand for pulp, paper
and packaging. The strongest pace of single-family home building in
more than a decade has helped spur demand for building products, as
has home remodeling. The company is also benefiting from rising
demand for pulp and paper, which has boosted prices. (Bond, Atlanta

The package delivery giant announced Wednesday it will sell about
10 percent of its stock, which has always been in the hands of

says the move will add financial flexibility. (Thurston, Atlanta

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a mathematician at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Steve Judd
harnesses the power of Unix work stations and Cray supercomputers
to detect and prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes home, he basks in the light of his 15-year-old
Commodore computer, a one-megahertz machine with 64 kilobytes of
RAM. It can move chunks of data in the same size packages as a
Nintendo Game Boy and has 3 percent of the memory capacity of a
Palm III organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Judd creates three-dimensional graphics on his obsolete
Commodore and calls it a real programming challenge. ``It's like
building a radio from scratch,'' he said. ``You are designing from
the most fundamental level. You have to take advantage of every
ounce of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fender Tucker, who runs a Commodore software company called
Loadstar, said, ``Commodores are for people who aren't all that
sure that the computer revolution has made our lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people appear to have turned to old computers (or
stuck with them) out of nostalgia, a desire for simplicity and an
appreciation for classic design. In the realm of digital machines,
where today's computer is out of date tomorrow, there can be great
satisfaction in taking a digital Model T out for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cotton, editor of Commodore World magazine, estimates
that a million Commodores are still in service around the world.
Their owners include people who remember their first computers more
fondly than their first girlfriends (most users are men), as well
as people who have handed them down to their children or have set
up miniature computer museums in their basements, much to the
dismay of their wives.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not only the Commodore. Old Apple computers and
Sinclair Spectrums are also popular. ``Some people like to drive
classic cars, like the '60s-era Mustang or the original Beetle,''
said Scott Gamon, 24, who still uses an Apple II GS. ``I think the
main reason is that the cars are classic vehicles that made
history. The Apple II computer is the same in the computer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners are active users of the old computers, and some
participate in international programming competitions.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who cannot afford a new computer or do not
know how to use them. Many actually own up-to-date computers that
are hundreds of times as fast and much more powerful than their old
ones, but they keep their eight-bit machines around to remind them
how they started with computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't buy that machine with my paper-route money when I
was 11, I likely wouldn't have gotten into computers, a university
scholarship and a decent-paying job,'' said Robyn Harbron of
Thunder Bay, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, who is also a co-owner of Creative Micro Designs, a
Commodore hardware company, said, ``We have a number of people who
have called us up saying, `Windows is nice for work, but I miss
that old Commodore.'''
</P>
<P>
   A number of fans of eight-bit machines are sophisticated
programmers who praise the computers' timeless elegance and
efficiency. ``You don't say Mozart, Shakespeare or van Gogh are
good for their time,'' Judd said. ``They are just plain good. I
make the claim for the Commodore 64.''
</P>
<P>
   All software, whether Windows 98 or Lotus Notes or Doom, is
based on simple mathematical calculations like addition and
multiplication. Computers express information in binary numbers;
each digit is a 0 or a 1, and each place is a power of 2. Eight-bit
computers handle data in binary numbers that have eight digits. For
large calculations, an eight-bit computer has to break down the
problem into simpler pieces, and that is one factor that makes
eight-bit computers slow, compared with modern 32-bit machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the sluggishness is that those old
computer chips did not have many transistors, or switches, and the
transistors they did have were far apart, lengthening the paths the
signals had to travel. Modern chips pack transistors tightly
together, which speeds up processing times.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you could make them compatible, it would take about a
thousand Commodores to run the equivalent of today's Microsoft
Word, and even then it would run very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many users insist that the eight-bit classics are on the verge
of becoming collectibles. Searches on auction sites like Ebay
unearth hundreds of items in the classic realm, like floppy disks,
printers and actual computers, for generally low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of trailing-edge technology have their own magazines,
conventions, weekly on-line discussions, Web sites and newsletters.
In Europe, dozens of programmers meet regularly for competition
parties, where they see who can stretch the capacities of the
eight-bit computers the furthest. Some are on a crusade, contending
that the old computers should be preserved for posterity. The
Vintage Technology Center, a computer nostalgia group in Santa
Clara, Calif., recently announced plans to build a supercomputer
out of Commodore 64's. ``Sixty-four 64's'' is its motto.
</P>
<P>
   All of that would be mere nostalgia, or a hobby like collecting
Pez memorabilia, except that the eight-bit die-hards actually use
their computers. In a sense, their devotion to the simple machines
is an active refutation of the Wintel world of quick obsolescence
that frustrates many computer users.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, programmers looked for creative software
solutions instead of glitzier hardware. ``In a way it was simpler
back then,'' said Lane Denson, a Nashville farmer who has set up a
computer museum in his basement. ``You didn't have 20 or 30 sound
cards and you didn't have to worry about upgrading every other
week.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when mega, giga and tetra are the popular prefixes,
the software available for the kilobyte clunkers is surprisingly
sophisticated. Commodore users can send faxes via modems, use laser
printers and use a mouse to maneuver through an operating system
that looks a lot like Windows. And their computers can act as hosts
for Web pages. Accessories that increase the capacities of the old
machines are also available, including one that speeds them up by a
factor of 20.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Randall, who has an auto repair shop in Charlotte,
Mich., uses his Commodore for all facets of daily computing, for
things like designing newsletters and writing HTML pages. ``If you
don't need to do a lot of high-powered graphical work, they're
perfect,'' Randall said. ``They don't crash. They don't have
viruses, and they don't break down as often.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular eight-bit computers are the Commodore 64, of
which 20 million units were sold from 1982 to 1992; the Sinclair ZX
Spectrum, which was the most popular computer in Britain in the
mid-1980s, and the Apple II line, which went on the market in 1977
and became immensely popular for its educational software.
Production had stopped for all these models by the early 1990s
because of pressure from the IBM compatibles.
</P>
<P>
   Now as then, the various computer camps are fierce rivals.
European Spectrum fans periodically invade on-line discussion
groups of Commodore users, and vice versa _ each group engaging in
the electronic equivalent of nose-thumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about my mom all you want, but don't insult my
computer,'' Judd said.
</P>
<P>
   Many programmers insist that the limits of the old machines
force programmers to be more resourceful. Many of them, like
Randall, who spends 40 to 50 hours each week programming, write in
assembly code, the most fundamental programming language, because
it takes up less space than higher-level languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using assembly language, I can make the code real tight and
small on a Commodore,'' Randall said. The program he uses to send
faxes via modem is only 56 kilobytes in size. His software
releases, which include a fax program and an updated operating
system that looks much like Windows, earn him more than $20,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   For some, eight-bit programming represents a return to computing
as a personal experience and a move away from being a technodrone
in an information economy. ``Before, it was very much discovering
and experimenting for your own benefit,'' said Mark Lair, 40, of
Dallas. ``Now we're in a service industry. Most of us programmers
are providing for other people rather than ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But others acknowledge that there is not a high demand for
eight-bit programmers. ``Yes, I'm a Sinclair fan, but to earn a
living, I need to remain up to date in a rapidly evolving
industry,'' said Richard Jordan, 26, a programmer in Britain who
owns several Spectrums.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-bit computers draw their biggest chunk of fans because of
the classic video games they play. Fans say the older games,
unadorned by fancy graphics and sound effects, focused more on game
play. A result, they contend, was games that transcend their
technological simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   A few times each month, Jeff Lewis, 35, goes into his basement
to play some of the hundreds of Commodore 64 games he has
accumulated. His wife, Dianna, refers to the computer, which is
still connected to a working dot-matrix printer, as a ``Commodore
shrine.'' ``She actually thinks I'm kind of nuts for keeping it
up,'' said Lewis, who lives in a suburb of Cleveland. ``I just tell
her it's part of my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those who actually own old computers, there are hundreds
of thousands more who pretend that they do by using a generation of
emulators, which allow users to pretend that their 32-bit PCs are
primitive Commodores, Spectrums and Apples. Thousands of old games
are available for downloading on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the number of eight-bit fans and admirers, the most
dedicated enthusiasts sometimes bemoan the skewed demographics of
their ranks. Oyvind Vevang, 20, of Haugesund, Norway, meets many
friends though a common interest in classic video games, but they
are almost all male. Vevang lamented, ``If more girls were
interested in this, I'd have one hell of a pickup trick!''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Protests erupted Wednesday in Beijing and other
Chinese cities as thousands of followers of the Buddhist Law
movement vented their anger over a government crackdown that began
on Monday night, according to members of the group and a Hong
Kong-based human rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   As they did once before, in April, members of the group, known
in Chinese as Falun Gong, took their grievances to the doorstep of
the Communist Party. Early Wednesday morning, hundreds of members
massed in front of the leaders' compound here, a member of the
group said. The police quickly herded them into buses and took them
away.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Falun Gong representatives in Beijing and Hong Kong
said, police in 14 cities rounded up more than 100 prominent
members.
</P>
<P>
   It was a silent vigil near the compound on April 25 by 10,000
followers protesting local officials' harassment of Falun Gong and
demanding official recognition that catapulted the group from
obscurity to the top of the agenda for jittery party leaders. Falun
Gong had managed to mount the biggest illegal rally in Beijing
since the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement, which caught the
authorities completely by surprise and suggested unusual powers of
mobilization. Furthermore, the group says it has 100 million
members around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is a number impossible to verify, particularly in a group
that claims no formal organization aside from an allegiance to the
teachings of its founder, Li Hongzhi, who depends heavily on the
Internet to communicate with his followers. Li, 48, a former grain
bureau clerk in northeastern China who is now based in the United
States, started Falun Gong in 1992 as a fusion of the ancient
Chinese practice of qigong _ the channeling of vital energies
through yogic exercises _ with elements of Buddhism and Taoism. The
group's members insist that they are interested only in physical
and moral uplift, and that they eschew politics.
</P>
<P>
   But if Falun Gong's rapid response to the crackdown is any
indication, Chinese authorities may have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds ranging from a few dozen to several thousand demonstrated
Wednesday in 30 cities across China, including Shanghai, Tianjin,
Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Wuhan, according to the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   These rallies came despite a blanket of silence about the
detentions in the official Chinese news media. The police declined
to comment on the detentions and protests.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is only one of several quasi-religious movements that
have emerged in China since Deng Xiaoping began reforming the
economy in 1979 and social controls were relaxed. With its mixture
of martial arts and mysticism, it bears enough resemblance to
popular movements that wreaked havoc in the final decades of the
last imperial dynasty to make communist authorities apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   As China enters a period of fresh social and economic upheaval,
with faltering state enterprises laying off millions of workers and
rural incomes stalling, Beijing may have concluded that Falun Gong
is too much of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a senior Chinese official warned its members not to
``promote superstition'' or ``destroy social order.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As they did in April, Falun Gong members began gathering at dawn
Wednesday in the tree-lined streets near Zhongnanhai, the walled
compound that houses President Jiang Zemin and other leaders. This
time, though, the police hustled them to buses and removed them
before a crowd was able to coalesce, said Wang Xiaoyan, the wife of
one of the group's detained leaders, Ji Liewu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to tell the government that there's no reason to
arrest students of Falun Gong,'' said Ms. Wang, who spoke to
several participants by telephone. ``As people got near
Zhongnanhai, the police were ready,'' she added. ``They forced them
to leave, to get on buses to take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang said that more than 1,000 Falun Gong members were being
held in a football stadium outside Beijing. The Hong Kong rights
group said people were being held at two stadiums as well as other
locations. From there, the group said, people were being sent back
to their homes in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong spokeswoman for Falun Gong described a similar
sequence of events in the southern city of Guangzhou. Roughly 2,000
demonstrators congregated in front of a government building early
Wednesday morning, she said. The police forced most onto buses, and
they were taken to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
   In central Beijing Wednesday, the fear of unrest hung heavy in
the torpid air. Hundreds of riot police and soldiers maintained
their positions around Zhongnanhai. Water-cannon trucks were parked
in walled courtyards across the street from the compound, while
riot shields were lined up in gleaming rows.
</P>
<P>
   The police closed a main thoroughfare on the western edge of the
compound, causing traffic jams that paralyzed much of downtown. The
police also turned away most pedestrians and bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets nearby, scores of people squatted on the
sidewalk, watching the scene curiously. One or two appeared to be
meditating, but it was unclear whether they were members of Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One reason the government is so wary of this group is that its
members blend seamlessly into ordinary society. Unlike the
flag-waving, slogan-shouting students of 1989, Falun Gong followers
tend to be middle-aged people _ a large percentage female, and many
retired _ who would make the most unlikely of rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply follow the law and principles that Master Li Hongzhi
taught us,'' said Sophie Xiao, the spokeswoman in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the government has not yet commented on the crackdown, it
continues its campaign of indirect criticism. The main television
news program Wednesday evening carried lengthy coverage of a speech
by a senior party ideologue, Gong Yuzhi, in which he denounced the
spread of ``feudal superstition'' in Chinese society.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such denunciations will not persuade people like Ms. Wang to
abandon her allegiance to Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only wait for news of my husband,'' she said. ``But I'll
definitely continue practicing Falun Gong. We believe that teacher
Li is the truth.''

NUN OPENS VATICAN DOORS TO THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Vatican was never a place associated with openness.
Popes don't give interviews or news conferences, and the high walls
around Vatican City are a kind of metaphor for a tradition of
discretion that reaches back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But more than any pontiff before him, Pope John Paul II has
tried to open the Roman Catholic Church to the world. And better
than most predecessors, he knows how to enlist modern technology in
the task.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was not surprising when Sister Judith Zoebelein,
an American nun, was given the job several years ago of opening the
church to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Sister Zoebelein, who had arrived at the Vatican
in 1991 to sort out the church's computer systems, built the
Vatican Web site, www.vatican.va, which went online about two years
ago with the help of three Digital Equipment servers nicknamed
Gabriel, Raphael and Michael. Sister Zoebelein is technical
director of the site, which delivers basic information about the
popes of this century, the church administration and the Vatican
library, museums and archives.
</P>
<P>
   While some areas of the site provide abundant information,
others are more sketchily furnished. Sister Zoebelein has ambitious
plans to upgrade the technological equipment and deepen the
offerings, including audio and video material from the life of the
pope and the history of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Claudio Celli, a former Vatican diplomat who is now a
senior official in the administration overseeing the Web site,
said: ``Today, technical means of communication offer broad
possibilities to disseminate knowledge at a global level. The Holy
See considers it a challenge to be present in this context.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sister Zoebelein's project is a logical extension
of recent changes in the church. The Vatican museums and library,
for instance, have broadened communication with outside scholars,
and a longstanding tradition of not lending Vatican treasures has
been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Zoebelein, a native of Manhattan, said she had been
bitten by the computer bug in her youth thanks to her father, who
worked for the Burroughs computer company before its merger with
Sperry to form Unisys Corp. She joined the order of the Franciscan
Sisters of the Eucharist, which sent her to Israel to help train
Palestinians in the use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 she was asked to oversee the organization of computer
systems for Catholic Relief Services, the relief and development
arm of the church in the United States. It was through this work,
which included unifying several systems used to track food
supplies, that she came to the attention of Rosario Jose Cardinal
Castillo Lara, who was the manager of Vatican properties and asked
her in 1991 to come work at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In those eight years, she has seen computer use begin to spread
among Vatican personnel. The Annuario Pontificio, the hefty tome
that is a kind of Vatican Who's Who, now contains a smattering of
e-mail addresses alongside names.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any major institution, there is an explosion in computer
use in the beginning among middle management,'' Sister Zoebelein
said, dressed in a gray habit in her office on the first floor of
the Apostolic Palace, one floor below the papal offices. ``It's
natural for a large institution to combine resources, to develop a
system that could work, to build a database.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, she and several other Vatican officials,
including the head of the papal press office, Joaquin Navarro
Valls, began to share ideas about bringing the Vatican onto the
World Wide Web. The initial plan, Sister Zoebelein said, was ``to
try something simple, to see what the response was.'' The site made
its debut on Christmas Day 1995, with the papal message ``Urbi et
Orbi'' (``To the city and to the world'') from the balcony of Saint
Peter's Basilica. The home page included a photo of the pope and
links to the text of the message in various languages.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 48 hours more than 300,000 visits were logged.
Because Sister Zoebelein's design team had included an e-mail
address, many viewers sent requests for information or prayers, or
with good wishes for the pope. ``In the first two weeks we got
4,000 letters,'' Sister Zoebelein said. ``It surprised everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortable with the system's inability to respond to such
e-mail, the Vatican suspended operations at the site for 18 months.
The site reappeared on Easter Sunday 1997, without an address for
corresponding by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican was able to contain costs by relying in part on
donations from computer suppliers. The system servers are from
Digital Equipment and the desktops are from Compaq. IBM is
sponsoring a $3 million project to digitize manuscript
illustrations from the Vatican library, which could ultimately be
accessible on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is not designed to make money. The only advertisement
is for a CD of the pope's prayers and homilies, ``Abba Pater,''
which was released by Sony Classical in March.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Luigi Salimbeni, an associate responsible for computer
technology, said that Michael, the server named for the
sword-wielding archangel, served as a firewall against hackers.
Sister Zoebelein added: ``If we say, `God is love,' we don't want
someone putting in, `God is not love.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Zoebelein said the Vatican commitment to the site ``is a
credit to several people, including the holy father, who recognized
its potential.'' Pope John Paul himself does not use a computer,
though all the members of his staff do. The pope has yet to visit
the Web site offices. ``We are still waiting,'' Sister Zoebelein
said, adding that the head of the papal government, Angelo Cardinal
Sodano, under whose authority the site falls, had come twice.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges Sister Zoebelein now faces go well beyond
expanding the site's six areas _ documents relating to the popes of
this century, the church administration, the Vatican news service
and materials from the Vatican library, the museums and the papal
archives. Plans involve expanding in the next six to eight months
the range of languages _ the site is now accessible in English,
Italian, Spanish, French, German and Portuguese, though not all
documents are available in all six _ to include Arabic and Chinese.
``Technically, this is very difficult,'' she said, ``but the church
has such difficulties in Arab countries, and our logs show that a
lot of Chinese access the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Zoebelein also wants the site to offer live audio and
video of events during next year's Jubilee, when millions of
pilgrims are expected in Rome for special liturgical celebrations
of the millennium. Already fiber optic cable links to Vatican
Television are in place. ``We want to make every key event
available,'' Sister Zoebelein said, ``and that is a major
investment in time, equipment and bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Celli, the sense of the Vatican's commitment to the project
is to ``keep the Holy See in a dialogue with the world, to offer
what we have.'' The Vatican's rich cultural heritage, he added,
reflected ``the history of humanity. Offering this helps humanity
to regain its meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Zoebelein agreed. ``People ask, `Why is a sister doing
this?' '' she said. ``Well, technology has to have a spiritual
dimension.''

 FESTIVAL REVIEW: CHOREOGRAPHIC VILLAGES FROM AROUND THE GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In its earliest years, the American Dance
Festival offered a place and a time to work to pioneers of American
modern dance. The summer dance festival, now on the campus of Duke
University, is today best known for its revivals of modern-dance
classics by black choreographers and for its encouragement of dance
students and choreographers from around the world. The focus of the
festival's latter involvement is the annual ``International
Choreographers'' program of commissioned works created during the
festival with student dancers as performers.
</P>
<P>
   All of this year's premieres, presented Tuesday night at the
Reynolds Industries Theater at Duke, tended too often not to let
the viewer in on their secrets. All three pieces, created by
Chinese, Russian and American-Israeli choreographers, needed more
shape and editing. Intriguingly, each work was about a village or
community.
</P>
<P>
   The village was a cosmic one in ``The Call of the Wild,'' a
piece for 13 dancers by Ma Bo, a member of the Guangdong Modern
Dance Company of China, and Li Han Zhong, who directs the Beijing
Modern Dance Company. Set to turbulent music by Vangelis Mask that
is interspersed with passages of silence, ``The Call of the Wild''
has a suggestion of a plot having to do, presumably, with
regression to a primitive state.
</P>
<P>
   The dance opens with a striking tableau. A man (Layard Thompson)
stands with his back to the audience in a pool of white light on a
darkish stage. Watched by a motionless, expressionless group of
black-clad men and women, he slowly sheds his black suit coat and
pants, red tie, white shirt and shoes until he is dressed only in a
flesh-colored dance belt. Soon he is crawling like a baby to the
back of the stage, setting in motion his rescue by a woman, their
return with another woman as a nude-looking family and the slow
transformation of the others to similar nakedness and childlike
motion. Small subplots rise to the surface and disappear, to
unfathomable purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, ``The Call of the Wild'' is also a stylized dance full
of strong stage patterns that and disappear, to unfathomable
purpose. Happily, ``The Call of the Wild'' is also a stylized dance
full of strong stage patterns that recall choral and symphonic
dances choreographed in Europe in the 1930s. The somewhat robotic
movement has a diamond-hard edge that is dramatic in itself. The
stark lighting and costumes were designed by David Ferri and Sahar
Javedani respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants crudely lumber, lope and trot through the village of
Tatyana Baganova's sprawling, haunting ``Crows,'' a dance for 11
men and women. Their feet jabber across the stage as if driven by
the tumultuous, folk-tinged excess and eventual cacophony of the
score by Mikhail Alperin. Waiting for spring weather that may never
come, they revert to strange primitive behavior, inventing dark
rituals moment by moment.
</P>
<P>
   Two women sit motionless in swings that seem to have frozen in
place. Strings and ribbons spool out from mouths. The village women
form a witches' circle around a bare tree. The men tie their long
hair to the branches so that it fans out and drapes like thick,
gray cobwebs or long-faded decorations. A man and a woman bite at
opposite ends of a carrot protruding from the woman's mouth, moving
toward each other for a stumbling grope that is both sensuous and
funny. And back and forth the villagers go, in long skeins of
clotted processionals from one side of the stage to the other, the
bleak cries of loons and other birds echoing around them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a psychic landscape, painted perhaps by Chagall for the
introspective, bland-colored '90s. Ms. Baganova, a performer and
choreographer with the Provincial Dances Company of Ekaterinburg,
was assisted by Ravil Galimov. The moody lighting was by Ferri. The
drab costumes were by Ms. Javedani and the set by Ms. Baganova.
</P>
<P>
   The community in Barak Marshall's ``And as the Rooster Crowed
the Green Bride Floated through the Village Square,'' set to
atmospheric traditional Romanian music and a score by Margalit
Oved, perches cheerfully between old and new custom. Episodes fly
by, as they do in Ms. Baganova's piece, held together by the
ranting of the eccentric village storyteller and historian, played
by Ms. Oved, herself a noted Yemenite dancer and choreographer, and
Marshall's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The women rule here, as Marshall announces with a comical first
image of babushka-wrapped gossipers with attitude. They work hard,
but they also party in days full of hectic activity. In brief,
imaginative vignettes, a bride (Theresa Hardy) smokes incessantly
and a young girl (Ariane Malia Reinhart) joins in an elder's
prayers unwillingly and with suspicious innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster (Adrienne Longenecker) lifts her skirt over
her head, half shyly and half slyly exposing herself. Chickens are
fed, their tail feathers and combs suggested by spread fans. The
villagers drift into a dreamlike nighttime dance. And a man (Jordi
Gali) wheels through a tantalizingly brief solo filled with soft,
billowy staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The text was by Ms. Oved and Kafka, the lighting by Jeff Dodson
and the set by Marshall, who designed the costumes with Ms.
Javedani.

Citizen,'' told a news conference that he would vote against anyone
who campaigned on the theme of keeping everything ``just like it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he hoped candidates for office would outline
ways to ``build on the progress of the last six years and go beyond
it _ and not adopt a completely different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is weighing a possible Senate campaign from New
York. Gore is seeking the Democratic nomination for president in
2000 to cap two terms as Clinton's vice president and 16 years as a
member of the House and Senate from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has my friendship and my support,'' Clinton said. ``But I
also think that it's a mixed blessing, as you say, because people
want to see any vice president out there on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would do ``whatever I am asked to do basically''
to ``try to be helpful'' to both Mrs. Clinton and Gore in their
respective campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said his greatest contribution to their campaigns
would be to ``continue to be a good president and take care of our
country,'' adding: ``I don't feel myself winding down, I feel
myself keying up. I want to do more. I want to try to make sure
that I give the American people as much as I can every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that Gore already has gone beyond Clinton
administration policies to propose an intensified federally-funded
campaign against cancer, universal pre-kindergarten schooling for
America's children and tax breaks for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has offered ``interesting ideas about how you build on the
progress the country's made the last six-and-a-half years,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his sarcastic derision of the campaign slogan
of ``compassionate conservatism'' used by Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   `I was just having a little fun,'' Clinton said. ``If we don't
have any laughs, it's going to be a very tedious struggle between
now and November of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton challenged Bush to be more specific on his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to everyone, you know, use whatever slogans you
want, but tell us where you stand,'' Clinton said, adding that Gore
``has done the best job of telling the American people what he
would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered his most enthusiastic personal endorsement for
his wife as she weighs a prospective Senate bid from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady would bring a unique perspective to the
100-member Senate, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great thing for the country _ not only
because of what I owe her, but because (of) what she knows and how
she's lived and what she's done,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean it's very unusual to find somebody like that, who has
that much knowledge and background and passion all packed into one
place,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Mrs. Clinton's loyalty to him during the
sex-and-cover-up scandal involving former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. The president was impeached by the House but acquitted by
the Senate.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had never known anyone ``who was a more
effective, more consistently committed, completely passionate
public citizen'' than his wife of 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in response to a question, said he didn't have ``any
idea'' whether he too might someday seek elective office such as a
Senate seat from Arkansas in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say that I love this job. I love it _ even on the
bad days,'' Clinton said. ``Will I miss a lot of the things about
this job? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution restricts a president to two terms in
office, leaving an ex-president ``to go find something else to do
with his life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has its rhythms,'' Clinton said, adding: ``The people
that are most satisfied and most happy in life take the rhythms of
life and make the most of them instead of sitting around moping and
wishing the rhythms were something other than they are.''

BOOK TALK: CAMPAIGNING AT THE BOOKSHELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ These days, when a presidential candidate throws his
hat into the ring, there is often a book attached to the brim.
Unfortunately for the cause of public debate, most of these works
are about as naked as a hand or a bald head in their obviousness.
</P>
<P>
   This year the unseemly early start of the campaign has already
produced the promise of four books by candidates. George W. Bush
has written what his publisher calls a ``statement about his life
and politics,'' which will be in bookstores in December. John
McCain will weigh in in September. The campaign positions of Steve
Forbes, the publisher, have been promised in book form in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle's book, ``Worth Fighting For'' (Word Publishing), is
on sale, and not surprisingly, in keeping with the annals of the
the former vice president, it immediately touched off controversy.
The candidate was disappointed that Random House turned down the
book, and said the rejection was a result of some sort of liberal
culture police guarding the corridors of the publishing house. For
some reason, no culture police spooked McCain because Random House
is the senator's publisher. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's comments did raise an interesting question: Must a
publisher believe ideologically in the political point of view of a
book to publish it? The answer is no, but not a simple no.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing is a business, and most publishers most of the time
will publish a book that they believe will sell, dogma be damned.
Perhaps that is a misanthropic way to examine book making. But
within that cynic's box is the idea that for the book to sell, it
must be written by someone who has something fresh and interesting
to say, which could attract readers. High-profile figures who in
times past generated intrigue with their messages but now have
nothing new to add simply would not appeal to readers, and
generally publishers don't care about their ideology. They don't
want old, familiar stuff on their lists.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Godoff, president and editor in chief of the Random House
imprint, turned down Quayle's book in a letter to his agent, Morton
Janklow, in which she wrote: ``Mr. Quayle's arguments will set his
agenda squarely before the American people. The proposal is well
thought through. The trouble is I just don't want to be a party to
the promulgation of ideas I disagree with so profoundly. In the
end, I think the best publishing is done without reservation. Best,
Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   That letter was reprinted in Quayle's book after the book was
purchased by Word, a Christian publishing house. Ms. Godoff's
comments took the discussion a step beyond whether Quayle's book,
which outlines his proposals for what he considers would be a
return to American values, is a viable read. ``Other publishers
turned down the book, but I was the only one dope enough to put it
in writing,'' Ms. Godoff said with a bit of a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Quayle book was rejected by Free Press, a Simon &AMP; Schuster
imprint, which until recently was identified almost solely with
publishing politically conservative serious nonfiction. Quayle's
previous book, his second, ``Standing Firm'' (HarperCollins), was a
best seller in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing, like so many other things, is about fire and ice.
What Ms. Godoff's letter points up is that as bottom-line as the
business is, giving a book a successful life is also about
publishing with passion. A publisher and an editor must have the
intensity for a manuscript to motivate the house's troops, its top
executives, its marketers, its sales representatives and, finally,
the bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The culture police did not disarm Ms. Godoff's gusto for
publishing McCain's book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' written with
Mark Salter, although the senator is most certainly a conservative
Republican. That is because the Arizona senator's manuscript is
considered a ``book book,'' about his family and faith and military
tradition, and not merely a campaign tract. (Bush's book, ``A
Charge to Keep'' (William Morrow), will be a combination life story
and presidential platform.)
</P>
<P>
   What was interesting in checking with publishers about the
subject of this column was the unanimity of their belief that
ideology ran far second to actually having something to say,
whatever the political beliefs of the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Osnos, the publisher of Public Affairs books, said: ``I
draw the line on books that I find offensive or silly or clearly
phony, thrown together by some politician's administrative aide.
But I don't only publish books I agree with. You do have to have
faith in the book, even if you don't agree with the message. In the
process of working on a book, there has to be a lot of chemistry;
if you don't believe in the book, you're not going to be there for
the chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course a lot of silly books are published every year.
Nonetheless, when it comes to serious nonfiction, that principle of
saying something generally holds. Alfred Regnery, president of
Regnery Publishing, which produces nonfiction and biographies that
are usually but not always by and about politically conservative
writers and subjects, said that he rejected lots of books by
conservatives ``because the writers don't know what they're talking
about, or they're not able to write what they are trying to write,
or are replowing old ground.'' Regnery is publishing Forbes' book.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Elizabeth Macguire, editorial director of Free
Press, said, ``We have to be convinced that the author has
something important to say, and we'll often embrace the contrarian
thinker.'' Her authors include William J. Bennett and Robert Novak
on the right, but also liberals like Michael Eric Dyson, an
African-American, who is writing on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and Michael Warner, a radical gay scholar who argues a ``sort
of antigay marriage point of view,'' she said, ``that gays should
not try to be mainstream. Many people here disagreed with that. If
you don't embrace a book, really believe you produced with the
author a good book, it doesn't work. That doesn't have much to do
with ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sterling, the president and publisher of Henry Holt, said
that ``there has to be serious consideration of whether a book we
want to publish will sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's right or left politically. You have
to feel confident when you sign up a book that it's by someone who
has something fresh to say. Someone may have a high public profile,
but if there's nothing fresh being said, why do the book? There
will likely be no audience.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which could lead one to conclude that in the dos-a-dos of
publishing's square dance, sometimes what is good for the counting
house may actually be good for writing as well. And it was pretty
gutsy for Ms. Godoff to put in a letter what everyone else said in
a phone call.

HOPES CRASHED WITH PLANE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release July 29)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our new neighbor called last weekend to ask what neighborhood
activities were available for children, since her grandchildren
were visiting in August.
</P>
<P>
   I told her about the pool, the playground and the local buffet
pizza joint.
</P>
<P>
   Then the conversation turned to John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings up so many feelings in me,'' she said. ``My grown
son died a few years ago of leukemia, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes her son had developed his leukemia, which doctors
tied to radiation overexposure, while digging ditches for the
military near an atomic testing site. He was in his 30s, and was
just beginning to make his mark as an international model, when the
disease hit.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about another retired couple in the neighborhood,
whose grown son had been killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these young men just try to do too much, too fast,''
she said. ``It's as if the world is theirs, and nothing can happen
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Para-sailing, hang gliding, jet skis, fast boats, sports cars
and traveling swiftly across countries and continents has claimed
more than a few privileged young adults.
</P>
<P>
   When news broadcasts about the tragedy turned to the details,
this undercurrent was there: JFK Jr. was limping when he got on his
plane from an injured ankle, visibility was low, he wasn't
qualified to fly with instruments, few relatives would fly with
him.
</P>
<P>
   To take risks, we seem to be saying, is to court disaster.
Especially for a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his family history, you'd think he'd have been a little
more careful,'' said my neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not about to condemn JFK Jr. for his free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of getting his pilot's license, he had said in
interviews, was to be able to get away whenever and wherever he
wanted. Wanting to sometimes fly away seems quite understandable
for a child who has been in the media's eye since playing under his
father's presidential desk.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up seeing images of John-John and hearing about the
Kennedy mystique.
</P>
<P>
   His father had been assassinated the year I was born. My
mother's name was Jacqueline as well, and with the logic of a
preschooler, I thought that might mean that we were related
somehow. My family _ both sides _ were yellow dog Democrats, which
meant the Kennedy clan was our own vision of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   As I went on to college, and JFK Jr. failed the bar twice, I
took heart in his good-natured optimism that he would pass it
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was named ``Sexiest Man Alive'' by People Magazine,
his name was bantered about on Seinfeld, and ``George'' emerged
from the morass of New York magazine offices, I thought he had
finally made it as a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps JFK Jr. would have matured into political service.
Perhaps his children would have carried on the genetic chain of
Kennedy charm and charisma. Whatever the future would have held has
disappeared into the chilly waters off Martha's Vineyard.

FRIENDS RAISE MONEY TO FREE PROTESTER FROM FEDERAL PRISON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A woman imprisoned past her scheduled
release date, because she refused to pay a $2,000 fine, was freed
Wednesday after friends came up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Rumpf, a New Yorker and a two-decade veteran of
left-wing protests around the nation, was released Wednesday
afternoon from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, prison after
serving three days more than her one-year sentence for defacing
government property in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and fellow activist Martin Sheen, who met Rumpf in jail in
1984, arrived in Fort Worth this week to make a number of
appearances with her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumpf refused to sign a form promising to pay the court-imposed
fine, a condition of her release. She said that she is indigent and
that she objected to paying the government on conscientious
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not tell them not to do it,'' she said of her friends.
``They very much wanted me home. ... It's time to let go. If people
are intervening, I'm really powerless to do anything in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumpf, 47, and four other protesters were convicted of
spray-painting ``School of Shame'' on the sign in front of the U.S.
Army's School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., which trains
Latin American soldiers in military tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The school has long been a target of a coalition of groups, most
notably the Catholic Church, which believe that the school is
responsible for teaching Latin American troops how to abuse people.
The school contends that it has helped move Latin America toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who has also protested at the school, has appeared
throughout Fort Worth and Dallas this week, speaking about
everything from violence and the military to women's prisons and
drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he addressed young offenders in Tarrant
County's ``drug court.'' Sheen's son, Charlie, has a history of
drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the elder Sheen addressed about 30 people who gathered
at Fort Worth attorney Darrell Keith's office to raise money to
investigate medical conditions at the federal women's prison, which
is adjacent to Naval Air Station Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot about family values in this country,'' he said
afterward in a wide-ranging discussion about his views. ``Is
nonviolence a family value?'' &QL;

CASTOR TO LEAD MOVEMENT FOR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Va.)  (js) 
 By JULIA FERRANTE   
 The Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ If she had planned every step of her career, Betty
Castor could not have chosen a better path to be named president of
the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a board
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very delighted,'' said spokeswoman Paula
Shoecraft. ``It was like she was just led to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Castor, a former teacher, state senator and Florida state
education commissioner, announced Tuesday that she would resign as
president of the University of South Florida after five years of
leading the Tampa-based state university. She will start her new
job Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief executive officer of the national board,
Castor will be responsible for leading a national movement for
teacher development and recognition. She will be in charge of the
organization's $36 million budget, 50 staff members and offices in
Michigan and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1987, the teaching standards board was part of a
reform movement to recognize accomplished teachers and raise
standards in the profession by assessing teachers in the classroom,
through lesson plans and through tests.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching standards certification is comparable to that of
certified public accountants and board-certified physicians, who
must past tests and meet certain criteria to be recognized within
their profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the teaching profession, it has been
written down what it means to be an excellent teacher,'' Shoecraft
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 teachers have earned the certification.
Shoecraft said 37 states and 129 school districts offer incentives
to teachers who achieve board certification.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, for example, the state pays 90 percent of the
application fee and offers salary increases to those who gain
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Riordan, Castor's special assistant at the University of
South Florida, said Castor will travel frequently to establish ties
with legislators and create new board offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission they have given her is to take the number of
teachers from a few thousand to 100,000,'' Riordan said.

WASHINGTON STATE WEIGHS BENEFITS, COSTS OF GROWING GAMING
INDUSTRY

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CENTER, Wash. _ Cheryl Bartow, a 37-year-old mother of four,
pushed back from a blackjack table at the Double Down Saloon, one
of four mini-casinos that crowd this city's two-block-long
downtown. She scanned the dimly lit room, grabbed her Pepsi and
headed for what she hoped would be a luckier table.
</P>
<P>
   Just a half-mile away, scores of children tossed balls, fielded
grounders and took batting practice on three meticulously kept
baseball fields. Bubba Myers, a 9-year-old catcher, shortstop and
outfielder, waited patiently for his mother to pick up after
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Pounding his mitt, young Bubba had no idea he would enjoy _ at
least indirectly _ a cut of the cash left by Bartow on Double
Down's table. Gambling taxes help maintain the 12-acre park where
Little Leaguers play.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling money, in fact, is sprinkled almost everywhere in this
southwestern Washington town of about 1,500, near the Oregon border
_ in widened streets, new sidewalks and more police. The
mini-casinos support nearly half the city's $4.4 million budget;
employ a work force equal to one-fourth of its population; and
create enough economic activity that Jo Ann Currey keeps her
sandwich shop open late on weekends, well-stocked with the black
cherry ice cream the gamblers inexplicably prefer.
</P>
<P>
   La Center presents a striking example not only of the growth of
gambling in Washington, but also how deeply it is woven in the
social and economic fabric of the state. While much attention has
focused on the spread of mini-casinos, they, in fact, represent
only a part of an industry that touches almost every facet of
community life.
</P>
<P>
   Washington residents such as Bartow can gamble at the corner
store or corner tavern; at the Elks Lodge, Moose club or Friends of
Eagles; on the tables at mini-casinos or the slot-like machines of
tribal casinos. Their losses will support schools and social
services; playing fields and professional stadiums; for-profit
businesses and non-profit charities.
</P>
<P>
   All told, legal gambling in Washington, including the lottery,
generates nearly $2 billion a year in revenues, employs at least
15,000 people and exclusively funds three state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good bet gambling will continue to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998, net receipts for all gambling increased
33 percent, according to the state Gambling Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A leading gambling industry journal estimates that within three
years more than 10,000 video gaming machines, similar to slots,
will operate in tribal casinos. The machines alone will generate a
half-billion dollars in revenues, says International Gambling and
Wagering Business.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this steady expansion, most visibly in the form
of mini-casinos, lawmakers, local officials and residents are now
asking whether gambling has spread too far. But the real question
might be this: Is it too late to even worry about it?
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a state Senate committee will try to answer that
and other questions in hearings on the growth, impact and future of
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Margarita Prentice, D-Seattle and chairwoman of the panel,
said reining in gambling now could mean closing charities, business
failures and loss of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep coming to us to level the playing field, but all
they've done is ratchet it up,'' said Prentice, adding that she
doesn't believe the Legislature will allow further expansion. ``I
know how we got here. But I don't know how to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question facing policy-makers is not whether people will
gamble, but where and how. Non-profit groups are lobbying for
electronic gaming machines, and some mini-casino owners say they'd
like them, too. Some fear so-called convenience gambling _
stand-alone machines in neighborhood stores, taverns and other
businesses _ could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears have led at least eight Washington communities to
impose temporary bans on mini-casinos, and at least half that many
ban them altogether. Permanent bans were most recently imposed in
Gig Harbor and unincorporated Pierce County.
</P>
<P>
   La Center got into gambling in the mid-1980s, when the
down-and-out logging town of less than 400 welcomed card rooms as a
way to generate desperately needed taxes, jobs and economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   La Center Mayor Elizabeth Cerveny said the original card rooms,
where players rented chairs by the half-hour, primarily attracted
professional gamblers and mostly older men. Since converting to
mini-casinos, under a 1997 state law, the crowds have become
bigger, with more women and younger gamblers, Cerveny said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartow, of Vancouver, has been there for each turn of the
ratchet in Washington gambling. She's played bingo, bought lottery
scratch cards now and then, and celebrated special occasions with
her husband at nearby tribal casinos. She discovered the Double
Down mini-casinos in May after receiving advertising in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to snare recreational gamblers like Bartow has driven
the escalation of gambling in Washington. Since the Legislature
authorized a variety of modest activities in 1973, gambling has
proliferated, largely driven by competition among Native Americans,
commercial operators, non-profit groups and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, it seems, is always upping the ante. Card rooms
upgraded to mini-casinos to stem losses to tribal casinos. Tribal
casinos responded by adding slot-like machines. Charitable
operators, losing bingo customers to casinos and mini-casinos, now
want their own electronic games.
</P>
<P>
   The state lottery has not remained above the fray. Since it
began in 1982, the lottery has grown from one to six games, selling
tickets nearly 20 hours a day and paying $6.5 million a year to
promote its games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is competition,'' said lottery spokeswoman Heidi
Hutchinson. ``We're all competing for entertainment dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition today encompasses more than a dozen tribal
casinos and four dozen mini-casinos, as well as nearly 400 bingo
halls, 2,300 pull-tab sellers and 3,400 lottery outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal casinos often lead the way in expansion. The Suquamish,
for example, plan to lead a new round of casino growth by turning
their Clearwater Casino near Poulsbo in Kitsap County into a
resort, complete with the state's first casino-related 150-room
hotel and 10,000-square-foot convention center.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Squaxin Island Tribe saw net receipts at its casino
near Shelton in Mason County fall 25 percent between 1996 and 1998
because of increased competition, the tribe installed nearly 100
slot-like machines, and plans still more.
</P>
<P>
   Non-profit groups face similar situations. Whatcom County Crisis
Services, which supports 35 percent of its budget with gambling,
recently cut its hot line after a decade-long slide in bingo
income. Kathleen Marshall, the agency's director, said non-profits
should be able to offer the same card games and machines as
mini-casinos and tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a sort of leveling of the playing field,''
Marshall said. ``People are going to gamble anyway. Why not have it
do some good?''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission
said this
</P>
<P>
   expansion is typical in states with legal gambling.

   LA CENTER, Wash.: legal gambling
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past 25 years, the report said, gambling has spread
piecemeal with little attention to the cumulative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the broad impacts of gambling on society, on the
tenor of our communities' lives, on the weakest among us?''
commissioners asked in the report. ``How can one ruined life be
compared with the benefits provided another?''
</P>
<P>
   At La Center's City Park, it's hard to see anything but
benefits. An employee from the city's expanded Public Works
Department steers a lawn tractor past tennis and basketball courts
built with gambling taxes. Next door is the high school, where the
band uniforms were donated by mini-casino owners, and science
classes take field trips to a wetlands park, acquired and
maintained with the help of gambling taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the tennis court is empty but four teens dash and weave
through a half-court basketball game. A shot clangs off the rim.
Two battle, shoulder-to-shoulder, for the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Double Down, it's recreation of a far different
sort.
</P>
<P>
   Bartow, of Vancouver, needs only to flick a finger to get
another card in blackjack. She plays maybe once or twice a week and
limits her losses to no more than $30.
</P>
<P>
   When she first discovered the mini-casinos, Bartow played as
many as five times a week _ ``a little too much,'' she admitted.
Once, she added, she lost more money than she should have.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone in that experience.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling debate in Washington centers on the question of
economic rewards vs. hard-to-measure social costs. The spread of
mini-casinos to more than 20 communities has intensified the
debate, exposing residents to a grander scale of gambling and
bigger concerns about its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Dollars illustrate the change. In 1996, the year before the
Legislature allowed card rooms to offer casino games like
blackjack, the highest grossing operator in the state reported
revenues of $1.2 million. The year after the mini-casino law, the
top operator grossed nearly $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, card room taxes in 1998 quadrupled in Tukwila,
tripled in Shoreline and doubled in unincorporated King County. In
Spokane, where the state licensed six mini-casinos, card room taxes
jumped from less than $150,000 to nearly $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   In La Center, gambling taxes also doubled in 1998. Collections
this year are running twice that pace, more than $500,000 in the
first three months alone.
</P>
<P>
   La Center officials say mini-casinos not only changed the scale
of gambling in their city, but also its character. What were once
low-key, ``country bumpkin'' operations are now professionally
managed, with tight security and aggressive advertising, said Mayor
Cerveny.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny traces that change to the arrival last year of Michels
Development, a Nevada-based company which primarily develops and
manages tribal casinos. Michels owns the Double Down Saloon and the
Palace in La Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of just opening the doors and watching the money roll
in are gone,'' said Matt Daly, who oversees Michels' five
Washington mini-casino operations. ``You have to run tight games,
and we believe we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Tim Hopkins said Michels and their competitors have
largely succeeded. Although the weekend influx of mini-casino
patrons doubles the city's population, Hopkins said crime has not
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Most players come from the Portland-Vancouver area. Some are
regulars, like Bartow, but some just drop in for lunch and a few
hands once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun,'' Bartow said. ``You don't like to lose, but
you like it when you win. And you make friends, who are rooting for
you to win.''
</P>
<P>
   At the city park, shouts of encouragement echoed as Bubba's mom,
Robin Myers, chatted with a friend. She said she is raising her
five children with few worries about the mini-casinos, which are
isolated from the rest of town at the bottom of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see any gamblers, you don't see the gambling side of
it,'' she said. ``I've never seen any real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But 15 miles down the highway in Vancouver, the problems are
visible. Patricia, a member of Gambler's Anonymous, said average
attendance at two weekly meetings in the city has jumped from about
five to more than 15 in less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The different perspectives in La Center and Vancouver illustrate
the difficulty in gauging social costs. Local and national
statistics show no increase in crime near gambling centers, but
they have yet to measure divorce, bankruptcy and domestic violence
that research shows follows some gamblers home.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey commissioned by the state Lottery estimates that
up to 5 percent of Washington residents have serious gambling
problems, a rate similar to national estimates. While the survey
showed the percentage of problem gamblers unchanged from five years
ago, population growth might mask an increase in overall numbers,
said Gary Hanson, executive director of the Washington State
Council on Problem Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal information supports Hanson's belief. Calls to the
council's hot line have tripled since 1993, while Gamblers
Anonymous meetings statewide have grown from a few to nearly two
dozen, Hanson said. In Spokane, Gamblers Anonymous officials say
their services have expanded from one weekly meeting averaging five
people, to three averaging 15 each.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials say they recognize the risk of
compulsive gambling, and they contribute to assistance programs.
Since 1993, for example, the lottery has provided about $600,000
for compulsive gambling programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeanne Benson, a recovering compulsive gambler in Spokane,
is unimpressed. The lottery, she said, spends 10 times more on
advertising in one year that it has contributed to programs in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government,'' she said, ``is as addicted to gambling revenues
as much as compulsive gamblers are addicted to gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may not seem that way to those involved in the growth of
gambling in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling was far from the mind of Robin Myers as she corralled
young Bubba in La Center one recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But its impact surrounded her: in the ball fields where her
children practice; in the tennis court, where her daughters play
badminton; and in the basketball court, where Bubba hopes to learn
the game.
</P>
<P>
   She had left her car in a parking lot, built, too, with gambling
taxes.

`SOUTHERN CULTURES' MAGAZINE IS ON THE SKIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BEN STEELMAN   
 Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The South may rise again, but for Southern
Cultures, it had better happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another year and a half, we will face a decision about
whether to continue publishing Southern Cultures,'' the editors
write in a note in the Chapel Hill-based quarterly's summer issue.
``Unless our subscription base has substantially increased,
eliminating the need for the subsidy we have been receiving, we
shall probably have to close up shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cultures' publisher, the Center for the Study of the
American South, is facing serious budget cuts, like other agencies
of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Circulation has
slipped below 2,000 per issue, according to co-editor John Shelton
Reed, and needs to rise above that level if the journal is to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   If Southern Cultures goes the way of the Old Confederacy, it
would be a tragedy for readers and not just Southerners. The
magazine remains one of the most sprightly and enjoyable of
academic publications, allying history, literature and the social
sciences in a coordinated study of a fascinating region.
</P>
<P>
   Advertised as ``required reading for Southerners and those who
wonder what makes the South the South,'' the magazine had its
origins five years ago, in the flurry of interest that followed the
publication of ``The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture.'' The
enormous volume, released by the UNC Press, sold more than 80,000
copies _ small 'taters for a John Grisham, but pretty amazing for a
piece of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, co-editor Harry Watson and others involved in the project
thought those sales might signal enough interest to support a
cross-disciplinary journal, one that would be read by ordinary
folks as well as professors and grad students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had in mind was sort of an academically informed
conversation about the South, but not one written for the
specialist,'' said Reed, a Kenan professor of sociology at Chapel
Hill and author of such books as ``Southern Folk Plain and Fancy''
and ``My Tears Spoiled My Aim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned out to be harder than we thought,'' he added,
``getting writers to loosen up from their footnotes. Of course,
academics are the only people crazy enough to write for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Southern Cultures remains a lot more fun than your
old social studies textbook.
</P>
<P>
   The summer issue, for example, includes a fine essay from
novelist Doris Betts on the meaning of the ``Piedmont'' and how the
foothills region differs from other parts of the South. Historian
Jane Turner Censer delivers an intriguing study of late-Victorian
romance novels in which Southern belles paired off with dashing
Yankees as a metaphor for sectional reconciliation. Reed delivers
an appreciative review of Tom Wolfe's Atlanta novel, ``A Man in
Full,'' comparing it with Robert Altman's film ``Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reviews recordings, museum exhibitions, videos
and films of regional interest.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, as the magazine goes, the summer issue is fairly tame.
The spring issue featured several scholars dissecting ``Gone With
the Wind.'' Historian Drew Gilpin Faust (``Mothers of Invention'')
noted that Scarlett O'Hara was a ``rebel against the Rebellion,''
chafing against the accepted role of widowhood and trading with the
hated carpetbaggers. And Grace Elizabeth Hale of the University of
Virginia dissected Tony Horwitz's best-selling ``Confederates in
the Attic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better stuff may be coming. According to Watson, a Chapel
Hill historian, the fall issue will contain a ``love letter'' from
novelist Pat Conroy (``Prince of Tides'') to Thomas Wolfe, the text
of a previously unpublished letter from black author Zora Neale
Hurston (``Their Eyes Were Watching God'') to William Faulkner, and
an anthropology graduate student's hysterical study of sorority
rush at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   (In the interest of disclosure, I must note that Southern
Cultures published a book review I wrote in an early issue. Since
then, however, the magazine has substantially improved.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of material in the foreseeable future. ``The
South will still be here in the next millennium,'' Reed said. ``It

   TUKWILA, Wash. _ Gambling gave Dany Sou a new life. It almost
destroyed Jeanne Benson's.
</P>
<P>
   Sou, a Cambodian refugee, ended 10 years of welfare dependence
when she found a job as a dealer at the Riverside Casino, a Tukwila
mini-casino. Benson, a Nevada native, began a slide
towardsfinancial ruin, isolation and despair when she stepped into
an Eastern Washington bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these women represent the two faces of
gambling, and the debate that surrounds its spread. For many,
gambling has proved an economic godsend that has not only created
jobs for people such as Sou, but revived local economies, saved
businesses and revitalized cities.
</P>
<P>
   For the few, it has been a living hell.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, 52, of Spokane, began playing bingo in 1986, shortly
after she moved to Eastern Washington. She had never gambled _ the
Nevada casinos that surrounded her as a kid never held any appeal _
but bingo seemed like a good way to meet people.
</P>
<P>
   Benson didn't even think of it as gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's grandmother plays bingo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But within six months, Benson was gambling compulsively. She did
whatever she could to get the time and money to play bingo. She
lied to friends, manipulated family, quit her job.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote bad checks. She borrowed money that she wouldn't pay
back. She hocked a $700 pearl necklace for $70, never bothering to
reclaim it. All told, Benson estimates she lost more than $80,000
before she found help in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose everything, but I rode the edge,'' Benson said.
``I started losing my spirit, losing my sense of humor, and after a
while, I felt dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about robbing. I thought about killing myself,'' she
said. ``If I hadn't found help, I shudder to think what I might
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson has not gambled since entering a 12-step program in 1993.
Today, she answers a hotline in Spokane, helps other gamblers, and
supports herself by renting out rooms in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her house needs a new roof and new windows, Benson said, but she
can't afford the repairs _ a reminder of what gambling cost her.
</P>
<P>
   But now freed of her compulsion, she says life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Life is also good for Sou, 33, who recently completed her first
year working at the Riverside Casino. The job, her only employment
since fleeing Cambodia in 1987, has meant financial independence
and self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have power,'' said Sou, who lives in Burien, south of
Seattle. ``I have a job. I have everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sou arrived in the United States without education or skills.
She had trouble learning English, adding another barrier to her
efforts to find work.
</P>
<P>
   She constantly applied for jobs, but no one would hire an
uneducated, unskilled immigrant. A single mother of two, she lived
on welfare benefits of about $500 a month, despairing that she
would ever work.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years on welfare, she learned about the Riverside from
a friend. The Riverside trained her, pays a living wage and
provides health insurance. Sou said she now takes home about $2,000
a month. Mini-casino owners say most dealers make $15 to $20 an
hour in wages and tips.
</P>
<P>
   The job, said Sou, has changed her life. She bought a car. She
pays for child care and can keep her children in new clothes. Her
English is improving as she spends more time with English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said proudly, her 13-year-old son has new respect for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strong,'' she said. ``I got a job, and my life is
really happy.''

 &HT;    PENTAGON RECRUITING BEES, COCKROACHES AND WASPS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drafted off the farm, a small parasitic wasp is
being trained to help the Pentagon search for land mines and
chemical and biological warfare agents, using capabilities that
normally help it find crop-hungry caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   At a U.S. Department of Agriculture research laboratory in
Tifton, Ga., entomologist Joe Lewis has shown that the wasp can be
taught to use its extraordinarily sensitive sense of smell to home
in on the faint TNT vapors given off by virtually all types of land
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) are intrigued by the thought that the free-ranging
insects could scout unfamiliar terrain for mines or other dangers
in areas where troops must be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The wasp research is being supported by a relatively new DARPA
program that also looks for ways to use the unique capabilities of
such creatures as cockroaches, honeybees, moths, lobsters and
lizards to perform military tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out a year ago to explore what kinds of things we could
learn from organisms and how they go about doing some fundamental
things,'' said Alan Rudolph, coordinator of the DARPA Controlled
Biological Systems program. ``We want to know how we could use that
information to construct, fabricate new capabilities for defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That may mean using the creatures like Lewis's wasps to map the
concentration and distribution of hazardous agents in hostile or
inaccessible environments, copying their techniques and abilities
in the design of machines and instruments, or even developing what
Rudolph calls ``biohybrids'' in which parts of an organism, such as
an insect's antennae, are spliced into a man-made device.
</P>
<P>
   Working with DARPA research grants, scientists at several
universities and government laboratories are studying a variety of
natural systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``One part of the program is copying nature, trying to
understand how natural or biological systems accomplish some
fundamental things important to their fitness and trying to harvest
that information into synthetic systems or hardware,'' Rudolph
said. ``We call this 'biomimetics,' mimicking nature.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, lobsters look pathetically helpless in one of those
holding tanks at seafood restaurants, but in the wild they are
remarkably capable creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph said that a lobster can stabilize itself and go where it
needs to go, even in a pounding surf. By studying the creature's
engineering, DARPA grantees at Northeastern University are
attempting to design lobster-imitating legged robots.
</P>
<P>
   Small lizards called geckos can climb a vertical surface at a
speed of more than a yard per second. Nobody knows how the gecko's
feet, which remain dry, stick like glue to the surface on which the
creature is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA aims to find out. A legged robot with a lobster's ability
to withstand a crashing surf and a gecko's ability to go up, down
and across just about any obstacle could be a handy piece of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's wasps parasitize a caterpillar whose various names
reflect the wide range of farm havoc it has caused. The corn
earworm, the tomato fruitworm, the cotton bollworm are all the same
destructive pest on different crops.
</P>
<P>
   Several species of the house fly-size wasps lay their eggs on
the caterpillar. The wasps' young devour it from the inside.
Lewis's research has been devoted for years to encouraging and
assisting the wasps, in order to hold the worm in check.
</P>
<P>
   To find the caterpillar, the wasp responds to chemical distress
signals given off by a plant that is under attack. Since different
plants give off different chemicals, nature has designed a smart
wasp that can learn a new scent and associate that scent with
either the presence of the caterpillar or nectar, on which the
adult wasps feed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and a collaborator, Agricultural Research Service
biologist James Tumlinson in Gainesville, Fla., have shown that in
exchange for a few sips of sweetened water, the versatile little
wasps will gladly follow practically any scent offered to them,
including those of vanilla, chocolate and TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can detect them at very low concentrations,'' Lewis said,
``and we really haven't found any compound yet that they can't
detect and be trained to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   One use may be to put the trained wasps in a container and
observe their behavior as the container is moved around an area of
suspected land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Because they move fast and collect just about anything that's
floating around in the air, honeybees may also be a powerful system
for scouting forbidding environments. DARPA is funding research by
scientists at the University of Montana at Missoula and Sandia
National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   A DARPA drawing imagines a bee with an electronic backpack and a
helmet that together make him look like a character dreamed up for
``Star Wars'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to track the insect as it forages for nectar.
If the insects can be trained to associate the smell of TNT with
sweetened water, then they may tend to visit plants that grow near
buried land mines and have taken up residues of the chemical
through their roots.
</P>
<P>
   Highly instrumented hives can then monitor and analyze the
coming and goings of individual bees and compare that data with the
kind of dust, soil and pollen they collect as they forage, said
University of Montana entomologist Jerry Bromenshenk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bees are like flying dust mops,'' Bromenshenk said. ``Wherever
they go, they pick up dust, airborne chemicals and other samples.
If it's out there, they'll find it and bring it back.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, microelectronic gear for echoing radar signals and
monitoring a bee's movements is a little too heavy for your typical
honeybee, Bromenshenk said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope it will be possible to miniaturize the equipment
further or even develop a spray-on substance that would allow
electronic monitoring of a hive full of bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this method works and it's reliable, you could foresee
giving people the green light to re-enter or farm large (mined)
areas based on bee sampling,'' said Sandia researcher Susan Bender.
``The beauty of this approach is that bees are indigenous to every
climate on Earth, and you don't need a million-dollar piece of
equipment and extensive training to use (them).''
</P>
<P>
   The International Red Cross has estimated that between 80
million and 120 million land mines are currently deployed in 70
countries, many of which are too poor to afford expensive
mine-detecting equipment. An estimated 60 people are killed or
maimed by land mines every day.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph said it is too soon to predict whether any of the
experiments will lead to relevant defense systems, although DARPA
is beginning to pick up signals that some of the country's largest
defense contractors would be interested in exploring some of the
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these systems are at a very fundamental stage of
discovery,'' said Rudolph. ``We've only been at this a year.''

APPLE SHRINKS ITS IMAC TO SIZE OF A NOTEBOOK

   How can Apple Computer top the phenomenal success of the iMac?
With an iMac to go, Apple's chief executive, Steve Jobs, said
Wednesday at the Macworld trade show in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The new iBook portable Macintosh, which will cost $1,599 when it
goes on sale in September, continues Apple's recent string of
impressive, innovative and colorful consumer computers. Besides
being visually striking _ it is shaped vaguely like a toilet seat
and comes in two colors, blueberry or tangerine _ the iBook is the
first portable computer to come with wireless data antennas built
in.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with an optional $99 plug-in card and a $299
``Airport'' base station that attaches to an Internet-connected
desktop computer, the iBook lets users browse the Net and handle
e-mail wirelessly, with a range of 150 feet. The 2.4-gigahertz
radio link operates at 11 megabits per second, about 10 times the
speed of most home networking products.
</P>
<P>
   At just under seven pounds, the iBook is heavier and larger than
some of Apple's business-class G3 Powerbook portables. However, it
has a flip-up handle that makes it easy to carry, like a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook has a full-size keyboard with a nice feel, a 12.1-inch
active-matrix color screen backed by 4 megabytes of video memory,
and a CD-ROM drive (DVD is not available). It comes with 32 MB of
system memory and a 3.2-gigabyte hard disk. The iBook has a 300-MHz
G3 processor, making it one of the fastest portables available, and
Apple says that it will run for 6 hours on a single battery charge.
</P>
<P>
   Its standard equipment includes a 56K modem, a single USB
peripheral port and a fast Ethernet port for those with a cable
modem, DSL line or other high-speed network.
</P>
<P>
   Apple expects the iBook to be popular with students, and the
Airport wireless network can handle as many as 10 iBooks
simultaneously through a single connection, making it ideal for
classrooms.

   NOVEL HEART-RATE-MONITOR BRA SHOWS POTENTIAL AS A LIFESAVER
</P>
<P>
   The soccer star Brandi Chastain's Nike bra is not the only
prototypical undergarment making the news this month. Kursty
Groves, 26, an industrial design engineering student at the Royal
College of Art in London, has invented a high-tech brassiere,
called the Techno Bra, that features a built-in heart-rate monitor,
wireless telephone and a Global Positioning System locator.
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like a novelty, the purpose is anything but
frivolous. Using all of its electronics, the Techno Bra can detect
a sudden increase in the wearer's cardiac rate from a
heart-pounding scare and then notify the police via a cellular
phone network while it provides an exact location of the incident
with the GPS device.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Groves, who also holds a degree in chemical engineering,
said that, in addition to combining her interests in new
technologies with concerns about vulnerability and protection, she
also wanted to bring a feminine aspect to the design. ``I feel with
a lot of design, it's aimed more at men because a lot of designers
are men.''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype was created by hand and contains a battery and a
stop button in its front clasp. The electronic parts are encased in
a 3-millimeter-thick layer of gel-like material that can be removed
for washing. The bra is eventually expected to be sold as a
security device but might have other uses as well; for example, it
might be used as a wearable monitor for people with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Groves is a design consultant and is working with companies
to bring her bra to market. ``It's all taking off,'' she said.

   WRAPAROUND SIGHT AND SOUND YOU CAN WEAR ON YOUR HEAD
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality continues to get a bit closer now that Sony
introduced a new version of its Glasstron. The product mixes a pair
of eyeglasses that simulate a 52-inch screen in front of the viewer
with a pair of headphones that provide sound.
</P>
<P>
   Any computer or television can provide the image that is seen on
the virtual screen. The product weighs 6.4 ounces and is being sold
for $900.
</P>
<P>
   If two shutters are left open to let light stream in from the
outside world, electronic images appear superimposed on top of the
physical world.
</P>
<P>
   The images can help the user cope with life by providing
reminders, hints or maybe a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Sony continues to explore ways to sell the technology.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Pepsi 400, held at the Daytona International
Speedway, the company provided 50 pairs of the enhanced glasses for
fans to use to get an in-car experience provided by a camera and
microphone mounted in a car. &QL;

   FROM 3COM, A NEW PALM PILOT, PRICED FOR THE LIMITED BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   With competition from Windows CE PDAs at one end and a spate of
new low-end knockoffs at the other, the Palm division of 3Com has
introduced a new version of the popular Palm Connected Organizer,
better known as the Palm Pilot. The new Palm IIIe, released this
week at a retail price of $229, is geared to the low end of the
market _ to people who want a PDA but balk at a $300-plus price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone needs all the expandability of the other
models,'' said Andrea Johnson, the IIIe's product manager. The new
unit uses the display of the IIIx, which is sharper and more
readable than the early version of the III model. And, while its
two megabytes of memory cannot be upgraded, the IIIe can use all
the third-party software that is the real key to the success of the
Palm line. There are thousands of programs available for the Palm
devices.
</P>
<P>
   One difference is that the new model isn't for users looking to
synchronize their PDAs with a desktop personal information manager
like Microsoft's Outlook or Symantec's ACT. The IIIe comes bundled
with 3Com's version of that, Palm Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   David Pogue, author of ``Palm Pilot: The Ultimate Guide,'' said
the IIIe was for holdouts. ``Palm's thinking seems to be: `We've
got 82 percent of the market. What are we doing wrong?''' he said.

   A NEW PLACE ON THE INTERNET TO EXPLORE SPACE'S WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 30th anniversary of the moon landing, no giant
steps were made into space but a small step was made on the Web.
Space.com, a new site devoted to the world beyond Earth, was
officially launched in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Space.com is the brainchild of Lou Dobbs, a former CNN executive
who has had a lifelong fascination with space. ``I used to watch
the early attempts to launch rockets and sit there and watch all
those Atlas rockets blow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day was also supposed to see the launching of a new shuttle
mission, the first to be commanded by a woman, Eileen Collins.
After the flight was delayed, Sally Ride, the first American woman
in space and a Space.com executive vice president, flew in from
Cape Canaveral for the Web site's party. ``At least I got to take
part in one successful launch today,'' Dr. Ride said.

   JOURNALIST'S MEMOIR CHRONICLES 40 YEARS OF COVERING CIVIL RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Earl Caldwell began his career as a reporter in the 1950s and
spent 40 years covering the civil rights movement for eight
newspapers, including The New York Times. Caldwell was the sole
reporter at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis when Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was murdered. His refusal to cooperate with government
surveillance of the Black Panthers set in motion in many states the
enactment of shield laws to ensure the protection of reporters'
sources. The Caldwell Journals, his memoir, is being presented on
line by the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education
(www.maynardije.org). The project includes the voices of Caldwell's
fellow black journalists _ a few of the 20 or so who were at major
news organizations in the '60s. Billed as a ``personal account of
the black journalists' movement,'' the Caldwell Journals also
provide an intimate view of recent American history.

ARMSTRONG DENIES LATES DRUG-CHARGE REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAU, France _ Usually the rider in the yellow jersey gets a lot
of attention simply because he is leading the Tour de France. But
that's not the case with Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this week, Armstrong met the press not just
to talk about his cycling, but to address drug charges that have
been leveled against him. Le Monde newspaper in Paris reported
Wednesday that traces of corticosteroids had shown up in
Armstrong's blood after he won the prologue.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong denied the charges and called Le Monde reporters
``vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Racing Union issued a report confirming that
traces of the drug were found, but not at a level to be considered
a positive test. The report also said Armstrong had a prescription
for the drug. Armstrong, who has held the yellow jersey since July
11, has been tested every day since then, along with the stage
winner and racers chosen at random. No rider has tested positive,
which would lead to his immediate expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's stage, which was won by Spaniard David
Etxebarria, Armstrong again accepted the yellow jersey, then
answered questions about the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was using the topical cream for saddle sore that showed up
traces in my urine of Day 2 but not Day 1,'' Armstrong said. ``Le
Monde is here for doping stories; we are here to race our bikes.
They are vultures. It's bad for me, bad for cycling, bad for the
Tour de France.''
</P>
<P>
   Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs
which are not classified as steroids, but are considered banned
substances unless prescribed by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was asked about an apparent discrepancy in comments he
made earlier in the week, when he said he's been on no medication
since his chemotherapy treatment for testicular cancer ended in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where a misunderstanding comes in,'' he said. ``When I
think of taking drugs, I think of a pill, an injection, or an
inhaler,'' he said. ``I don't consider a cream to be taking
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he understands the attention given to the issue
of drugs, which dominated last year's Tour. No rider tested
positive last year, but one team was caught with drugs in its car,
and other teams dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why there are more journalists here this year,
and why these stories are running,'' he said. ``I only wish that
people would be more responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was asked if has any message for cancer patients,
based on his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they say that stress causes cancer,'' he said. ``So
first of all, don't come to the Tour, and don't wear the yellow
jersey. My story is a medical miracle, there are no secrets. It's
of someone wanting to come back, and being told, `No way.' So my
message is that you have to believe in yourself, and fight, and
hold the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was a race Wednesday as the cyclists said
goodbye to the mountains for good. The 120-mile stage from
Lannemezan to Pau in the Pyrenees covered four peaks, all of which
are known for their steep grade (one averages 8.3 percent) and
narrow roads.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders snaked up one mountain pass, they rode into _ then
above _ the clouds before making the descent and seeing blue sky
again.
</P>
<P>
   Etxebarria, who took off with six others on the final climb,
edged the pack with a flat sprint into town, finishing at 5 hours
17 minutes 7 seconds. It was his second stage win. Armstrong, who
stayed near the front the whole way, came in 21 seconds later. He
still holds the overall lead by more than six minutes over Fernando
Escartin.
</P>
<P>
   With four days of flat racing ahead, the Tour is virtually over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were celebrating when we hit that last climb,'' said Postal
Service team manager Mark Gorski, who was following the race in the
team car. ``That was the last hurdle we had to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., finished two minutes back
to move up to 17th place overall. He and Kevin Livingston (39th)
are the top Americans behind Armstrong.

RUSSIAN CHURCH REMOVES BISHOP CHARGED WITH IMPROPRIETIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In an unusual disciplinary action, the Russian Orthodox
Church has removed a bishop who has been widely accused of
corruption and sexual impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said Wednesday that Bishop Nikon, 39, was being
``retired'' from his Yekaterinburg diocese for provoking divisions
among the clergy and believers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which follows more than six months of appeals from
local priests, is intended to put an end to one of the most
damaging church scandals since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the episode spur debate within the church. To the
embarrassment of the church, it was also seized on by the Russian
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that a bishop has been removed with
such a public fuss,'' said Anatoly Krasikov, the head of a research
institute on church-state relations. ``Clergymen have been removed
for drunkenness, but those scandals were handled quietly. This case
was talked about throughout the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergymen said they expected Nikon to leave Yekaterinburg within
a week. The bishop has previously declined to discuss the
allegations and could not be reached Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His newly appointed successor, Bishop Vikenty, has been chosen
to restore the church's reputation in the Yekaterinburg region, the
church's third most important diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod was split at first, according to Krasikov. And
two abbots from the Yekaterinburg region who initiated the
complaints against Nikon were ordered by the synod to leave their
monasteries for repeatedly pressing their case.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the mounting allegations and the unusual
public vetting of the bishop's private life in the Russian press
appeared to persuade the synod that it had to act. More than 50
priests had accused Nikon of demanding huge fees to resolve
administrative disputes, drunkenness and open homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The synod's ruling was far more circumspect. It avoids any
direct reference to the allegations swirling around the bishop,
saying only that his mistakes ``have led to division among the
clergy and lay people.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the synod's ruling, Nikon will be stripped of his church
rank but will not be defrocked.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Nikon, who owed his appointment to connections
with powerful Soviet-era church officials, Vikenty has a strong
background in theological studies and a record of service in some
of the poorest regions of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Vikenty was born in the former Soviet republic
of Moldova. His original aim, church officials said, was not to be
a top clergyman but to live as a monk.
</P>
<P>
   The church later assigned him to restore a monastery in Moldova.
Most recently, he served as the bishop of Abakan and Kyzyl, two
towns in the Tuva region near the Mongolian border. It was not a
glamorous position. The region has only 15 churches.
</P>
<P>
   But while his appointment will almost certainly improve the
church's image, the move did not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   As it seeks to establish itself in post-Soviet society, the
Russian Orthodox Church has been struggling to maintain church
unity. And like Russia's political institutions, it grants its
representatives in the nation's far-flung regions considerable
authority and takes a dim view of challenges to their authority.
</P>
<P>
   A clergyman in Yekaterinburg said Nikon had sought to avoid
harsher punishment by asking to be transferred to a monastery
northwest of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The synod's ruling does not say whether the two dissenting
abbots will be restored to their monasteries. But it says a new
commission will look into the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Father Avraam, one of the ousted abbots, said the protesters
would accept the synod's ruling and stop their campaign to
highlight Nikon's abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to listen to the ruling bishop and fulfill our
duty,'' he said. ``The appeals to the press will be stopped.''

ARQULE, PFIZER ANNOUNCE LICENSING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ArQule Inc., which has struggled over the past 18 months as the
number of new pharmaceutical collaborations has declined, announced
Wednesday a 4 1/2-year technology licensing partnership with Pfizer
Inc. that could be worth up to $117 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one of the largest in the field known as
combinatorial chemistry, which enables pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies to speed the search for promising new
drugs. As part of the agreement, ArQule will devote its entire
Medford, Mass. facility to Pfizer as the company shifts its entire
operations and headquarters to a new 130,000-square-foot building
in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ArQule will provide Pfizer with tools, services, and proprietary
technologies for creating libraries of novel compounds and
converting the best ones into drug candidates quickly. In addition,
ArQule expects to hire 20 to 40 more researchers to fulfill the
Pfizer contract, said Stephen Hill, ArQule's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, Pfizer will make an initial payment of $16
million for research funding and for the construction of a
dedicated chemistry operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Arqule will then receive $20 million to $27 million annually
during the collaboration and is expected to provide Pfizer with
thousands of compounds in the year 2000. All compounds developed by
ArQule will be owned exlusively by Pfizer, which will also take
over the Medford facility at the end of the contract. Under the
agreement, Pfizer can cancel the partnership after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Pfizer is not making an equity investment in ArQule,
which already has several pharmaceutical companies as investors,
including American Home Products Corp., whose Wyeth-Ayerst
Pharmaceuticals division has a comparable 5-year agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hill acknowledged the Pfizer deal will significantly help ArQule
financially, which recently has suffered steep losses and rapidly
declining stock prices. In the just-ended second quarter, ArQule
reported $4.6 million in revenue, down from $6 million in the same
period a year ago. The company said its losses jumped more than
fivefold to $3.6 million, or 29 cents a share, versus $638,000, or
5 cents a share, in the 1998's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the current imbalance between revenues
and cash flows versus our investments in technologies will be
addressed with the initiation of our collaboration with Pfizer,''
said James R. Fitzgerald Jr., ArQule's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   For New York-based Pfizer, whose major research laboratories are
in Groton, Conn., the ArQule deal expands its presence in
Massachusetts. Last year the company opened a biotechnology
research facility in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ArQule shares rose 1 7/8 to close at 6 5/8 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Pfizer shares were unchanged at 35 3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

   _Benefits from the nation's 260 tribal casinos are spread
unevenly, with the 20 largest casinos accounting for half the $6.7
billion generated by tribal gambling.

   _At least 250 online casinos, 64 lotteries, 20 bingo games and
139 sports books operate over the Internet, where gambling revenues
doubled between 1997 and 1998 and are now estimated as high as $1
billion. Congress is considering a ban on Internet gambling, but it
may be impossible to regulate because most games operate in foreign
countries.

BREAKDOWN OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GAMBLING IN WASHINGTON

<P>
   Gaming in Washington generates $2 billion annually in revenues,
and supports a variety of commercial, non-profit and government
activities. Here's the industry at a glance:
</P>
<P>
   CARD ROOMS: Where owners rent chairs at rates of up to
$10-an-hour to players, who bet against each other using only their
own money. Limited to five tables. Generated $30 million in annual
revenues, and paid some $3.5 million in local taxes last year. The
rapid growth of mini-casinos, a type of card room, could quadruple
those figures for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   MINI-CASINOS: Technically called ``enhanced card rooms,'' about
50 offer casino-style card games such as blackjack, where players
bet against the house, which bankrolls the games. Up to 15 tables
allowed. Employ about 7,500 people statewide.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBAL CASINOS: Offer full range of table games _ such as cards
and roulette _ and recently authorized for video gaming devices.
Generated about $440 million in revenues, and about $3.4 million in
impact fees to local government. All support tribal governments and
economic development. Employ at least 7,000 people statewide.
</P>
<P>
   BINGO: Offered only by charities and non-profit groups. Prizes
go up to $10,000. Generated about $174 million in revenues last
year; paid about $3.7 million in local taxes. Helps support nearly
400 charities and social services dealing with youth sports to
domestic violence prevention. Employs between 1,000 and 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOTTERY: State-run gambling that offers a growing variety of
daily and weekly games and scratch tickets. Generated $454 million
in revenues, including $27 million in commissions to 3,400 lottery
outlets, last year. Revenues support education, human services and
other state programs, and will provide $9 million annually for
professional baseball and football stadium construction.
</P>
<P>
   HORSE RACING: Generated about $177 million in revenues
supporting Emerald Downs in Auburn and four seasonal fair meets.
Employs about 5,000 _ including jockeys and grooms _ and provides
nearly $2 million to aid horse breeders. Covers the $4.5 million
annual Horse Racing Commission budget.
</P>
<P>
   PUNCHBOARD/PULL TABS: Paper games with instant winners, similar
to lottery scratch tickets. Charities and commercial businesses may
offer them. Last year the games generated about $540 million in
revenues, and about $19 million in local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   CASHLESS SLOTS: Computerized games with the look and feel of
slots, but are allowed under the state's slot machine ban. They
don't have levers _ players insert a prepaid card, instead of
coins. A computer selects a predetermined number of winners for all
machines. With traditional slots, odds vary by machine.
</P>
<P>
   ETC: Revenues from all commercial, non-profit, and tribal
activities support the state Gambling Commission, which has a
budget of about $22.6 million and 180 employees. Lottery revenues
also cover Lottery Commission operations _ $8 million per year with
150 employees.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS HOLD RALLY TO SUPPORT LEE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, several House Democrats and
representatives of Asian-American groups attacked Senate Republican
leaders Wednesday for refusing to vote on the nomination of Bill
Lann Lee, acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Lee for the post on July 21, 1997, but the
nomination languished because some Republican senators said he
would use his position to advance quotas for minorities, a charge
that he has consistently denied.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997 the president appointed Lee to the acting
position, which allows him to serve through the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his leadership, the Justice Department has enforced our
civil rights laws justly and fairly,'' Clinton said in a statement
delivered at a rally outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of Mr. Lee's opponents have decided to use his nomination
as a means of expressing their disagreement with the civil rights
laws themselves,'' Clinton said. ``This is wrong. He deserves to be
considered based on his record and abilities, not blocked because
some senators disagree with the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Some four dozen Asian Americans appeared at the rally hoping to
pressure Senate leaders, mainly Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
G. Hatch, R-Utah, to bring Lee's nomination up for a vote. They
said their groups were also holding rallies in Philadelphia, New
York, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lee supporters at the Capitol held placards saying ``Confirm
Bill Lann Lee Now,'' ``Justice Cannot be Silenced'' and ``All We
are Saying is Give Bill a Chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has led the Republican refusal to permit a vote on
Lee, agreed to meet with the Asian Americans Wednesday evening. He
said earlier this week that he is concerned that Lee has ``misused
the law'' to promote quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaking at the rally, said Lee as
``magnificently qualified'' for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an act of disrespect, a slap in the face of every
American _ well beyond the Asian Pacific American community _ when
a person of eminent qualifications is refused consideration because
some senators disagree with what he believes,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., told the demonstrators that Lee
would be the highest ranking Asian American ever in the federal
government if he were confirmed.

added that Lee's nomination would pass ``overwhelmingly'' if
allowed to go to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Robert A. Underwood, a nonvoting Democrat who
represents Guam and chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus,
said that ``those blocking this process are clearly stifling large
populations'' of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., called Lee ``a political
prisoner, nothing short of that ... It's time to let him go; it's
time to set him free.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, attacked what she called the
``hardline views'' of Judiciary Committee Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Kwok, who chairs the National Council of Asian Pacific
Americans, a coalition of Asian-American organizations, said, ``The
time has come now for the Senate to move immediately on Bill Lann
Lee's nomination. It is the only fair thing to do and we hope it is
done immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 50, the son of Chinese immigrants who owned a laundry, grew
up in New York City, won a scholarship to Yale University and
graduated from Columbia University Law School. He is a former
lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

CAROLYN BESSETTE KENNEDY'S UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Great hair, minimalist taste and a runway model's
poise.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was a style-setter Americans admired,
say those in the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tart-tongued fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell called her
elegant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't an icon like her mother-in-law Jackie,'' he said,
``but she had what today's stars don't have _ the ability to carry
herself with a sense of grace and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hall, spokesman for the Fashion Association in New York and
co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency,'' also found her intriguing.
``She wasn't a great beauty, but had a beautiful aura. She could
have been short and a size 18, and she'd still have that aura ...
and sense of style. Whenever I saw her, she always had the right
shoes and purse. And never wore too much makeup. But I probably
liked her hair best,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The July 16 airplane crash that took her life along with husband
John F. Kennedy Jr. and her sister Lauren Bessette have Kennedy
watchers mourning the loss of yet more members of a family held up
to be the closest thing to American royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a couple, they were wonderful to look at, and with their
loss it appears to be the end of Camelot,'' said Edie Locke, a
director of the Los Angeles branch of Fashion Group International,
the organization of fashion designers, writers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Locke worked with Bessette Kennedy on fashion layouts at Calvin
Klein. ``She was always chic and had such a simple, minimalist
style. And I remember that she never wore makeup,'' Locke recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That minimalist attitude the young Kennedy wife was to become
famous for was first spotted at Calvin Klein's New York offices,
but it continued with designs by Versace, Yohji Yamamoto and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Fox, the Beverly Hills author of ``Star Style'' (Angel
City Press; $23.95) and the upcoming book ``Star Style at the
Academy Awards'' (Angel City Press; $35), called her the muse of
Prada. ``Her clothes were a wrapper to her porcelain beauty. But if
you looked closely, you saw only the finest quality and
workmanship. And that's the definition of understated elegance,''
said Fox.
</P>
<P>
   That signature style, continued Fox, was often misunderstood.
``Some people thought she was too bland and only wore black, white
and beige _ and not enough makeup. But I thought she had a pale
serenity. She was different, and I can't help but think back to
Audrey Hepburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schwartz of ABS fashions in Los Angeles, also admired
Bessette Kennedy's sense of style. Not only did he think she was
the next fashion idol for the American public, but his lower-priced
copy of her clingy white wedding gown by Narciso Rodriguez, was his
best seller for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and her husband were modern and contemporary, not corny
like British royalty. And I still can't get over how she wore a
ponytail on her wedding day and showed such style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Murray, a fashion historian and gallery director for the
Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, felt
Bessette Kennedy had already become a fashion icon. ``She moved
with the grace of a runway model. She had the same aloofness as
Jackie Kennedy Onassis ... and you know what they always say about
men marrying women like their mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Princess Diana and now Bessette Kennedy,
there's a void to fill.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hall, ``It's hard to say who's next, since great
taste and politicians don't usually have anything to do with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Dolly Madison, Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan come to
mind, but he can't think of any heir apparent to the fashion
throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, Tipper Gore is an American beauty who could develop a
memorable style. She's got great hair, and she looks happy,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kennedy clan, there's Caroline Kennedy and Maria Shriver,
but neither have shown much fashion independence, say these fashion
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking to Hollywood, maybe Gwyneth Paltrow,'' Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz also thinks Paltrow has enough polish and class to rise
in the ranks as America's fashion plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray thinks the next young woman to become a fashion icon
could be Julia Roberts. ``She can be very chic when she puts her
mind to it,'' she says. ``Besides, Paltrow's too soft. A fashion
icon has to have a hard edge,'' Murray added. &QL;

<P>
   MAHAHENG AMATSHO, Lesotho _ As a seer to kings, Mmatsepo has had
her hits and misses.
</P>
<P>
   She told the previous king of Lesotho, Moshoeshoe II, that he
was in danger, she said, but she could not foresee that his driver
would go over a cliff on Jan. 15, 1996. Even now, she doubts the
official version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone shot him,'' she insisted, and her say-so was enough to
start some citizens grumbling that his body, buried atop Thabo
Bosiu, two miles away, ought to be exhumed.
</P>
<P>
   The present king, Letsie III, was visiting her when South
African troops invaded last September to thwart a military coup,
she said. She knew that Lesotho, the mountainous Kingdom in the
Sky, was troubled _ as did everyone else, because a stalemate
between two army factions had gone on for weeks _ but she did not
foresee the invasion or that looters would burn down much of
Maseru, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she is accorded reverence. Such seers, or sangomas,
the healers and spiritual counselors once dismissed by the West as
``witch doctors,'' are not expected to be infallible. Just as the
Oracle at Delphi gave herself wiggle-room by speaking in parables,
Mmatsepo does not pretend that the ancestors reveal everything.
</P>
<P>
   She is credited, though, with keeping lightning away from Thabo
Bosiu _ Night Mountain _ the historical fortress and royal
graveyard of the Basotho. In a mountainous country where lightning
kills many people each year and on a continent where many believe
that witchcraft causes lightning, this is a signal accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   She also seems to be well liked. The children in the village
below like to troop up to her cave, grabbing visitors' hands and
practicing their English: ``Give me a sweetie.'' She is gracious to
strangers, even when they interrupt her as she is pounding her
washing beside her hut and offers them a sip from the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, powerful sangomas do their own laundry. Yes, she has a
helper, but the helper is down with the flu. Yes, those are
aspirins beside her helper's bed, which is, yes, a bit of a slur on
Mmatsepo's powers, but the chief of the village brought them, and
she is not going to insult him.
</P>
<P>
   She gave her helper, Dineo, some of her own herbs as well. She
is not exclusive in either medicine or religion: she addresses the
Christian God as well as the ancestors, and does not mind if her
patients visit clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have educations in other things,'' she said of the clinic
workers. ``Their tablets are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the 20-minute climb up to her home is over, it seems almost
ordinary, though in an eerily perfect way. Her three huts _ a
bedroom, a kitchen and a church-infirmary, flow into each other
seamlessly, smoothed together with layers of cow dung painted brown
and tan, with circular altars before each.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, they glow with fresh paint: her bedroom is pink,
with pink linoleum and white curtains on the window, her kitchen is
yellow with matching linoleum. Her church, only three feet high,
with the cave itself for roof and floor, is green and contains only
two drums and a rattle.
</P>
<P>
   There are anomalies: the chapel can hold only about six people,
while her pots and cookers can feed dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Her home is in an archaeologically extraordinary spot _ at the
entrance to one of many caves in a dolomite formation that
encircles the mountain above the village, whose name means ``dark
caves.'' The huge boulders around Mahaheng Amatsho are decorated
with Bushmen paintings thousands of years old: buffaloes and the
tiny lithe men hunting them.
</P>
<P>
   But the caves above are known as ``the cannibal caves,'' said
Patrick Rafutho, a local guide and translator. Cannibalism was not
a practice in southern Africa, but several hundred people living
here 180 years ago were forced into it when Shaka's expanding Zulu
empire wiped out their farmland and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cannibals made the mistake of eating the grandfather and
several wives of Moshoeshoe I, the founder of the Sotho nation,
Rafutho said. His warriors wanted to wipe out the cannibals, but
Moshoeshoe, seeing war with the Boer pioneers coming, let them live
in return for joining his army and changing their diet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether living with such dire spirits bothers her,
Mmatsepo, who uses no surname, said no. The ancestors who visited
her dreams as a teen-ager and ordered her to abandon her family,
she said, led her to this place and will protect her. She is from
far away and is not even Sotho.
</P>
<P>
   The ancestors do not allow her to marry, she said, because ``the
more I am alone, the easier it is for me to hear them.'' But she is
allowed to have a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   She is 48, and when it was time to find a successor, she used a
method any Tibetan would recognize: a dream told her where Dineo
was, and she eventually found the family and asked them to give her
their 9-year-old daughter _ which they did because Dineo had had a
matching dream that Mmatsepo was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Dineo, now about 14, is learning herbs. ``She can help with
stomach aches and headaches,'' Mmatsepo said, ``but not with
telling people about their future yet. The girl must have her own
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa, has one of the
world's worst HIV-infection rates, and she was asked what she tells
people about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is very, very bad, and I don't think it will end,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She is a mixture of a traditionalist and a modernist: She blames
young people for not restraining themselves sexually and for not
respecting the old ways, such as never eating eggs in the presence
of the opposite sex, which ``makes problems.'' But she also
counsels young women to go to clinics and ask for condoms.
</P>
<P>
   She is a little more optimistic about her adopted country and
the king she counsels. Letsie, who is a young man, ``will have a
long reign now that his father has died,'' she predicts. Then,
making a safe bet even for an oracle, she adds, ``But he will be
very confused by politicians.''

YUGOSLAV DEFENSE MINISTER ANNOUNCES PLAN TO PAY RESERVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In an unusual open meeting of the
government intended to help assuage popular grievances after the
Kosovo conflict, the Yugoslav defense minister announced Wednesday
that army reservists would be paid overdue wages in installments
over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Angry reservists have protested around central and southern
Serbia, including again Wednesday in Kragujevac. The protesters
have blocked roads and railroad tracks and marched on city halls,
demanding to be paid for their service in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, told the Cabinet that
paying the reservists was a ``top priority'' and that the bill
would be 1 billion dinars, or $100 million at the official exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   With Yugoslavia's foreign exchange reserves estimated at $150
million before the war _ the figure is a carefully kept secret _
paying the soldiers is bound to mean printing money and new
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more to be spent to try to restore electrical
stations and transformers, roads, bridges and factories, many of
which were heavily damaged in the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reservists are to come first. The government of
President Slobodan Milosevic cannot afford the potential for a
popular explosion led by armed former soldiers who were mobilized
for Kosovo, with 8,000 from Krusevac alone.
</P>
<P>
   The protests in numerous cities and towns include Krusevac, Nis,
Prokuplje, Pirot, Smederovo and Leskovac. In Kragujevac Wednesday,
250 protesters rallied in the town center and marched two miles and
blocked traffic along the road to Kraljevo, letting only the old
and the sick through their barricades.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been typical among the protesters, they spoke less
about fundamental politics than about obtaining their money.
</P>
<P>
   One protester, Dusan Danjanovic, told a local journalist: ``This
is nothing to do with politics. This is a question about money. If
they hadn't promised the money, we wouldn't have asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I trusted the Yugoslav army,'' Dragan Radovic said, ``I
would go back to the army again. But it depends on whether they pay
us or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljubica Markovic, editor in chief of the independent Beta news
agency, noted in an interview that the government ``is not fighting
back, but clearly hoping that the demonstrators will get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, she said, daily demonstrations by reservists and
opposition supporters in Leskovac and Valjevo are dwindling. One
main opposition grouping, the Alliance for Change, has been
organizing daily protests in Leskovac for 16 days, and Valjevo has
had rallies for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The rallies are demanding Milosevic's resignation and the
release of those arrested for organizing the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government doesn't keep its promises to pay the
reservists,'' Ms. Markovic said, ``there will be more trouble. But
there doesn't seem to be much belief or real energy in the
demonstrations so far. Just deprivation and depression. The
protests in southern Serbia are about social problems and lack of
money, not about politics, at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the region experiences social explosions as winter
approaches, she said, ``they could take all the politicians right
along with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic era is ending, ``and there will be hard days for
everyone,'' Ms. Markovic said. But she predicted that Milosevic
would ``be here for another year or 18 months, losing little by
little, until the threshold is crossed, and people will abandon
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discussions are beginning among figures on the outskirts of
the government, she said, but the moment for defection is not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Mirosinka Dinkic, an economist at the Belgrade Economics
Institute, said Yugoslavia's gross domestic product for this year
would be $13 billion, 30 percent smaller than last year's. Average
salaries, she added, are down 50 percent from the beginning of the
year, at least as measured by the black-market exchange rate for
the German mark. The salaries are running 75 marks, or $45 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic said the government would pay each soldier who served
in Kosovo $180, and $120 a month to those who served outside the
province. He said he was convinced that the plan would satisfy the
reservists, because professional soldiers were paid just this week
for the first half of May and retired staff members had received
their April pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief of staff, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, said in his
report that 62 Yugoslav soldiers had been killed in Kosovo
Liberation Army attacks after the accord signed with NATO on June
10, during the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from the
province.

 JFK JR.'s DEATH REVIVES OLD MEMORIES, OLD MYTHS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the enfolding darkness of a summer evening, an
airplane piloted by the handsome young torchbearer of the nation's
most celebrated family plunged into cool Atlantic waters, and the
resulting splash inundated all of us with old memories, old dreams,
and old myths.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire history of America, there has been nothing like
the Kennedy phenomenon. It has been woven into the consciousness of
our people with the twin skeins of glory and tragedy for much of
the 20th century. The demise of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
Carolyn and her sister Lauren Bessette is but the latest incident
embroidered on a fabric bright with achievement and dark with
death.
</P>
<P>
   We have had other distinguished families whose power and
influence, in both public and private endeavors, have passed from
generation to generation. Among them are the Roosevelts, the
Adamses, the Rockefellers, the Fords, the Mellons, the Tafts and
more recently the Bushes. All have left their mark on American
history.
</P>
<P>
   But none have fascinated the public as long and as intently as
have the children and grandchildren of Joseph and Rose Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   With the passing years, we have watched the growth of the legend
that John F. Kennedy was one of our great presidents. But history
does not substantiate that claim.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that he and America emerged victorious from the
potentially catastrophic 1962 Cuban missile crisis and that he
launched the project that placed men on the moon. It also is true
that he instilled in millions of young people a commitment to
public service.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a man of charm, intelligence and sophistication, was a
good president.
</P>
<P>
   He was unable, however, to win passage of Medicare and the
historic civil rights and anti-poverty legislation that Lyndon
Johnson pushed through Congress. Had he lived, he would have had to
face the crisis in Vietnam that destroyed Johnson's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   No one can know how he would have fared.
</P>
<P>
   Although I knew and at one time worked for Kennedy, I did not
know his son. But the night of his birth in 1960 remains one of the
vivid memories in my long journalistic career.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy had won the presidency over Richard Nixon by a mere
114,673 popular votes out of 68,828,960 cast that Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The shift of a few votes in Illinois and Texas would have given
the election to Nixon, but he refused to challenge Kennedy's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy left his home in Hyannisport, Mass., two days after the
election for a stay at his father's ocean-front estate in Palm
Beach, Fla., where he planned to select Cabinet members and make
other decisions regarding his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Kennedy, pregnant and under a doctor's care, remained
at their home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three weeks in the sun, Kennedy had returned to
Washington for Thanksgiving. He was expected to remain here for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened in the Kennedy household on Thanksgiving
Day. One person who witnessed it was Look Magazine photographer
Stanley Tretick, who later took engaging photographs of little
John-John cavorting in his father's Oval Office and who ironically
died last Sunday, two days after JFK Jr. perished at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Tretick recalled that John and Jacqueline Kennedy had an angry
exchange of words that Thanksgiving Day. And the president decided
to return to Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, I received a telephone call announcing the
president-elect's surprise plans. We who covered him were to fly in
a chartered press plane. He was to fly in his privately owned
plane, the Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were told we could take members of our family with us.
So my wife, my four-year-old son and I boarded the press plane.
After landing at the Palm Beach airport, we had to wait about a
half hour for Kennedy's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Then we were hit with a another surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When the president-elect descended the ramp from his plane, he
did not, as was his custom, shake hands and chat with spectators
who had gathered to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he strode, looking very somber, into a hangar and made
a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   To reporters gathered around him as he emerged from the hangar,
he announced, ``We're going back to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Kennedy had been rushed to Georgetown University
Hospital and had gone into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Caroline was slower than the press plane and had not
been refueled, JFK and most of his staff boarded the press plane
for the return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was no room aboard the plane for the reporters' family
members; so they remained in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly midnight when we took off. As I went aboard the
plane, my wife stood on the tarmack with my four-year-old son
Elliott, who plaintively called out, ``Daddy, Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after we were airborne, Kennedy received the news that
his wife had given birth to a son. When we landed in Washington
just before dawn, he hurried to the hospital to see Jacqueline and
their new son.
</P>
<P>
   As the years have passed, we have watched John Kennedy Jr. grow
from a precocious little boy into an attractive and intelligent man
who published his own magazine. If there ever was a Camelot, he was
the rightful protector of the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   He was the logical one to carry the torch that fell first from
the hands of his father and then from those of his uncle, Robert
Kennedy. But, as with them, we can only speculate on what might
have been for JFK Jr. Death has drawn an impenetrable curtain over
his future.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of the night he was born are as fresh in my mind as
they were nearly four decades ago.

 HEAD OF PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES AT WOODSTOCK '99 HAS HANDS FULL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is easier than you might think to pick out Dr.
Paul Michael Ramirez, the director of psychiatric services for the
Woodstock festival, among his professorial colleagues at Long
Island University in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he's got a long ponytail, the male sign of at
least a wannabe independent spirit.
</P>
<P>
   For another, he is of the proper age, which is to say middle, to
possess the wistfulness required for a successful professional to
donate his services for what is, after all, a commercial
undertaking. Ramirez, 48, also headed the psychiatry team for the
last Woodstock anniversary event, five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A story from the front, please, Dr. Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a consultation with a young man in his early 20s,
who said he had taken LSD,'' Ramirez begins, somewhat academically,
in his offices at LIU's Brooklyn campus. ``He couldn't tell me his
name. He couldn't tell me what city or what state he was from.
Finally I said, `Can you tell me what planet you are on?' He
couldn't, so I put him under 24-hour observation. Later he was
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a very Woodstock question, about the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if he couldn't answer that question he was in really
bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small, folks
used to sing in the time of the first Woodstock, in '69, and if
that should happen at the three-day, 30th anniversary music
festival this weekend and you should, as it was said in those
ancient times, freak, not to worry:
</P>
<P>
   Besides the sports complex, the shopping center and the $150
admission price, Woodstock '99 will have psychiatric services,
headed by Ramirez and assisted by a staff of 50. (Like all the
medical services, it will be free.)
</P>
<P>
   Does he think people are going to be doing that many drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Ramirez says cheerfully. ``We'll have the
population of a fair-sized city. I just got word that Metallica is
playing Saturday. People who go to hear Metallica tend to do more
drugs than people who go to see Peter, Paul and Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is the professor, who specializes in neuropsychology, has a
private practice near his home in the Riverdale section of the
Bronx and at his weekend place in Woodstock, and has a curriculum
vitae that could choke a horse, working for free?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to be in need and be hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh, as the therapists say.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we got to Woodstock we were half a million strong,
people used to sing of the first time around, but Ramirez was not
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 18 and had just gotten my first job, as a clerk at
American Express,'' Ramirez says. ``The week before Woodstock my
boss called us all in and said, `If you're not here Friday, don't
bother coming in Monday.' There were about 15 of us. I was the only
one who showed up for work Friday and nobody was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did such a work ethic come from in the age of tune in,
turn on, drop out? One doesn't wish to make too much of childhood
with a neuropsychologist who consults with drug companies, so, most
briefly, the making of Ramirez:
</P>
<P>
   Both parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. Ramirez's mother was a
seamstress in a sweatshop, his father a tool and die maker. Ramirez
lived in Manhattan until he was 10 and his parents bought a house
in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of my parents was well educated, but they really
pushed education,'' Ramirez says.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that while the young Paul Ramirez did
not make it to the Woodstock Festival, he did, at 16 and 17, travel
often and surreptitiously to the town of Woodstock, the hippie
Hamptons of the '60s. ``I'd go up there with my friend Enzo Guido,
who I'd known since fifth grade,'' Ramirez says. ``We were both on
the debating team and we'd both give our parents the same story: We
had an out-of-town trip for the team. Then we'd go up on the bus
and hang out. He played guitar. Bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Time tripping: Is there anything heavier, if you're true to the
rock 'n' roll, than looking in the mirror and seeing a guy who's
losing his hair?
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me the other day he's going to be a grandfather.
In February. Imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez _ to time trip back _ put himself through Lehman College
by teaching karate and, having no notion of what he wanted to do in
life, majored in Renaissance and Reformation history. This prepared
him for three years of construction work. Many degrees later (he
has three masters and a Ph.D. in psychology) he found himself
specializing in psychopharmacology, which appealed to him as a
combination of science and psychology. His personal excursions in
such matters, he says, were limited. He smoked some marijuana in
college, but never took LSD.
</P>
<P>
   Some words of wisdom for the Woodstock partyers who may be of a
more pharmacological bent, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said on MTV, keep in mind that the person who made that
designer drug you're taking might have failed chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, apropos of nothing, as the interview is ending and Ramirez
is heading out to his weekend place:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I discovered on a trip to Cancun last year?
There are 120 different kinds of tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh.
</P>

BRINGING AN ALIEN AND A ROBOT TO TV LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A little over a year ago, Matt Groening had a
tough decision to make: Should his robot's head be square or
rounded?
</P>
<P>
   That would not normally be considered a major creative decision
in television, but for someone as detail-oriented as Groening _ he
said he spent hours contemplating the question _ it was one of
several crucial choices he had to make to help define his latest
animated prime-time series, the well-received `Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult-oriented animated series have become big, in large part
because of the success of Groening's first show, ``The Simpsons,''
which began in 1990. When Groening sat down years later to create
his next show, a sort of futuristic science fiction sendup, he used
much of what he had learned about what works and what does not in
this realm of television. The veteran took his hard-won experience
and created an ensemble of bunglers living in the year 3000, hoping
that such a show would stand out in a crowded animation field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' is off to a reasonably good start. By midseason it
was pulling in about 10 million viewers, and most of them were the
young men so coveted by advertisers. Its season ratings (it is
being shown in reruns until the fall) were well behind ``The
Simpsons'' but ahead of such animated shows as ``King of the
Hill,'' ``Family Guy,'' ``Dilbert,'' ``South Park'' and ``The
PJ's.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey from conception to animation took a few years, with
decisions looming large on issues like whether to give the robot,
Bender, antennae, how much of a slacker to make his pal, Fry, and
what kind of nose should grace the lead female character, the
strong-willed and sexy alien Leela. In a wide-ranging interview,
Groening discussed this delicate decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' began as a sort of dream project, Groening said,
one in which he could capitalize on his success and build the
comedy as he liked. Still, he had to get Fox executives excited,
and he said he did so with a sly stratagem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I sold the show was by saying, `This is the Simpsons
in the future,' and dollar signs danced in front of their eyes,''
Groening said. ``When they finally saw it, they said, `This isn't
anything like the Simpsons.' And I said: `Yes it is. It's new and
original.'''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Futurama'' shares with ``The Simpsons'' is a slightly
twisted sensibility, a pointed but good-natured satirical approach
and a focus on losers. But ``Futurama'' is more of an adventure
series _ there is no domesticity to speak of _ and it examines the
life of a teen-ager rather than parents and younger children.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way ``The Simpsons'' upends the formula of
traditional family sitcoms, ``Futurama'' mocks many of the
conventions of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the future has often been depicted as militaristic or at
least heavily regimented under some sort of strong authority.
``Futurama'' presents a civilian society dominated by commercial
interests with plenty of winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   A major ambition in assembling ``Futurama,'' Groening said, was
to create a sort of dream show, to get it all right without
anxieties or compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ```Futurama' was an attempt to see if we could duplicate some of
the fun and have none of the headaches of `The Simpsons,'''
Groening said. ``That did not happen.'' For starters, there was
Bender's head. The hard-drinking and nihilistic robot started out
with a squarish one, on the assumption that most robot heads would
look that way in the year 3000. But then, Groening said, Bender's
was rounded to underscore the fact that he is a misfit, a round peg
in a square hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially gave him antennas where he would have ears, but
we decided it was more effective to make him more streamlined,''
Groening said. ``He's not streamlined as a personality, and that's
part of what makes him funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also what helps make Bender believable as a machine who
can still be a companion of sorts. He knows no guilt, constantly
feels sorry for himself and can bend metal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bender's qualities have yet to be displayed in the
series or have not received much attention, although they have been
on the writers' minds as they determine how he acts in various
situations. As a robot with soul, he plays the piano when he is
blue, for example.
</P>
<P>
   According to Groening's computer file from December 1997, Bender
is also ``a poor chef, proud of his being nonlethal, useful in the
kitchen because he won't burn.'' He loves to cook but was built
without a sense of taste.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Groening brooded over the character of Bender, the
show is essentially about the trials of being a young adult, as
seen through the character of Fry, the robot's buddy. Fry is a
20th-century pizza delivery boy accidentally catapulted into the
future after literally stumbling into a time machine. Amazed by
what he finds, he remains, as he was in the 20th century, something
of a loser. But not too much of a loser.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Groening said, Fry has developed into a slightly less
farcical character, making a transition from hopeless bungler to
bungler with a modest glimmer of hope. He has become an exaggerated
version of a certain kind of teen-ager _ easily distracted,
stubborn, a slob, and at times blatantly exuberant about things he
loves, like bad television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bumbling through the future seemed like a nifty alternative to
Fry's old life. Back home he was a dropout from Coney Island Junior
College, whose cheer at sporting events was, ``Go Whitefish!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured we needed a character the audience could identify
with,'' said Groening, explaining that young viewers might
recognize a little of themselves in the willfulness of the
remodeled Fry. Nevertheless, Fry just does not have it in him to
actually get ahead, a characteristic Groening enjoys poking fun at,
and a contrast to the superheroes of other shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Force definitely is not with him,'' Groening said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Leela, who takes a snickering, condescending
attitude toward her hapless friends. Groening said that although
her most distinguishing feature was always a single large eye, she
had evolved considerably, thanks partly to lessons gleaned from
``The Simpsons.'' A flashback in one episode about how Homer met
his wife, Marge, in high school helped his creative team understand
that animated woman characters could be sexy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curvaceous Leela is a woman of the future, assertive, decisive
and battle ready. Being an alien, she also has that one giant eye,
which makes her self-conscious about being a freak of sorts, by
human standards.
</P>
<P>
   Calling up a computer file, Groening read off some qualities he
had jotted down for Leela: ``strong-willed, opinionated, gentle
(when not fighting), gives orders, unlucky in love, loves weapons,
loves animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, was that after his team realized that an
animated woman could be sexy, they kept making her a little too
racy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to pull back on Leela,'' Groening said. ``The tendency
among the animators was to draw this bizarrely exaggerated female
form, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she was toned down, one body part, in addition to her eye,
remained somewhat larger than usual: her nose. That Groening
decided to keep, just for fun. ``Probably the biggest argument
about Leela was the size of the nose,'' he said. ``Some of the
animators said it was grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Bender, the animators gave Leela some characteristics
that have yet to be examined but inform her personality in the
minds of the writers. In fact, a big surprise lies in store for
Leela. ``Since this is an epic space opera, Leela has a dark
secret,'' Groening said. ``Suffice it to say, things are not what
they seem. That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Futurama'' her chances of escaping her past are minimal.
One conceit of the show is that in contrast to the popular belief
in self-help and man's ability to change, what happens in
Groening's future world is predetermined, or nearly so. He intends
that gloomy note to be the foil against which the characters react.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satirizing everything you're told these days about
reinventing yourself,'' said Groening. In ``Futurama,'' he said,
``my answer to the question of whether you can reinvent yourself or
whether you're doomed by some predetermined plan is you're
doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   But over time, this notion, too, has become more malleable, so
that the characters now have some wiggle room to try to better
their lives. ``My optimistic liberal point of view is you should do
what you really want to do and not accept the fate you're handed,''
Groening said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he has come to realize that in the world of animation,
change _ in particular, rapid change _ is admirable. Bender, for
example, can drop whatever he is doing in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things you find work comedically in these
shows,'' he said. ``A big thing is, impulsiveness is very funny in
animation. Leaping before looking or instantly changing directions
when something interesting suddenly comes along. So I don't always
know what they will land on when they leap. That's part of the way
things change.''

CLINTON CALLS DECISION TO CONTINUE SEARCH RIGHT THING TO DO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday he authorized the
Coast Guard to expand its search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing
airplane and defended it as the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor somber and quiet, Clinton coincidentally held a
news conference just minutes after being informed that the bodies
of the former president's son, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
and her sister Lauren Bessette had been located.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend
memorial services for the Kennedys on Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened his news conference by again commending the work
of the Coast Guard and other officials while saying his ``thoughts
and prayers'' were with the Kennedy and Bessette families.
</P>
<P>
   Although he delayed the afternoon news conference for 30 minutes
to receive updates on the search, he made no mention that the
bodies had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he approved the Coast Guard's request to
continue the search during a conversation Monday with Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabbee. The recovery operation normally would have
ceased after the three-day ocean sweep, but Clinton said Larrabbee
indicated he believed the plane could be found if given more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said that I would support it and defend it. And I think
it was the right decision,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Coast Guard felt that they had the capacity to
succeed in this if they had a few more days, and because of the
role of the Kennedy family in our national lives and because of the
enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes, I
thought it was appropriate to give them a few more days,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not
at fault, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration committed equipment and personnel to the search off
the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The National Transportation Safety
Board also is investigating the causes of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was informed early Wednesday that a remote
undersea camera had discovered the Piper Saratoga's wreckage and
that Kennedy's body was inside. The bodies of the women were
discovered just before Clinton appeared before reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also recalled that, until he took office, Kennedy had
not been to the White House since his family moved after President
Kennedy's 1963 assassination. The young Kennedy, who turned 3 the
day his father was buried, had little memory of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told of showing Kennedy his father's old desk, one made
famous by a picture of young John peering through a trap door in
the front. Clinton uses the desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The president also took Kennedy and his wife on a tour of the
White House residence after a reception last year for HBO's
television series of the Apollo flights. Clinton also showed
Kennedy his personal memorabilia from his father's presidency.
Kennedy later sent the president his favorite photograph of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a nice night. I think that he really wanted to kind
of come to terms with all of it. They were delightful young people,
and they had a great time here that night. It was quite a great
night,'' Clinton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he'd really felt he wanted to come back to the
White House before he did. But, especially in light of everything
that's happened, I'm glad he had the chance to come back here one
more time and see the residence and know where he was when he was a
little boy. I'm glad he did that,'' Clinton said.

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ In one of Southeast Asia's perplexing riddles,
investors keep plowing money into the region's stock markets even
as governments dither over the urgent financial and regulatory
overhauls many of them promised in the wake of the economic crisis
that began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets are soaring despite a widely held view among
financial experts that the collusion, corruption and financial
bungling that contributed to Asia's troubles have merely been
diluted, not eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same economists, bankers and investors say that the
market recovery has helped lull the region into complacency about
the need for more politically distasteful economic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at which investors are driving the recovery in
Asian stocks and what kind of markets they have created suggests
that the rally is not as unlikely as it seems. Some say that the
soaring Asian equity markets are not a vote of economic confidence,
but rather a symptom of continuing financial gridlock that has
turned these markets into corporate casinos for skeptical Asian
savers and skittish Asian banks.
</P>
<P>
   While higher stock prices may ultimately help companies raise
cash and strengthen their balance sheets, some economists say that
the rally represents a false dawn that has yet to convince foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring is key to making this recovery long term, says
Bernhard Eschweiler, head of economic research at Morgan Guaranty
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And the big gains in Asian stock indexes are helping to obscure
just how much value corporate Asia has lost. Indonesia's benchmark
stock index, for example, has risen by almost two-thirds so far
this year, almost back to where it was before the crisis began late
in 1997. That sounds terrific until the decline in Indonesia's
currency is factored in, which makes the stock market there worth
only about half as much in U.S. dollars as it was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Malaysia _ despite a 43 percent rise by its
benchmark stock index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Economic considerations aside, some argue that the latest rally
makes sense if only from the standpoint of accounting for currency
devaluations _ a sort of inflation adjustment by fund managers
rejiggering their global portfolios so they more closely mimic the
relative size and growth potential of economies.
</P>
<P>
   Others assume that new wealth being created in U.S. stock
markets is finding its way to Asia as investors seek to diversify
their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But data suggest that the opposite has been taking place. Since
the crisis started, investors have withdrawn an estimated $1.77
billion from American mutual funds investing in Asian markets other
than Japan, according to Lipper Inc. And while those funds have
grown by 44 percent so far this year as markets swelled, they have
only half as much money invested in the region as they did when the
crisis started. The world's biggest pool of capital _ the United
States _ does not appear to be unambiguously behind the Asian
rally.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. Lipper says investors pumped an estimated
$380 million into those Asian funds last month, the biggest monthly
inflow in more than two years. And Asia's economies, reforming or
not, are showing signs that they are recovering. Inflation is under
control, interest rates are falling, exports are rising, and Asians
are saving more than they spend.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't foreign investors been moving into the region
more aggressively? Analysts and fund managers say it is largely
because U.S. stocks are doing too well to risk putting money into
economies that are still under renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not fashionable yet to be looking at opportunities
offshore,'' says Dominic Armstrong, head of Malaysia and Singapore
research at ABN Amro Asia Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Asia's savers are giving banks a
growing pile of deposits that they either cannot afford to lend or
that companies are too indebted to borrow. Brokers say that a lot
of that money is ending up in regional stock markets for lack of a
better place to go. Joining it are small, local investors eager to
make a quick profit on the surge in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old-fashioned gambling mentality,'' says Hugh Young,
managing director at Aberdeen Asset Management. ``The consumer is
still quite nervous, but is quite happy to pump the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers and economists point to Malaysia as a prime
illustration. Foreigners are reluctant to put money into a market
where the government will tax them up to 30 percent for funds they
withdraw within a year of investing them. Instead, the market's
gains are being driven primarily by local investors, they say _ in
some ways the very type of short-term ``hot money'' that Malaysia
had hoped to discourage by imposing currency controls last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casino element is taking over,'' said William Belchere,
head of fixed-income research and strategy at Merrill Lynch
International Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   That much is evident from statistics measuring the volatility of
Asia's markets. Trading in Kuala Lumpur has nearly quadrupled,
compared with its level at the start of the crisis. At the same
time, the market is twice as volatile as it was two years ago.
Bangkok's stock market is almost as turbulent now as it was in the
uncertain days before the Thai baht was devalued in July 1997. And
Jakarta's stock market yo-yos more than any of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets are, of course, minuscule compared with the New
York Stock Exchange, so it takes a lot less money to move them.
Nevertheless, the amount of local money pouring into these markets
has important implications for economic recovery, market experts
say, since it demonstrates that despite Asia's difficulties, the
region is sitting on sizable amounts of investor money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frightening indication of how much cash there is in
Asia,'' Armstrong of ABN Amro said.

139 sports books operate over the Internet, where gambling revenues
doubled between 1997 and 1998 and are now estimated as high as $1
billion. Congress is considering a ban on Internet gambling, but it
may be impossible to regulate because most games operate in foreign

HOUSE TO CONTINUE INQUIRY OF INTERIOR'S ROLE IN SAIPAN GARMENT
LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans agreed Wednesday to continue an
inquiry into whether Interior Department employees engaged in
partisan political activities in an attempt to impose tougher labor
and immigration standards on the U.S. territory of Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 24-14 along party lines, the House Resources
Committee approved a resolution to subpoena more materials from
interior employees who allegedly have tried to help Democratic
candidates in their campaigns against GOP leaders who are opposed
to strengthening federal oversight of labor and immigration
practices on Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands of the western
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution deals with alleged attempts by David North, an
interior spokesman and policy expert in the department's office of
insular affairs, to solicit information from the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee on candidates who might challenge
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, and Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 Interior Department memo to then DCCC Executive
Director Matt Angle, which was leaked to reporters by Republican
sources, North wrote that the three ``have been giving the Clinton
administration a hard time over its efforts to reform the
sweatshops and trade law evasions now found in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans said the memo shows that North and other
interior employees may have violated the Hatch Act and other
federal laws prohibiting government employees from using their
positions for partisan political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the information we've received clearly shows that
there's a problem here,'' said Steve Hanson, a spokesman for
committee chairman Don Young, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other officials should be
cited for contempt of Congress because they failed to meet a
three-day deadline for turning over subpoenaed department
correspondence and files _ and even North's computer _ that might
contain information related to department employees trying to dig
up dirt on DeLay, Armey or other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Young decided to withdraw the resolution recommending
contempt after interior officials delivered several boxes of
information to the committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokesman John Wright said the department
had tried to meet the request, ``but they gave us only three days
to comply'' with a subpoena that asked ``for not only documents,
but any information held by any employee of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 65,000 employees, so we went back to them and asked
for more time and for them to be a little bit more specific about
what they wanted. I think we're working on an agreement now,''
Wright added.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats also pleaded with Young to give the Interior
Department more time to comply with his subpoena request. Speaking
for the minority, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., an advocate of
cracking down on labor and immigration abuses on Saipan, said he
would not condone any illegal or even questionable activity on the
part of interior officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he accused Republicans of using the subpoena powers of the
committee to intimidate government bureaucrats who happen to
disagree with them over policy matters in the Northern Marianas.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, joining with human rights and labor groups, has been
trying to get the committee to hold hearings on legislation that
would impose federal immigration and minimum wage laws on the
Northern Marianas, which has been allowed since signing a 1976 U.S.
territorial covenant to set its own labor and immigration
standards.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, House Republicans leaders have refused to allow
any hearings on the issue even though Senate Republicans have
already held one hearing at which testimony was given detailing the
exploitation of so-called foreign ``guest workers'' in Saipan's
garment industry.
</P>
<P>
   At that hearing, former Chinese and Filipino workers on Saipan
presented dramatic accounts of being forced to pay thousands of
dollars to buy jobs in the island's garment factories and other
foreign-owned businesses _ only to be cheated out of their meager
wages and treated like indentured servants with no rights. The
Interior Department and several labor and human rights groups also
charged in testimony that the Saipan garment industry is run by
corrupt Chinese and Asian-based businesses that are using the
American territory to produce ``Made in U.S.A.'' clothing as a way
to circumvent federal trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was in contrast to the views held by DeLay, who
calls Saipan ``a shining example of a free market success''
precisely because it has refused to adopt U.S. wage and immigration
standards. DeLay has vowed to fight any attempt by Congress to
change the island's labor practices, although he has encouraged the
government of Northern Marianas to ``clean up some of the
problems'' in its garment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his efforts to head off congressional action could be in
trouble as more and more Republicans come out in favor of a
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., for
example, unveiled a bill last week that would end the practice of
foreign-owned businesses using what they called ``ill-treated
indentured labor'' and materials from Asia to produce duty-free
``Made in U.S.A.'' clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and labor groups are also urging the Justice
Department to investigate the trafficking in and abuse of foreign
workers on Saipan. In a letter last week to Attorney General Janet
Reno, the Washington-based human rights organization Global
Survival said the Northern Marianas ``has become a center of
international human trafficking operations'' involving Asian
organized crime, sexual slavery and debt bondage of garment
workers.

MOSES EXPECTED TO RESIGN TO TAKE SPOT AT TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Education Commissioner Mike Moses, who has
been the point man in carrying out Gov. George W. Bush's education
initiatives, is expected to announce his resignation, possibly as
early as Friday, to take a job at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Moses' resignation as head of the Texas public school system,
where he has served since 1995, apparently hinges on final approval
of the establishment of a Texas Tech University System.
</P>
<P>
   The Higher Education Coordinating Board is scheduled to vote on
that issue Friday, and Texas Tech spokeswoman Cindy Rugeley said
school officials have been given no indication the board will turn
the proposal down.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, Moses would become a deputy chancellor of the new
system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, State Board of Education Chairman Chase Untermeyer of
Houston and members of the governor's staff have begun interviewing
possible replacements for Moses, according to several officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moses has not submitted his resignation, ``we have
begun the process,'' of finding a replacement, said Bush
spokeswoman Linda Edwards. She declined to release the names those
being considered for appointment, even though names of applicants
are considered public under the Texas Open Records Act. Edwards
said the staff member charged with gathering the information is on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate to speak about it further,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Commissioner Moses has expressed interest in
exploring potential opportunities,'' Edwards said. ``We don't have
a resignation. Mike Moses has been a great education leader for our
children. He has set high standards and strengthened accountability
in Texas public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer, likewise, was circumspect, saying only, ``As I
understand, things are moving in some kind of direction that may
lead to an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses applied earlier this week for the job of deputy chancellor
for external systems operations at Texas Tech, a new job being
created at the school. The job has been posted on Texas Tech's
Internet site for several weeks, but Rugeley said Moses is the only
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that (Chancellor John) Montford would like to
have him here,'' Rugeley said. Montford and Moses have been good
friends for many years, stemming from the time Moses was
superintendent of Lubbock schools and Montford was a state senator
from the same city.
</P>
<P>
   Moses declined Wednesday to respond to questions about his
possible departure, but spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe said he
submitted his application after Montford asked him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montford approached him about this new job that may be created
and he's intrigued by that,'' Ratcliffe said. ``He and his family
came to love Lubbock and Texas Tech when they lived there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being named education commissioner, Moses headed Lubbock
schools for about six years and public schools in La Marque for
about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Rugeley said Moses had told Montford some time ago that he was
interested in returning to Lubbock and would like to work at the
university if there were a place for him.
</P>
<P>
   The new position would involve overseeing development and news
and information services, Rugeley said. Although the job is a new
one, Rugeley said it was not created solely in hopes of getting
Moses.
</P>
<P>
   At least one critic has suggested the new position is simply
another layer of bureaucracy, but Rugeley said the job was created
as part of an overall restructuring of administrative positions.
Three or four other positions would be eliminated or merged under
the proposed realignment,
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said Bush has repeatedly urged Moses to stay on as
commissioner. When Bush reappointed him to the job last January,
Moses committed to staying on only until the end of the legislative
session, which ended May 31.

 &HT;    CLINTON VOWS TO VETO HUGE TAX-CUT BILL
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Wednesday to veto a
Republican plan for massive tax cuts, calling the proposal a
budget-buster that would squander a historic opportunity to address
a host of national ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow a risky plan to become law,'' Clinton told
reporters as Republican leaders struggled to put together a House
majority for their package of $792 billion in tax cuts over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the plan could add $3 trillion to the federal debt
over 20 years, while contributing little or nothing to the
resolution of long-term problems with funding for Social Security,
Medicare, defense and other national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science _ this is arithmetic,'' Clinton
said in a 70-minute White House news conference covering subjects
as diverse as the rising tensions between China and Taiwan and the
tragic death of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who plans to attend memorial services for Kennedy in
New York on Friday with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said he
was Kennedy's host for his only two visits to the White House since
the assassination of his father, President John F. Kennedy, in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he had really felt he wanted to come back to the
White House before he did,'' Clinton said, recalling with evident
fondness the younger Kennedy's visits to the Oval Office and the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, especially in light of everything that's happened, I'm
glad he had the chance to come back here one more time and see the
residence and know where he was when he was a little boy,'' said
Clinton. `` I think that he really wanted to kind of come to terms
with all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about a recent jab he made at Republican
presidential hopeful George W. Bush's self-styled ``compassionate
conservatism,'' and said he intended no sharp barb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just having a little fun,'' Clinton said, adding that
the political climate is crying out for levity. ``If we don't have
any laughs it's going to be a very tedious struggle between now and
November of 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a swipe at Bush's reluctance to stake out specific
positions on key national issues, Clinton said Vice President Al
Gore had eclipsed the Texas governor in articulating a political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would say to everyone, you know, use whatever slogans you
want, but tell us where you stand,'' said Clinton. ``I think that's
the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would support the campaigns of Gore, and of his
wife should she decide as expected to run for the U.S. Senate in
New York, Clinton said he would do ``whatever I'm asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can be helpful, I will be,'' said Clinton. ``I owe them a
great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, much work remains to be done in his
remaining tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself winding down,'' said Clinton. ``I feel
myself keying up.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the point, he showed himself at the news
conference to be mentally agile and at ease with a broad slate of
domestic and international concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Clinton focused on the potentially dangerous
rift between China and Taiwan, urging Taiwanese President Lee Deng
Hui to tone down recent rhetoric Beijing has cast as a threatening
prelude to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we don't want to see escalate,'' said
Clinton. He reaffirmed two decades of U.S. policy that attempts to
walk a fine diplomatic line treating Taiwan as neither an
independent state nor part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pillars of the policy are still the right ones,'' said
Clinton. ``I would hope that we would stay with what is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Following this week's remarks by Lee, Clinton canceled a planned
mission by Pentagon officials to help Taiwan assess its missile
defense needs, a study Beijing could interpret as the precursor to
additional U.S. military sales to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think this was the best time to do something which
might excite either one side or the other and imply that a military
solution is an acceptable alternative,'' said Clinton. ``If you
really think about what's at stake here, it would be unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a former Chinese province that broke from the mainland
when communist revolutionaries established the People's Republic of
China 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy is that the future status of Taiwan is to be
negotiated peacefully between Taipei _ which has flirted with a
declaration of independence _ and Beijing, which routinely
threatens to take the island republic by force if it attempts to
formally go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy isn't explicit over whether American forces would
defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack. Clinton has said repeatedly
that he would regard such a move ``with the gravest concern,'' a
formulation he reiterated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He underscored the point three years ago, when China-Taiwan
tensions neared a boiling point, by sending two U.S. aircraft
carrier battle groups to patrol the 90-mile strait dividing Taiwan
from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago we had a physical expression of that, that we
don't believe there should be any violent attempts to resolve this,
and we would view it very seriously,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The understanding we have had all along with both China and
Taiwan is that the differences between them would be resolved
peacefully,'' he said. ``If that were not to be the case, under the
Taiwan Relations Act we would be required to view it with the
gravest concern.''

BAY STATE ACTS TO PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts may soon become one of the most
aggressive states in curbing marketers who peddle personal facts
about consumers, from their social security numbers to shampoo
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of consumer annoyance over complete strangers selling an
individual's personal information, top state officials attended a
public hearing Wednesday on a proposed new state law that gives
consumers some ways to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are open to anyone willing to pay the right price,''
said Lt. Gov. Jane Swift, who proposed the law last month. ``Where
I live, my phone number, my spouse's name, how many children I have
and my favorite cereal are all items that are for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging bill appears to be on the fast-track for
approval, though it faced vigorous opposition Wednesday from the
state's retailers, banks and credit reporting agencies.
Representatives of these industries said data collection on
individuals shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing, and that it is
essential in helping industry reduce retail crime and pitch new
products.
</P>
<P>
   Two provisions in this proposed law are particularly powerful.
One would require the state's retailers and credit card issuers to
get explicit approval from consumers to sell their personal
information to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A department store, for example, couldn't sell information about
a customer's store credit card or buying patterns without asking
the customer first.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said some states, such as Connecticut, have
proposed opt-out provisions, which require local business to allow
consumers the right to refuse the distribution of their personal
information. But the proposed Massachusetts law goes even further,
requiring business to get a consumer's approval, and not just offer
a chance for the customer to register disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also puts severe restrictions on information brokers,
who collect biographical data on specific people, not just
demographic groups. Under the proposal, these brokers would have to
notify a Massachusetts resident whenever the resident's information
is sold to another person or group.
</P>
<P>
   And to curb the amount of junk mail received by residents here,
the law calls for the secretary of state to keep an ongoing list of
people who don't want their name peddled by any direct-marketers.
Any businesses who plan to solicit residents here would have to
make sure they don't pitch to anyone on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer privacy issues have been under national scrutiny in the
past couple weeks as many local public television stations,
beginning with WGBH-TV in Boston, admitted that they swapped donor
lists with political parties and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed law, for example, WGBH would have had to make
sure the names on its list were not on the secretary of state's
do-not-solicit list. And if they gave detailed biographical
information on any one donor, thereby acting as an information
broker, they would have to inform that donor in advance that his or
her private information was being sold or bartered.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of
Massachusetts and an opponent of the bill, said collecting detailed
information often helps businesses identify check-bouncers and
potential thieves. He said such fraud ultimately costs the
consumer. The Massachusetts Bankers Association and the Washington
D.C.-based Associated Credit Bureaus also opposed the bill, which
they say leaves them without the necessary tools to fight fraud and
expand business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this law is very well-meaning, but we're concerned
about unintended consequences,'' Hurst said.

 JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON AGREES TO BUY BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out to strengthen its pipeline of new drugs, Johnson &AMP; Johnson
announced Wednesday that it would buy Centocor Inc., one of the
nation's largest biotechnology companies, for $4.9 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition follows a rapidly growing trend among drug
makers to snap up biotechnology companies. Last month, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn said that it would pay $650 million for Sugen Inc., while
earlier this year Warner-Lambert bought Agouron Pharmaceuticals for
$2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the drug companies are looking to invigorate their
research and development efforts through biotech companies,'' said
Jack Lamberton, a managing director with HSBC Securities. ``Johnson
&AMP; Johnson is a leader in biotechnology anyway. It's not a huge leap
for them to bring it in house.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's purchase of Centocor, based in Malvern, Pa.,
appears to be a part of the company's strategy to shift more of its
focus to high-profit pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Johnson &AMP; Johnson is one of the world's most diverse
health care companies _ making medical devices like heart stents
and consumer brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol _ analysts believed
the company's diversity had caused its earnings gains to lag behind
those of some of its competitors. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which is based
in New Brunswick, N.J., surprised analysts on Tuesday by beating
second-quarter per-share earnings estimates by 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors applauded the deal. Shares of Centocor jumped almost
15 percent Wednesday, or $7.875, to close at $57.375. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's stock gained 1 percent, or 93.75 cents a share, to at
$93.375. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that a deal was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the accord are complex. Centocor's shareholders
will receive a fraction of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's shares, depending on
the value of the acquirer's stock during a 20-day trading period.
If Johnson &AMP; Johnson's shares trade between $85.71 and $104.76( as
expected, Centocor's shareholders will receive $61 in Johnson &AMP;
Johnson stock for each of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson officials said Wednesday that the purchase
should dilute the company's earnings by 15 cents a diluted share
this year and another five cents in 2000. Centocor is expected to
Johnson &AMP; Johnson's earnings in 2001, even though company officials
declined to say by how much.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts said that Johnson &AMP; Johnson might have
overpaid for Centocor, few argued the benefits of the deal.
Analysts have chided Johnson &AMP; Johnson for its weak pipeline of new
drugs, a problem that Centocor should quickly remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Centocor shared several
ey development areas, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal
products. With the acquisition, Johnson &AMP; Johnson will get
Centocor's anti-clotting drug ReoPro _ with half of the profits
going to Eli Lilly &UR;  &LR; _ and Remicade, a treatment for Crohn's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ReoPro and Remicade should prosper under Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
management. Analysts noted Wednesday that ReoPro is used in half of
all stent procedures. Since Johnson &AMP; Johnson is a major stent
maker, the company could easil9 boost ReoPro sales by selling it to
its stent buyers. Centocor is also waiting on approval from the
Food and Drug Administration to market Remicade as a treatment for
rheumatoid arthritis, a market that is expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's deal is a very good move,''
said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``Johnson &AMP;
Johnson will leave Centocor alone so that it will function as an
independent subsidiary. That's good, because there are a lot of
synergies here.'' &QL;

GRISSOM'S LIBERTY BELL 7 CAPSULE BACK ON SHORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Thirty-eight years to the day after it
was swallowed up by the Atlantic Ocean, Mercury astronaut Gus
Grissom's tiny Liberty Bell 7 capsule returned to land Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bell-shaped, nine-foot tall capsule sank within 10 minutes
of Grissom's recovery from a 16-minute spaceflight July 21, 1961,
only the second by an American. It rested upright in more than
15,000 feet of water until its recovery early Tuesday 90 miles
northeast of the Bahamas by a small expedition funded by the
Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of reaching Port Canaveral early Wednesday aboard
the recovery ship, Ocean Project, the spacecraft rested dockside
atop a flatbed truck, immersed in a canister of fresh water, amid
the less ethereal cruise ships and shrimp boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been an expedition like we've had with Liberty
Bell 7,'' said Max Ary, the president of the Kansas Cosmosphere and
Space Center, the capsule's new owner and second only to the
Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum as a repository for
the artifacts of aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Bell fought us all the way. Until it came on the deck
we were still concerned it wouldn't make it. I will not be at ease
until its on the ground in Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ary set sail aboard the Ocean Project with expedition leader
Curt Newport and his crew July 4. Newport's first attempt to
recover the historic spacecraft succeeded in finding and
photographing it May 1. But the control cable on the robotic
submersible that was attempting to bring it to the surface snapped,
forcing the recovery team back to port for new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule was to leave late Wednesday by truck for the
Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Once it arrives, the spacecraft will be disassembled into its
25,000 parts. Once each has been cleaned and reconditioned, the
Liberty Bell 7 will be reconstructed, a process that is expected to
take about six months.
</P>
<P>
   The black titanium shell of the spacecraft appeared well
preserved, more so than the experts expected. The contrasting white
lettering ``United States'' and ``Liberty Bell 7'' were visible.
</P>
<P>
   But the gaping interior of the capsule was stinking, soggy mass
of wiring and tangled harnesses. The control panel was in disarray,
largely because of the large number of copper components that had
succumbed to the corrosiveness of the salt water. The windshield
and periscope that Grissom used to look out, however, appeared to
be in good shape. Also recovered from the capsule, were several
1941 Mercury-style dimes that Grissom had taken along as souvenirs,
each preserved as though tossed in a jar on a bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft was retrieved without its hatch. After Grissom's
capsule splashed down, the explosive bolts on the hatch detonated
prematurely, and the rescue helicopter that hovered overhead was
unable to raise the Liberty Bell 7 from the water.
</P>
<P>
   For years space buffs have debated whether the late astronaut
jettisoned the hatch in a panic or the explosives fired on their
own, as Grissom claimed. Grissom went on to command NASA's first
Gemini mission in 1965, but perished along with Ed White and Roger
Chaffee in a launch pad fire during the Jan. 27, 1967, test of an
Apollo capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is tremendous,'' said Lowell Grissom, the
astronaut's 65-year-old brother who traveled from his St. Louis
home to greet the capsule. ``We thought it was lost. I was very
nervous. I didn't expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gus would be extremely pleased to see Liberty Bell
come home. It was a good feeling to see it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom said his famous older brother was a good engineer and
too thorough a test pilot to have mistakenly jettisoned the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it was really a question in the first place,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty Bell's recovery afforded a reunion of sorts for
Guenther Wendt, the NASA engineer who helped seal America's
earliest astronauts into their capsules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy they found somebody who can put it back in the
shape I last saw it,'' Wendt joked Wednesday. ``I think the
hospitality has been lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the spacecraft has been refurbished, the Kansas museum
plans to take it on a three-year tour of the United States before
placing it on permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel plans to air a documentary of Liberty
Bell's recovery Dec. 12.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It was another routine transaction in the deadly
business of how criminals get their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, a stranger paid 21-year-old Tia Branch $200,
drove her to the Baltimore Gun Smith store near her housing project
and showed her a $700 semiautomatic pistol he wanted. Outside the
store, he gave her the money for the gun, and she went back in and
bought it. As a convicted felon, he was barred by federal law from
buying a gun himself.
</P>
<P>
   The sales clerk did not question the young woman, although
law-enforcement officials said the clerk should have known from the
couple's behavior that it was an illegal straw purchase. Baltimore
Gun Smith has made so many similar sales, they said, that the store
is responsible for selling 20 percent of the guns used in crimes
that Baltimore police have traced in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that record, despite investigations going back to 1991
and despite several attempted prosecutions, Baltimore Gun Smith is
still open for business, a large sign in the shape of a Colt
revolver hanging over its doorway.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress debates gun control, the gun industry and its
supporters often say that the United States has enough gun laws
already, that what is lacking is enforcement. But a review of cases
like the Baltimore Gun Smith, and of the agency charged with
enforcing federal gun laws, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, reveals a much more complicated situation.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, an arm of the Treasury Department, was created with
limited power, has existed under constant threat of attack by the
National Rifle Association, has been kept short-staffed and is
charged with enforcing laws often written to make prosecutions
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the ATF also shows a major distinction in its
approach to the job. Historically, it has arrested a sizable number
of criminals who use guns in robberies or drug sales, particularly
career criminals with three or more convictions. These are
considered safe cases that do not arouse NRA opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the bureau has been less aggressive in what is
now being recognized as a critical part of gun control: going after
illegal gun traffickers and the small number of corrupt dealers,
among the 104,855 federally licensed dealers, who supply guns to
criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   While half of all crime guns traced by the ATF in the past two
years were traced to just 389 dealers, only 42 dealers were
recommended for prosecution last year, and only 19 had their
licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot of vigor in gun enforcement,'' said
Julius Wachtel, who retired last year after 23 years as a firearms
agent. When it comes to investigating dealers, traffickers or gun
shows, he said, the agents have a saying: ``No cases, no waves.
Little cases, little waves. Big cases, big waves. All those years
of being hammered by Congress have had a chilling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ATF Director John McGaw acknowledged in an interview: ``I
virtually never use the term `gun control' because that would make
us anti-gun. Everything we touch is unpopular and controversial, so
we have to be very careful to do what Congress has decided we
should and be neutral regulators, not take sides in the gun
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under McGaw, a former director of the Secret Service who became
director of the ATF in 1993, after the raid on the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, the number of gun trafficking cases
recommended for prosecution rose to 788 in 1998, up from 533 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with what McGaw sees as his congressional mandate, he
has formulated a policy of treating gun dealers as ``partners,''
members of the legitimate firearms industry, whom agents often
depend on for tips about straw purchases or gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's small size _ its 1,631 agents are only 9 more than
in 1973 _ means it sometimes must forgo investigations, prosecutors
said. And the agents must spend much of their time investigating
bombings and arsons, as well as enforcing the laws on alcohol and
collecting tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the number of agents in the Drug Enforcement
Administration has grown to 4,515 today, from 1,370 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that Congress has never decided it is serious about
going after gun trafficking the way it is about the war on drugs,''
said David Yassky, an assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School
and a Democratic counsel to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With drugs, we've realized we've got to go all the way up the
chain,'' Yassky said. ``If all you do is arrest the crack addict,
we won't get anywhere. But with guns, we only arrest the end user,
the shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal gun laws underscore the difference in priority between
drugs, which are illegal to sell, possess and use, and guns, which
start out as legal products, and illustrate the difficulty the
bureau faces in pursuing gun control.
</P>
<P>
   A dealer who sells 1,000 or more guns to criminals might get
only six months in jail, but for drug dealers there are stiff
mandatory minimum prison sentences of up to 25 years, even for
selling small quantities of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover purchases are a common tactic of drug agents, but
appeals courts have reversed convictions gained by firearms agents
posing as felons buying guns. Agents must use an actual convicted
felon in undercover operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, a law
championed by the NRA and sponsored by Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho,
who later retired, and by Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., who lost his
seat in 1996, raised several barriers to prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmer, now living in Hannibal, Mo., said his law is still
necessary to rein in what he sees as an overzealous government
agency. In the minds of firearms agents, Volkmer said, ``It's
almost like, if you are a gun owner or dealer, you're weird or not
legitimate. They believe the only way to resolve violence is to
take away our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The law limited ATF agents to annual inspections of dealers,
reduced record-keeping violations by a dealer from a felony to a
misdemeanor, a disincentive for federal prosecutors in cases where
a dealer has forged or destroyed his records to hide evidence, and
required prosecutors to prove that dealers who sold guns to
criminals or straw purchasers did so ``knowingly and willfully,'' a
nearly insurmountable hurdle, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   It also prohibited the ATF from establishing any national system
of gun registration, which makes tracing the origin of guns used in
crimes much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   `The gun laws weren't very strong to start with,'' said William
Vizzard, a retired firearms agent who is now a professor of
criminal justice at California State University in Sacramento.
``But after McClure-Volkmer, they were Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ORIGINS: From Moonshine To Gun Control
</P>
<P>
   The ATF's difficulties lie partly in its origins. It was created
with little planning when Congress hastily passed the Gun Control
Act of 1968 following that year's assassinations of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. in April and of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in
June.
</P>
<P>
   That law required that everybody dealing in firearms be licensed
by the federal government, and it prohibited convicted felons,
illegal immigrants and drug addicts from buying guns. The law gave
the government no power to regulate the manufacture, design or
marketing of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who was a member of the NRA board of
directors, had the gun industry exempted from the new Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The agency charged with supervising the 1968 law was the Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax Division of the Treasury Department. Until 1968,
its agents were mainly revenuers, famous in film lore for tracking
down whiskey stills, largely in the Southeast. Most of the agents
themselves were Southerners who grew up with guns and were likely
to be members of the NRA; they had little interest in the new
notion of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, who joined the agency in Phoenix in 1972, after it was
renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, recalled that
his first training officer was from Alabama afd ``basically knew
nothing about firearms trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon Wachtel and other new agents began making some alarming
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked into gun shows and found you could buy a machine
gun, which was illegal, without even having to give your name,''
Wachtel said. They also stumbled on dealers ``who were putting guns
on the streets without paper,'' he said, selling to criminals
without keeping the required records. And Wachtel said they found
that traffickers would buy guns in states with lax gun control
laws, like Georgia or South Carolina, and then drive them north for
resale to criminals in Washington or New York.
</P>
<P>
   In short, by the late 1970s the new agents had an understanding
of how guns moved quickly from manufacturers, wholesalers and
dealers to criminals. But as they began to make criminal cases, gun
industry supporters in Congress held angry hearings into alleged
abuses of law-abiding gun owners and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the NRA, President Ronald Reagan in 1981
announced the elimination of the ATF and many agents were given
layoff notices, until his administration later reconsidered the
action.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the most famous attacks on the ATF, Dingell, who
was influential in the defeat of a gun-control bill in the House in
June, called firearms agents ``a jackbooted group of fascists who
are perhaps as large a danger to American society as I could pick
today.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect itself against criticism of this kind, the ATF in
1979 ordered that any agent who wanted to investigate a gun dealer
had to get permission from headquarters in Washington. This policy
lasted until the Clinton administration. Vizzard remembered ``the
chilling effect'' when he received a reprimand because he was
investigating three corrupt dealers concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University and director of the Boston Gun
Project, the most successful citywide program to stop gun
trafficking, said of the firearms agents: ``These people are
heroes, and the only fair thing to say is that they have been
systematically kept away from doing a vitally important job.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATF operates out of an unremarkable, granite-faced
eight-story building in Washington. By mandate of Congress, 25
percent of the bureau's time must be spent on explosives, a
priority that gained new urgency after the bombing of the federal
building in Oklahoma City in 1995. The bombing was directed against
the ATF office there in retaliation for the bureau's role in the
Branch Davidian raid near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   After the Waco incident, President Clinton appointed McGaw, who
was popular with Republicans, as the new director. McGaw has
emphasized training and professionalism as a way to re-create an
agency that had its start in moonshine and is still regarded as the
blue-collar law enforcement agency, and give it more of a
buttoned-down image like that of the Secret Service or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGaw's most important initiative has been to quadruple the
number of crime guns the ATF traces back to manufacturers and
dealers, which has led to a much clearer understanding of the role
of illegal dealers and traffickers in helping criminals get their
guns. But to make the program more palatable to the NRA, which
always worries about the government's keeping information on guns,
it has officially been described as an effort to stop the flow of
guns to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   McGaw is not one to lead the call for new gun laws, and he makes
no apologies for treating gun dealers as partners. Gun trafficking
is a victimless crime, he says, where no one calls up to report an
illegal sale, so the bureau depends on having good relations with
dealers who can tip it off about suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   McGaw said he was surprised when he took over the ATF and found
that all its functions ``are negatives, are controversial.'' Even
when it investigates white supremacist groups or the bombing of an
abortion clinic, the bureau has drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   So to avoid attacks on the bureau's budget, he tries to steer a
course down the middle. ``For our agents, some of the laws may be
frustrations,'' he said, but he added that these impediments ``tell
us what Congress wants us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PROBLEM: Quirks in the Law Help the Dealer
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials first became interested in Baltimore
Gun Smith in 1991 when Detective Ed Bochniak of the Baltimore
Police Department went to the home of a drug dealer, Anthony Jones,
18, to investigate the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old girl in his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' home, police found receipts showing that Jones'
cousin, Sheila Kelly, had bought eight guns for $5,274 from
Baltimore Gun Smith, and Ms. Kelly later confessed that Jones had
paid her to buy them. The guns included a 40 mm Glock semiautomatic
pistol, two 9 mm Glock semiautomatic pistols, a 9 mm Beretta
semiautomatic pistol with a laser sight and a Cobray Streetsweeper
shotgun. One of the pistols killed the 13-year-old; another had
been used to shoot two drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Bochniak turned over the evidence to the ATF office in
Baltimore. But when firearms agents recommended prosecution to the
U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, they were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney said he could not discuss the
case because no prosecution had been made.
</P>
<P>
   But agents involved in the investigation said they were told the
prosecutor feared that the case would be nearly impossible to
prove, given the quirks in the gun laws. Under the McClure-Volkmer
standard, the agents would have to show that the owner, Anthony
DiMartino, had sold the eight guns to Ms. Kelly knowing that she
was a straw purchaser. In other words, they would have to prove his
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   That would take valuable extra time, the agents were told, and
even if by chance DiMartino was found guilty, the prison sentence
would be only a few months, not the kind of high-profile case that
ambitious federal prosecutors usually seek.
</P>
<P>
   With no trial, Baltimore Gun Smith kept selling hundreds of guns
that turned up in crimes in the city, police found, and the ATF's
agents kept trying to catch DiMartino. In 1996 they mounted an
undercover operation. They could not take the easy path, posing as
felons, since federal courts had ruled that the buyer must be an
actual felon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, an agent posing as a waitress and equipped with a
hidden tape recorder bought a .22-caliber Beretta pistol at the
store, saying she was buying it for a convicted murderer whom
DiMartino knew. Again, the U.S. attorney's office declined to
prosecute. Even if DiMartino was convicted, which would be
difficult, he might simply transfer his firearms license to his
son, who worked in the store, agents say the prosecutor's office
told them.
</P>
<P>
   DiMartino's license was up for renewal at the time. But Mike
Campbell, a spokesman for the ATF in Baltimore, said federal law
required the bureau to hold off on any revocation and automatically
renew a license during a criminal investigation to insure citizens'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last March the agency scheduled a revocation hearing, but it was
postponed when a firearms agent who had been part of the
investigation could not attend because he had been transferred to
another city. No new date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Baltimore Gun Smith, Richard Karceski, said his
client had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   NRA chief lobbyist James Baker said that dealers who violate the
law ``ought to be prosecuted,'' but that the McClure-Volkmer
standards ``were put in to protect law-abiding people from
well-documented abuses by ATF.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think forcing ATF and the Justice Department to prove
a case should prevent effective law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bochniak, who is now assigned to a special new gun squad,
said, ``From the point of view of local law enforcement, all this
is very frustrating. Whose fault is it? Should people sue the gun
dealer, or the ATF that failed to shut the store down?''
</P>
<P>
   The fault, he said, is ``in the law, and all the judges and
politicians that don't take guns seriously.''

<P>
   THE BLAME: Finding Fault With Congress
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the oddities of the gun laws can mar even a successful
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   B&AMP;E Guns, which operates from a strip mall in Cypress, Calif.,
is the second largest dealer in the state. Firearms agents had long
been suspicious about B&AMP;E Guns, and in 1990 got the owner's license
revoked for forging records of his purchases and sales. But that
did not deter the owner, Robert Komor. He simply transferred the
license to his wife, Esperanza Juan-Komor, said Tom Makar, the
agent who handled the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, more than 200 guns that the ATF had traced to
B&AMP;E Guns began showing up in murders, robberies and shootings in
Southern California. Other guns traced to B&AMP;E Guns were being
smuggled into Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau raided B&AMP;E Guns, and after its agents pored through
the shop's files they found that it had illegally sold about 9,000
guns in less than two years, Makar said, one of the biggest such
sales in the United States. The store had improperly accounted for
the sale of 3,000 of the guns by listing them as having been sold
to other dealers who were unaware of the transactions. There were
no records at all for the remaining 6,000 guns, Makar said, even
though manufacturers and wholesalers reported that they had sold
the guns to B&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lucrative operation, agents said, because a gun with no
paper trail could be sold to criminals for double the normal
markup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the case, the U.S. attorney's office
in Los Angeles last year allowed the Komors' son, Zak Komor, who
was the store's manager, to plead guilty to only five counts of
causing a false statement to be made in B&AMP;E's record books
involving just 24 guns. He was sentenced to a year in prison. No
one else at B&AMP;E Guns was prosecuted, and the store is still open.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brush, Komor's lawyer, said the ATF's claim that 9,000
guns were involved was exaggerated. The Komors' mistake, he said,
was just ``sloppiness in record keeping, not an attempt to put guns
in the hands of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office declined to answer questions about
the deal, saying the court records were under seal. But several
agents familiar with the case said they believed that prosecutors
had simply run up against the McClure-Volkmer law, which reduced
fraudulent record-keeping by a dealer to a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Vizzard, the former ATF agent in Sacramento, says the problems
with gun control lie in Congress. He recalled that at Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings in 1995 into the deadly standoff
between government agents and white separatists at Ruby Ridge,
Idaho, a number of senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, had
grilled firearms agent Herb Byerly on his decision to arrest
separatist Randy Weaver after Weaver had sold an informer two
sawed-off shotguns and offered to sell him five more.
</P>
<P>
   If Weaver had sold only two sawed-off shotguns, said Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., ``It is a little hard to understand how you can say
to this subcommittee that this man has a profile as a gun
trafficker.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the hearings on television, Vizzard said he wondered if
Congress took gun crimes seriously. For one thing, selling or even
possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun is a felony. But what
would the senators have said, he wondered, if it had been a young
boy selling just two vials of crack cocaine? That is punishable by
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   And what would the senators say now, after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April? Two of the
four guns the teen-age killers used _ and the ones that claimed the
most victims _ were sawed-off shotguns. Would the senators still
say, Vizzard wondered, ``only two sawed-off shotguns?''

MOWLAM SAYS IRISH-AMERICANS CAN HELP RESTART PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Irish-Americans could help revive the stalled Good
Friday peace process, British minister Mo Mowlam said Wednesday, by
pressuring Northern Ireland's republicans to start surrendering the
IRA's hidden arsenals of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist political leaders need prodding as well, Mowlam said in
a press conference here, but she noted that the close ties between
America's Irish-Catholic community and its counterpart in Northern
Ireland gave Irish-Americans a special opportunity to help
jump-start the stymied peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam, the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland
affairs, praised the republican Sinn Fein party's commitment to the
peace process, but said that Americans had a mistaken impression
``Unionism is to blame for everything'' in the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Sinn Fein has made critical progress'' and ``moved in a
year further than anyone thought possible,'' Mowlam said, Catholics
on both sides of the Atlantic need to recognize the obstacles that
Protestant political leaders face as well.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate unionist leaders like David Trimble face a significant
portion of their constituency, led by extremists like the Rev. Ian
Paisley, that views Sinn Fein as a terrorist front. For many of the
North's Protestants, she said, sharing power with Sinn Fein is
``like sitting down at a table with the people who did the
Oklahoma'' City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sinn Fein would ``take the moral high ground, begin that
decommissioning'' of some of the hidden arsenals of IRA arms, said
Mowlam, it would ``show people they are serious'' and move the
peace process forward ``very very quickly.'' Instead, said Mowlam,
Sinn Fein leaders have taken a ``mechanistic'' view of the
agreement, which did not require immediate disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam is visiting Washington, New York and Boston this week to
brief US government officials and the American Irish community.
Former US Senator George Mitchell of Maine, who helped shepherd the
warring factions toward signing the historic Good Friday accord in
1998, was back in Belfast Wednesday, holding talks with Catholic
and Protestant leaders. The two sides failed to meet the latest
deadline to form a common government last week when unionists
demanded the republicans make further progress toward the
decommissioning of arms.
</P>
<P>
   In his own press conference Wednesday, President Clinton
disagreed with a reporter who suggested that US involvement in
Northern Ireland was a waste of time, given the intransigence of
the North's politicians and the competing claims of ethnic and
tribal strife in Africa and other parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of America's ties to Britain and Ireland, said Clinton,
``I don't agree that we've misplaced our energies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam pointed to the relative calm that met this summer's
Protestant marching season, in which unionist organizations staged
annual parades without the usual outbreak of violence, as a further
sign of hope in Ulster.

POLITICAL PLAYERS CAUTIOUSLY EMERGE IN CONGO CEASE-FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ The longtime opposition politician sat
comfortably on his front porch one day this week, an arm's length
from a cell phone that pealed with a call every few minutes. Having
just emerged from 18 months in prison for criticizing President
Laurent Kabila, the politician, Joseph Olenghankoy, was inclined to
be generous.
</P>
<P>
   Olenghankoy's body had suffered in prison, but after a month's
freedom it was nicely filling the chair under it. His mother had
died during his incarceration, but his wife, an American, and two
children were safe in the United States. His generosity, it seemed,
extended even to opposing sides in Congo's one-year-old war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning to go see my old friend Jean-Pierre soon _ he's a
confrere,'' Olenghankoy said of Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of
one of the two main rebel movements. And what of Kabila, the man
who threw him in jail? ``Kabila can change. He's a human being that
God created with ears.''
</P>
<P>
   God also gave Olenghankoy fingers, and at least one was pointing
in the air and testing the political winds. Congo's political
parties, once significant players in the Zaire of Mobutu Sese Seko,
have since been reduced to irrelevance, having been ignored or
suppressed by Kabila since his ascendancy two years ago, and
overshadowed by combatants since the outbreak of war.
</P>
<P>
   But now they are stirring back to life. Their immediate reason
for hope is the recent cease-fire accord signed in Lusaka, Zambia,
by the half-dozen warring countries, though not yet by the two main
rebel movements. According to the agreement, a cease-fire is to be
followed quickly by a national conference at which the Kabila
government, the rebel movements, the political parties and other
members of civil society will convene and try to forge a
reconstruction program for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there will be a dialogue is the first glimmer of
hope we have had in a long time,'' said Francois Lumumba, the
leader of the Congolese National Movement of Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
   But the political parties, short on members, ideas and basic
organization, appear less concerned with preparing for a national
conference than with positioning themselves for any political or
military shift. At any conference, the Kabila government and the
rebels will enjoy the biggest bargaining chips, so Congo's
political class will likely have to seek its share through
alignments.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the military situation is far from settled. Despite
the accord, the rebels have continued to fight. In the north,
Bemba's group even seized a new town, Gemena, on his path toward
the city of Mbandaka, which lies at the critical confluence of the
Congo River and tributaries reaching into the interior.
</P>
<P>
   In the south, another rebel group is close to the city of
Mbuji-Mayi, the country's diamond center and the only real source
of cash for the Kabila government's war efforts. If Mbuji-Mayi
falls _ an event that would very probably be preceded by the
bloodiest battle in the war _ the Kinshasa government is next, the
logic goes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this uncertainty, many leaders of Congo's political class
are trying not to be left out in the cold any longer. During the
war that brought Kabila to Kinshasa, many here initially denounced
him as a puppet of Rwanda and Uganda, his sponsors; once it became
clear that he would defeat Mobutu, they cheered him on.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, however, Kabila dismissed Congo's entire
political class as opportunists who either collaborated with Mobutu
or opposed him, led by what proved more lucrative to them at any
given point. Many politicians recall with bitterness their
unrequited attempts to meet Kabila: the letters never answered,
phone calls never taken and cars left waiting at the gates of the
Marble Palace, the presidential home built by Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Kabila's criticism was pointing out the obvious,
without making attempts at reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, under pressure at home and from the West, Mobutu
permitted the formation of political parties in addition to his
own, the Popular Revolutionary Movement. After initially allowing
only the Union for Democracy and Social Progress to operate, the
longtime dictator opened the door to an unlimited number of
parties, which were said to have numbered as many as 400 at one
point. But the parties allowed Mobutu to keep his grip on power,
despite the apparent political reforms. Mobutu pitted the parties
against one another, and even bankrolled some of them outright.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, parties were allowed to criticize Mobutu and to
play a part in the game. Kabila put an end to this situation on his
arrival by banning political activities and arresting those who
continued to engage in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the Mobutu era, we had won certain privileges,''
Lumumba said. ``These were all swept away by Kabila.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumumba heads one of countless parties claiming to be the
rightful heir to his father, Patrice Lumumba, the first prime
minister of Congo after independence from Belgium in 1960, who was
later assassinated. That fact underscores one of the fundamental
problems bedeviling Congo's political system, Congolese experts and
Western diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   In the leader-take-all political culture inherited from Mobutu,
parties are fragmented because although the leaders can expect some
gain from their status, members or organizers get nothing. The
result is that most parties have no basis beyond their leadership,
the experts say, adding that the leaders tend to regard their
parties as a form of entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Many parties appear to have also lost their footing because
their raison d'etre _ opposing Mobutu _ has disappeared. The oldest
opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress _
whose leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, embodied the opposition against
Mobutu _ has shrunk in recent years and is now made up mainly of
members of Tshisekedi's own ethnic group, according to Congolese
political analysts and Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Joseph Mukendi, Tshisekedi's political adviser, waved away
any discussion of the party's ethnic makeup, acknowledging,
however, that his party had been weakened. ``This dictatorship
weakened us,'' he said. ``We can't hide that. Our activities have
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other parties, Mukendi's could not provide membership
figures. The party's records, he said, had been destroyed in a fire
set by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the Kabila government issued a decree
permitting the registration of political parties provided they met
certain criteria. Not a single party has registered yet, though it
is unclear whether it is because they are incapable of meeting
legitimate criteria or, as the parties argue, the requirements are
too onerous.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for an agenda the Union for Democracy expects to present at a
national conference, Mukendi said it would push for a resumption of
the political reforms set forth in the 1992 national conference. At
that conference, Tshisekedi was named prime minister but was
dismissed the following year by Mobutu. Following the 1992
conference, new participants on the political scene, the parties
and Mobutu showed themselves incapable of setting up a workable
system for the country.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Tshisekedi considers himself this country's
legitimate prime minister. Asked whether the political parties
would not find themselves in a weak position at a future national
conference, sandwiched between the government and armed rebellions,
Mukendi said: ``We have the strongest army. We have the army of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the war, as well as the absence of political expression
and free media in Congo, that statement is hard to verify. But
conversations with many residents of the capital revealed little
enthusiasm for the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties were all creations of Mobutu,'' said Elie
Mapwanga, a businessman who said he once belonged to Tshisekedi's
party. ``Some were for him and others were against him, but they
were all created by him. But now that the boss is dead, these
enterprises don't know how to function anymore.''

KENNEDY PATRIARCH FACES GRIM TASK WITH STOICISM, DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENEMSHA, Mass. _ On a blissfully beautiful summer day, US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy embarked on yet another journey of
excruciating sadness Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For here, in a picturesque harbor of fishing boats and weathered
shingles, Kennedy boarded a Coast Guard vessel that would bear him
to the body of his nephew. After another shocking death, it was yet
another time for the patriarch of America's most famous family to
bear the burden of personal tragedy with dignity and stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of dwindling hope and mournful vigil, John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s body, along with those of his wife and her sister,
had finally been found on the ocean floor. The elder Kennedy, as he
had done so often before, roused himself amid his grief and strode
into the public eye to do the family's sorrowful business.
</P>
<P>
   As oblivious tourists crowded the beach and snackshops here, a
Coast Guard helicopter swept low over the cottages, brush and salt
marshes of Menemsha to deliver Kennedy and two of his sons to the
Coast Guard station. From there, the Kennedys were driven 100 yards
down a winding access road to the tip of a long wharf at the end of
a snug and crowded harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Escorted by uniformed state troopers, the family members strode
purposely and at a slightly quickened pace to the Coast Guard
vessel Menemsha. Once on board, the Kennedys took cover in the
boat's cabin as it left the wooden dock and dozens of startled
onlookers for a 45-minute trip to the USS Grasp, a salvage ship
positioned above John Kennedy's body and the shattered fuselage of
his single-engine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers said the Coast Guard widened a broad security zone
around the recovery scene even farther just before Kennedy's
arrival. Donny Brice, a 35-year-old restaurateur from neighboring
West Tisbury, had just returned by boat from the perimeter of the
salvage site when Kennedy boarded the Menemsha.
</P>
<P>
   He said he passed an eight-boat flotilla of speeding
law-enforcement craft culled from the Coast Guard, State Police and
state Department of Environmental Management.
</P>
<P>
   On the docks, word of Kennedy's presence spread quickly among
dozens of print and broadcast media, who hastily assembled TV
cameras and still-photograph vantage points in case Kennedy chose
to return here.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of reporters and tourists proved to be an uneasy one,
and Menemsha's link to the Kennedy tragedy dampened the day's plans
for some. Paul and Marion McCauley of Marblehead had driven to
Menemsha from their vacation residence on Chappaquiddick Island to
lunch on lobster rolls and enjoy the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing Kennedy changed those plans, and other thoughts about
how to spend their 15th annual vacation on Martha's Vineyard. ``We
thought we'd have a sunset cookout on Menemsha, but tonight doesn't
look like the right night,'' Marion McCauley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' her husband said, peering toward the ocean where Kennedy
had just ventured. ``No, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the image of Ted Kennedy _ his head bowed,
his face tight with grief _ has been a bitter symbol of another
tragedy befallen a family who has endured so much.
</P>
<P>
   The renewal of that grim responsibility Wednesday saddened
visitors and Vineyarders alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' Brice said. ``What a day for Ted, to go see his
beautiful nephew. I'm not a Ted Kennedy fan, to be honest with you,
but I feel for him today. The poor guy.''

INTERNET COMPANIES EXPANDING TO REGIONS OUTSIDE SILICON VALLEY,
STUDY SHOWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Texas, Mass., D.C.)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ ``Don't look back,'' the legendary baseball
pitcher Satchel Paige once said. ``Something might be gaining on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth of that warning was driven home Wednesday to a group
of Silicon Valley business and civic leaders when a survey they had
commissioned showed that the booming Internet economy is
decentralizing technology industries and threatening Silicon
Valley's domination of all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, said its
survey showed that Internet companies _ and the economic growth
they reap _ are expanding rapidly in seven regions outside of the
Valley: Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin, Texas, Boston, New York, the
District of Columbia and San Francisco's ``Multimedia Gulch.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Joint Venture by A.T. Kearney, a
business consulting firm. Its findings were based on surveys and
interviews with 125 executives of Internet companies in an effort
to provide a portrait of an industry that, according to a study by
the University of Texas Center for Research in Electronic Commerce,
accounted for 1.2 million jobs and $300 billion in revenues in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that the Internet, which has been spurred largely
by networking and software technologies commercialized and invented
in Silicon Valley, is making it possible for new economic activity
to rapidly spread beyond the Valley's borders.
</P>
<P>
   As a loosely defined geographic region, Silicon Valley now
describes an area bordered by San Mateo on the north to far past
San Jose on the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot expect the past dominance in high-tech will ensure
future dominance of the merging Internet industry,'' said Ruben
Barrales, president and chief executive of Joint Venture. The
challenge for Silicon Valley, he said, was ``how to remain the
geographic center of an inherently locationless medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Each new industry that has emerged based on the increasing power
of the integrated circuit has eventually spilled over the Valley's
borders into areas that quickly donned imitative names like Silicon
Mountains, Silicon Desert and Silicon Alley. Outside the United
States, it has generated vast manufacturing and design outposts in
Asia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing concern that increasing
quality-of-life concerns as well as the rapid depletion of skilled
workers relative to demand is encouraging companies that would have
located in the Valley to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of the executives surveyed reported access
to talent as a factor in determining the location of their Internet
companies. In the Valley, the skilled work force shortfall is
estimated to be as high as 160,000 workers, equivalent to almost 33
percent of the entire labor demand of high-tech industries in the
United States, according to A.T. Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, a number of technology executives and
government officials spoke defensively Wednesday about the
strengths the region still offered as a result of its
entrepreneurial culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an extremely strong work ethic here,'' said Arife
Janjua, vice president and general manager of Saraide.com, a
wireless Internet services company. ``People are willing to go the
distance for the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives gave examples of the hypergrowth that continues
to set the Valley apart. Rod Schrock, president and chief executive
of the Altavista Company, said that his Valley-based business had
grown from 55 employees to more than 500 in the past six months and
was now hiring 8 to 10 new employees a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You could not achieve this kind of growth anywhere but in
Silicon Valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is growing concern that congestion in
the Valley is reaching historic proportions and that housing costs
which once required that a household have two breadwinners, are now
spiraling so high that each home will instead soon require two
instant-millionaire beneficiaries of initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer see ourselves as a suburban community,'' said
Richard Gordon, a San Mateo County Supervisor. ``We have to see
ourselves as an urban environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing anxiety that the Valley's best days may be
behind it, there was a general consensus among those who spoke at a
news conference here Wednesday that the Valley's culture, built
largely by entrepreneurs and based on meritocracy, was still
unmatched anywhere in the world.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three follow-ups:
</P>
<P>
   - A ban on casual cotton pants is gone from the dress code
proposed for Sprint's new Overland Park, Kan., office park.
</P>
<P>
   The dress code draft, the subject of this column two weeks ago,
generated uncommon feedback. Three readers applauded strict dress
standards for maintaining quality and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more said the ban on Dockers-type pants was out of touch
with work and life today. Sprint workers said revamping their
wardrobes would amount to a pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who wanted attention on their production rather
than their crease lines were computer experts working at Sprint on
a contract basis. They said they wouldn't stew about meeting the
new code; they'd just find work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There's something for tight-labor-market recruiters to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, employee focus groups shared their thoughts. That
feedback is helping rework the policy, which will evolve until it
becomes final in the fall, a Sprint spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton-clad Sprint workers now say they _ ha-ha _ won't need to
scour thrift shops for polyester pants to comply with the code.
</P>
<P>
   - Last week this space told how QuikTrip convenience stores have
earned fans. I expected a backlash from naysayers who are typically
the first _ and sometimes only _ ones who respond to positive
publicity about companies or individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said her father felt shoved out of his longtime
QuikTrip job in favor of a younger, lower-paid person. That was it
for the negative response, and even she said the family remained
loyal to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen phone messages, e-mails and handwritten letters came
from customers, employees and suppliers. That may not sound like a
lot, but believe me, people are far less likely to send compliments
than criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   All said they felt valued at QuikTrip. They used such words as
courteous, clean, excellent, friendly, better, refreshing,
efficient, loyal, polished, pride, different and generous. They
praised the stores for treating workers and customers well.
</P>
<P>
   And from several readers came something else I didn't know: You
can get a pretty good poor-boy sandwich for a buck.
</P>
<P>
   - Two Sundays ago in our Careers section, I mentioned an
unsatisfying customer-service experience in an unnamed hardware
store. Two hardware store managers (from other companies) seized
the marketing day and invited my patronage.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting response, though, came from reader Rick
Eubank, who wrote of his experiences in poorly paid retail
positions under managers and owners who took advantage of workers.
He said customers shouldn't expect good service under those
conditions. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you traded at a hardware store and found the service to be
poor, just inquire of the manager (if you can find one) what he
pays his full-time help, then you will have an appropriate
perspective based on reality rather than your snooty self-centered
attitude and unreasonable expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you think of that?

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATRIARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was presiding over the Senate in Washington when
the news came that his brother, the president, was dead in Dallas.
He was campaigning in San Francisco when his other brother, Bobby,
was shot in Los Angeles. He was awaiting a niece's wedding in
Hyannis Port when his nephew, John Jr., died as his plane plunged
into the sea off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy sought a Senate leadership position
and couldn't hold it. He sought the presidency and lost a bitter
nomination struggle. But the job he didn't seek is the one he can't
shake: He is the Kennedy family patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   In a family of fateful accidents, here is one to contemplate _
the ascendancy of the youngest brother, playing the role of family
leader longer, and better, than anyone else, through more
heartbreak, more anguish, more tragedy than anyone could have
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   For the three decades leading to 1968 _ when they were young and
Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was the giant in the family
circle; as they grew older and young Joe was being groomed for
greatness; as they tasted real political power when Jack was a vice
presidential candidate, then the Democratic nominee and finally the
president; as the grief over the assassination lingered and Bobby's
political passion sharpened _ through all that time, no one looked
to the youngest brother for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No one, especially after the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at
Chappaquiddick in 1969, the break-up of his marriage to Joan
Kennedy, and his reputation for high-living.
</P>
<P>
   No one suspected he'd be the big oak in the forest, the one to
lean on, the one to bear the sorrow and the sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after accidents and deaths and scandals, several involving
Senator Kennedy himself, the astonishing has become the
commonplace. Even his most ardent foes, who assail his ideology
even as they question his morality, acknowledge the role that
Edward Moore Kennedy has come to play in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that no family should have to endure the level of
tragedy that has befallen the Kennedys,'' said Senator Orrin G.
Hatch, the Republican from Utah. ``I will say to the senator from
Massachusetts: America mourns with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, the Democrat from South
Dakota, pleaded from the floor: ``Senator Kennedy, please _ if
there is any way _ let us help you carry your grief, if you grow
tired. You and your family have given our nation so much. Let us _
if we can _ give something back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the family that has given so much has been through so much.
The senator, alone among the family members, has witnessed every
tragic turn.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Drayne, who served as Kennedy's press secretary in the
1960s and early 1970s and, until his death in 1987, remained close
to the senator, once related that when Joseph P. Kennedy died in
1969, the sole suriviving son took a sleeping bag and kept vigil in
the room at the ambassador's Hyannis Port home where the casket
remained until the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   As his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, approached death in
January 1995, all the family members gathered at the senator's
house. When she passed away, he brought people together, holding
them together in part by holding them.
</P>
<P>
   Though on the surface he appears stout and stout-hearted,
striding bravely to a boat Wednesday that took him to the ocean
site of his nephew's death, Senator Kennedy has spent the week in
silent contemplation, breaking only to visit Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg in New York and then returning to his home in the
family compound, sitting alone.
</P>
<P>
   He reached Los Angeles hours after Senator Robert F. Kennedy was
shot, and after all the life-saving efforts expired, he stood,
alone, in the bathroom of the room where his brother's body lay,
leaning against the sink, a look on his face beyond agony, his
mouth twisted and open, a scene so stark that an observer couldn't
bear to look more than a moment or two. It was the private grief of
a public man.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the grief has come responsibility. He has been _
everyone in the Kennedy circle unfailingly uses this phrase _ a
surrogate father for the two children of John Kennedy and the 11
children of Robert Kennedy, serving as godfather to several of them
_ and as godfather to Caroline's daughter, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy staff members recall that over the years, all of them
would visit the Kennedy office on Capitol Hill, many serving as
interns, the remaining brother insisting that they all come to
understand the kind of work their fathers did in the Senate.
Sometimes a clutch of them would turn up on days of early school
dismissal, and when they were young the senator would play
hide-and-seek with them.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the senator would take many of them on camping
trips to western Massachusetts, a tradition that became so revered
that not long ago Rory, whose wedding was postponed Saturday by
this summer's tragedy, organized a camping trip to revisit those
days, and so the whole brood retraced the route, and their roots.
</P>
<P>
   When his own son, Edward M. Kennedy Jr., developed cancer, it
was the senator who had to tell him that he would lose his leg. He
was with his son when the he went into surgery and saw him come
out, and then he whipped off to Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown
and walked niece Kathleen Kennedy down the aisle when she married
David Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   He kissed her on the steps when she came out and returned to the
hospital. Then he learned how to give injections for the antidote
to chemotherapy every four hours so he could bring young Teddy home
a day early. That knowledge would come in handy, permitting the
senator to give emergency injections after son Patrick's
particularly severe asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, now a congressman from Rhode Island, began to describe
him as his night nurse. He is, in truth, night nurse to an entire
family. Right now he is on duty again.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN ADMITS IT DUMPED OIL AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the world's
second-largest cruise ship line, pled guilty Wednesday to routinely
dumping oil and hazardous chemicals from nine ships in coastal
waters around the United States, and admitted that one ship
continued to dump a month after the company had been convicted on
earlier charges and promised to stop polluting.
</P>
<P>
   The company admitted it had dumped toxic solvents in New York
Harbor; had dumped oil and toxic chemicals in Miami, the Virgin
Islands, Los Angeles and the Inside Passage in Alaska, and had
repeatedly lied to the Coast Guard about pollution. It pled guilty
to 21 ``representative counts'' in six cities, and promised to pay
an $18 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Reno, the attorney general, said in a news conference that
the fine, assuming the deal is accepted by judges, was the largest
ever brought against a cruise line, and that the dumping was ``on a
scale far greater than previously acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the cruise line pled guilty to nine counts in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, and Miami, paid $9 million in fines, and
promised to stop polluting. The earlier pleas were for obstruction
of justice, a fleet-wide conspiracy to dump oil, and lying to the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company also admitted putting dry-cleaning fluid
and silver nitrate from photography shops, both of which are
dangerous pollutants, into ``gray water,'' which is water from
sinks and showers, which is routinely discharged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A statement signed by the company's president said, for example,
that the Song of America, one of the ships, visited the Port of New
York weekly in the summer and fall of 1994 and 1995, and drained
about 50 gallons each week from the photo labs, including silver
nitrate, which is toxic, and 20 gallons a month from the
dry-cleaning shop, including perchlorethylene, which is also toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Some ships also dumped toxic chemicals from printing presses.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's initial guilty plea in June 1998 highlighted
the difficulty faced by U.S. authorities in regulating and
prosecuting the cruise industry. The ships fly foreign flags, and
the parent companies are registered in foreign countries, often
putting them outside the reach of the authorities in this country.
Royal Caribbean entered the first guilty plea only after a federal
judge in Miami rejected arguments by the company's lawyers that the
United States had no jurisdiction over its dumping activities.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Congress and the American-owned shipping industry
have argued that new regulations might be required to ensure that
the foreign-owned cruise industry meets U.S. environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even as federal prosecutors were announcing the pleas, in which
the company acknowledged deliberate violation of federal water
pollution laws, the cruise line issued a press release saying the
hazardous chemical dumping was a ``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Martenstein, a spokeswoman for the company, which is based
in Miami, said, ``we did think we were complying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement signed by the company's president, which was
submitted to the six U.S. district judges who must approve the plea
agreement, says that the company ``knew that these harmful
chemicals were contaminating the gray water.'' And, according to
the statement submitted to the judges, an outside auditor brought
in by company executives warned Royal Caribbean twice in 1998 that
it was dumping materials into the gray water system that did not
belong there.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Martenstein was asked about the statement, she said it
had been drafted by the Justice Department. She said that the
auditors later said that the gray water was legal to dump.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Udell, a Justice Department lawyer prosecuting the
case, said, ``The Department of Justice is not prosecuting mistakes
here.'' The company, he said, ``has been prosecuted for deliberate
violations of the law which it has admitted to in court papers but
not to the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven P. Solow, chief of the environmental crimes section,
said, ``They negotiated that statement with us, line by line, and
signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The company president, Jack Williams, said in a statement, ``We
are profoundly sorry that a group of our employees knowingly
violated environmental laws and our own company policy.''
Prosecutors said that by dumping oily wastes, the company had saved
tens of thousands of dollars per ship each year on oil filters, and
the expense of dockside disposal of hundreds of thousands of
gallons per ship each year, and that ship engineers won bonuses for
minimizing expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean had gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid
prosecution, including hiring two former U.S. attorneys general,
Elliot Richardson and Benjamin Civiletti, to argue that it was
immune from prosecution here because its ships fly the flags of
Liberia and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The company did make a major concession to prosecutors, though,
agreeing to cooperate as the government seeks additional
indictments. In the original guilty pleas, in June 1998, on the eve
of a trial in Miami, the company admitted to breaking the law but
declined to cooperate further.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to extend a court-supervised probation
program from the two jurisdictions where it has previously pled
guilty, Miami and Puerto Rico, to include New York, Los Angeles,
Anchorage, Alaska, and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Solow said that the fact that the Nordic Empress continued
dumping after the guilty pleas showed that the company ``had a
culture of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to turn around,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Martenstein said the company had discovered that last
incident itself, reported it to the government and fired the ship's
chief engineer. He fled the country, prosecutors say. Court papers
said the government knew about the incident before the company
reported it.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that at the time of the first round of guilty pleas,
``Royal Caribbean gambled that we would not learn more about its
illegal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gambled, and it lost,'' she said. ``If people flimflam us,
they should expect the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno added, ``Our waters are far more fragile than people give
them credit for, and we have got to stop messing them up, if we
want to preserve the way of life we can for our children and our
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ships that illegally dumped were the Sovereign of the
Seas, the Majesty of the Seas, the Grandeur of the Seas, the Song
of Norway, the Sun Viking, the Monarch of the Seas and the Nordic
Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, a newsletter that
follows the industry closely, said that when Royal Caribbean was
fined $9 million last year, it didn't seem to effect business.
``The feeling might have been that those violations were old ones,
so why worry about it,'' he said. ``But the latest violations
appear to be a lot broader and a lot more serious, and they could
have a broad effect.''

DISCOVERY OF VICTIMS RENEWS OUTPOURING OF GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND RYAN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lea Morgan spent four days transfixed by the
television, clinging to slivers of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   She cried as she searched wide-shots of blue ocean for signs of
hope. She knew it made no sense, but still she believed John
Kennedy Jr. would be found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he was on the island,'' she said. ``As far as him
being athletic, I thought he was the kind of person who could
survive this.''
</P>
<P>
   That hope had withstood grim-faced experts, lowered flags, even
published obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Morgan, like the thousands of tearful mourners who
visited the JFK Library to lay tributes and sign the condolence
books, admitted it was over. She added two glittery pink angels and
some flowers to the growing shrine on the wall in front of the
library, already overflowing with carnations and orchids, pretty
handwritten notes, pictures of the president's son as a child, and
plush toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my way of paying respect,'' Morgan said, clutching her
young son to her. ``So I don't cry any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that the bodies of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
and Lauren Bessette had been found Wednesday drove many more
mourners to pay their respects than in previous days.
</P>
<P>
   Makeshift shrines, which have sprung up not just at Kennedy's
apartment building in New York, and the library, but in many places
connected with his family, grew higher and more elaborate, as the
finality of the loss sank in with a public convinced he was one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   At the State House, flowers were placed into the hands of the
statue of President John F. Kennedy, bouquets at his feet. A black
book in a clear plastic cover was laid on the pedestal with a note
that said ``Write your thoughts if you like.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people filed into Rep. Patrick Kennedy's office in
Pawtucket, R.I. to sign a maroon memorial book placed on his desk,
a desk which had once belonged to John F. Kennedy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been almost like a wake,'' press secretary Larry Berman
said. ``We've just been getting so many phone calls and emails and
cards, we felt there should be some sort of way for people to
express their sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners made pilgrimages to Holyhood Cemetery, in Brookline,
too, to visit the ivy-covered graves of Joseph and Rose Kennedy,
and of John Kennedy Jr.'s cousins Michael and David.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Shulman, of West Newton, and Marcy Frankel, of Brookline,
rode their bikes there after they heard Kennedy's body had been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But their grief for the young publisher spilled over onto the
rest of the family, too, as it did at other shrines, as the latest
tragedy to befall the storied family merged into all those that
came before it.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jewish tradition, the women laid stones on Rose
Kennedy's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the sweetheart of the family,'' Frankel said. ``We
came to pay respects and see if other people had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   They had. Three bouquets and a plastic-covered picture of
Kennedy and his wife were laid at the tombstones.
</P>
<P>
   As the women sat on the grass beside the grave a delivery man
laid an elaborate bouquet of roses, sunflowers, peonies, and
gerberas at the matriarch's headstone.
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned note said: ``We miss you, mother. We love you.''
The Kennedy Library has been inundated with people willing to stand
in line for up to an hour to sign the condolence book. A second
book was also added Wednesday, and all of the tributes will be
presented to Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg when she next visits the
library.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesperson Tom McNaught said 1,100 visitors bought tickets to
the library Tuesday, twice the usual number, and he estimated that
a further 400 visitors went to the lobby to write sympathy notes.
McNaught expected many more visitors than that Wednesday. By 4
p.m., the shrine outside the library had already grown twice as big
as it had been the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have come today if they hadn't found
John Kennedy's body,'' said Ruth Carrington, of Milton. ``I would
have come later, but it was more urgent to come today. I'm glad
they found him, so we could bring some closure for the Kennedys.''
</P>
<P>
   Teena Enakis, of Boston, visited the library because she was
finally sure Kennedy, his wife, and his sister-in-law were truly
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because they found him,'' she said. ``Until now, it was
a mystery, and there were no witnesses whether the plane went down.
It seemed like it took a while (to prove it). So now, we're closing
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Bolster, who described herself as a baby boomer raised in a
large Irish-Catholic family, and whose father campaigned for John
F. Kennedy during his run for the presidency, said she had come to
the library not just for the younger Kennedy, but for the whole
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate them,'' she said. ``This adds another
tragedy in a continuing story. Growing up, they were so sacred to
us. There was the Pope, the church, and the Kennedys. They
dignified us.''

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It was another routine transaction in the deadly
business of how criminals get their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, a stranger paid 21-year-old Tia Branch $200,
drove her to the Baltimore Gun Smith store near her housing project
and showed her a $700 semiautomatic pistol he wanted. Outside the
store, he gave her the money for the gun, and she went back in and
bought it. As a convicted felon, he was barred by federal law from
buying a gun himself.
</P>
<P>
   The sales clerk did not question the young woman, although
law-enforcement officials said the clerk should have known from the
couple's behavior that it was an illegal straw purchase. Baltimore
Gun Smith has made so many similar sales, they said, that the store
is responsible for selling 20 percent of the guns used in crimes
that Baltimore police have traced in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that record, despite investigations going back to 1991
and despite several attempted prosecutions, Baltimore Gun Smith is
still open for business, a large sign in the shape of a Colt
revolver hanging over its doorway.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress debates gun control, the gun industry and its
supporters often say that the United States has enough gun laws
already, that what is lacking is enforcement. But a review of cases
like the Baltimore Gun Smith, and of the agency charged with
enforcing federal gun laws, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, reveals a much more complicated situation.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, an arm of the Treasury Department, was created with
limited power, has existed under constant threat of attack by the
National Rifle Association, has been kept short-staffed and is
charged with enforcing laws often written to make prosecutions
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the ATF also shows a major distinction in its
approach to the job. Historically, it has arrested a sizable number
of criminals who use guns in robberies or drug sales, particularly
career criminals with three or more convictions. These are
considered safe cases that do not arouse NRA opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the bureau has been less aggressive in what is
now being recognized as a critical part of gun control: going after
illegal gun traffickers and the small number of corrupt dealers,
among the 104,855 federally licensed dealers, who supply guns to
criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   While half of all crime guns traced by the ATF in the past two
years were traced to just 389 dealers, only 42 dealers were
recommended for prosecution last year, and only 19 had their
licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot of vigor in gun enforcement,'' said
Julius Wachtel, who retired last year after 23 years as a firearms
agent. When it comes to investigating dealers, traffickers or gun
shows, he said, the agents have a saying: ``No cases, no waves.
Little cases, little waves. Big cases, big waves. All those years
of being hammered by Congress have had a chilling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ATF Director John McGaw acknowledged in an interview: ``I
virtually never use the term `gun control' because that would make
us anti-gun. Everything we touch is unpopular and controversial, so
we have to be very careful to do what Congress has decided we
should and be neutral regulators, not take sides in the gun
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under McGaw, a former director of the Secret Service who became
director of the ATF in 1993, after the raid on the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, the number of gun trafficking cases
recommended for prosecution rose to 788 in 1998, up from 533 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with what McGaw sees as his congressional mandate, he
has formulated a policy of treating gun dealers as ``partners,''
members of the legitimate firearms industry, whom agents often
depend on for tips about straw purchases or gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's small size _ its 1,631 agents are only 9 more than
in 1973 _ means it sometimes must forgo investigations, prosecutors
said. And the agents must spend much of their time investigating
bombings and arsons, as well as enforcing the laws on alcohol and
collecting tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the number of agents in the Drug Enforcement
Administration has grown to 4,515 today, from 1,370 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that Congress has never decided it is serious about
going after gun trafficking the way it is about the war on drugs,''
said David Yassky, an assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School
and a Democratic counsel to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With drugs, we've realized we've got to go all the way up the
chain,'' Yassky said. ``If all you do is arrest the crack addict,
we won't get anywhere. But with guns, we only arrest the end user,
the shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal gun laws underscore the difference in priority between
drugs, which are illegal to sell, possess and use, and guns, which
start out as legal products, and illustrate the difficulty the
bureau faces in pursuing gun control.
</P>
<P>
   A dealer who sells 1,000 or more guns to criminals might get
only six months in jail, but for drug dealers there are stiff
mandatory minimum prison sentences of up to 25 years, even for
selling small quantities of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover purchases are a common tactic of drug agents, but
appeals courts have reversed convictions gained by firearms agents
posing as felons buying guns. Agents must use an actual convicted
felon in undercover operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, a law
championed by the NRA and sponsored by Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho,
who later retired, and by Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., who lost his
seat in 1996, raised several barriers to prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmer, now living in Hannibal, Mo., said his law is still
necessary to rein in what he sees as an overzealous government
agency. In the minds of firearms agents, Volkmer said, ``It's
almost like, if you are a gun owner or dealer, you're weird or not
legitimate. They believe the only way to resolve violence is to
take away our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The law limited ATF agents to annual inspections of dealers,
reduced record-keeping violations by a dealer from a felony to a
misdemeanor, a disincentive for federal prosecutors in cases where
a dealer has forged or destroyed his records to hide evidence, and
required prosecutors to prove that dealers who sold guns to
criminals or straw purchasers did so ``knowingly and willfully,'' a
nearly insurmountable hurdle, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   It also prohibited the ATF from establishing any national system
of gun registration, which makes tracing the origin of guns used in
crimes much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   `The gun laws weren't very strong to start with,'' said William
Vizzard, a retired firearms agent who is now a professor of
criminal justice at California State University in Sacramento.
``But after McClure-Volkmer, they were Swiss cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ORIGINS: From Moonshine To Gun Control
</P>
<P>
   The ATF's difficulties lie partly in its origins. It was created
with little planning when Congress hastily passed the Gun Control
Act of 1968 following that year's assassinations of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. in April and of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in
June.
</P>
<P>
   That law required that everybody dealing in firearms be licensed
by the federal government, and it prohibited convicted felons,
illegal immigrants and drug addicts from buying guns. The law gave
the government no power to regulate the manufacture, design or
marketing of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who was a member of the NRA board of
directors, had the gun industry exempted from the new Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The agency charged with supervising the 1968 law was the Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax Division of the Treasury Department. Until 1968,
its agents were mainly revenuers, famous in film lore for tracking
down whiskey stills, largely in the Southeast. Most of the agents
themselves were Southerners who grew up with guns and were likely
to be members of the NRA; they had little interest in the new
notion of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, who joined the agency in Phoenix in 1972, the same year
that it was renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
recalled that his first training officer was from Alabama and
``basically knew nothing about firearms trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon Wachtel and other new agents began making some alarming
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked into gun shows and found you could buy a machine
gun, which was illegal, without even having to give your name,''
Wachtel said. They also stumbled on dealers ``who were putting guns
on the streets without paper,'' he said, selling to criminals
without keeping the required records. And Wachtel said they found
that traffickers would buy guns in states with lax gun control
laws, like Georgia or South Carolina, and then drive them north for
resale to criminals in Washington or New York.
</P>
<P>
   In short, by the late 1970s the new agents had an understanding
of how guns moved quickly from manufacturers, wholesalers and
dealers to criminals. But as they began to make criminal cases, gun
industry supporters in Congress held angry hearings into alleged
abuses of law-abiding gun owners and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the NRA, President Ronald Reagan in 1981
announced the elimination of the ATF and many agents were given
layoff notices, until his administration later reconsidered the
action.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the most famous attacks on the ATF, Dingell, who
was influential in the defeat of a gun-control bill in the House in
June, called firearms agents ``a jackbooted group of fascists who
are perhaps as large a danger to American society as I could pick
today.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect itself against criticism of this kind, the ATF in
1979 ordered that any agent who wanted to investigate a gun dealer
had to get permission from headquarters in Washington. This policy
lasted until the Clinton administration. Vizzard remembered ``the
chilling effect'' when he received a reprimand because he was
investigating three corrupt dealers concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University and director of the Boston Gun
Project, the most successful citywide program to stop gun
trafficking, said of the firearms agents: ``These people are
heroes, and the only fair thing to say is that they have been
systematically kept away from doing a vitally important job.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATF operates out of an unremarkable, granite-faced
eight-story building in Washington. By mandate of Congress, 25
percent of the bureau's time must be spent on explosives, a
priority that gained new urgency after the bombing of the federal
building in Oklahoma City in 1995. The bombing was directed against
the ATF office there in retaliation for the bureau's role in the
Branch Davidian raid near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   After the Waco incident, President Clinton appointed McGaw, who
was popular with Republicans, as the new director. McGaw has
emphasized training and professionalism as a way to re-create an
agency that had its start in moonshine and is still regarded as the
blue-collar law enforcement agency, and give it more of a
buttoned-down image like that of the Secret Service or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGaw's most important initiative has been to quadruple the
number of crime guns the ATF traces back to manufacturers and
dealers, which has led to a much clearer understanding of the role
of illegal dealers and traffickers in helping criminals get their
guns. But to make the program more palatable to the NRA, which
always worries about the government's keeping information on guns,
it has officially been described as an effort to stop the flow of
guns to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   McGaw is not one to lead the call for new gun laws, and he makes
no apologies for treating gun dealers as partners. Gun trafficking
is a victimless crime, he says, where no one calls up to report an
illegal sale, so the bureau depends on having good relations with
dealers who can tip it off about suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   McGaw said he was surprised when he took over the ATF and found
that all its functions ``are negatives, are controversial.'' Even
when it investigates white supremacist groups or the bombing of an
abortion clinic, the bureau has drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   So to avoid attacks on the bureau's budget, he tries to steer a
course down the middle. ``For our agents, some of the laws may be
frustrations,'' he said, but he added that these impediments ``tell
us what Congress wants us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PROBLEM: Quirks in the Law Help the Dealer
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials first became interested in Baltimore
Gun Smith in 1991 when Detective Ed Bochniak of the Baltimore
Police Department went to the home of a drug dealer, Anthony Jones,
18, to investigate the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old girl in his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' home, police found receipts showing that Jones'
cousin, Sheila Kelly, had bought eight guns for $5,274 from
Baltimore Gun Smith, and Ms. Kelly later confessed that Jones had
paid her to buy them. The guns included a 40 mm Glock semiautomatic
pistol, two 9 mm Glock semiautomatic pistols, a 9 mm Beretta
semiautomatic pistol with a laser sight and a Cobray Streetsweeper
shotgun. One of the pistols killed the 13-year-old; another had
been used to shoot two drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Bochniak turned over the evidence to the ATF office in
Baltimore. But when firearms agents recommended prosecution to the
U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, they were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney said he could not discuss the
case because no prosecution had been made.
</P>
<P>
   But agents involved in the investigation said they were told the
prosecutor feared that the case would be nearly impossible to
prove, given the quirks in the gun laws. Under the McClure-Volkmer
standard, the agents would have to show that the owner, Anthony
DiMartino, had sold the eight guns to Ms. Kelly knowing that she
was a straw purchaser. In other words, they would have to prove his
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   That would take valuable extra time, the agents were told, and
even if by chance DiMartino was found guilty, the prison sentence
would be only a few months, not the kind of high-profile case that
ambitious federal prosecutors usually seek.
</P>
<P>
   With no trial, Baltimore Gun Smith kept selling hundreds of guns
that turned up in crimes in the city, police found, and the ATF's
agents kept trying to catch DiMartino. In 1996 they mounted an
undercover operation. They could not take the easy path, posing as
felons, since federal courts had ruled that the buyer must be an
actual felon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, an agent posing as a waitress and equipped with a
hidden tape recorder bought a .22-caliber Beretta pistol at the
store, saying she was buying it for a convicted murderer whom
DiMartino knew. Again, the U.S. attorney's office declined to
prosecute. Even if DiMartino was convicted, which would be
difficult, he might simply transfer his firearms license to his
son, who worked in the store, agents say the prosecutor's office
told them.
</P>
<P>
   DiMartino's license was up for renewal at the time. But Mike
Campbell, a spokesman for the ATF in Baltimore, said federal law
required the bureau to hold off on any revocation and automatically
renew a license during a criminal investigation to insure citizens'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last March the agency scheduled a revocation hearing, but it was
postponed when a firearms agent who had been part of the
investigation could not attend because he had been transferred to
another city. No new date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Baltimore Gun Smith, Richard Karceski, said his
client had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   NRA chief lobbyist James Baker said that dealers who violate the
law ``ought to be prosecuted,'' but that the McClure-Volkmer
standards ``were put in to protect law-abiding people from
well-documented abuses by ATF.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think forcing ATF and the Justice Department to prove
a case should prevent effective law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bochniak, who is now assigned to a special new gun squad,
said, ``From the point of view of local law enforcement, all this
is very frustrating. Whose fault is it? Should people sue the gun
dealer, or the ATF that failed to shut the store down?''
</P>
<P>
   The fault, he said, is ``in the law, and all the judges and
politicians that don't take guns seriously.''

<P>
   THE BLAME: Finding Fault With Congress
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the oddities of the gun laws can mar even a successful
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   B&AMP;E Guns, which operates from a strip mall in Cypress, Calif.,
is the second largest dealer in the state. Firearms agents had long
been suspicious about B&AMP;E Guns, and in 1990 got the owner's license
revoked for forging records of his purchases and sales. But that
did not deter the owner, Robert Komor. He simply transferred the
license to his wife, Esperanza Juan-Komor, said Tom Makar, the
agent who handled the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, more than 200 guns that the ATF had traced to
B&AMP;E Guns began showing up in murders, robberies and shootings in
Southern California. Other guns traced to B&AMP;E Guns were being
smuggled into Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau raided B&AMP;E Guns, and after its agents pored through
the shop's files they found that it had illegally sold about 9,000
guns in less than two years, Makar said, one of the biggest such
sales in the United States. The store had improperly accounted for
the sale of 3,000 of the guns by listing them as having been sold
to other dealers who were unaware of the transactions. There were
no records at all for the remaining 6,000 guns, Makar said, even
though manufacturers and wholesalers reported that they had sold
the guns to B&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lucrative operation, agents said, because a gun with no
paper trail could be sold to criminals for double the normal
markup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the case, the U.S. attorney's office
in Los Angeles last year allowed the Komors' son, Zak Komor, who
was the store's manager, to plead guilty to only five counts of
causing a false statement to be made in B&AMP;E's record books
involving just 24 guns. He was sentenced to a year in prison. No
one else at B&AMP;E Guns was prosecuted, and the store is still open.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brush, Komor's lawyer, said the ATF's claim that 9,000
guns were involved was exaggerated. The Komors' mistake, he said,
was just ``sloppiness in record keeping, not an attempt to put guns
in the hands of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office declined to answer questions about
the deal, saying the court records were under seal. But several
agents familiar with the case said they believed that prosecutors
had simply run up against the McClure-Volkmer law, which reduced
fraudulent record-keeping by a dealer to a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Vizzard, the former ATF agent in Sacramento, says the problems
with gun control lie in Congress. He recalled that at Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings in 1995 into the deadly standoff
between government agents and white separatists at Ruby Ridge,
Idaho, a number of senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, had
grilled firearms agent Herb Byerly on his decision to arrest
separatist Randy Weaver after Weaver had sold an informer two
sawed-off shotguns and offered to sell him five more.
</P>
<P>
   If Weaver had sold only two sawed-off shotguns, said Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., ``It is a little hard to understand how you can say
to this subcommittee that this man has a profile as a gun
trafficker.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the hearings on television, Vizzard said he wondered if
Congress took gun crimes seriously. For one thing, selling or even
possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun is a felony. But what
would the senators have said, he wondered, if it had been a young
boy selling just two vials of crack cocaine? That is punishable by
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   And what would the senators say now, after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April? Two of the
four guns the teen-age killers used _ and the ones that claimed the
most victims _ were sawed-off shotguns. Would the senators still
say, Vizzard wondered, ``only two sawed-off shotguns?''

COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF CLINTON EXTENDED SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-six years ago, when Bill Clinton shook
President Kennedy's hand and decided he would try to be president,
John F. Kennedy Jr. was not yet 3 years old. In another four
months, President Kennedy was assassinated and his son didn't
return to the White House _ until President Clinton invited him in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after somberly recounting this story, Clinton gave no
apology for acting as commander in chief in the search for
Kennedy's body, acknowledging that he ordered the Coast Guard to
take a few days longer than usual to complete the job. Clinton said
he believed the nation would understand that he wanted to spare no
expense in helping a family so familiar with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault, I am,'' Clinton said at a White House news conference
dominated by questions about Kennedy's death. ``It was because I
thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clinton said he didn't get involved in the rescue or search
effort until a few days ago. At that point, he said, Coast Guard
officials told him they would normally end their search, but they
urged the president to allow more time because of the availability
of advanced equipment and the national interest in finding Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard felt a capacity to succeed in this, if they
had a few more days, and because of the role of the Kennedy family
in our national lives and because of the enormous losses they have
sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give
them a few more days,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the way the Clinton and Kennedy sagas have
intertwined over the years, an emotional Clinton took a long,
deliberate walk through the White House hallway to meet an
assemblage of reporters waiting in the same East Room often used by
former President Kennedy. In what amounted to an impromptu eulogy,
Clinton recalled playing a small role in helping the younger
Kennedy ``come to terms'' with the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back to the Oval Office, where he saw the desk that he
took the famous picture in,'' Clinton said, referring to the
photograph of the younger Kennedy peering from beneath his father's
desk. Clinton, in a symbol of his ties to the Kennedy legacy, has
been using that desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on a March 8, 1998, visit, Clinton offered Kennedy a tour
of the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took him upstairs and showed him the residence, which he
had not seen since he was a tiny boy,'' Clinton said. ``And I
showed him some of my memorabilia that I had from his father's
service . . . we had a very nice evening and I sent him pictures
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the visit was cathartic for Kennedy, who grew up
with many pictures and stories about his father, but relatively few
firm memories about his time at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he really wanted to come to terms with all of
it,'' Clinton said, leaving unspoken the fact that he and the
nation are now trying to come to terms with death of Kennedy's son.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Clinton has often grieved publicly.
He has dealt with the death of his mother and the suicide of his
deputy counsel, Vincent Foster, as well of the victims of numerous
tragedies such as the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma
City and this year's shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the president made clear the death of the 38-year-old
son of former President Kennedy had severed a treasured
relationship, and he made no apology for the extra government
expense taken to try to find his body, as well as those of his wife
and sister-in-law. Clinton said he first met the younger Kennedy
when Kennedy was an intern at a law firm in Los Angeles ``and we
have been together on many occasions since then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck me was . . . he was a very deliberate
person, as many people have noticed, about . . . when he would be
publicly exposed and all of that,'' Clinton said. ``He had his
mother's care for having a private life. And I'm not sure he wanted
to go back to the White House before he did. But, especially in
light of everything that's happened, I'm glad he had the chance to
come back here one more time and see the residence and know where
he was when he was a little boy. I'm glad he did that. I'm grateful
that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board notified the White
House at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday that Kennedy's body had been located,
but Clinton aides decided against waking the president. Instead,
they briefed him at 9:15 a.m., but the president apparently had
already heard the news on the morning television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delayed his 2 p.m. news conference by 30 minutes
Wednesday to receive a briefing about the discovery of the bodies
of Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Congress debates gun control, the gun industry and its
supporters often say that the United States has enough gun laws
already, that what is lacking is enforcement. But actual situation
is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, an arm of the
Treasury Department that is responsible for enforcing federal gun
laws, was created with limited power, has existed under constant
threat of attack by the National Rifle Association, has been kept
short-staffed and is charged with enforcing laws often written to
make prosecutions difficult.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the ATF also shows a major distinction in its
approach to the job. Historically, it has arrested a sizable number
of criminals who use guns in robberies or drug sales, particularly
career criminals with three or more convictions. These are
considered safe cases that do not arouse NRA opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the bureau has been less aggressive in what is
now being recognized as a critical part of gun control: going after
illegal gun traffickers and the small number of corrupt dealers,
among the 104,855 federally licensed dealers, who supply guns to
criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   While half of all crime guns traced by the ATF in the past two
years were traced to just 389 dealers, only 42 dealers were
recommended for prosecution last year, and only 19 had their
licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot of vigor in gun enforcement,'' said
Julius Wachtel, who retired last year after 23 years as a firearms
agent. When it comes to investigating dealers, traffickers or gun
shows, he said, the agents have a saying: ``No cases, no waves.
Little cases, little waves. Big cases, big waves. All those years
of being hammered by Congress have had a chilling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ATF Director John McGaw acknowledged in an interview: ``I
virtually never use the term `gun control' because that would make
us anti-gun. Everything we touch is unpopular and controversial, so
we have to be very careful to do what Congress has decided we
should and be neutral regulators, not take sides in the gun
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under McGaw, a former director of the Secret Service who became
director of the ATF in 1993, after the raid on the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, the number of gun trafficking cases
recommended for prosecution rose to 788 in 1998, up from 533 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with what McGaw sees as his congressional mandate, he
has formulated a policy of treating gun dealers as ``partners,''
members of the legitimate firearms industry, whom agents often
depend on for tips about straw purchases or gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's small size _ its 1,631 agents are only 9 more than
in 1973 _ means it sometimes must forgo investigations, prosecutors
said. And the agents must spend much of their time investigating
bombings and arsons, as well as enforcing the laws on alcohol and
collecting tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the number of agents in the Drug Enforcement
Administration has grown to 4,515 today, from 1,370 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that Congress has never decided it is serious about
going after gun trafficking the way it is about the war on drugs,''
said David Yassky, an assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School
and a Democratic counsel to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With drugs, we've realized we've got to go all the way up the
chain,'' Yassky said. ``If all you do is arrest the crack addict,
we won't get anywhere. But with guns, we only arrest the end user,
the shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal gun laws underscore the difference in priority between
drugs, which are illegal to sell, possess and use, and guns, which
start out as legal products, and illustrate the difficulty the
bureau faces in pursuing gun control.
</P>
<P>
   A dealer who sells 1,000 or more guns to criminals might get
only six months in jail, but for drug dealers there are stiff
mandatory minimum prison sentences of up to 25 years, even for
selling small quantities of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover purchases are a common tactic of drug agents, but
appeals courts have reversed convictions gained by firearms agents
posing as felons buying guns. Agents must use an actual convicted
felon in undercover operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, a law
championed by the NRA and sponsored by Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho,
who later retired, and by Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., who lost his
seat in 1996, raised several barriers to prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmer, now living in Hannibal, Mo., said his law is still
necessary to rein in what he sees as an overzealous government
agency. In the minds of firearms agents, Volkmer said, ``It's
almost like, if you are a gun owner or dealer, you're weird or not
legitimate. They believe the only way to resolve violence is to
take away our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The law limited ATF agents to annual inspections of dealers,
reduced record-keeping violations by a dealer from a felony to a
misdemeanor, a disincentive for federal prosecutors in cases where
a dealer has forged or destroyed his records to hide evidence, and
required prosecutors to prove that dealers who sold guns to
criminals or straw purchasers did so ``knowingly and willfully,'' a
nearly insurmountable hurdle, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   It also prohibited the ATF from establishing any national system
of gun registration, which makes tracing the origin of guns used in
crimes much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   `The gun laws weren't very strong to start with,'' said William
Vizzard, a retired firearms agent who is now a professor of
criminal justice at California State University in Sacramento.
``But after McClure-Volkmer, they were Swiss cheese.''

STUDIES CITE HEART ATTACK RISKS FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young and middle-aged women who suffer a heart attack are twice
as likely to die of it as men of the same age, while women of all
ages are more likely to have complications and harder-to-diagnose
symptoms than men having a heart attack, according to two major new
studies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on data from nearly 400,000 hospital
patients, provide one of the most comprehensive looks at women and
heart disease, an issue that is turning out to be much more complex
than previously thought. And they suggest that some aspects of
heart disease are biologically different in women, which could have
ramifications for diagnosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four decades ago, heart disease was popularly seen as
primarily affecting middle-aged men. More recent emphasis on heart
disease as the No. 1 killer in the United States of both women and
men has raised public awareness, but there is still the perception
that heart disease is not as much a problem for women, until
perhaps after they reach their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   As these two new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine
indicate, ``We certainly can't afford to be complacent about
symptoms of heart disease in women, irrespective of their age,''
said Dr. JoAnn Manson, principal investigator for the federally
funded Women's Health Initiative at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, who has reviewed the studies and found they make important
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies, by researchers at Yale and elsewhere,
documented for the first time that women in the 30-49 age group who
have a heart attack are twice as likely to die during
hospitalization as men of the same age _ 6.1 percent for women vs.
2.9 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study found, women of almost all age groups who
suffered heart attacks died at a higher rate than men, with the
disparity gradually lessening with age. It was not until the 80-84
age range before women with heart attacks were less likely to die
from them _ 21.5 percent for women vs. 21.8 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger the woman is when she is having a heart attack,
the greater the risk of dying in the hospital,'' said Dr. Viola
Vaccarino, assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University
School of Medicine and the lead author. ``Our study opens up the
question, what is it about younger women that puts them at higher
risk than men of similar age?''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on an analysis of data for about 385,000
patients, looked at deaths occurring during hospitalization and may
not necessarily apply to deaths outside the hospital. But
nationwide, many, if not most, heart attack deaths occur during
hospitalization. The report also took into account possible bias in
how physicians treat women, but found that could only explain 10
percent of the disparity between death rates for women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrice Nickens, director of the heart research program for
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, called the finding
about younger women ``very important'' and ``provocative.'' While
most heart attacks in both women and men still occur after the age
of 50, Nickens said, ``We need to understand what's going on in
these (younger) women.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have known that men, especially those younger than
65, are at higher risk of developing heart disease than women, but
women are more likely to die if they suffer a heart attack. They
have attributed the higher death rate among women to the fact that
women tend to be older before developing heart disease, when with
menopause they lose the protective effects of estrogen. This is the
first study to specifically show that younger, pre-menopausal women
who suffer heart attacks die at a higher rate than men of the same
age who suffer heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors theorized that women at risk may be more
likely to experience spasms in blood vessels and have differences
in blood clotting mechanisms, among other disparities.
</P>
<P>
   The second study in the current New England Journal, by
researchers from New York and elsewhere, looked at data from more
than 12,000 patients hospitalized with symptoms of a heart attack,
and found that women are more likely to have such complications as
major internal bleeding and heart failure, and to have such other
illnesses as diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   And, interestingly, the study found that women with chest pains
did not show the kind of blood vessel blockage that men with chest
pains did. While more than 85 percent of the men with ``unstable
angina'' had significant blockage, only about 70 percent of the
women did, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the message is for researchers to try to
understand the differences so that we can better target the therapy
for both women and men,'' said Dr. Judith S. Hochman, director of
the cardiac care unit at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York,
and lead author of the second study.
</P>
<P>
   And secondly, women should realize they may be at risk for heart
disease, and take steps to prevent it, said Hochman, who is also
chairwoman of the Women's Health Initiative advisory committee to
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of heart disease in women has not gotten the
attention that it should get,'' agreed Dr. Deeb N. Salem, past
president of the New England affiliate of the American Heart
Association and chairman of medicine at New England Medical Center
and Tufts. ``What these two articles are going to do is to
stimulate more research in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Savoie of Danvers, Mass. was 49 when she had a heart
attack four years ago, and knows she is lucky. She has diabetes and
a family history of heart disease, which places her at greater risk
of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have typical chest pains, or the feeling that an
elephant was sitting on my chest. There was no numbness in my arms
or hands. I had a sharp pain that was behind my left breast and
went out to my back. It was nothing that made me think it would be
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Savoie knew something was wrong, and rushed to the hospital,
where doctors did an electrocardiogram and found she was having a
heart attack. She underwent an emergency angioplasty to clear one
blockage, and subsequently had a second angioplasty and then heart
bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Savoie now volunteers as a speaker for the New England affiliate
of the American Heart Association. ``We want to educate women who
understand that cancer is a great risk, but don't necessarily
understand that a heart attack. . .is too.''

WOMEN UNDER 50 MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO DIE AFTER HAVING A HEART
ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   In people under 50, heart attacks are far less common in women
than in men, but when they do occur, women are more than twice as
likely to die, doctors are reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had long known that overall, women with heart
attacks have worse outcomes than men, but the large difference in
the younger age groups was not known before Thursday's study. The
difference between women and men who have heart attacks diminishes
with age, as men's risk goes up, but women's risk of death stays
higher than men's until the age of 75.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the difference are not fully understood, and
scientists say that the new findings, based on a study of the
hospital records of 155,565 women and 229,313 men who had heart
attacks and were treated at 1,658 hospitals, mean that younger
women who suffer heart attacks are a high risk group needing
special study and attention. The research is being published
Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A second study in the same issue of the journal, including 3,662
women and 8,480 men with heart problems, also found that overall,
women with heart attacks were more likely to die than men. They
were more likely to have weakened heart muscle, dangerously low
blood pressure and electrocardiograms that initially made it
difficult to tell whether they were having a heart attack. Women
also had more complications from treatment, particularly bleeding
from blood-thinning drugs routinely given to heart attack patients.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, women's heart attacks tended to have different
causes than men's: In men, blocked arteries were more likely to
bring on heart attacks, while women had clearer arteries. But the
women still had heart attacks, which researchers said were probably
caused by large blood clots and sudden spasms in the arteries that
supply blood to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``These studies are eye-opening to both physicians and their
female patients,'' said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist and
chief of the women's heart program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New
York who was not involved in either study. ``These are two very
good studies which really point to the issue that both men and
women do have heart attacks, but that's where the similarities end.
There are clearly differences in the kind of heart attack they're
having, and it implies that there is a physiologic basis for the
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United
States. According to the American Heart Association, 9,000 women
aged 29 to 44 had heart attacks in 1997, compared to 32,000 men.
The association did not have death rates, but in the larger study,
6.1 percent of women under 50 died from their heart attacks,
compared to 2.9 percent of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Viola Vaccarino, an assistant professor of epidemiology at
the Yale University School of Medicine and first author of the
larger study, said, ``Heart disease is less common in these young
women, but those who get it prematurely appear to have more severe
disease in some ways, and they have more severe heart attacks.''
More research is needed to find out why, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Dr. Vaccarino said, younger women need to
realize that they can develop heart disease. ``Women need to work
on what we know to be risk factors, such as high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, smoking, obesity and diabetes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldberg said that women from families in which heart
disease occurs at an early age need to be especially vigilant about
risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Hochman, lead author of the second study and director
of the cardiac care unit and cardiac research at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in New York, said that an
encouraging finding from her study was that women actually did
better than men when they were treated for a condition called
unstable angina, a type of chest pain that often precedes an actual
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to present at that stage,'' she said. ``Women do very
well then. If you present later, with a heart attack, you do worse
than a man. The message is, don't ignore symptoms, don't delay
seeking care.''
</P>
<P>
   Women with heart attacks do not always have typical symptoms
like chest pain, Dr. Hochman said. Some just become short of breath
or feel discomfort in the upper part of the stomach, throat or
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vaccarino said that three factors accounted for part of the
difference in survival between men and women. Women with heart
attacks were more likely than men to have other conditions that
worsened their outlook, including diabetes and stroke. In addition,
they tended to delay going to the hospital, and when they got there
were less likely than men to be given prompt treatment for a heart
attack, which includes aspirin, other blood thinning drugs and beta
blocker drugs.
</P>
<P>
   However, those three factors combined accounted for only about a
third of the difference in death rates between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had several theories about the rest of the
difference. Dr. Hochman said that because of their higher estrogen
levels, most younger women were less likely than men to develop
atherosclerosis, the build up of fatty plaques that can trigger
heart attacks by blocking the arteries that supply blood to the
heart muscle. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That condition accounts for the higher incidence of heart
attacks in men. But the destructive process of forming plaques &UR;  &LR; can
have a good side, Dr. Hochman said. Often, as plaques develop and
blood flow through the arteries is gradually diminished, the body
compensates by sprouting new blood vessels, called collaterals.
</P>
<P>
   When a heart attack does occur, Dr. Hochman said, ``collaterals
can be very protective.'' But, she said, studies have shown that
women have less collateral blood flow than men. ``So if they get a
heart attack due to a total blockage, then they have no protection,
or less protection than men, from a back-up blood supply.''
</P>
<P>
   And total blockages can develop in women even if they don't have
severe atherosclerosis. Some studies have shown that women tend to
form large blood clots that can shut down an artery. The clots form
because women's platelets, blood cells involved in clotting, tend
to be stickier than men's, and to clump together more, initiating
clot formation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, some women may be more likely than men to
have artery spasms, which can trigger a heart attack. Women are
more prone to other conditions related to artery spasm, including
migraine headaches and Reynaud's syndrome, which causes the hands
and feet to become cold and numb.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vaccarino said that more research was needed to explain
women's higher risk, but also to find better ways to detect heart
problems in younger women. ``The symptoms and signs we have now are
based on what we know about men and older women. What we are doing
may not be good enough.''

`TORINO SCALE' ESTIMATES ASTEROID IMPACT THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Impact-Scale)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember that asteroid last year that astronomers initially
thought had a slight chance of striking Earth in 40 years? Well,
that risk would have rated a 1 on a new 0-to-10 scale of impact
risks being unveiled by the International Astronomical Union.
</P>
<P>
   On the so-called ``Torino Scale,'' developed by Massachusetts
Institute of Technology astronomer Richard Binzel, that asteroid
was found within a day to have a true risk of zero, and thus would
have quickly reverted to zero on the hazard scale as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Binzel and other astronomers think many people may have been
unduly and unnecessarily alarmed by some of the initial media
reports of the possibility of an impact with that asteroid, called
1997 XF 11, which was first reported in March of last year. The
hazard scale is an attempt to provide perspective on any future
announcements of this kind so that people will better understand
the remote nature of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The scale was presented last month at an astronomers' meeting on
the risk of impacts from comets or asteroids, held in Torino,
Italy. Astronomers at the meeting endorsed the new system, which
then became known as the Torino scale.
</P>
<P>
   But while Binzel and others like to compare the new scale to the
well-known Richter scale used for measuring the intensity of
earthquakes, or to similar scales used for the force of hurricanes
and tornadoes, the Torino scale is actually quite different. Unlike
those scales which measure intensity, the Torino scale attempts to
combine both the severity of an impact and the probability of its
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if an object is ever discovered that is found to be
on a definite collision course with Earth, its rating on the scale
would then depend solely on its size, and thus the severity of the
expected impact.
</P>
<P>
   An object so small that it would simply shatter in the
atmosphere and never strike the ground _ something about the size
of a house or smaller _ would be rated zero, even if it were
certain to strike, because it would have no discernible effect. But
an object definitely heading toward Earth that was a bit bigger,
between 60 and 300 feet across, would have a rating of 8, because
such an impact could be devastating to a city-sized region or more.
Objects from 300 feet to about 3,000 feet across would be rated 9,
meaning they could devastate a large region of the planet, and
objects larger than that _ ones big enough to threaten the entire
planet _ would get the highest rating of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope the scale will accomplish is to put in perspective
whether an object merits concern,'' Binzel said Wednesday. All
asteroids discovered so far fall safely within the ``zero'' part of
the scale, but when a new asteroid is discovered there can be a
brief period during which the uncertainties about its orbit make a
future collision possible, and thus push the number _ temporarily
at least _ up into the ``1'' range or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's report about asteroid 1997 XF 11, for example,
included the possibility that there could be an impact in a few
decades. Brian Marsden, the astronomer who runs the international
clearinghouse in Cambridge, Mass. where all newly discovered
asteroids and comets are first reported, calculated that based on
what was known at the time of the initial report, the likelihood of
an impact was about 1 in 100,000 or greater.
</P>
<P>
   This estimate would have placed the object somewhere between
categories ``1'' and ``2'' on the scale _ described as ``events
meriting concern.'' But thanks to the widespread interest generated
by that report, within a day old photographs had been found which
proved that the chance of impact was nil. So within a day, the
object would have faded from category 2 to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, another asteroid discovered early this year, 1999 AN
10, was first reported to have a possibility of impacting Earth in
2044, and over a few weeks that probability kept increasing as new
observations were made _ enough to raise it to a category 1 _
``events meriting careful monitoring.'' But then old pictures were
found that, once again, proved that the chance of impact _ at least
for the next 70 years or so _ was nil, and pushed it back into
category zero.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Peiser, an anthropologist at Liverpool John Moore
University in England who circulates a daily newsletter of
information about the hazards from asteroids and comets, said in an
interview Wednesday that ``I think every tool helps, to explain a
fairly complex problem,'' and so was glad to see the new scale
offered ``to help convey some information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``as we've seen in the last 12 months,
things change so rapidly and so unexpectedly that we might see some
limitations of the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of 1999 AN 10, he pointed out, the calculated
probability of impact changed, over a period of a few weeks, from
one in a billion to about 1 in 100,000, before suddenly going to
zero. Tracking those rapidly-changing numbers might not have been
any easier with the scale than without it, except perhaps by
reassuring people that even with the increases the object was never
more than a ``1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it gives a focus,'' Peiser said. ``It puts the risk
in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsden said that he thinks the scale is well designed in terms
of the ``low end,'' how it deals with the kind of unlikely impacts
found so far or likely to be found in the near future as searches
intensify. But he is not so sure the scale works well in the way it
handles the higher-probability events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's been rushed in some way,'' he said. ``I think it's
confusing at the high levels.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when joblessness has fallen to just 4.3 percent of the
work force and employers are loudly complaining about labor
shortages, companies are also announcing record numbers of layoffs.
It doesn't seem to make sense, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for example, Eastman Kodak disclosed plans to cut up
to 2,500 more jobs on top of the 17,700 it had already planned to
eliminate by the end of the year. Not long ago, Procter &AMP; Gamble
announced a mass layoff of about 15,000, with 2,400 in North
America, as it reorganizes its worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   And Levi Strauss, fighting off competition from cheaper jeans
makers, said this year that it would close half of its
manufacturing plants in the United States and Canada, moving work
overseas and laying off 5,900 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to the widely followed monthly surveys by
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an international outplacement firm,
layoff announcements in the first half of this year are running
about 40 percent higher than last year, already a record year.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Challenger surveys picking up rising layoffs at a
time that unemployment hovers near a 30-year low? On the surface,
it seems paradoxical.
</P>
<P>
   But economists and labor-market analysts, including those at
Challenger itself, say it is in fact not contradictory at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job creation will far outdistance automation and job
destruction,'' explained John Challenger, the firm's chief
executive. ``Sometimes a company must take a step backward by
cutting part of its labor force in one area in an effort to move
two steps forward into more profitable areas of development.''
</P>
<P>
   So, though layoffs tend to attract more attention during periods
of economic stress, they can often signal economic vitality and
long-term willingness to create jobs, even as they temporarily
victimize some workers.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of AT&AMP;T, which announced in early 1996 that it
would lay off 40,000 workers. Not long afterward, the company ended
up hiring enough new people _ in providing wireless and local
telephone services and running telecommunications systems for major
corporations _ that by the end of 1996 its total employment had
hardly budged. AT&AMP;T continues to lay off workers in some of its
divisions even as its adds workers to others, such as its new cable
operations.
</P>
<P>
   A tip that layoffs are not necessarily sinister or a sign of
weakness comes from looking at the industries that have been hit
hardest. In April, the computer industry _ hardly anyone's
candidate as a troubled sector _ announced the most job cuts that
month, more than 10,000. Electronics, another high-technology star,
was second, with 8,900. According to the Challenger survey, between
1993 and 1998 the computer industry announced almost 273,000 job
cuts, about the same as retail trade and second only to the
aerospace-defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the Challenger data need to be put into the
context of a labor market that is constantly churning. Challenger
says announced layoffs are running at about 60,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like a lot. But set it against another, truly
startling, number: 13 million workers change their employment
status in a typical month, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. On average, that means 13 million Americans leave home
or school to enter the labor force, exit the labor force without
looking for new work, find new work after a spell of unemployment
or search for work after they quit or are dismissed or laid off _
every month. Seen in the context of that enormous number of job
changes that take place every month, the Challenger numbers barely
register as a blip.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 13 million figure is an underestimate of labor
market churning. For it takes no account of workers who manage to
change employers within a month. Nor does it include workers who
change jobs within the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Labor Department estimate that 40 percent of
the work force, or roughly 50 million workers, change jobs within a
year. In manufacturing alone, Steven Davis, a labor economist at
the University of Chicago, estimates that 10 percent to 12 percent
of jobs disappear in a typical year, a number that has not changed
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, careful scrutiny of government data suggests that
Challenger's survey might not accurately track the number of actual
layoffs taking place throughout the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger surveys draw rapt attention because they are the
only data available monthly, providing the only instant barometer
of corporate layoffs. The question is how representative
announcements of layoffs are of actual layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the surveys might be be biased toward large
companies, since they are the only ones that by law are required to
announce plant closings and large layoffs ahead of time. Further,
some job cuts are achieved through attrition rather than through
actual layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department does collect data every two years on
dislocated workers _ workers who lose their jobs because a plant
closes or moves, or because sales fall. Once collected and
analyzed, the government's data, drawn from the entire economy,
have shown that the actual number of job losses were significantly
greater than picked up by Challenger's more limited surveys. That
is unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   But the government data also show that job losses have been
steadily falling over the last few years, the opposite of the trend
in the Challenger data. Davis says the government's data differs
from Challenger's because Challenger appears to capture ``only the
tip of an iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Labor Department, the percentage of workers
with at least three years' tenure who were displaced during 1995
and 1996 fell to 3.8 percent. The figure for 1993 and 1994 was 4.4
percent. The 14 percent drop indicates job cuts were falling at
least through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another indication of the trend in job losses comes from
government surveys of unemployed workers who report they lost their
jobs. The number has been falling _ to 2.7 million last month from
2.8 million in June 1998 and 3.1 million in June 1997 _ even though
the size of the labor force grew by about 4 million during that
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs fuel fears, expressed throughout the 1990s, that
corporate downsizing has been ripping workers from the security of
long-term employment relationships. But a careful sifting of the
numbers does not lend support to that anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University, calculates
that about 13 percent of the work force was displaced from jobs
between 1991 and 1993. That compares with 15 percent between 1993
and 1995 and 12 percent between 1995 and 1997. His estimates are
far higher than the government's in part because he does not limit
his sample to workers who have been working at least three years
for their current employer.
</P>
<P>
   Farber says his data suggest that ``somewhat more jobs were lost
in the recent expansion than at similar points in the expansion of
the late 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are unclear,'' he added in a recent interview.
``But the evidence is that workers are now coping better, and a
higher fraction can find jobs. Also, the average wage loss by
displaced workers is smaller than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the workers who lost jobs between 1995 and 1997, about 75
percent were employed as of February 1998, compared with 65 percent
for the 1993-1995 period. ``None of these changes, however, is
dramatic,'' Farber said.
</P>
<P>
   He says that despite the public focus on downsizing, there has
been no substantial decline in job security in the 1990s.
``Long-term employment is still an important phenomenon in the U.S.
economy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that 35 percent to 40 percent of workers at least
35 years old have been with their current employers more than 10
years. These long-term relationships exist alongside the tremendous
churning that characterizes the rest of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers, especially the young, change jobs rapidly _ at
least until they find the occupations and employers they want for
the long haul. Some industries, like fast food, foster short-term
employment. So the economy creates substantial numbers of long-term
and short-term jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that layoffs remain high by historical standards.
But job creation remains far higher.

 &HT;    Top Bush adviser works on faith
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The real-world laboratory for the ideas George
W. Bush wants to bring to Washington may be Indianapolis, where
churches run city parks and the Jewish mayor raises money to get
kids out of public schools and into Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with that mayor at his side, Bush goes to an Indianapolis
church to detail his proposals to give faith-based programs a
larger role in attacking society's ills, perhaps including vouchers
that welfare recipients could redeem for either government-run,
religious or non-profit services. Bush is promising to lay out ways
``to rally the armies of compassion in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the Indianapolis plan, Mayor Stephen Goldsmith,
is now the man behind the Bush domestic plan. For Goldsmith, the
changes he championed have attracted widespread praise _ and a fair
amount of criticism _ for road testing new ways to solve old urban
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I share a conservative philosophy,'' Bush has said his
chief domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In a Goldsmith speech, you hear the central themes of a Bush
speech: less government, more religion and a willingness to have
government set values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government had attempted to become all things to all people
and in the meantime created a fair number of mistakes,'' Goldsmith
said in a March 1998 speech at Catholic University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes, Goldsmith believes, included counterproductive
welfare programs. ``These mistakes were subsidizing bad behavior.
Much of the welfare reform discussion relates to government's
subsidy of bad behavior,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, he noted, nothing tricky about getting people off
welfare. The challenging part is keeping them off. Faith-based,
neighborhood and other nongovernment programs can be ``more
sensitive'' to the needs of people than government bureaucracies
can be, Goldsmith believes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith also sees a faith-based response to urban education
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly certain I'm the only mayor in the United States
with the last name of Goldsmith who is chairman of the archdiocese
fund-raising drive,'' he said in the Washington speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's a task he has embraced enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic schools in the center of Indianapolis are the
public schools of choice,'' said the mayor. ``They are open to the
public. We are raising scholarship money and money to repair the
schools. There is a private voucher program. If I had my way, there
would be a tax-credit program as well that would support parents in
making these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not said if he favors tax credits for private-school
tuition. In June, at a Philadelphia Catholic school, he hinted
something might be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk about that when I lay out my budget and tax plan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's effort at making widespread changes in the
Indianapolis public schools went nowhere. As mayor, he has no
authority over the schools. Kip Tew, former chairman of the
Democratic Party in Indianapolis, said Goldsmith's ideas hit a
brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats across the country believe a voucher system is
harmful to the public school system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Bush, Goldsmith talks about faith-based answers to
problems like teen pregnancy. Goldsmith believes government should
not be afraid of making a value judgment on premarital child
bearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything we can to help you if you are a teen
mom,'' Goldsmith said in the Washington speech. ``We are also
saying having a baby as a teen-ager is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith, an attorney, is well aware of the legal high-wire act
it takes to bring church and state together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be in a position where we are using the force
of the state to cause people to have faith-based connections they
don't wish to have,'' he said. ``I'm obviously sensitive to this
issue as a Jewish mayor in a city with not many Jewish residents
involved activelyI. We are trying to push this as far as we can,
remembering there is a First Amendment issue to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his efforts is a Front Porch Alliance that looks for ways
to get faith-based and other organizations involved. In several
parts of Indianapolis, church groups have taken over maintenance
and operation of city parks.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor put his concepts on paper in his book, ``The
Twenty-First Century City.'' In 1997, while promoting it, the
Bush-Goldsmith connection _ one that could go places if Bush wins
the White House _ was made.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at Bush's downtown Austin campaign headquarters,
Goldsmith talked about the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he wants to figure out how we can use government
more effectively to make the market work for individuals. So it
respects individuals and their choices on their own lives. It
respects federalism and states rights, and understands that big
government bureaucracies are often counterproductive but also
understands that there is a place for government in helping those
who aren't succeeding,'' said Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith gets credit for moving his city toward those goals.
Governing magazine has named him public official of the year. Brian
Vargus, director of the Indiana University Public Opinion
Laboratory, said Goldsmith did the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went down to the very Republican City-County Building and
basically abolished a lot of positions, which got a lot of people's
brothers-in-law off the public payroll,'' Vargus said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jobs went to the private sector. The savings,
Goldsmith claims, have topped $400 million. City tax rates are
down, though bonded indebtedness is up.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, the world is told on Goldsmith's city Web site, in
many ways is ``the best it has ever been.''

FTC URGES CONGRESS TO PLACE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON CIGARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.) (rk) 
 By   STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to the rapidly growing popularity of
cigars, the Federal Trade Commission recommended Wednesday that
Congress impose new restrictions like those already governing
cigarettes, including health warning labels and a ban on television
and radio advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been reluctant to toughen restrictions on tobacco
products, and there is little broadcast advertising for cigars.
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives and government officials said Wednesday
that the agency's call for uniform health labels might be adopted,
particularly as some states have begun to impose a variety of
warning labels, a patchwork approach that the cigar industry
considers burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, California became the first state to require health
warnings on cigars, and earlier this year Massachusetts became the
second. But critics have said the California warnings are not
strong enough and the two states require different labels.
Moreover, some industry executives fear that if other states try to
impose their own warnings, cigar boxes could begin to resemble a
well-traveled suitcase covered with unsightly labels.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said that the state requirements in
Massachusetts are only for machine-made cigars, not hand-rolled
ones, and that since there are often no requirements on the
placement of the warnings, they have been put in places where they
cannot easily be read.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's recommendations were approved by a vote of 4-0. Robert
Pitofsky, the chairman of the FTC, said the agency had the
authority to order the industry to post health warnings but decided
instead to make the recommendations to Congress as the agency had
done in the case of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations follow a dramatic rise in sales between 1993
and 1997, when consumption increased by almost 50 percent to more
than 5 billion cigars. The trend marked a sharp turnaround from a
20-year slump in cigar sales.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest increase in cigar consumption has been among
relatively well-to-do young and middle-aged men, but there have
also been significant increases among teen-agers and women,
according to a study on the health effects of cigar smoking that
appeared last month in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That article, a study of 17,774 men of whom 1,546 smoked cigars,
blamed the resurgence of cigar smoking on a widespread
misperception that ciars are safer than cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the National Cancer Institute and others have shown
that cigar smoking can cause several forms of cancer and that cigar
smoke contains the same toxic and carcinogenic constituents found
in cigarette smoke. The studies have also shown that cigar smokers
face increased risks of heart and lung diseases and that cigars are
not safer than cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The article in The New England Journal also concluded that
cigars have become more popular because they have been glamorized
in advertisements and in movies and television shows. The FTC
called for health warnings to appear in print advertisements for
cigars, as they do for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Total marketing expenses of the five largest cigar makers, which
constitute almost 90 percent of the national industry, grew by 32
percent to $41 million in 1997. Less than 1 percent of that
marketing budget went for television and radio advertising, and
Wednesday Pitofsky, the chairman of the FTC, said that the heart of
the report was not the ban on such advertising, but the new
proposed labeling requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who think that if they get away
from cigarettes and smoke cigars instead, that it is safer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But while representatives of the cigar industry said that a
standard warning label could alleviate the problems associated with
different state rules, they criticized the commission's report and
others that have tied advertising to the rising popularity of
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America,
said that cigar consumption had been relatively stagnant over the
last year and that the industry's marketing expenditures were a
pittance compared to cigarette marketing. He said that as a result
of the California labeling law, health warnings already appear on
about 96 percent of cigar packages.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said that the increase in cigar consumption is largely a
reflection of economic prosperity and renewed attention from the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigars are now seen as one of life's little affordable
luxuries, like beers from microbreweries and fine wine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC recommended that Congress consider rotating three
warning labels to be placed conspicuously on cigars, boxes and
advertising:
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Regular cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth
and throat, even if you do not inhale.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Inhaling cigar smoke can cause lung cancer. The more
deeply you inhale, the greater your risk.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations follow similar ones made earlier this year
by the surgeon general, David Satcher, who cited studies such as
one completed in 1998 by the National Cancer Institute that
concluded that although cigar smokers inhaled less than cigarette
smokers, cigars could be just as toxic because they contained up to
90 times as much of some carcinogenic substances as cigarettes. As
a result, some health experts also say that second-hand smoke from
cigars is more toxic than that from cigarettes.

COMMENTARY: THE CHERUBIC COMMANDO GETS GUNS, BUTTERS UP PEOPLE IN
HIGH PLACES   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak,
stopped moving through a welcoming throng to ask me: ``Do you
remember what you told me after Bibi defeated Peres?''
</P>
<P>
   Here it comes, I thought, another politician afflicted with
total recall, rubbing my nose in one of those cockamamie
predictions I make just to be provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it was good news for me. That if Peres had won, when
my time came the Israeli voters would be tired of Labor. But with
Bibi winning, I could be in a better position of challenging him in
a few years. I never forgot that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. I remember now. After the Likud's Bibi Netanyahu scored a
stunning upset victory over Labor's Shimon Peres three years ago, I
thought it would be good to buy some Ehud Barak stock at the low.
So I interviewed him in his unbusy foreign ministry office and then
gave him this cheer-up scenario:
</P>
<P>
   If Labor had won in 1996, as Bill Clinton had fervently hoped,
the dovish Peres would never have been able to persuade half of the
Israelis that his dreamy deal with the Palestinians would provide
security. With the right resolutely opposed, the peace process
would founder.
</P>
<P>
   But the victorious Netanyahu, I figured, would slow down the
Oslo rush to give away almost all the West Bank before
final-settlement talks. Then he would bring along the right,
Nixon-to-China style, to buy a deal for a Palestinian state on half
the West Bank. If Yasser Arafat balked, Bibi's hard-ish line would
at least put the next Israeli government in position to negotiate a
fairly secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it seems to be working out. With ``bad cop'' Bibi
gone, a large majority of Israelis can accept the risks that ``good
cop'' Ehud is prepared to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   What does this remembrance of predictions past reveal about the
new prime minister? First, he sure knows how to butter up a
right-wing American columnist. More important, he can get from a
softened-up Clinton what his predecessor was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we see him going home with a long-term switch of economic
aid to military aid _ money to keep American arms production lines
rolling and the Israeli armed forces with their qualitative edge.
Obstruction to financing the Arrow anti-missile system will be
removed. (The decision to choose F-16 fighters was Barak's; the
more sophisticated F-15 costs too much to fly.)
</P>
<P>
   The same suggestion that Bibi made to fold the next salami slice
of the West Bank into the final talks was no longer opposed by
Clinton. It was for Arafat to reject, which he promptly did, making
him look negative at a positive moment.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also arranged for Clinton to be less of a buttinsky. The
future U.S. role is to be facilitator, not mediator. Israel needs
an ally more than a broker.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, the White House is willing to help reopen talks
with Syria, long a hotbed of terrorism and importer of missiles.
Last time, a too-eager American secretary of state was repeatedly
insulted; if Hafez al-Assad makes Madeleine Albright cool her
heels, she should return to a Damascus hotel and tell him to call
her from the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Barak appears not to be making Yitzhak Rabin's mistake, which
was to seek American troops on the Golan Heights. His idea seems to
be a Syrian-Israeli arrangement of mutual monitoring joined by a
team of international observers. If the aging Assad says, ``Get off
the Golan or else,'' Israel should choose else.
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister, a former commando who looks remarkably
cherubic, made two mistakes in his debut. One was saying ``We do
not intend to drag our feet for another three years,'' which
sounded like a gratuitous shot at a predecessor whose necessary
corrective made possible Barak's current lionization in Washington.
He disclaims any such intent, but it delighted doves and mars his
unity pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The other mistake was to select 15 months as his deadline for
final agreement. Why the odd number? Why not a year, or 18 months,
or no deadline at all? It puts all the pressure on an agreement
made two weeks before the U.S. election, presumably when
campaigning Democrats _ most of all Hillary Clinton _ will be
panting for peacemaking handshakes on the White House lawn.
Scheduling an ``October surprise'' is too clever by half.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, his debut here went well. Fancy his remembering that
sage cheering-up. (BOX)

   SCHWARZ-CONDUCTOR (Undated) _ There was talk, as there always is
when a young American conductor, in this case, Gerard Schwarz,
begins piling up accomplishments of a future at the helm of a major
American orchestra. ``With talent on this order,'' Harold C.
Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1980, after a New York
visit by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, ``there is no place for
him but up.'' Nearly 20 years after that prediction, it is fair to
ask whether Schwarz, now 51, has indeed made his way up in the
music world. But how one answers that question is bound up with
one's view of what constitutes success for a conductor. Schwarz
continues to direct Mostly Mozart at Lincoln Center in Manhattan,
which opens its 33rd season on Tuesday evening. But the festival
has been scaled back in recent years to make way for the Lincoln
Center Festival, and Schwarz has become less of a presence. By
Allan Kozinn. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

   SINGAPORE-DANCE (Singapore) _ Not many years ago the Singapore
arts scene was largely invisible. Now it is exploding. With a
combination of seduction and subsidies, the Singapore government is
aggressively wooing artists and arts organizations around the world
to make their homes in this affluent city-state. The first annual
Singapore Arts Festival closed its monthlong run in mid-June,
attracting 29 international troupes, more than 200 fringe
performers and a mammoth citywide sculpture exhibition, thanks to
generous government support. By Susan Heller Anderson. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WALTZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Walzen,'' as any bibulous Viennese
will tell you, is ``to twirl.'' The word means more than
``rotate,'' less than ``wanken,'' or downright stagger. Drop the
umlaut, and we have what Johann Strauss the Younger and his father
had Europe doing for a good part of the 19th century. Waltzes had
existed under other names during the century before. Mozart might
call them ``Landler''; Schubert gave waltzes their proper name and
created a body of piano music stunning both for its simplicity and
for its subtlety. Weber, Liszt and Berlioz raised them to the title
of high art. Tchaikovsky and another Strauss, Richard, made a
twirling, almost staggering, three-in-a-bar ballroom dance a form
to set next to the rondo or the passacaglia. By Bernard Holland.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GOETHE'S-FAUST (Undated) _ Although Schumann's ``Scenes From
Goethe's `Faust,''' has elements of both opera and oratorio, it
fails to fit comfortably into either form. Running two hours and
requiring full orchestra and a large chorus as well as vocal
soloists, it demands much from concert presenters and audiences
alike, and is thus something of a rarity. Although it has been
performed by the American Symphony and the Orchestra of St. Luke's
the last decade, it was last presented by the New York Philharmonic
in 1973 and has not been heard at Carnegie Hall since 1891, when
the third and last part was given. New Yorkers can hear the work
Sunday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, where John Eliot Gardiner and
the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique conclude their
four-night Schumann celebration as part of the Lincoln Center
Festival. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).

<P>
   MEHLDAU-JAZZ (Undated) _ Brad Mehldau, at 28, is among the most
celebrated jazz pianists of his generation. If you've heard his
name mentioned, you've probably heard that he's ``the next Bill
Evans.'' High praise, to be sure. But like most such comparisons,
this one is more than a little misleading, as unfair as it is
flattering. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-ART (Washington) _ Major exhibitions of the art of India
are rare in this part of the world. They always have been. Why?
Nobody knows. This art has everything: epic drama and swoony sob
stories, gods, gremlins and glamour queens, the human at its most
human, the spiritual at its most ineffable. Formally, it is pure
seduction. Intellectually and emotionally, it looks you in the eye
and says, over and over again in a thousand different ways: wake
up, change your life, look again, things are not what they seem.
Which are the fundamental messages of great art, sacred or secular,
anywhere. All these elements play a role in ``Devi: The Great
Goddess,'' a gathering of 120 sculptures and paintings at the
Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution through
Sept. 6. By Holland Cotter. (Moved).

DAVID OGILVY, 88, LEGENDARY ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

(lh) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Ogilvy, the legendary ad executive who dreamed up the
eyepatch-wearing ``man in the Hathaway shirt'' and many other
iconic advertising campaigns, died Wednesday at Chateau Touffou,
his home near Bonnes in the Loire Valley of France, following a
year of declining health, according to a spokeswoman for Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned five decades, Ogilvy created one of the
biggest ad agencies in the world and helped alter the landscape of
American advertising. He is credited, along with William Bernbach,
with introducing what was then a novel idea _ that consumers could
be approached with a soft sell through print, radio and television.
His ads, for everything from Schweppes mixers to Rolls-Royce cars,
helped start the ``creative revolution'' in the 1960s. These ads
were in marked contrast to the droning, repetitious style of the
hard-sell advertising they supplanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is not a moron,'' Ogilvy said once, and repeated
often. ``She is your wife. Try not to insult her intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he wrote his first advertisement, for a stove; by 1948
he had formed Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, now an international empire with
global billings of nearly $8 billion last year and a unit of WPP
Group PLC. Along the way, he took a series of side roads, from
salesman to country farmer to diplomat to pollster, before
advertising captured his undivided attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tremendous impact on the business,'' said Allen
Rosenshine, the chairman and chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, who
met Ogilvy exactly once but refers to his writings as ``a bible of
what constitutes good and bad advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenshine added, ``He showed that you can approach the art of
creativity with a certain amount of science and right-brain
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ogilvy prided himself on perfecting the information-laden
but painless print advertisement, he was perhaps even more famous
for finding the character or symbol that turned a product into a
brand, and a brand into a byword.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, his advertisements featured interesting-looking
people and symbols, like the Schweppes board member whose
bewhiskered Englishness so entranced Ogilvy that he persuaded him
to appear as Commander Whitehead _ the last name was real _ in a
series of ads for Schweppes sodas that summed up the product as
having ``Schweppervescence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot bore people into buying your product,'' Ogilvy once
concluded. ``You can only interest them in buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   He created successful campaigns for Shell Oil, Sunoco, Dove Soap
and Sears, Roebuck, as well as for the Puerto Rico Tourist Board
and Merrill Lynch. For Puerto Rican tourism. his approach was to
change the image of the entire island, selling it as a tropical
paradise. He created the first Pepperidge Farm bread commercial in
1956, a campaign he said he literally dreamed up. In his memoir
``Ogilvy on Advertising,'' he told of a dream in which a baker
drives his horse-drawn wagon down a country road. The bread
commercial used just that script, creating an image of hand-made
tradition for a mass-market bread.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, his agency won the Rolls-Royce account, for which it
produced Ogilvy's own favorite campaign. The headline of the print
ads read: ``At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new
Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.''
</P>
<P>
   This relatively small effort paved the way for other accounts
with major billings, like Shell. He later resigned the Rolls-Royce
account at a time when he felt that the quality of the cars, which
he liked to drive himself, was not up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy began his working life in the kitchen of the Hotel
Majestic in Paris. A few years later, he was selling Aga stoves _
hulking furnace-like English ranges _ door to door in England. He
left the company in 1935, but not before writing a sales manual for
successive generations. His first advertisement, in fact, was for
Aga, and featured a reproduction of Manet's ``Dejeuner Sur
L'Herbe,'' an interesting choice since the painting includes a
nude. It was possibly the first nude to appear in any
advertisement, he later said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake,'' he wrote sternly in ``Ogilvy on
Advertising,'' the 1983 installment of a series of books in which
he set down his thoughts on the industry. ``Not because it was
sexy, but because it was irrelevant to the product.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   David MacKenzie Ogilvy was born June 23, 1911, in West Horsley,
England, the youngest child of John and Dorothy Ogilvy. His father,
a stockbroker, suffered a financial crisis when David was very
young, and the boy attended an Edinburgh school, Fettes, on a
scholarship. He also won a scholarship to study modern history at
Christ Church College, Oxford, but was, in his own words, a ``dud''
who could not pass his exams there. He left after just two years.
</P>
<P>
   His first advertising job was with the London agency Mather &AMP;
Crowther, where his older brother, Francis, worked. For David
Ogilvy, advertising became a passion that consumed most of his
time. ``I loved advertising,'' he wrote. ``I devoured it. I studied
and read and took it desperately seriously.'' He persuaded the
agency to send him to the United States for a year; at the year's
end, he resigned and joined George Gallup's National Research
Institute, which he later called ``the luckiest break of my life''
because, he said, he learned a great deal about the United States,
its people and its preferences, and because he also learned how to
do research, on which he placed great reliance, in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Ogilvy served in British intelligence in
the United States from 1942 to 1944. In 1944 he became second
secretary at the British Embassy. After the war, he and his wife
moved to Lancaster County in Pennsylvania to try to make a living
raising tobacco. Although they loved the region, he wrote later, it
was physically and economically impossible for them to succeed as
farmers. So in 1948, he set up his advertising agency, with, as he
recalled, ``no credentials, no clients and only $6,000 in the
bank.'' One advantage he did have was a British accent, which he
used to ``differentiate me from the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The tweedy, pipe-smoking Ogilvy wrote the copy for some of his
agency's best-remembered ads. It was he who stopped and bought the
eyepatch that quickly inflated the fortunes of a small shirt
company named Hathaway. And it was he who wrote the headline for
the Rolls-Royce ad, which he insisted was one of the best ads of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy, never one to underestimate himself, wrote of these early
successes, ``I doubt whether any copywriter has ever produced so
many winners in such a short period.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an early advocate of what he called ``factual and
informative'' advertising. For many years he opposed the use of
humor in advertisements or commercials, and he was a long holdout
against singing commercials, in the belief that they did not sell
their products.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Confessions of an Advertising Man (1963), which sold
more than 600,000 copies in 11 languages, Ogilvy also wrote a 1978
autobiography, ``Blood, Brain and Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions'' was very much a how-to book, stuffed with such
crisp maxims for success in advertising as:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Unless your advertising contains a Big Idea, it will pass
like a ship in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Advertising should be true, credible and pleasant. People do
not buy from bad-mannered liars.''
</P>
<P>
   One chapter promised to explain ``How to Write Potent Copy,''
and began: ``The headline is the most important element in most
advertisements.'' In his chapter on making good television
commercials, he wrote: ``Start selling in your first frame and
never stop selling until the last.'' And: ``The purpose of a
commercial is not to entertain the viewer, but to sell him.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote in ``Confessions'' about his relationship with his
clients: ``I buy shares in their company, so that I can think like
a member of their family.'' And he said: ``I always use my clients'
products. This is not toadyism but elementary good manners. I also
resign accounts when I lose confidence in the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy was married three times, first to Melinda Street, then to
Ann Cabot and finally to Herta Lans, who survives him. He is also
survived by his son by his first wife, David Fairfield Ogilvy, of
Greenwich, Conn., and by three step-grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for many causes and cultural institutions, including
the New York Philharmonic, the World Wildlife Fund, an
anti-littering campaign in New York City and the United Negro
College Fund. In 1967, Ogilvy was made a commander of the British
Empire by Queen Elizabeth, and in 1990 the French government named
him an officer in its Ordre des Arts et Lettres.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy was chief executive of his agency until 1975, when he
stepped down and moved to France. He remained active on several
boards and as titular head of some Ogilvy operations until
recently. In retirement, he worked tirelessly on his elaborate
gardens, and for his 80th birthday the agency presented him with a
hybrid rose named ``David Ogilvy.''

COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF CLINTON EXTENDED SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time reference in lede to 36 years ago.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty-six years ago, when Bill Clinton shook
President Kennedy's hand and decided he would try to be president,
John F. Kennedy Jr. was not yet 3 years old. In another four
months, President Kennedy was assassinated and his son didn't
return to the White House _ until President Clinton invited him in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after somberly recounting this story, Clinton gave no
apology for acting as commander in chief in the search for
Kennedy's body, acknowledging that he ordered the Coast Guard to
take a few days longer than usual to complete the job. Clinton said
he believed the nation would understand that he wanted to spare no
expense in helping a family so familiar with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault, I am,'' Clinton said at a White House news conference
dominated by questions about Kennedy's death. ``It was because I
thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clinton said he didn't get involved in the rescue or search
effort until a few days ago. At that point, he said, Coast Guard
officials told him they would normally end their search, but they
urged the president to allow more time because of the availability
of advanced equipment and the national interest in finding Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard felt a capacity to succeed in this, if they
had a few more days, and because of the role of the Kennedy family
in our national lives and because of the enormous losses they have
sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give
them a few more days,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the way the Clinton and Kennedy sagas have
intertwined over the years, an emotional Clinton took a long,
deliberate walk through the White House hallway to meet an
assemblage of reporters waiting in the same East Room often used by
former President Kennedy. In what amounted to an impromptu eulogy,
Clinton recalled playing a small role in helping the younger
Kennedy ``come to terms'' with the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back to the Oval Office, where he saw the desk that he
took the famous picture in,'' Clinton said, referring to the
photograph of the younger Kennedy peering from beneath his father's
desk. Clinton, in a symbol of his ties to the Kennedy legacy, has
been using that desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on a March 8, 1998, visit, Clinton offered Kennedy a tour
of the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took him upstairs and showed him the residence, which he
had not seen since he was a tiny boy,'' Clinton said. ``And I
showed him some of my memorabilia that I had from his father's
service . . . we had a very nice evening and I sent him pictures
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the visit was cathartic for Kennedy, who grew up
with many pictures and stories about his father, but relatively few
firm memories about his time at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he really wanted to come to terms with all of
it,'' Clinton said, leaving unspoken the fact that he and the
nation are now trying to come to terms with death of Kennedy's son.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Clinton has often grieved publicly.
He has dealt with the death of his mother and the suicide of his
deputy counsel, Vincent Foster, as well of the victims of numerous
tragedies such as the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma
City and this year's shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the president made clear the death of the 38-year-old
son of former President Kennedy had severed a treasured
relationship, and he made no apology for the extra government
expense taken to try to find his body, as well as those of his wife
and sister-in-law. Clinton said he first met the younger Kennedy
when Kennedy was an intern at a law firm in Los Angeles ``and we
have been together on many occasions since then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck me was . . . he was a very deliberate
person, as many people have noticed, about . . . when he would be
publicly exposed and all of that,'' Clinton said. ``He had his
mother's care for having a private life. And I'm not sure he wanted
to go back to the White House before he did. But, especially in
light of everything that's happened, I'm glad he had the chance to
come back here one more time and see the residence and know where
he was when he was a little boy. I'm glad he did that. I'm grateful
that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board notified the White
House at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday that Kennedy's body had been located,
but Clinton aides decided against waking the president. Instead,
they briefed him at 9:15 a.m., but the president apparently had
already heard the news on the morning television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delayed his 2 p.m. news conference by 30 minutes
Wednesday to receive a briefing about the discovery of the bodies
of Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette.

CANADIANS SEIZE SHIP CARRYING 100 CHINESE IMMIGRANTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A ship with no name carrying more than 100 Chinese
immigrants without identification papers has been taken into
custody by Canadian authorities off the coast of Vancouver Island
in what is believed to be the largest interception of immigrant
smuggling along Canada's West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities said the rusted fishing boat had left
Fuzhou, China, 39 days ago, bound for Canada. At least one of the
people on board told immigration authorities that he had paid
$38,000 to smugglers for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Canada accepts about 200,000 legal immigrants a year but has
tightened its regulations on illegal immigrants and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have arrested 11 members of
the ship's crew who are suspected of being involved in the
smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of immigrants packed aboard the filthy ship was
unusually high, authorities said this was not the first time such
trafficking had been uncovered in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Another ship, carrying an unknown number of illegal Asian
immigrants, sank a few weeks ago north of the Queen Charlotte
Islands, farther up the British Columbia coast, and immigration
officials said they had been expecting other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants have also landed on the East Coast of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, authorities found 152 people from Sri Lanka floating in
lifeboats in the ocean off Newfoundland. In 1987, a freighter
dropped 173 Sikhs from India on the coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, a federal fisheries airplane spotted a
suspicious boat on the western coast of Vancouver Island, about 190
miles northwest of Victoria, and notified the Coast Guard. The
180-foot ship, described as an obsolete fishing trawler, was
listing badly when Coast Guard vessels intercepted it in an
isolated bay halfway up the island's western coast.
</P>
<P>
   There were 122 people aboard the stinking ship, including the
crew. All but 18 were women.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday they were taken in several yellow schoolbuses to the
Esquimalt Canadian Forces Base at Victoria. They will be kept in a
gymnasium at the base, behind hastily erected fences, until
immigration hearings can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   James Redmond, an official with Citizenship and Immigration
Canada, said at a news conference Wednesday that it would take time
to determine whether the immigrants will be allowed to remain in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If they claim to be refugees, they will have to prove they would
be persecuted if they returned to China, a process that could take
months or years. If they do not qualify for refugee status, Redmond
said, they are subject to deportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Cameron, a Vancouver immigration consultant, said
deporting the immigrants could be difficult because China's policy
is to refuse to take back people who do not have passports or other
official identification, something the illegal immigrants may have
been counting on. ``They could remain here for quite some time,''
Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew members were taken from the garbage-covered deck of the
ship in handcuffs and were being investigated by the Mounted
Police. The other immigrants were seen walking freely off the boat.
Some smiled and waved, appearing to be in good spirits despite the
arduous journey across the Pacific. Others looked dazed and
confused.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said that there was plenty of rice aboard but that the
water used for drinking and cooking was contaminated. Doctors said
the immigrants were hungry and tired but were not suffering
contagious diseases. &QL;

<P>
   The Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 included several
provisions that made the policing of gun dealers and owners more
difficult, including these:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Records  &LR;  The penalty for falsifying records, the easiest
dealer violation for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to
prove, was reduced to a misdemeanor from a felony.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Inspections  &LR;  Unannounced inspections to review a dealer's
records were limited to one a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Standard of Proof  &LR;  The standard of proof to convict a dealer
of selling guns to straw buyers was raised to ``knowingly and
willfully.'' Prosecutors had to prove not only that a dealer knew a
sale was illegal, but also that he made it intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Licensing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The standard for convicting someone of selling guns without a
license was raised to require not only they sell them regularly,
but also that they earn a major part of their livelihood from those
sales.

COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF CLINTON EXTENDED SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time reference in lede to nearly 36 years ago.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 36 years ago, when Bill Clinton shook
President Kennedy's hand and decided he would try to be president,
John F. Kennedy Jr. was not yet 3 years old. In another four
months, President Kennedy was assassinated and his son didn't
return to the White House _ until President Clinton invited him in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after somberly recounting this story, Clinton gave no
apology for acting as commander in chief in the search for
Kennedy's body, acknowledging that he ordered the Coast Guard to
take a few days longer than usual to complete the job. Clinton said
he believed the nation would understand that he wanted to spare no
expense in helping a family so familiar with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault, I am,'' Clinton said at a White House news conference
dominated by questions about Kennedy's death. ``It was because I
thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clinton said he didn't get involved in the rescue or search
effort until a few days ago. At that point, he said, Coast Guard
officials told him they would normally end their search, but they
urged the president to allow more time because of the availability
of advanced equipment and the national interest in finding Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard felt a capacity to succeed in this, if they
had a few more days, and because of the role of the Kennedy family
in our national lives and because of the enormous losses they have
sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give
them a few more days,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the way the Clinton and Kennedy sagas have
intertwined over the years, an emotional Clinton took a long,
deliberate walk through the White House hallway to meet an
assemblage of reporters waiting in the same East Room often used by
former President Kennedy. In what amounted to an impromptu eulogy,
Clinton recalled playing a small role in helping the younger
Kennedy ``come to terms'' with the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back to the Oval Office, where he saw the desk that he
took the famous picture in,'' Clinton said, referring to the
photograph of the younger Kennedy peering from beneath his father's
desk. Clinton, in a symbol of his ties to the Kennedy legacy, has
been using that desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on a March 8, 1998, visit, Clinton offered Kennedy a tour
of the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took him upstairs and showed him the residence, which he
had not seen since he was a tiny boy,'' Clinton said. ``And I
showed him some of my memorabilia that I had from his father's
service . . . we had a very nice evening and I sent him pictures
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the visit was cathartic for Kennedy, who grew up
with many pictures and stories about his father, but relatively few
firm memories about his time at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he really wanted to come to terms with all of
it,'' Clinton said, leaving unspoken the fact that he and the
nation are now trying to come to terms with death of Kennedy's son.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Clinton has often grieved publicly.
He has dealt with the death of his mother and the suicide of his
deputy counsel, Vincent Foster, as well of the victims of numerous
tragedies such as the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma
City and this year's shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the president made clear the death of the 38-year-old
son of former President Kennedy had severed a treasured
relationship, and he made no apology for the extra government
expense taken to try to find his body, as well as those of his wife
and sister-in-law. Clinton said he first met the younger Kennedy
when Kennedy was an intern at a law firm in Los Angeles ``and we
have been together on many occasions since then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck me was . . . he was a very deliberate
person, as many people have noticed, about . . . when he would be
publicly exposed and all of that,'' Clinton said. ``He had his
mother's care for having a private life. And I'm not sure he wanted
to go back to the White House before he did. But, especially in
light of everything that's happened, I'm glad he had the chance to
come back here one more time and see the residence and know where
he was when he was a little boy. I'm glad he did that. I'm grateful
that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board notified the White
House at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday that Kennedy's body had been located,
but Clinton aides decided against waking the president. Instead,
they briefed him at 9:15 a.m., but the president apparently had
already heard the news on the morning television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delayed his 2 p.m. news conference by 30 minutes
Wednesday to receive a briefing about the discovery of the bodies
of Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton held his second lengthy
take-all-comers news conference in a month on Wednesday to
demonstrate his command of the issues and to try to put to rest any
hints of looming lame-duckism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself winding down,'' the president declared at
about minute 61 of a 69-minute news conference at the White House
on Wednesday afternoon. ``I feel myself keying up. I want to do
more. I want to try to make sure that I give the American people as
much as I can every day. So I've got plenty of energy, and I'll do
whatever I'm asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded questions on topics including the search for the
wreckage of the Kennedy plane and the exploration of the surface of
Mars. He talked of peace in the Middle East and in Ireland. He
spoke about China and the Federal Reserve and listened politely to
a largely unintelligible question from a Cuban reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Aides cautioned before the news conference that it was unlikely
to yield any ``new news'' and the president did not prove them
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He opened with a brief statement about the search for the bodies
of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister,
Lauren Bessette. The president then repeated his criticism of
Republican tax-cutting plans in familiar language, calling them
excessively costly and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the questions, 24 in all, including three on the
impasse in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``very disappointed'' in the breakdown of
the talks and said the disputes between Irish Catholics and
Protestants looked to outsiders like the squabbling of
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that America was tied by ``blood and
emotion'' to Ireland and that he had dispatched former Sen. George
Mitchell to try to break the stalemate. ``My instinct is that it
will be resolved,'' Clinton said hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Several questions concerned the campaign to succeed him. When
asked about Vice President Al Gore, Clinton said it was tough
coming out from the shadow of a popular president. He compared
Gore's problem to that of Richard M. Nixon in the final months of
Dwight Eisenhower's presidency, as he tried to establish an
identity independent of his role as Eisenhower's No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves a lot of credit for what he's done, and he has my
friendship and my support,'' Clinton said of Gore. ``But I also
think that it's a mixed blessing, as you say, because people want
to see any vice president out there on his own. If you go back and
look at where Richard Nixon was in 1959, you'll see the same sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's question period was scheduled in response to
complaints from reporters over the past 18 months of sex scandal
and Balkan war that access to Clinton had been limited to brief
picture-taking sessions and abbreviated news conferences with
foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kosovo conflict behind him and having seized the
initiative on Social Security, Medicare and taxes, Clinton has held
not only the two long press conferences but also a series of
interviews with newspapers and magazines, off-the-record dinners
with reporters and even a couple telephone calls to reporters,
something he almost never did in his previous years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said Clinton enjoyed
press conferences _ up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good test of his knowledge, it's a good test of your
stamina, but there are just times where they're not necessarily the
most productive thing to do,'' Lockhart said. One of those times
was all of 1998, when the president faced investigation and
mpeachment because of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The last question the president took on Wednesday was about
whether he would be content to quietly fade away as his presidency
ended and the spotlight shifted to other figures, including Gore
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who seems to be running for
the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has loved being president (``even on the bad
days'') and would even miss sparring with reporters (``believe it
or not''). But he said he would surely find some useful ways to
spend his remaining days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just grateful that I've had the chance to serve and that
the results have been good for our people and for our country and,
I think, for the world,'' the president said. ``And, you know,
that's part of life. Life has its rhythms, and the people that are
most satisfied and most happy in life take the rhythms of life and
make the most of them instead of sitting around moping and wishing
the rhythms were something other than they are. That's just not the
way life works, and listen, I'm way ahead, and I'm very grateful.
Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the East Room and then went to play golf.

REPORTS ON KENNEDY `DREAM HOME' ARE FALSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD WEIZEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CANAAN, Conn. _ A local architect and town building
department officials said there was no truth to news reports that
John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, were
building a sprawling three-story ``dream home'' in this affluent
Connecticut suburb near the New York state border.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kaali-Nagy, an architect and developer who has designed
large houses along the Fairfield County gold coast in Connecticut,
said Wednesday: ``I have absolutely no idea how these rumors got
started. All I know is, I turned on the television and saw this
very erroneous report.'' He added that he was building the house in
question for himself and his wife, Karen.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Appleby, news director at News 12 Connecticut, the Norwalk
cable station that broke the story, now says of the broadcast: ``It
was done on the weekend, and we didn't have enough information. The
word was that everybody in town was talking about this, very
wealthy people were talking. Our reporter made the leap of faith.
I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Daley, executive vice president of Country Living
Associates, a real estate agency, said, ``I think these wild rumors
got started because the Bessette family just moved out of town to a
home in Old Greenwich a few months ago and someone might have
spotted John Kennedy Jr. and his wife here during that time and
jumped to the conclusion they were buying a home here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her firm had handled the sale of the Bessettes' home
when they moved out of New Canaan.

CLINTON SAYS GORE EMBODIES CHANGE VOTERS WANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday he agreed the
American people want a change from his administration, but
maintained that Vice President Al Gore best embodies the difference
they want.
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton said he was just having fun when he mocked Gov.
George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' slogan, but he
again said Americans should expect candidates to say what they will
do if elected, as Gore has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the American people have to decide is what kind of change
do they want? Do they want to build on what has worked for the last
six and a half years, or do they want to abandon it and go back to
what failed them for 12 years before? That will be the decision
they have to make,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared before the media in a formal East Room news
conference, his second in two months, in a subdued and soft-spoken
mood, having just learned Coast Guard officials had located the
bodies of John Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and
her sister Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   His wistful demeanor gradually lightened during the 70-minute
session that covered more than a dozen topics ranging from foreign
policy to his feelings on the national spotlight, shifting to Gore
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who may run for the Senate
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   _ Said he would veto the nearly $800 billion tax cut plan being
proposed by House Republican leaders, calling it a ``risky plan''
that would save neither Social Security nor Medicare;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reiterated that the United States maintains its one-China
policy and that he expects China and Taiwan to peacefully resolve
current tensions caused by Taiwan's hints at independence and
China's hints of military reprisal;
</P>
<P>
   _ Said participants in the Northern Ireland peace accord should
come together to resolve differences that now threaten that pact;
</P>
<P>
   _ Urged Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to hear
out the peace proposals from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak;
</P>
<P>
   _ Said his administration, which he hinted saved the imperiled
space station several years ago, is determined to renew U.S.
interest in space exploration by highlighting the benefits to
health and the environment from current programs;
</P>
<P>
   _ And said he will release a study Thursday showing 75 percent
of the elderly need his proposal for prescription drug coverage
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's midyear session with reporters came has his own public
approval rating remains high, at 58 percent in a USA Today poll,
but the survey also showed a majority of Americans want a change
from his administration. Clinton disagreed that it was a bad sign
for Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what that means is people think things are going well,
but they want a change in policy, so I think that's right. If you
ask me that question and you word it in that way, I'd be in the 50
percent,'' Clinton said, adding he would vote against any candidate
who said he would do everything exactly the way Bill Clinton did
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is should we change in a way that builds on what
has been done and goes beyond it, which is what I would argue, or
should you change and go back to the policies we were following
when we had $290 billion deficits and we averaged over 7 percent
(unemployment) for 12 years?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, to me, the best thing the vice president has done is
to talk about, you know, dramatically intensifying the war on
cancer, making pre-school universal, increasing access to college
by helping people save without tax consequences; what he would do
to make America a safer country, what he would do in communities to
have faith-based organizations cooperate with governments more,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was just ``having a little fun'' when he
sarcastically mocked Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' theme
during a recent session with the Democratic Leadership Council. But
Clinton continued to suggest the term is without meaning because
Bush has failed to articulate his position on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would say to everyone, use whatever slogans you want, but
tell us where you stand,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush's campaign, released a
statement with 75 items she said were specific positions by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are 75 reasons why Bill Clinton is wrong. It is amazing
that President Clinton continues to engage in what he himself
admitted was `not quite presidential' by talking about a candidate
who hasn't even received the Republican nomination yet,'' she said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The first example of Bush's ``specific policy positions'' was:
``Supports cuts in marginal tax rates and a fairer system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also resisted any suggestion he would slow down as the
national spotlight shifted to Gore and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who may run for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself winding down,'' Clinton said, referring to
his remaining 17 months in office. ``I feel myself keying up. I
want to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of his vice president and of his wife, ``I owe them a
great deal.'' He said Gore has had more responsibility than any
vice president in history, but the American people may not realize
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has my friendship and my support. But I also think that
it's a mixed blessing, as you say, because people want to see any
vice president out there on his own,'' Clinton said, pointing,
oddly, to Richard Nixon in 1959. Nixon, after two terms as
Eisenhower's vice president, lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   As for his wife, Clinton said, ``If she decides to do this, I
will do whatever I can do. And, if she's successful, I will happily
go to the Senate spouses' meeting if that's part of the job.'' He
called his wife, whose public standing soared during the 1998
Monica Lewinsky scandal, a ``completely passionate public
citizen.''

HOUSE VOTES $1.4 BILLION FOR EMBASSY SECURITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.J., China)   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House agreed Wednesday to spend $1.4 billion
next year to protect U.S. embassies from the sort of terrorist
attack that left two U.S. embassies in East Africa in ruins last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which would dramatically expand the State
Department's security budget and is more than double what the
Clinton administration had requested, would be used to fortify
vulnerable embassies and build new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The money was incorporated in the $2.4 billion foreign affairs
funding bill that was approved by the House on a voice vote
Wednesday. The other money in the legislation would go to State
Department programs, international agencies and refugee relief.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal had broad bipartisan support in the House,
the final security budget for the State Department is likely to be
cut to less than $1.4 billion, perhaps far less.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved only $300 million next year for
security, and the final figure will be set in a conference
committee at which representatives from the Senate and House hammer
out differences in their legislation. The Clinton administration
has asked for a total of $568 million next year for new embassy
construction and for other security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that most U.S. embassies
do not meet basic architectural guidelines intended to protect the
compounds from the sort of truck bombs that destroyed the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, killing 224 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A special State Department committee established in the wake of
the East Africa bombings recommended that the government spend $14
billion over the next decade _ or $1.4 billion a year, the amount
approved Wednesday in the House bill _ for embassy security.

<P>
   ``American facilities abroad are under threat as they never have
been before,'' said Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, the chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, in explaining why the
security budget should be expanded so dramatically. ``Unfortunately
it took a catastrophic double-bombing in East Africa to teach us
that lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critical that we step forward at this time and fight the
war against terrorism and those who would threaten and intimidate
American officials abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign affairs bill was adopted without the anti-abortion
provisions that have been added to similar legislation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House rejected an amendment by Rep. Christoper
Smith, a New Jersey Republican and a fierce abortion opponent, to
cut off funds to the U.N. Population Fund, which he argues is
promoting abortion in China and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has managed nearly singlehandedly to block efforts in the
Congress to permit the payment of nearly $1 billion in back dues to
the United Nations by saddling legislation dealing with the arrears
with anti-abortion provisions. Lawmakers who want the United States
to pay the back dues say they are hopeful that they can stop Smith
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved Wednesday included a different amendment in
support of a State Department employee who has alleged that she was
removed from her post at the United Nations as punishment for
having divulged embarrassing information to members of Congress and
reporters about the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, approved on a vote of 287-136, could further
complicate negotiations in Congress over the fate of Richard C.
Holbrooke, whose nomination as chief American diplomat to the
United Nations has been held up as a result of the dispute over the
State Department employee, Linda S. Shenwick.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has vowed that he
will not permit a vote on Holbrooke's nomination until the State
Department reaches a settlement with Ms. Shenwick. The State
Department has denied that it was seeking to punish Ms. Shenwick as
a result of her contacts with lawmakers and the press.

FIDELITY, SCHWAB, 2 OTHERS TO FORM TRADING NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. have
been fierce competitors in virtually every business in which they
operate _ mutual funds, stock brokerage, online trading. But on
Wednesday they said they were joining forces.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which is a unit of FMR Corp., Schwab and two other
large Wall Street firms, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Spear,
Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, said they planned to form an electronic
stock-trading network.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, which has yet to be named, could quickly become one
of the best-funded and most efficient of the nine computerized
stock trading posts known as ECNs, or electronic communications
networks. As such, it will probably provide stiff competition for
the biggest ECNs: Instinet, which is a unit of Reuters Group PLC,
and Island from Datek Online Holdings Corp., as well as for the
NASDAQ stock market itself.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, Schwab, Donaldson, Lufkin and Spear, Leeds are
expected to funnel many of their customers' orders to the new
operation for execution, a behind-the-scenes move that should
create little noticeable change for existing customers. But the new
venture will probably also provide a platform from which the
partners can offer after-hours trading to individuals, much in the
way Instinet now serves institutions like pension plans and mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which participants said was subject to
approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, were not
disclosed. The four parties will each own a quarter of the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs are relatively new inhabitants of Wall Street, the result
of changes in the way customer orders to trade NASDAQ stocks are
handled by brokerage firms. Those changes, which were instituted in
the wake of federal antitrust scrutiny of NASDAQ market dealers,
provided for a new forum where buyers and sellers could trade
stocks without paying a markup to the professional traders who have
long served as middlemen in the NASDAQ market.
</P>
<P>
   The new ECN will be, in essence, a renovated version of the
Redibook ECN now operated by Spear, Leeds, which is the largest
specialist on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and makes
markets in NASDAQ stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four partners will have a financial incentive to
make sure there is sufficient trading on the system to make it a
viable alternative to the NASDAQ system. In order for customers to
get good prices for their orders, the system needs a heavy volume.
The new partners already use ECNs for a significant part of their
customer orders, particularly limit orders, which are requests by
customers to trade stocks within certain boundary prices.
</P>
<P>
   The firms will not be required to send their limit orders to the
new ECN _ on the contrary, they are required by federal securities
laws to seek out the best prices for their customers. But a big
portion of small investors' orders, as well as some orders from the
mutual funds businesses of Fidelity and Schwab, are expected to
find their way to the new market.
</P>
<P>
   Limit orders offer less opportunity for market makers like
Spear, Leeds and Schwab's Mayer &AMP; Schweitzer unit to make a profit
on a trade. Securities regulations require market makers to either
route limit orders to ECNs or to reflect those low-margin orders in
their current trading quotes.
</P>
<P>
   But the customers whose orders are sent to an ECN benefit only
if a sufficient number of other investors are there seeking to
trade. If not, orders are less likely to be filled at a desirable
price. By joining together and shuttling a certain portion of their
orders to their own ECN, ``we are creating a liquidity pool that we
feel will be one of the deepest liquidity pools out there,'' said
Robert Mazzarella, president of Fidelity Brokerage Services.
</P>
<P>
   The venture joins three of the largest online brokerage firms in
Schwab, Fidelity and Donaldson, Lufkin's DLJ Direct; three of the
biggest providers of clearing, or back-office processing of
securities trades, in Spear, Leeds, Fidelity and Pershing, also an
affiliate of Donaldson; and four of the biggest NASDAQ market
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were some of the last holdouts that had not bought a piece
or connected to an ECN,'' said Lon Gorman, president of Schwab
Capital Markets and Trading. ``We each have enough order flow to
become our own ECN, and collectively we present a huge opportunity
to get a lot of orders interacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing firms voiced little concern Wednesday about potential
competition from the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt it changes the competitive landscape, and they
certainly are going to come after our business,'' said Matthew
Andresen, president of Island. ``But we're happy to compete with
them on the basis of price, service and liquidity. And I think an
entrant of this type is a particularly strong validation of the
power of this model.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Instinet, which has said it is considering opening
up its electronic trading service to individual investors, declined
to comment on the announcement. NASDAQ officials were not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the big Wall Street firms that own parts of most
competing ECNs, three of the four members of the new venture,
excluding Spear, Leeds, count individual investors as their primary
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   That means that a firm like Schwab can use the network as a
platform for providing new services, like after-hours trading,
previously available only to institutions. Schwab officials have
voiced dismay over the delays by the major exchanges in moving to
extended hours. The New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have said
that they will wait until at least next year to extend trading, and
a study group brought together by the SEC is examining how an
extended session would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this platform offers the best opportunity to offer
after-hours trading,'' said Gorman. ``I don't think we're trying to
put a time or a place on how that is going to work. But after-hours
trading is going to proceed with or without the exchanges, and
we're prepared to compete in that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new ECN also offers other opportunities to the participants.
With far more transaction volume than Spear's Redibook had by
itself, the venture is a more attractive potential partner for the
New York Stock Exchange, which has said it is looking at a link
with one ECN or more. Gary Goldring, a senior managing director of
Spear, Leeds, which is the largest specialist on the floor of the
New York exchange, said that Redibook had talked with the Big Board
about a possible link.
</P>
<P>
   With nine ECNs now operating or in the planning stages,
questions have arisen about how many of them can survive in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cohan, a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin, said the
new venture represented a step toward consolidation in that
business, because each of the partners were heavy users of ECNs,
which get paid a small fee for executing each transaction. Now with
their own network, ``we've taken this from being an expense to a
way of lowering our expenses as the markets get more competitive,''
he said.

REPORT DETAILS MEXICO BANKING SCANDAL, BUT WILL IT BRING CLOSURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the early 1990s Mexico's bloated government
sold off the banks it had seized from private hands a decade
earlier, in a proud campaign to get ready to compete in the modern
world of global finance.
</P>
<P>
   Today the banking system is in disorder, starved for capital and
unable to make loans. Three of the Mexican entrepreneurs who bought
banks from the state are facing criminal charges for huge frauds.
Mexican taxpayers are looking at a bill for at least $71 billion to
pay for a gigantic bailout the government undertook to save the
banks from collapse after the economic crisis of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And no high-ranking public official has ever lost a job over the
mess.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, in the throes of a delicate transition from
one-party authoritarian rule to democracy, the banking scandal
posed a central problem about how to deal with the misdeeds of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans believe that the banks' troubles stemmed mainly
from corruption and cronyism in the financial and political elites.
But after 18 months when the bank bailout dominated the debate
between President Ernesto Zedillo and the opposition-dominated
Congress, no side is satisfied that the truth has been revealed or
justice has been done.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is time to close the books on the past
and make reforms to insure such scandals do not happen again. The
opposition wants the officials who were responsible to be
identified and brought to account. Now the battle is waning and the
two sides have reached nothing better than a draw.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal came to a point of closure this week when a Canadian
auditor, Michael Mackey, presented a report commissioned by the
Congress in which he examined the performance of the banking system
for the last two decades and the record of the government rescue
program since its inception in 1994. The opposition parties in the
lower legislative house commissioned the review hoping it would
expose rampant malfeasance in both the banks and the bailout
program and collusion between them to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey's report in itself was a notable step forward. It was the
first time that Mexico ever opened up the innermost workings of its
financial system to scrutiny by an independent and a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million report gives a stark portrait of an incestuous
banking system in which a small business elite controls the banks
as well as many of the companies that want to borrow from them.
Mackey pointed out the nearly total lack of effective supervision
of the system in 1991 when the government began to sell the banks
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey described the ``complete inadequacy'' of the background
checks done on the Mexican businessmen who came forward to buy the
banks. In many cases the purchasers ``lacked the lending experience
and technical expertise necessary for prudent banking and were
unwilling or unable to hire competent management.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey found that senior finance officials had been long aware
that the banking system suffered from a chronic lack of capital but
continued to insist on propping up ailing banks, thereby vastly
increasing the cost of the rescue. Officials also encouraged the
banks to make loans to uncertain projects and companies to help
stimulate the economy, even though the likelihood that the debts
would be paid was low.
</P>
<P>
   Of 18 banks the government sold off, only 5 still operate today
under the control of the Mexican bankers who bought them. Foreign
banks bought most or all of 4 more banks that are still operating.
The government has taken over 3 banks that were failing and 6
others went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor identified $7.7 billion worth of questionable or
illegal loans that were taken over from the banks by the bailout
program, which was known as the Bank Savings Protection Fund. Of
those, $638 million loans were plainly illegal. Mackey found $4.4
billion in loans were given by banks to other banks or companies
with which they had some kind of direct business relationship, an
unacceptable practice by most international standards.
</P>
<P>
   But to the frustration of opposition lawmakers, Mackey's report
produced no evidence that any government official broke the law or
was grossly negligent. The auditor praised several top finance
officials for improving oversight and tightening regulations and
accounting practices in the last five years, since President
Ernesto Zedillo took office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flaws of the bailout, Mackey concluded, it did
succeed in averting general financial meltdown, preserving every
depositor's account and reducing the number of Mexican debtors who
could not pay their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Finance officials responded to the report by noting they had
already detected the illegal loans the auditor identified. Over the
course of the scandal the authorities brought 137 indictments
against 211 bankers, including five men who were bank chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Angel Isidoro Rodriguez Saez, who is charged with a
$10 million fraud, has defeated several of the cases against him in
the courts. But finance officials said his victories only
illustrated the flimsiness of Mexico's fraud and bankruptcy laws
and the malleability of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Many practices by bankers and bailout officials that Mackey
questioned were not illegal because the financial laws are often
lax. A well-known business magnate, for example, can still walk
into a bank and take away a multimillion-dollar loan solely on the
basis of a signature.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Mackey pinpointed only $73 million in loans, a tiny
fraction of the whole portfolio of bad loans absorbed by the
bailout fund, that were so irregular that the fund will have to
return them to the banks. The finding brought relief to bankers and
international investors who were watching closely to see what
impact the auditor's review would have on the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey noted that the government fought his scrutiny every step
of the way. Officials won the war to keep the auditors from
examining a series of trust funds that Carlos Cabal Peniche, a
former Mexican bank owner jailed in Australia and facing possible
extradition on fraud charges, said that he used to channel illegal
donations to Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the four opposition parties in the Congress failed to nail
the government as they had hoped because they were divided among
themselves. They did not mobilize enough combined strength to force
any senior official to acknowledge that the cost of the bailout was
far more than Mexican voters ever expected to pay, and to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   This week the opposition pledged to pursue impeachment
proceedings against Guillermo Ortiz, the head of the central bank,
Eduardo Fernandez, the top banking regulator, and Finance Minister
Jose Angel Gurria. But the efforts seemed unlikely to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected the financial crisis of 1995,'' said Marco
Provencio, the spokesman for the Finance Ministry, explaining the
government's view. ``You can't go through a crisis of that
magnitude without some cost to public finances. And not one single
Mexican lost a peso in their bank accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bailout was the big booty of the technocrats and the small
group of speculators close to them,'' Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
an opposition leader, said Wednesday. ``The Mexican people should
not have to pay for it, without a full accounting and punishment
for those responsible.''

   BOEING-MACHINISTS (Seattle) _ Boeing's 48,000-member Machinists
union rallies Wednesday; at least 20,000 members are expected to
show up at the Kingdome to authorize a strike. It's largely a
pro-forma vote, and could backfire if too few members show up to
vote; they're not voting on any specific proposals, just showing
solidarity for the union's negotiations with the company, which are
continuing.

SENATE APPROVES NEW WAY TO OVERSEE NUCLEAR PROGRAMS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a
major overhaul of the Department of Energy, creating a new agency
within the department to oversee nuclear weapons programs in the
wake of allegations of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote marked the most far-ranging legislative
response to two scathing studies _ one earlier this year by a House
panel and the other last month by a presidential review board _
that concluded that China stole some of the country's most
sensitive nuclear secrets and that criticized the Energy Department
for lax security at the nation's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would centralize security functions scattered in
other divisions in a new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, with some
autonomy within the Energy Department. Its director, an under
secretary of energy, would have broad powers to oversee policy,
budgeting, security and counterintelligence for the department's
nuclear programs, and would report to the secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 96-1, came after Democrats wrung concessions from
Republican sponsors to strengthen the energy secretary's authority
over the new agency. Only Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., opposed a measure
that represents the most dramatic restructuring of the department
since it was formed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes it less likely in the future that there will be
nuclear secrets walking out the door at our national
laboratories,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and sponsor of the
measure, an amendment to a bill authorizing the government's
intelligence programs.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the new agency would also begin to reverse a trend
at the Energy Department since the end of the Cold War to emphasize
nonprofileration programs over defense programs and nuclear
deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote dealt a setback to the Clinton administration
and to Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, who initially resisted
the idea of a semiautonomous nuclear stewardship agency before
grudgingly accepting the plan in order to avert alternatives he
considered even worse, like splitting the agency from his
department altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Senate made significant improvements to the
reorganization proposal,'' Richardson said Wednesday night in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for passage in the House are unclear.

</P>
<P>
   There are lawmakers from both parties who feel the Senate action
goes too far and others who feel it does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for example, seven senior lawmakers on the House
Commerce Committee, including the chairman, Rep. Tom Bliley of
Virginia, and the ranking Democrat, Rep. John D. Dingell of
Michigan, criticized the Senate approach, saying, ``We should not
compound current problems by enacting an ill-conceived and
ill-considered `quick fix.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richardson has tried to blunt the growing calls to
revamp his department by reorganizing and centralizing its
far-flung security functions. Last month, Richardson appointed a
retired four-star Air Force general to be the department's first
security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Richardson proclaimed several weeks ago that ``Americans
can be reassured; our nation's nuclear secrets are today safe and
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a stinging report last month, the presidential review
panel said the administration's efforts to tighten security at the
nuclear labs were hamstrung by bureaucratic arrogance and
foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, which studies sensitive intelligence and national security
matters for the president, concluded that the Energy Department was
a ``dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of
reforming itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by former Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.,
recommended creating either a semiautonomous agency, like the one
the Senate approved Wednesday, or an independent agency, like the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to oversee nuclear
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said in debate Wednesday that they were
modeling their proposal after the presidential advisory board's
recommendation. ``Instead of a czar getting a structure set up
under the old system, we ought to get this one in his hands,'' Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said of choosing between Richardson's new
security chief and the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats succeeded in adding language to the measure that gives
the secretary and his top aides greater discretion in developing
policies related to the agency. ``It adds to the efforts of the
president and Richardson to have greater control over the
activities in these labs,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.

UNCLE AND NEPHEW HAD SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since 1969, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has been the
patriarch of his family, the one many nieces and nephews called for
advice or help. But his connection to John F. Kennedy Jr. had many
special qualities.
</P>
<P>
   It was bracketed by moments of sadness. On the day John saluted
his father's casket on the way to Arlington National Cemetery, he
also celebrated his third birthday at the White House. As the
foreign leaders left, his Uncle Ted was there to sing Happy
Birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, with the support of his own sons, Edward M.
Kennedy Jr. and Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the uncle
went to sea with the Navy as the bodies of John Kennedy, his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, were
being recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were happier times. On July 19, 1988, John
introduced his uncle at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta, saying: ``I owe a special debt to the man his nephews and
nieces call Teddy, not just because of what he means to me
personally but because of the causes he has carried on. He has
shown that an unwavering commitment to the poor, to the elderly, to
those without hope, regardless of fashion or convention, is the
greatest reward of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy never had to get John and his sister, Caroline,
out of trouble, and so there have been few headlines about their
ties.
</P>
<P>
   But one friend, who agreed to speak only if he were not
identified, called the senator's connections to the first 2 of 13
Kennedys made fatherless by assassins ``unbelievably close.'' He
said Caroline's children treat their uncle, who has a repertory of
animal sounds to amuse small children, ``as their grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend said the senator was weathering his latest loss but
suggested that he had been angry when television helicopters flew
over Caroline's house on Long Island to take pictures when he went
to console her on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator worked with his niece on matters relating to the
John F. Kennedy Library on Boston's Dorchester Bay. One former aide
said the senator usually deferred to her. And he encouraged her and
her brother to visit President Reagan at the White House in 1985 to
ask him to attend a fund-raiser for the library. Reagan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The senator encouraged his nephew John to take on the leadership
of an institution dear to the family, the Institute of Politics at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   For some years, the younger Kennedy seemed bored at institute
meetings. But in recent years he had taken a greater interest,
hoping to broaden its definition of politics beyond running for
office or holding positions in government. He wanted a focus on
service, as explained in the verse from St. Luke that his
grandmother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, taught his father: ``Of
everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required.''
</P>
<P>
   As his uncle encouraged his nephew's desire to assume the
chairmanship of the Institute board _ Senator Kennedy's college
chum, former Sen. John Culver of Iowa, was stepping down _ the
connection was like that of a senior partner promoting a young
protege. And it was agreed that the younger Kennedy would take the
position this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, a Nixon, Ford and Reagan administration
official who also serves on the board, on Wednesday described the
senator's manner over many board meetings: ``He was a gentle guide
to John when it came to the IOP. He gave John space, gave him
encouragement, gave him the experience of his years. This was a
mission John thrived on. It was really a labor of love between an
uncle and a favorite nephew.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy had been eagerly looking forward to last weekend
and the wedding of Rory Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's youngest child.
He told a reporter that after the January 1998 funeral of Michael
Kennedy, one of Rory's older brothers, that he wanted to bring the
family together for a less formal, happier occasion. But the
wedding was canceled when the family learned that John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s plane had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, at St. Thomas More Church in New York, the church
where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis worshipped, the senator, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, and the rest of the family will assemble
again, for a mass to again mourn lost life.

 &HT;    Amoco BP pumps out low-sulfur fuel
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rushing to market with air-friendly gasoline before
any of its competitors, BP Amoco will unveil a cleaner low-sulfur
fuel today that will be in 550 metro Atlanta stations by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is drawing personal appearances by Gov. Roy
Barnes and federal environmental Chief Carol M. Browner.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel, to be sold in 25 counties, will be available only in
premium grades for now and will not carry a price increase. It will
meet state pollution standards four years ahead of schedule and
federal rules five years early.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials and state air experts who looked at the
company's calculations say the fuel, which has less sulfur than
current formulations, will reduce pollution by an amount equal to
what 12,000 cars produce daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a major step that's going to solve Atlanta's air quality
problem? No,'' said Michael Kumpf, BP Amoco government affairs
director. ``If we could do it in the whole slate (of grades), it
probably wouldn't solve Atlanta's problem. ... But it's small
steps. And hopefully that will encourage other people to take
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The announced attendance of Barnes and Browner at the luncheon
news conference today is another big sign of Atlanta's role as the
poster child for air quality and traffic problems. The region has
been out of compliance with Clean Air Act standards and has been
under a freeze for federal road-building money. That's one of the
big reasons BP Amoco says it chose Atlanta as the first city to
roll out it's new fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company views Atlanta somewhat as a case study,'' said Tim
Hayes, a research engineer and project manager for BP Amoco's debut
of the lower-sulfur gasoline in the United States. It plans to have
the fuel in 40 cities worldwide by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said metro Atlanta consumers are aware of the need to
address the region's air issues. He commended the governor's push
to create a new state panel to crack down on traffic congestion and
air problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right direction,'' said Joel Stone, director of
planning for the Atlanta Regional Commission, the planning agency
trying to come up with a plan to meet federal air standards by this
spring. That plan will include mass transit, roads and new fuels.
``I'm pleased they will be taking this on early. I hope others will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the good-guy public relations move, it will also be
good business. By getting out ahead of other oil companies, all of
which will be mandated to have the new cleaner-burning fuel in
metro Atlanta by 2003, BP Amoco hopes to get a jump on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will cost more to scrub and refine the gasoline to
reduce sulfur in the premium grade, the company plans to keep the
gas prices at regular levels. What they hope to do, Hayes says, is
build brand loyalty and increase premium sales. Come Sept. 30, the
company will have an advertising campaign aimed at motorists who
want to make an environmental difference. It's called ``I'm only
one.''

 &HT;    BellSouth's second quarter strong enough for analysts
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. met the expectations of analysts
Wednesday, reporting solid growth in its second quarter with
revenue of $6.1 billion and net income of $980 million, or 51 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was 8.5 percent better than the same period a year ago
and net income up nearly 20 percent as the Atlanta-based
telecommunications company compensated for a slowing in the rate of
growth for new phone lines by surging still faster in other arenas.
During the second quarter of 1998, BellSouth had revenue of $5.7
billion and net income of $818 million, or 41 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Local phone service on its nine-state turf still accounts for
the bulk of BellSouth revenue. Making up most of the company's
revenue growth were local phone business and BellSouth's
international investments, said Ron Dykes, chief financial officer
for the $24 billion-a-year company. ``CFOs are never happy with
revenue growth, but yes, we like what we see. Look at the strong,
fundamental underpinnings that we have for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of local lines grew by only 3 percent, and much of
that came in additional lines: About 17 percent of customers now
have more than one line at home. Most of the boost in the local
phone unit came from new phone features like Call Waiting and
Caller ID. About 40 percent of BellSouth customers have some
enhanced features, Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
   Company stock edged slightly higher on the news, a contrast with
the first quarter when investors were taken aback by an
unexpectedly large investment in new high-speed lines. But
BellSouth has not reversed course just to placate Wall Street,
Dykes said. ``We had an adverse reaction. That doesn't mean we
stopped our investments, because we think that is the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the present _ company earnings and stock price _ is about
where it was predicted to be, said Anthony Ferrugia, analyst for
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Burks of Hilliard Lyons said BellSouth is
well-positioned to exploit growing demand for data services and _
especially in Latin America _ for wireless phones. The biggest
challenge for BellSouth will be behemoth rivals like Bell Atlantic,
AT&AMP;T, SBC and MCI WorldCom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's earnings came the same day as Bell Atlantic reported
11 percent higher earnings. Also Wednesday, Cincinnati Bell
announced plans to buy IXC Communications. IXC, which is building a
national high-speed network, had been mentioned as a possible
partner for BellSouth. ``I think BellSouth can be successful on
their own,'' Burks said. ``But they may want to gain some size, and
there are fewer and fewer dance partners left.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth this spring made an investment in long-distance
carrier Qwest Communications but might have reduced influence as
Qwest merges with U S West.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock Wednesday rose 75 cents to close at $47.06 1/4 a
share.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T's cable foray a popular subject

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Money magazine for August offers its update on
investing in the form of a midyear guide. There is also a list of
the editors' 12 favorite stocks for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there is an analysis of how well Ma Bell (AT&AMP;T) will
do in its new role as Ma Cable, along with one of those
for-your-amusement stock graphics. That is, if you owned 100 shares
of AT&AMP;T when the company broke up in 1984, you had $6,150 invested.
Left untouched, that would now be worth $56,144 and spread among 10
companies. The same money in a Standard &AMP; Poor's index fund would
be worth only $49,048 today.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia readers will enjoy the fact that stock picker John Neff,
former manager of the Vanguard Windsor fund, puts three
Georgia-based companies in his top seven _ Beazer Homes USA, a home
builder; Delta Air Lines; and Georgia Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor also takes a look at AT&AMP;T, focusing on the
debt the company has taken on, balanced against the potential
rewards. Otherwise, the August issue focuses on value investing and
cites Bob Evans Farms, Crown Cork &AMP; Seal, DSP Group, Gateway,
Interstate Bakeries, St. Jude Medical and Toro.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these stocks _ Interstate Bakeries is an example _ are
expected to appreciate by 45 percent in 12 months, according to the
magazine.

   What organizations need most are ``people who are good at
managing organizational pain,'' say three Canadian business
professors. Called ``toxic handlers,'' these heroic individuals
shoulder everyone else's anger, fear and frustration in times of

   Banking over the Internet is poised to become a powerful force
in consumers' lives. According to the July/August issue of
Bloomberg Forecast, people will reach a point at which they prefer
to have a branch bank in the corner of the den to having one at the
crossroads three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks see their online business as a way to cement
relationships with their clients and cut their costs at the same
time,'' writes reporter Gregory Taggart. ``As a result ...
competition among the banks themselves and between them and
brokerages and other financial providers should assure that
innovations will keep coming'' and the fees for using them will
keep falling.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine are tips about winning with sports
stocks and why the life insurance industry could be the next hot
sector, and a list of the top low-cost, large-cap growth funds,
this year headed by White Oak Growth Stock and Vanguard Growth

FIDELITY IN GROUP FORMING TRADING NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the latest challenge to traditional securities
markets, mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, leading discount
brokerage Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., and two other prominent financial
services firms said Wednesday that they would form a new stock
trading network.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal constitutes the Internet Age's latest shot at the
old-fashioned way of buying and selling stocks through traditional
brokers or dealers who crowd hectic trading floors. The four firms
expect to create a computer-based system that will automatically
match up buyers and sellers, all without human middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The system, known as an electronic communications network, or
ECN, joins nearly a dozen similar alternative marketplaces that
have sprung in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs are a fast-growing threat to venerable trading venues like
the 207-year-old New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, the
computer-based system for trading shares of smaller companies. ECNs
now account for one in three trades of Nasdaq-listed shares and
around 5 percent of the trade in NYSE shares, according to some
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by technological changes and a stampede of investors into
the stock market, the private networks are part of an unfolding
revolution in the way modern Americans invest _ a seachange that
includes explosive growth in online brokerages and proposals by
major exchanges to allow 24-hour trading.
</P>
<P>
   The new, private networks _ digital matchmakers of sorts _ are
seen by some financial firms as a wave, though of uncertain
contours, of the future. But some industry observers contend that
the independent networks produce a fragmented and volatile stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity and Schwab are joined by Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette _ a New York investment bank and brokerage _ and Spear,
Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, the country's biggest specialist and market-making
firm. (Such firms, which trade Nasdaq stocks, facilitate liquidity
by using their own capital to buy and sell shares.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mazzarella, head of Fidelity's brokerage unit, said the
new system would enable its participants ``to reduce costs and
aggregate market orders.'' That economy-of-scale approach in theory
will translate into lower costs, and better returns, for fund
shareholders and stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is significant in several ways. Fidelity, the
nation's biggest fund firm, and Schwab, which sells funds and is
the country's biggest discount brokerage, trade vast quantities of
stocks each day for their millions of fund and brokerage customers,
and thus have great power to move markets. Shifting even some of
that business away from Nasdaq and the Big Board toward alternative
networks could impact the prices other buyers and sellers pay. The
lesser the volume at any given marketplace, the less likely a buyer
or seller is to get an optimal price.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Samuel Hayes of Harvard Business School called the venture
``the equivalent of the establishment of a fourth main network for
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to bypass the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq as well,'' Prof. Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   That Fidelity and Schwab, major competitors to each other, would
ally is one sign of the steps financial firms are taking to cope
with a fast-changing investment industry. The move shows that the
two companies are racing to come up with new ways to compete with
other investment firms, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
brokerage giant that recently launched online trading.
</P>
<P>
   The four firms have yet to name their new system _ which will
build on Spear's existing ECN, REDIBook _ and did not disclose the
terms of their deal. Like all ECNs, the new venture will deal only
with limit orders _ orders to buy or sell a stock at a specific
price, rather than at the market price _ on Nasdaq. Mazzarrella
said the group had no plans soon to route trades of NYSE shares
through its ECN. He declined to state what percentage of Fidelity's
and the others' trades would be executed through the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals to the new ECN _ there are now 9 of them _ include
Instinet Corp., a unit of Reuters Group; Island ECN, which is owned
by web-based brokerage Datek Online Holdings; and Archipelago,
whose owner is Terra Nova Trading.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs have traditionally catered to institutional and
professional investors. With the exception of day traders, whose
rapidfire trades are usually executed through ECNs, few ordinary
investors use the new electronic networks. But a Fidelity statement
said the new venture was designed ``to see how retail and
institutional customers can benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail, or ordinary, investors may find ECNs attractive for a
number of reasons. Anonymity _ a strategic asset when squaring off
against other bidders or sellers _ is one. The availability of
after-hours trading, instantaneous trade executions, and lower
costs _ all prominent features of ECNs _ are others, according to
Gomez Advisers, a consulting firm specializing in online financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs work by passively matching buyers and sellers,
electronically and instantaneously. If an ECN can't find a seller
for your stock at your pre-set price, it sends your order to
another ECN or to a Nasdaq marketmaker. All that happens in a
matter of seconds or minutes. The ECN collects a fee for its
matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, dealers and marketmakers seek out the best sell or
buy prices for a client and pocket the difference, known as a
spread. Unlike ECNs, they also use their own capital to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional exchanges like Nasdaq and the Big Board are battling
the changing stock-trading marketplace with a number of moves,
including proposals to extend trading hours into the night. But in
a sense, the traditional venues helped spawn their challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Nasdaq's parent organization, grew concerned that dealers
were profiting excessively by not giving clients the best-priced
trades. In 1996 it ordered them to display prices, usually more
competitive, that they had also posted on ECNs. The rule cut costs
for investors and spawned the growth of ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new, independent networks raise questions. A recent
Gomez report said that ECNs could not efficiently execute trades,
meaning garner the best prices for clients, unless they grow their
volumes. But with the ECNS marketplace fragmented, and the new
systems unlinked, massing volume could be difficult.

SUPPORT OF WOMEN KEEPS DOLE AFLOAT 
OHIO: DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE POOL RUNS DRY  
 MISSISSIPPI: SIGNS OF SHAME ARE TAKEN DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The word ``begats'' is sic in last quote of 1st item) 
(yn) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has said time and again that she is not running as a woman
but instead is a woman running.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the most notable things about Elizabeth Dole's
quest for the Republican presidential nomination is the large
number of women who turn out whenever she makes a campaign stop,
especially young women not previously involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   That was true months back when the former Red Cross president
first hit the campaign trail, packing an arena in Ames, Iowa, to
overflowing with cheering young women, many of them college
students. And it remains largely true now, again most notably in
Iowa, where numerous young women volunteers are working to ensure
that Mrs. Dole shows well in the much-publicized Republican straw
poll to be held in Ames on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most impressive role women are playing in the
Dole campaign involves fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole came in dead last among Republicans in raising money
in the first three months of her campaign, pulling in less than
$700,000. There was talk that even though she was running second in
the polls, trailing only Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, she might
have to get out of the race if she did not turn the money thing
around.
</P>
<P>
   She has.
</P>
<P>
   She has assembled a cadre of a dozen or so wealthy, successful
businesswomen, led by Bonnie McElveen-Hunter of Pace Communications
in Greensboro, N.C., one of the largest women-owned companies in
the country, and over the past three months the women's savvy,
contacts and influence have helped Mrs. Dole raise $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That is far less than the $30 million or so pulled in by Bush in
that period _ and it is probably nowhere near enough to enable Mrs.
Dole to catch him, though she is still holding second place in the
polls. But it is nevertheless more money than any other Republican
contender has raised in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, according to a study by the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington, close
to half of her gifts of $200 or more came from women.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts say that few women candidates get half
their $200 plus contributions from women.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in general, men and women, get about a quarter of
their $200 plus gifts from women.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE POOL RUNS DRY
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, easily won election in
1994 and has since shown well in the polls, Democratic leaders in
the state have always considered his support to be thin. So last
year when he helped lead the charge to remove President Clinton
from office, Democratic hopes to oust him in Election 2000
increased, in good part because the president carried Ohio in both
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a top-tier, well-financed Democrat willing to tackle
DeWine and thereby improve Democratic chances of taking back the
Senate is proving difficult. No fewer than 10 party stalwarts have
rejected feelers from party leaders, unconvinced that the senator's
support is so thin that they could whip him.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Joel Hyatt, DeWine's opponent the first time
around, three House members _ Sherrod Brown, Marcy Kaptur and Ted
Strickland _ and a former House member, Dennis Eckart. The list of
others choosing not to run includes Lee Fisher, the party's
unsuccessful candidate for governor last year; Mary Boyle, the
unsuccessful Senate nominee in 1998; Mayor Michael White of
Cleveland, and several current and former Cuyahoga County
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Richard Cordray, a Columbus lawyer who was an
unsuccessful candidate for attorney general last year. He says he
is considering having a go at DeWine. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, David Leland, and Tim
Burke, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Hamilton County,
which encompasses Cincinnati, have been discussing the problem and,
according to The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Tuesday, they are taking
a look at an old Ohio-pol-turned-talk-show-host, one Jerry
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Springer may be best known for presiding over a television show,
a sometimes violent show, physically and verbally, that has a huge
national following because of its preoccupation with matters
personal, especially bedroom matters. But back in the 1970s, before
he was on television, Springer was best known as a member of the
Cincinnati City Council (who got caught at one point consorting
with a prostitute). He also ran for governor, unsuccessfully, in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Springer for Senate? Seriously?
</P>
<P>
   No comment from Springer.
</P>
<P>
   But Burke, who has known him since the City Council days, says
he would be a ``viable, fascinating, interesting candidate'' and,
besides, would start off with plenty of money and high name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Leland says Springer probably would face a
``difficult'' race, considering ``the stuff'' found on his show.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the view of Gerald Austin, a veteran Democratic
political consultant from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He says maybe a Springer candidacy is not such a bad idea after
all, given how easily Jesse Ventura, the professional wrestler, won
the governor's race in Minnesota last fall. Politics, Austin told
The Plain Dealer, is becoming more and more like show biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said, ``Jesse the Body begats Jerry Springer.''
</P>

   SIGNS OF SHAME ARE TAKEN DOWN
</P>
<P>
   In our previous installment of the Fordice Saga, Kirk, the
governor of Mississippi, and Pat, his wife of 44 years, were at a
marital impasse.
</P>
<P>
   After a weeklong liaison in France with an old high school
sweetheart, the governor, a Republican, was back home in Jackson,
pressing for a divorce, threatening to thrash nosy reporters and
insisting there was no parallel between his extramarital behavior
and that of President Clinton, whose resignation he demanded during
the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Fordice, for her part, was hanging tough, refusing to decamp
from the Executive Mansion and saying that while the governor might
want her gone, she did not view their marriage as ``some sort of
romantic comedy'' and would fight to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Then she apologized ``for being a partner in a marriage that has
become a source of embarrassment for Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now today's installment, in which we learn just how deep that
embarrassment runs for some Mississippians. ...
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, at a cost of $1,200, Republican leaders in
Vicksburg erected two road signs at the city's limits that proudly
informed drivers that they were entering the ``home of Governor
Kirk Fordice.'' But a few days ago, the city ordered the signs
removed, with several officials explaining that in light of the
governor's marital problems, the proud message the signs once sent
had become garbled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signs had been spray-painted with the word
``hypocrite.'' The other had been bashed to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   One city alderman, Sam Habeeb, a Republican, said that while he
belonged to the same political party as the governor, he
nevertheless favored removal of the signs ``to remove the mixed or
ambiguous messages that are out there about marital loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   An alderwoman, Gertrude Young, a Democrat, said city hall had
received a number of complaints about the signs after word got out
about the governor's trip to France. Anyway, she noted, the
governor no longer owns a home in Vicksburg.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's spokesman, Robbie Wilbur, urged Mississippians to
consider ``the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Vicksburg and the state of Mississippi,'' Wilbur
said, ``are better off since the Fordice administration took
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

 &HT;    EU seizes files, questions Coke's practices
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., which has had its share of troubles in
Europe lately, now is the target of an inquiry into its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, which meets with analysts today in
New York to discuss its operations going forward, confirmed
Wednesday that European Union authorities have seized ``internal
files'' at offices in Germany, Austria and Denmark. The operations
of three of its anchor bottlers, including Coca-Cola Beverages,
also are being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Ben Deutsch in Atlanta said allegations have been made
that the company is running afoul of EU competition rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not been notified of the specific allegations,'' said
Deutsch, who added that the company is fully cooperating with the
probe into its relationship with retailers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   He said Coca-Cola's Atlanta offices have not been asked for any
documents, and he added that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises,
the Coke system's largest bottler, was not a target of the inquiry.

<P>
   The Financial Times of London reported the EU's ``dawn raids''
were a prelude to an investigation into whether Coca-Cola has
abused itsill get better faster
than building products gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   An exceptionally strong housing market is boosting sals of
Georgia-Pacific Group's gypsum wallboard, plywood and oriented
strand board.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company's pulp,paper and packaging businesses
are steadily recovering from slumping prices last year related to
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's building products segment posted a sharp
increase in operating profits, to $364 million from $120 million
one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the building products distribution segment reported an
operating profit of $35 million, compared with a loss of $11
million one year ago, excluding gains on asset sales.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific recently boosted its distribution business with
its purchase of Unisource Worldwide, the nation's largest
distributor of paper products and janitorial supplies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the acquisition, analysts were concerned that the
low-margin business wouldn't do much for earnings. Georgia-Pacific
said Wednesday that Unisource could start adding to earnings as
early as this year. Most of the impact, however, will come next
year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia-Pacific's other businesses, results were mostly
positive. The containerboard and packaging segment posted
second-quarter profit of $81 million, up from $31 million one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit in Georgia-Pacific's pulp and paper segment
slipped in the second quarter due to lower prices in the tissue and
uncoated freesheet businesses. Operating profit for pulp and paper
was $33 million, down from $54 million one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's timber business reported better-than-expected
results for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. posted net income of $45 million, or 53 cents a
share, compared with $38 million, or 41 cents a share, one year
ago. The current results exclude a one-time, after-tax gain of $52
million from the sale of timberlands.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. was expected to earn 43 cents a share, according to a
survey of analysts by First Call.

 &HT;    UPS to sell 10% of stock to public
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service plans to sell public stock for
the first time, a move it says is aimed not at raising cash but at
creating a market for shares that can be used as currency in future
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery giant said Wednesday it will sell 10 percent of its
stock, or about 55 million shares, in an offering by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   A target price hasn't been set. UPS stock _ now owned by 125,000
employees, along with company trusts and foundations _ is valued
internally at $47 a share, which would make the offering worth $2.7
billion. But the company expects it to bring substantially more on
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, UPS' offering could challenge the $4 billion
Conoco Inc. public offering of 1998, which now ranks as the biggest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, UPS will use the proceeds for a tender offer
to employee stockholders who want to sell up to 10 percent of their
shares at a newly established market price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to raise cash but to make our stock a public
currency that can be used in future transactions,'' UPS spokesman
Ken Sternad said.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Kelly declined to elaborate at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is nothing specific I can talk about,'' he said.
``We intend to begin this transaction and then begin the process of
looking at candidates that may fit our competitive posture.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said the move will give UPS a valuable currency in
the modern marketplace of stock-based transactions. ``It makes
perfectly good sense for them to go public,'' said Jeffrey
Pittsburg, president of Pittsburg Institutional Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He said likely acquisition targets lie in logistics management
or electronic commerce _ hot growth areas for UPS and chief rival
Federal Express. Fedex shares, which are up 42 percent in the past
year, fell $1.18 3/4 Wednesday to $46.31 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there are any big core business
acquisitions, but certainly logistics is one direction UPS wants to
go in,'' Pittsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS last month announced a deal to buy Latin America air rights
and other assets of Challenge Air, a Miami-based shipper.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering will end UPS' status as one of the world's
biggest private companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, the offering is structured so that initially 99 percent
of the voting control of the company will stay in the hands of
current shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   UPS stock ownership was limited to about 35,000 managers until
1996, when purchase rights were extended to all workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic step for UPS,'' Kelly acknowledged.
``Under this plan, UPS will continue to be employee-owned and
owner-managed, allowing us to preserve the best aspects of our
culture while meeting the business challenges of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was a tightly held secret among UPS' top executives and
board of directors until it was announced to employees, and then
the media, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, founded in 1907, moved its headquarters to Atlanta in 1991.
Since then annual revenue has grown from about $15 billion to
nearly $25 billion, making it Georgia's largest company.

CLINTON CANCELS TAIWAN TRIP TO AVOID INTENSIFYING CHINA DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that he was
canceling a visit to Taiwan by Pentagon officials this week out of
concern that this could exacerbate tensions between Taiwan and
China over Taiwan's diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was the best time to do something which
might excite either one side or the other and imply that a military
solution is an acceptable alternative,'' the president said at a
White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States would come to Taiwan's aid if it were
attacked by China, President Clinton said the United States ``would
be required to view it with the gravest concern,'' but he stopped
short of saying that U.S. military force would be used.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began July 9, when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui
asserted in an interview that talks between Taipei and Beijing
should be conducte$ on a ``state-to-state'' basis. Subsequent
explanations by Taiwan officials seemed to nudge Taiwan closer
toward formal independence, something Beijing has insisted it would
use military force to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rift, the Pentagon officials had scheduled a visit to
Taiwan this week to discuss cooperation over air-defense systems
and the possible sale of new military equipment to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has instead decided instead to send
diplomatic envoys to to Beijing and Taiwan to encourage a peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long adhered to a ``one-China'' policy,
which holds that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single
Chinese nation and that there should be peaceful efforts aimed at
reunification.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For decades, Beijing and Taipei each insisted it was the
legitimate government of one China and forced the rest of the world
to choose between them. But as more countries switched diplomatic
recognition to Beijing, and as Taiwan-born politicians like Lee
supplanted the Nationalist leaders who had retreated to the island
in 1949 after the Chinese civil war, Taipei dropped its claim to be
the mainland's rightful ruler, though not the goal of eventual
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, for its part, has continued to press hard for
reunification, by military means if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the envoys sent to Taiwan will urge
Lee to reconsider his remarks, while the officials sent to Beijing
_ Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth and Kenneth Lieberthal,
who oversees Asian affairs at the National Security Council _ will
press the Chinese not to consider using force to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is clear: We favor the one-China policy,'' Clinton
said Wednesday. ``We favor the cross-strait dialogue. The
understanding we have had all along with both China and Taiwan is
that the differences between them would be resolved peacefully.''
He said he was ``still not entirely sure'' what ``the Lee
statements were trying to convey.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration insisted Wednesday that it was
not trying to punish Taiwan by canceling the visit by Pentagon
officials and that it had no plans to curtail arms sales there,
friends of Taiwan on Capitol Hill stepped forward Wednesday to
defend Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, announced Wednesday that he
would block all congressional approval for foreign arms sales until
he had received assurances from the Clinton administration that it
was still fully committed to helping Taiwan defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reports circulating that the administration is
considering curtailing security assistance to Taiwan due to its
displeasure with President Lee's recent statements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If true,'' he said, ``these short-sighted, wrong-headed
sanctions are not in the U.S. interest, will undermine Taiwan's
fundamental security, and may destabilize the fragile peace in
northeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would block congressional approval for arms
transfers, which is required for large arms sales, ``until this
matter is resolved to my satisfaction.'' Under congressional rules,
Gilman could block arms sales abroad by introducing so-called
resolutions of disapproval for each sale proposed to Congress by
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Wednesday that the Clinton
administration's one-China policy was ``a puzzling fiction'' and he
saluted Lee for ``having the courage to state the obvious _ that
the Republic of China on Taiwan is a de facto sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that included references to ``Red China,'' Helms
accused the administration of ``caving in'' to Beijing and dragging
the United States ``even deeper into the `one-China' hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the United States should be seizing every
opportunity to break free of Beijing's definition of `one China',''
he said, the administration is ``paralyzed by its own anachronistic
policy, better known as appeasement.''

ATTORNEYS DECRY EFFECT OF MICROSOFT TEMP RULINGS ON CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuit by temporary employees against Microsoft has been
celebrated as a victory for equality _ that one group of workers
should get the same benefits as others. It is indeed that. But it
comes at some cost to the commercial rights of contracts and of
legal clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The clarity is in the dissents. ``This is a simple contracts
case,'' wrote Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the second of three 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals rulings on Vizcaino vs. Microsoft. The
temps had signed a contract, he wrote, and it should be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Judge Stephen Trott saw it in the first ruling, in
1996: ``The plaintiffs were university-educated. One had a law
degree. They knew what they were getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   That a court would tear up their contracts and award them
benefits never offered ``is so radical,'' he wrote, that it
violates the Constitution, which forbids a state from impairing the
obligation of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that view lost. It has not been a simple contracts case.
One writer has compared it to Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, the case in
Charles Dickens' ``Bleak House'' that went on and on until all the
assets were exhausted. (Except that this is Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   What the plaintiffs asked for, and got, was that the employment
contracts be declared illegal. Their Seattle attorney, Stephen
Strong, argues that the ``permatemps'' are not real temps because
they are hired by Microsoft and then assigned to an agency and
because they stay so long. The whole arrangement, he says, is a
``paycheck laundering scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is that they're Microsoft employees,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The third ruling, in May, was a bit different. The court said
the temps are ``common-law employees'' of Microsoft and the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else has come to this conclusion,'' says Fredric
Singerman, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who has filed a pro-Microsoft
brief for nine trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   Common law does have cases of someone being ``a servant of two
masters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hire a trucking company to move some goods, and the
driver is under your direction, and he hits a car, there can be
dual employment status,'' Singerman says. ``But there is zero
precedent for imposing dual-employment status for employee-benefit
purposes, and it doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule had been, if you were hired by Volt _ a staffing agency
_ and ``leased'' to Microsoft, you worked for Volt. Microsoft paid
Volt and Volt paid you. Your paycheck and benefits came from Volt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court says, you work for both. You get the benefits
offered by Volt, and you can demand at least one benefit, the
employee stock purchase plan, offered by Microsoft to employees who
don't work for Volt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of double-dipping,'' Singerman says. ``I'm a
technical benefits lawyer. This is appalling. There is no way to
deal with it. You almost have to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   This case deals with the stock-purchase plan, which offers
Microsoft stock to employees at a 15 percent discount. The temp
agencies don't offer that. But the two-bosses principle could be
applied to benefits both sides do offer. Could a temp have 401(k)
plans from Volt and Microsoft for the same job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's at all clear,'' Singerman says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's 401(k) plan is an issue in the cases. It hasn't been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, dual employers are not going to offer two full
platters of benefits for a worker doing one job. If the law
requires them to do that in circumstance X, they will avoid
circumstance X. They will change the benefits offered, the contract
duration or the means of payment. Or something. But how to do it is
not clear in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot discern the law,'' says New Rochelle, N.Y., tax
attorney Alvin Lurie, a former assistant commissioner for the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   He and other critics of the rulings would like ``check the box''
legislation to determine whether a temp is an employee of the temp
agency or the client. ``Let the parties come to an agreement,''
Lurie says.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, the temps' attorney, isn't so sure. They don't have the
bargaining power of Microsoft, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hevener, attorney for the American Payroll Association, a
Washington, D.C., trade group that represents employers, says a
system might allow employees to choose. It wouldn't matter so much
what box was checked, she says, ``as long as everybody knows what
they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Check-the-box would put the issue back in the world of
contracts: clear and practical. Not necessarily equal.

ESCAPE CHARGES AGAINST LIBERIAN PRESIDENT WERE DROPPED IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Surrounded by four petty con men with a hacksaw and a
rope made from bedsheets, Charles Taylor made his escape from the
Plymouth County jail in 1985. An intense manhunt snared his
accomplices, but Taylor fled toward a life of war and power.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later Taylor is the president of Liberia, a West
African nation still recovering from a brutal seven-year civil war,
led by Taylor, which took 150,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Taylor's election as president in 1997, which
ratified his hold on a job he claimed by force in 1990, he remained
a wanted criminal here in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, that is. The Plymouth County District
Attorney's office quietly -- at the behest of the US State
Department and Taylor's Washington lobbyist -- dropped its
longstanding jailbreak charges against an African ruler known by
some for his quirkiness and sense of fashion, and by others for his
raw brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's relations with the United States have often been
uneasy, but he has recently sought to burnish his image in
Washington. Although there was little chance that Massachusetts
police would have ever dragged away an elected foreign dignitary,
Taylor apparently saw the outstanding charges against him as an
obstacle to the success of a public-relations campaign being
orchestrated by a $300,000 Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The jailbreak charges against Taylor, which carried a sentence
of up to five years, were dropped in October 1998 after entreaties
by Lester Hyman, a Washington lobbyist for Liberia, Plymouth County
First District Attorney Joseph P. Guaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Liberia and educated in Boston, Taylor had been jailed
in Massachusetts on extradition charges in 1984. He had fled
Liberia after being accused of embezzling nearly $1 million from a
government agency he headed there for three years. Taylor's allies
maintain that the embezzlment charges were politically motivated,
and that his life may have been in jeopardy had he been extradited
to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   After his escape, Taylor resurfaced in his native country on
Christmas Eve in 1989, when he led a small band of rebels and
launched a spectacularly violent civil war that killed an estimated
150,000 and displaced hundreds of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Gaughan added that Hyman ``had the State Department speak with
us,'' and that ``without actually saying so'' State Department
officials ``indicated it would be in the best interests of
diplomacy'' to drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A US official, however, vigorously denied the notion that the
State Department would interfere with a state's legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a decision that Massachusetts authorities had to make
on their own,'' said the official. ``We were not involved in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hyman, the lobbyist for Liberia at the time, nor
representatives from the Liberian embassy in Washington returned
calls. Herman J. Cohen, Liberia's current Washington lobbyist,
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government dropped its own extradition charges
against Taylor several years after his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gaughan said he believed Taylor, now 51, wanted the charges
dropped prior to trips he planned to make in the United States. But
he added there was little chance state authorities would have acted
against him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't keeping an eye out to see if he was coming,''
Gaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   International law experts also noted that it would be highly
unusual for a U.S. state to arrest a foreign leader, and that
Taylor is covered by ``head of state immunity'' under international
law _ although sources conceded that the law is often ambigous.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the charges remained as a ``psychological''
impediment to Taylor's image enhancement, said one source. ``You
don't want to be traveling and have this hangingover you.''
</P>
<P>
   Settled by freed American slaves in the early 19th century,
Liberia has long had a special relationship with the United States.
The country's constitution, crafted up by a Harvard Law School
professor, is modeled on the US Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taylor government has been criticized by the State
Department and human rights activists for ``extradjudicial
killings'' and other rights abuses. The impoverished country, which
celebrates the 152nd anniversary of its independence on July 26, is
still largely devastated from its civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor graduated from Chamberlayne Junior College in Boston in
1974, and received an economics degree from Bentley College in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Torli Krua, president of the Liberian Community Association of
Massachusetts, said the greater Boston area's estimated population
of some 4,500 Liberians -- many of whom fled here during the civil
war -- is less concerned with the state's charges against Taylor
than with rebuilding its shattered homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberians in Massachusetts have fled the war and most have
experienced a lot of trauma. Most people lost a couple of
relatives,'' Krua said. ``The country has to be rebuilt, but most
of the technical and educated people have fled the country and they
are not returning.''

NORTH KOREA PROCEEDS WITH PLANS TO TEST-FIRE A LONG-RANGE MISSILE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Hawaii, Japan)   By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Despite stern warnings from the United
States, Japan and South Korea, North Korea is proceeding with plans
to test-fire a long-range ballistic missile this summer, diplomatic
and security officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, from Western and Asian countries, expressed grave
concerns that North Korea had ignored vigorous diplomatic efforts
in recent weeks to convince the communist country to abandon the
test launching.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range missile that North Korea intends to test is a
Taepodong-2, which has a range of up to 3,750 miles, making it
capable theoretically of reaching Alaska or Hawaii, the officials
said. The new rocket is an advanced version of the Taepodong-1,
which North Korea fired over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean in
August, raising fears across the region. That rocket has a range of
1,250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time all our intelligence indicates that North Korea
will go through with a second missile test,'' said a Western
security official, who like the others interviewed spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``That's really unfortunate because we will
be forced to respond, to send a message that this behavior cannot
be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Japan and the United States have warned North Korea
that if it launches the rocket, they will retaliate, most likely
with sanctions that would cut off all foreign aid, including food
and agricultural products vital to easing North Korea's widespread
famine.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, it has become increasingly easy
for countries like North Korea to obtain old American and Russian
missile technology. North Korea's Taepodong is basically a
longer-range version of the 1950s Soviet Scud missile. While
Taepodong-1 was not very accurate at hitting a specific target,
security experts say they believe that North Korea's second version
has greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   As North Korea continues to threaten its Asian neighbors,
opposition parties in Japan, South Korea and the United States are
pressing their governments to take stronger action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only state as clearly as possible that another firing
of a long-range missile would have serious consequences for
improvement of relations with North Korea,'' Stephen W. Bosworth,
the U.S. ambassador in Seoul, recently told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea has remained defiant in the face of the
warnings, vowing to continue its missile program, which it said is
a matter of national sovereignty. ``We will go straight, guided by
our faith and decision, no matter what others may say,'' North
Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by its foreign
news service, the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean officials have said that the Taepodong missiles are
used to ferry communications satellites into space, but U.S.
security experts disagree. They believe North Korea hopes one day
to use the missiles to transport weapons of mass destruction. North
Korea is also a supplier of missiles to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over North Korea's missile program has been rising
across the region and in the United States ever since foreign
diplomats returned from Pyongyang earlier this month with reports
that the reclusive country was preparing to launch a long-range
missile. Those reports precipitated the warnings and cajolings from
South Korea, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Military and intelligence operatives based in Seoul said in
interviews that they expected North Korea to test the missile
before the 51st anniversary of the Communist government on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The operatives said that U.S. surveillance shows that North
Korea is likely use its missile base in Musadan-ri, North Hamkyong
Province, the same location where it launched Taepodong-1 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The launching pad in Musadan-ri has been raised to accommodate a
larger missile with longer range, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and security experts said that North Korea's
long-range Taepodong missile was a destabilizing weapon because it
is likely to set off an arms race across Northeast Asia, as other
countries seek to match North Korea's military capability.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with President Clinton this month in Washington,
President Kim Dae Jong of South Korea expressed the need for South
Korea to develop its own deterrence against the North's missiles,
which already can reach anywhere on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, security experts said that another North Korea missile
launching could lead Japan to embrace the United States theater
missile defense program, which China has long viewed unfavorably as
an American effort to bolster the defenses of Japan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has threatened not only to end all aid to North Korea if
Taepodong-2 is launched but also to suspend its $1 billion
contribution to a consortium that has agreed to provide North Korea
with safe nuclear reactors and fuel-oil shipments in return for the
North ending its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's deep concern about North Korea's missile launching is
not measurable,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile threat is expected to be high on the
agenda of the South East Asian Nations Regional Forum to be held in
Singapore beginning July 24.
</P>
<P>
   The missile program is one of the few remaining bargaining chips
that North Korea has with the United States, and by launching it,
security experts said, North Korea believes it will gain more
leverage and bargaining power in obtaining foreign aid and in
dealing with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one thinks that we, who regard independence as our life and
soul, will not do what we should do because of somebody's slander
and `influence' upon us over the issue pertaining to our
sovereignty, it is a height of folly and foolish daydream,'' the
North Korean foreign news said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also behind North Korea's push to launch the missile is an
attempt to raise national morale and demonstrate military
sophistication during a famine that has killed hundreds of
thousands of people and after an embarrassing defeat in a naval
clash with South Korea last month.

ONE WOMAN'S STAND IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Indonesia's population nearing 211 million, 87 percent of
them Muslims, President B.J. Habibie likes to say his is the
largest Islamic country in the world, with more Muslims than the
entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be surprising, therefore, that some of the Islamic
parties are saying that Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose party came out
ahead in last month's election, should not serve as the republic's
next president because she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   There are some valid reasons why Megawati might not make a good
president. Being a woman is not one of them. She has had little
experience in governing, took few positions during the election,
and won slightly more than a third of the vote because she is the
daughter of Sukarno, the country's first president, whose reign led
the country to the brink of ruin. But to a new generation that
remembers little of Sukarno, it was enough that his daughter stood
in opposition to his dictatorial successor, Suharto, who was forced
out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Islam does not prevail in Indonesia with a heavy hand. The soft,
green islands of the East Indies do not lend themselves to the
harsh religious interpretations found in parts of the Arabian
desert. There is still much of the Buddhist and Hindu cultures that
came before Islam into Indonesia, with an underlay of animism that
deifies a spirit world that has nothing to do with the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   There are no religious police who force women to cover their
heads or forgo jobs. The national airline, Garuda, is named after a
Hindu god.
</P>
<P>
   Far more intensively Islamic countries, such as Pakistan and
Bangladesh, have had women presidents, with varying results.
</P>
<P>
   Given that no one party won enough votes to rule alone, a
process of coalition-building will unfold, and in this atmosphere,
Islamic politicians are feeling a new power. Megawati may fail to
reach the presidency, but it would be shameful if it were denied
her on grounds of gender _ especially in a country where religious
and political tensions run deep. Whatever their faults, Indonesia's
leaders have encouraged pluralism in the 50 years since
independence. It would be a pity if the result of a democratic
election brought intolerance with it.

BAD CALL BY THE UMPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each profession has its own indispensable skill, and for the men
in blue who call balls and strikes in the Major Leagues, that skill
is judgment. They must be able to see things as they really are.
</P>
<P>
   But 57 of 68 members of the umpires union made a blatant error
when they submitted letters of resignation, effective Sept. 2,
trying to pressure Major League Baseball to negotiate a favorable
new contract. The umps would be wise to rescind those resignations,
as five of their number have already done, before the Friday
deadline set by baseball commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   By resigning rather than striking _ the umpires are
contractually prevented from striking _ the men who are supposed to
distinguish ``safe'' from ``out'' allow the owners to accept their
resignations and hire replacement workers who, by definition,
cannot be called scabs.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, lawyers think the majors would have a good chance of
winning a suit against the umpires union for conducting an illegal
strike. The arbiters of the diamond would then bring on themselves
the worst of all possible calamities. They could be replaced
permanently as nonstriking employees and end up paying damages to
their employers for striking illegally.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one possible explanation for this folly. The umps
became so maddened having to call the games played by the prima
donnas who pass for ballplayers that they lost their judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans are accustomed to seeing disputes provoked not by
indignant players or managers but by truculent umpires determined
to put some lippy millionaire in his place. And when the
commissioner's office sent a memo to the umps asking them to
enforce a uniform strike zone, they filed a grievance, and many of
them vowed to go on calling pitches as capriciously as ever.
</P>
<P>
   When a home plate umpire cannot judge whether a batter broke his
wrists on a retracted swing, the opinion of another ump is
solicited. That's what the men in blue need to do now. They've made
the wrong call, and they have to change it before it becomes
official.

NEW STUDY PUTS BAY STATE IN HIGH-TECH LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the race with Silicon Valley to create the economy
of the future, Route 128 has moved into the lead, according to a
new study.
</P>
<P>
   In a ranking of all 50 states on how well they are making the
transition to a ``new economy'' made up of dynamic, high-tech
companies, Massachusetts surpassed its archrival, California, as
the leader, according to the Progressive Policy Institute, a
Washington think tank affiliated with the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   The exhaustive study, which uses 17 economic indicators to
compile rankings, found that a bounty of professional and high-tech
jobs, top-drawer universities, and a prominent role in the global
economy have propelled Massachusetts ``farthest along the path to
the New Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that Massachusetts has achieved its top spot
despite its dismal rank of 34th among states providing Internet
access and technology training in its schools. Surprisingly, just
39 percent of Massachusetts adults are on line _ putting it eighth
behind such states as Alaska, Colorado, Maryland, Utah, and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, the birthplace of Digital Equipment Corp., once
one of the world's biggest computer-hardware makers, has long been
a center of high-tech commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But the study gave credence to a growing belief that a
restructuring in the 1990s has fostered small, innovative companies
_ in software, the Internet, telecommunications, and biotechnology
_ that may give it an edge over California, the home of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so many rankings, people look at the absolute size'' of
California compared with Massachusetts, said Sara Johnson, chief
regional economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRIin Lexington. But
Massachusetts, ``relative to the size of our state population and
land area, does extremely well in these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study focused on the Internet industry that was also
released Wednesday showed that Massachusetts' success is owed, in
part, to California's problems.
</P>
<P>
   While the second report ranks Silicon Valley as a leader in
Internet development, the region is losing ground to cities with
flourishing Internet industries, especially Seattle, New York,
Austin, and Boston, according to a Chicago consulting firm that
conducted a study for Joint Venture, a group of 20 California
companies and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, there are 58 established, Internet-related
companies, compared with 25 in New York, 12 in Los Angeles, and
nine in Boston, Joint Venture said. Competition from other cities
``may jeopardize the Valley's position as the geographic center of
the Internet industry,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of housing in California and a slow-growing work
force threaten California's dominance in the Internet industry, the
study found. These problems also are a factor in the Boston area as
well, where housing prices have spiraled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Policy Institute took a broader look at the
conditions necessary to support the gamut of high-tech industries
that are fueling growth in an increasingly fluid, technology- and
service-oriented US economy.
</P>
<P>
   This ``new economy'' is ``a knowledge- and idea-based economy
where the keys to wealth and job creation are the extent to which
ideas, innovation, and technology are embedded in'' an area's
economy, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Using 17 indicators, composite ratings were compiled for each
state: Massachusetts ranked first with a score of 82.27 and
California was second with 74.25, followed by Colorado, Washington,
and Connecticut. West Virginia, Arkansas, and Mississippi were on
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest rankings for Massachusetts were in
indicators for its prime work force, a product of Boston's premier
universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as
well as its concentration of smaller colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The state, for example, has the highest share _ 34 percent _ of
its total work force employed in management, professional, or
technical jobs. More than 26 percent of all its jobs are in offices
_ second after Delaware, with 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state also did well in rankings for its concentration of
``.com'' companies, high production of technology patents, and
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, for example, has a higher portion _ 22.7 percent
_ of its manufacturing jobs dependent on exports than does
California, and a larger share of Massachusetts' work force _ 5.4
percent _ are employed by overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said these measures are ``puzzling'' because a much
greater share of California's gross state product comes from
exports than Massachusetts's.
</P>
<P>
   Although Massachusetts may be ``comparable to Silicon Valley,''
she said, ``California is a large state that is very diverse'' and
``more dependent on agriculture and mining.''

BARON DAVIS RUNNING AT SPL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Southern California, when a guy named Davis shows up without
warning, it's usually Al.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at the Pyramid, it was Baron.
</P>
<P>
   And you probably missed it, right? Well, you don't have to stick
your melon in the microwave, because another Baron sighting is
anticipated this weekend. But you are required to keep reading for
the really crucial details.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with the third pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, the Charlotte
Hornets did choose UCLA point guard Baron Davis. But the Hornets
aren't fielding a Summer Pro League squad, so Baron was a long shot
to make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The long shot came in when he suited up for the L.A. Pros, whose
roll call includes ex-UCLA star Charles O'Bannon. It is not a
coincidence that Davis and O'Bannon are represented by superb agent
Arn Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Davis' impact on the L.A. Pros' rout of a team
sponsored by Toyota of Orange, L.A. Pros coach Maury Hanks rolled
his eyes shook his head and - with uncharacteristic brevity said
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's evidence: 16 points (7 of 8 field-goal attempts went
down), 3 assists, 4 rebounds and (yikes!) 5 turnovers in 12
rationed minutes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hanks, Davis has committed to suiting up for the
L.A. Pros on Saturday night (7:30) when they meet the dreaded
Momentum squad.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected high-draft-pick sighting occurred Tuesday
morning, when UNLV's Shawn Marion - selected by Phoenix with the
ninth pick last month - trotted out with the, um, Korean All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know he was playing,'' said Suns coach Danny
Ainge, who just happened to be at the Pyramid to spy on someone
else. ``You really can't tell how good he is from this.''
</P>
<P>
   In 18 minutes, the 6-foot-7 small forward had 9 points and 9
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead )Winter at summer league
</P>
<P>
   Tex Winter, the high priest of the triangle offense, visited the
Pyramid on Tuesday for the Lakers' final SPL date, a 116-76 pasting
by chatty Bo Outlaw and the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, the former head coach at Long Beach State, had lobbied
for an on-campus arena in those days, but doesn't take credit for
his offensive system influencing the design of the eventual
facility. And he doesn't think the performance by the summer Lakers
defines what fans will see from Phil Jackson's winter Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense works better,'' Winter said, ``when you have
better players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem really hasn't been the offensive system,'' he
said of his new team's warm-weather edition. ``The problem is that
they can't stop anybody on defense. And we're getting killed on the
boards.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to weigh in on Devean George, a 6-6 small forward
drafted by the Lakers with the 23rd pick, Winter went the scholarly
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine shooter,'' he said of the frisky, Division III
star from Augsburg College in Minnesota, ``but school's out on some
other parts of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to learn to sustain an effort. But in time, I think he
can be a fine player.''
</P>
<P>
   George had 15 points and 9 rebounds against the Magic, but made
only 5 of 19 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Outlaw, who checked George for much of the
game, had a typically modest stat line of 7 points and 8 rebounds.
But the Magic free agent (who broke into the NBA by picking its
lock with the Clippers) did provide high entertainment value by
treating courtside fans as if they were the fourth wall, offering
bits of Meadowlark Lemon-style dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) Good timing by Miller
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller, the rookie point guard selected by Cleveland with
the draft's eighth pick, certainly looked like the truth against
Seattle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Gary Payton wasn't in the building, but the former Utah
star did go up against Randy Livingston and Moochie Norris, who at
least played in the league last season.
</P>
<P>
   Against this representative competition, Miller scored 23 points
including a game-winning layup at the buzzer to lift the Cavaliers
to a 106-104 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, made 10 of 13 field-goal attempts, had 4 assists, 6
rebounds and 5 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller sat, 5-5 Earl ``The Squirrel'' Boykins kept the
point guard position warm by posting 10 points and 9 assists,
including a 7-point, 6-assist second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) Observation deck
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Livingston, who finished last season in
Phoenix, will join the Suns for mini-camp work and audition for
them during the summer league in Salt Lake City. ``He's keeping his
options open,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said of Livingston.
``I've been impressed with him. He'll be in somebody's camp.'' ...
In four games with the Clippers, point guard prospect Jeff McInnis
averaged seven assists. ... Undrafted rookie Jamel Thomas, a
reserve swingman with the Cavs, could be a find. The 6-6 Providence
star, who scored 18 points in Cleveland's victory over Seattle, is
Stephon Marbury's cousin. ... Putting Literal In Its Place Dept.:
According to one longtime NBA witness, 21-year-old Dirk Nowitzki -
the sweet-shooting 7-0 forward of the Dallas Mavericks - is a bit
mechanical in his movements. The word this scout used was
``stiff.'' Not ``a stiff,'' mind you. There's a big difference. On
the same night he was regarded as ``stiff,'' the young
phenom-in-waiting from Germany could be seen in Frog's Gym at the
Pyramid ... stretching.

TO START A DAY AT THE DESKTOP, A CHANCE TO SMILE AND PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (yn) 
 By JEROEN VAN BERGEIJK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of procrastinators on the Internet, or at least
that is what a Dutch startup called Bitmagic hopes. The company
intends to bring entertainment to the Net in the form of computer
games, animation and interactive cartoons delivered to the user's
desktop each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitmagic is the little plaything on your desktop, a small,
very quick diversion before you start your day,'' said Francisco
van Jole, one of the company's founders.
</P>
<P>
   Just as television produced the soap opera and the sitcom, van
Jole believes, the Internet will produce its own entertainment
genres. Bitmagic hopes ``to move the sitcom from the living room to
the desktop,'' van Jole said.
</P>
<P>
   On Bitmagic (www.bitmagic.com), most of the content consists of
visual gags, and some material is in the tradition of The New
Yorker cartoons, but users can find simple shoot-'em-up-style games
as well. Some of the cartoons are interactive: users must click the
image to start the animation. The international editorial team
headed by van Jole, a former journalist, draws inspiration from
current events, popular culture and, most of all, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a general audience, Bitmagic is intended for a
computer- and Internet-adept audience. Recent cartoons, for
instance, involved a computer hacker attacking the Pentagon and a
spoof on the Jerry Springer show called ``I Committed On-Line
Adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bitmagic is a Dutch company, it is trying to create an
international brand of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is far from easy, because most humor differs from culture
to culture,'' van Jole said.
</P>
<P>
   Users who want to review the company's content have to download
a Bitmagic player. The company then sends new material every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the entertainment on the Internet you will find on Web
sites,'' van Jole said. ``The problem with that is that you have to
make the effort to find and visit them. We think there are a lot of
people that love to be entertained, but don't want to be bothered
with searching for it. That's why we will broadcast it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitmagic has attracted major Internet players in the
Netherlands. Van Jole founded the company with Michiel Frackers, a
young Dutch entrepreneur who started the Netherlands' first
commercial Internet service provider, Planet Internet, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The startup received a large chunk of its $6 million in seed
capital from Roel Pieper, a former vice president of the Dutch
electronics powerhouse Royal Philips Electronics. Bitmagic is based
in Amsterdam and recently opened a satellite office in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bitmagic expects to make money by providing commercials among
the cartoons and games. Frackers, who is the company's chief
executive, anticipates that Bitmagic's format, allowing animation,
will attract attention from advertisers that are dissatisfied with
banner advertisements, the main form of advertising on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dying for something that's not a banner,'' he said.
``You can't tell a story in a banner, you can't be funny in a
banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitmagic, however, said it wants to avoid the kind of
advertisements that dominate television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ads must be compelling,'' Frackers said. ``Otherwise people
will click away, or worse, they will stop using us all together. If
we don't like a commercial, we will definitely turn it down.''

ESCAPE CHARGES AGAINST LIBERIAN PRESIDENT WERE DROPPED IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Surrounded by four petty con men with a hacksaw and a
rope made from bedsheets, Charles Taylor made his escape from the
Plymouth County jail in 1985. An intense manhunt snared his
accomplices, but Taylor fled toward a life of war and power.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later Taylor is the president of Liberia, a West
African nation still recovering from a brutal seven-year civil war,
led by Taylor, which took 150,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Taylor's election as president in 1997, which
ratified his hold on a job he claimed by force in 1990, he remained
a wanted criminal here in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, that is. The Plymouth County District
Attorney's office quietly -- at the behest of the US State
Department and Taylor's Washington lobbyist -- dropped its
longstanding jailbreak charges against an African ruler known by
some for his quirkiness and sense of fashion, and by others for his
raw brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's relations with the United States have often been
uneasy, but he has recently sought to burnish his image in
Washington. Although there was little chance that Massachusetts
police would have ever dragged away an elected foreign dignitary,
Taylor apparently saw the outstanding charges against him as an
obstacle to the success of a public-relations campaign being
orchestrated by a $300,000 Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The jailbreak charges against Taylor, which carried a sentence
of up to five years, were dropped in October 1998 after entreaties
by Lester Hyman, a Washington lobbyist for Liberia, Plymouth County
First District Attorney Joseph P. Guaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Liberia and educated in Boston, Taylor had been jailed
in Massachusetts on extradition charges in 1984. He had fled
Liberia after being accused of embezzling nearly $1 million from a
government agency he headed there for three years. Taylor's allies
maintain that the embezzlment charges were politically motivated,
and that his life may have been in jeopardy had he been extradited
to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   After his escape, Taylor resurfaced in his native country on
Christmas Eve in 1989, when he led a small band of rebels and
launched a spectacularly violent civil war that killed an estimated
150,000 and displaced hundreds of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Gaughan added that Hyman ``had the State Department speak with
us,'' and that ``without actually saying so'' State Department
officials ``indicated it would be in the best interests of
diplomacy'' to drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A US official, however, vigorously denied the notion that the
State Department would interfere with a state's legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a decision that Massachusetts authorities had to make
on their own,'' said the official. ``We were not involved in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hyman, the lobbyist for Liberia at the time, nor
representatives from the Liberian embassy in Washington returned
calls. Herman J. Cohen, Liberia's current Washington lobbyist,
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government dropped its own extradition charges
against Taylor several years after his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gaughan said he believed Taylor, now 51, wanted the charges
dropped prior to trips he planned to make in the United States. But
he added there was little chance state authorities would have acted
against him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't keeping an eye out to see if he was coming,''
Gaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   International law experts also noted that it would be highly
unusual for a U.S. state to arrest a foreign leader, and that
Taylor is covered by ``head of state immunity'' under international
law _ although sources conceded that the law is often ambigous.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the charges remained as a ``psychological''
impediment to Taylor's image enhancement, said one source. ``You
don't want to be traveling and have this hanging over you.''
</P>
<P>
   Settled by freed American slaves in the early 19th century,
Liberia has long had a special relationship with the United States.
The country's constitution, crafted up by a Harvard Law School
professor, is modeled on the US Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taylor government has been criticized by the State
Department and human rights activists for ``extradjudicial
killings'' and other rights abuses. The impoverished country, which
celebrates the 152nd anniversary of its independence on July 26, is
still largely devastated from its civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor graduated from Chamberlayne Junior College in Boston in
1974, and received an economics degree from Bentley College in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Torli Krua, president of the Liberian Community Association of
Massachusetts, said the greater Boston area's estimated population
of some 4,500 Liberians -- many of whom fled here during the civil
war -- is less concerned with the state's charges against Taylor
than with rebuilding its shattered homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberians in Massachusetts have fled the war and most have
experienced a lot of trauma. Most people lost a couple of
relatives,'' Krua said. ``The country has to be rebuilt, but most
of the technical and educated people have fled the country and they
are not returning.''

WRITER LOOKS AT SOOTHSAYERS, AND THOSE WHO LISTENED TO THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Where is Nostradamus when we need him?
</P>
<P>
   Every age, it seems, has its oracles and soothsayers, and you'd
think we'd be crawling with them as the millennium draws near.
</P>
<P>
   But author Kathleen Krull says the closest thing to a modern-day
prophet is Microsoft's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't put Bill Gates in the same book with Jeane Dixon,''
concedes Krull, whose new children's book profiles a dozen of
history's most influential prognosticators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are people who are ahead of their time, and he's a
good example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Krull highlights an eclectic group in her new book, ``They Saw
the Future: Oracles, Psychics, Scientists, Great Thinkers and
Pretty Good Guessers'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $19.99, 108 pages).
</P>
<P>
   It's aimed at kids 10 to 14 but many adults will want to sneak a
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People throughout history have wanted to predict the future,''
said Krull, 46, a raven-haired writer with a soft, motherly face.
``It's something we're all curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego writer, who was in Seattle for book signings,
profiled scientists and ``armchair dreamers'' like Leonardo da
Vinci and H.G. Wells, plus mystics and seers whose predictions defy
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who were more right than wrong,'' Krull said.
``All were open-minded without being gullible. That's what I try to
be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the mystical is a departure for Krull. She's best
known for the light-hearted biographical series that began with the
``Lives of the Musicians'' and went on to include writers, artists,
athletes and presidents. (Up next: profiles of women rulers through
the ages.)
</P>
<P>
   Krull highlights the all-too-human foibles of the history's
leading lights, tailoring her writing to the big-headed portraits
painted by her friend Kathryn Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``They Saw the Future,'' Krull reins in the humor and plays
it straight. Profiles include historical and cultural details that
explain each prophet's influence on the times. Likewise, Kyrsten
Brooker's stylized portraits are more in a more dignified vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense this is a sort of history of the world,'' Krull
said, ``because you have to explain the context of their
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Krull says rulers through the ages have heeded soothsayers, from
the Oracle at Delphi in ancient Greece to contemporary psychic
Jeane Dixon, who reportedly advised presidents, congressmen and
NASA scientists even though ``her overall batting average was not
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prophets were outsiders with acute powers of observation.
Some, like the Oracle at Delphi, probably exploited gossip and
inside information from visiting supplicants.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't always right, but there are plenty of bull's-eyes
that Krull can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   We can only wonder how Hildegard of Bingen, a German nun of the
Middle Ages, came to write about the circulatory system 300 years
before it was ``discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how the 16th-century French physician Nostradamus foresaw
(depending on whose interpretation you believe) the 1969 moon
landing and the death of England's Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Krull thinks Leonardo was the most versatile, creative genius of
the bunch but she says Edgar Cayce (pronounced KAY-see) was the
most mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever explained how Edgar Cayce did what he did,''
Krull said.
</P>
<P>
   Cayce, a Kentuckian with an eighth-grade education, would go
into a trance each afternoon and answer questions posed in letters
from everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   He would speak foreign languages he'd never learned, diagnose
medical conditions for people he'd never met and display
encyclopedic knowledge far beyond his own experience or education.
</P>
<P>
   After The New York Times publicized his feats in 1910, a panel
of experts tested Cayce by shoving a pin through his cheek and
peeling back the nail of his little finger while he was in a
trance. Krull says Cayce showed no pain until he woke up, when he
began to bleed heavily. His finger throbbed for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some fakes in the field, Krull thinks certain people do
have extra intuition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she got the idea for ``They Saw the Future'' after her
acupuncturist introduced her to some psychic friends. Without
naming specifics, Krull says they ``just told me things about
myself and my past that they couldn't possibly have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Her admission may raise a few eyebrows, but Krull doesn't
foresee any serious fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the head of a government, so I don't think people have
to worry too much about me,'' she said with a chuckle. ``I'm just a
children's book writer.''

GESTURES OF GRIEF FOR A MAN LARGER THAN LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(rk) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Owens pulled from his pocket a small square
of paper, worn from being unfolded so many times. On one side was
the letterhead of Hachette Filipacchi, publisher of ``George''
magazine. On the other side was John F. Kennedy Jr.'s autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a 29-year-old salesman, fought back tears, along with
hundreds of others outside Kennedy's TriBeCa apartment, where the
number of mourners swelled with Wednesday's announcement that his
body had been found, in the wreckage of his Piper Saratoga, off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard. And like so many others streaming down
the cobblestone street, bearing bouquets and memorial candles,
Owens had a story to tell of a small kindness from a man who wore
his celebrity lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, making a delivery to Kennedy's office building a few
years back, spied him in the corridor. ``I froze,'' he said. ``Then
I started shaking like this.'' He extended a trembling hand. ``He
asked me why I was so nervous and I said, `You're a part of
American history.' He told me he was just like anybody else and
offered me an autograph if I held the elevator. I just had to be
here today, even though I doubt he'd like all this fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss has been building since last weekend's news that
Kennedy's plane was lost en route to a family wedding, with his
wife and sister-in-law on board. Within hours, in what has become a
ritual after high-profile tragedies, people set up a makeshift
memorial, in this instance turning the sidewalk outside Kennedy's
penthouse loft into a shrine: A mountain of roses and sunflowers,
votive and yahrzeit candles, flags and balloons, Shakespeare
sonnets and T.S. Eliot poems, rosary beads and baseball caps,
photos of a small boy saluting his father's coffin and a handsome
man gliding through Central Park on Rollerblades.
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime Wednesday, the men, women and children who came to
pay their respects formed a line that snaked around the block, each
with an offering to leave on the growing pile. Three vanloads of
flowers were carted off at mid-afternoon, destined for pediatric
wards at city hospitals at the behest of the Kennedy family, but
they were quickly replaced by fresh bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners spanned the generations. Some, who were old enough
to remember the 1963 assassination of a dashing young president,
Kennedy's father, felt the heft of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they interrupted the news to say the president had been
assassinated, I heard people screaming in the street,'' said Arelis
Shabbir, 42, who works the night shift in a group home in Brooklyn
and, sleepless, brought her daughter to the TriBeCa shrine first
thing Wednesday morning. ``Old people, young people, children were
crying. My mother cried for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger generations _ 30-somethings like Kennedy and those
born later _ were drawn less by history than celebrity, but
celebrity of a particularly graceful, I'm just-a-regular-guy kind.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Owens, had had memorable encounters with Kennedy.
Robert Santiago, a 32-year-old Long Island man named for Robert F.
Kennedy, recalled the younger Kennedy waving to him as they passed
each other on mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Wolinsky, a 64-year-old sidewalk book vendor who once
lived next door to Kennedy on the Upper West Side, said the young
man donated two cartons of books he had weeded from his personal
library, including one about the Rockefellers and several volumes
by Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offerings at the TriBeCa shrine were notes from people
who knew Kennedy from the neighborhood dog run, who had chatted
with him at coffee shops and newsstands or parked his car in the
local garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to be as normal as he could,'' said Dawn Slade, a
38-year-old from New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, stationed outside the building for days to keep
clear passage for the other tenants, were forced by the growing
crowds to establish rules. Earlier in the week, mourners stood as
long as they wished before the shrine. But with the news that
Kennedy's body had been found, the narrow street was quickly
clogged, the satellite trucks multiplied and some in the
neighborhood complained of the disruption.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, police officials said, there was the danger of a
fire from scores of candles in close proximity to dying flowers and
cards and letters. Those circumstances prompted the decision by the
Kennedy family to begin carting away flowers and by the Police
Department to force visitors to circle the shrine in single file.
</P>
<P>
   Still the mood remained that of an ad hoc church service,
contemplative and courteous. Strangers of many races and
nationalities conversed in sadness. Children too small to
understand watched from strollers or their fathers' shoulders.
Police officers, even as they barked ``move along,'' took time to
read the posters taped to the building facade and sniffed back
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the messages were wrapped in plastic to guard them from
the elements. Others, with ink running, seemed to weep from the
recent rain. The sentiments ranged widely. ``May God embrace you in
his loving arms.'' ``John, you are now together with your mother
and father.'' ``I still find this unbelievable.'' ``Too soon.''
``We'll dearly miss the Camelot we never knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayers, like the memorial candles, crossed religious
boundaries. One came from the Book of John: ``For God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten Son.'' Another was
traditionally Jewish. ``In the rising of the sun and in its going
down we remember them. ... As long as we live they too shall live
for now they are a part of us as we remember them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were in Spanish: ``La comunidad Hispanica nunca los
olvidara,'' meaning, ``The Hispanic community will never forget
you.'' The messages came from Laguna Beach, Calif., Kansas City,
Puerto Rico, Japan. Some were addressed to Kennedy's sister,
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, now the only living member of her
immediate family. ``The nation cries for you,'' it said. And one
was addressed to President Kennedy. ``You would have been so proud
of him,'' it said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The idea, back in 1983, was to replace the Huey
helicopter, the workhorse of the Vietnam War, with a fast, cheap,
light craft called the Comanche.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years and $4 billion later, the Comanche has not taken
off as planned. It will be the most expensive helicopter in history
_ if it flies. The ``light'' copter has been hung with so many
technological bells and whistles that it may be too heavy to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   It will take seven years before a single one rolls off the
assembly line. Until recently, the Army said it needed $4.4 billion
to get to that point. It now concedes that it will need hundreds of
millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that, the Army wants almost $30 billion to build
about 1,300 Comanches. Nine years from now, if full-scale
production is under way, the Comanche will consume two-thirds of
the Army's budget for aircraft, the Army concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, the Pentagon is planning to spend
something approaching half a trillion dollars on new aircraft. It
is spending twice as much money to buy half as many aircraft as it
used to. The Comanche explains why. The tale of how it became a $37
billion behemoth is all too familiar within the Pentagon, according
to military officers, defense analysts and Pentagon records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing isn't even designed yet,'' said Robert McDaniel, a
private military analyst who has followed the Comanche program for
a decade. ``No one really knows what it'll cost.''
</P>
<P>
   A real need arose for a new helicopter to transport troops 20
years ago. Then, in the 1980s, a money-is-no-object military
mentality created visions of a stealthy copter that could knock out
Soviet tanks invading Germany in the first battles of World War
III, Pentagon records show.
</P>
<P>
   That mission led to the Comanche's new design. The mission no
longer exists, as the Pentagon's inspector general points out.
Nonetheless, a helicopter first conceived as the military
equivalent of a Toyota pickup has become, on paper, a monster truck
bristling with guns and gadgets, crammed with the most complicated
computer codes the Army has ever tried to write.
</P>
<P>
   For years, government analysts warned that the project was in
trouble. But the Army pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   It cut the number of test helicopters it would build from six to
two, and cut its planned tests of those craft by 60 percent. But
the first prototype has been plagued by frozen computer displays, a
faulty clutch and a badly designed main rotor. Many of the copter's
crucial systems remain untested.
</P>
<P>
   The Comanche, as designed, weighs 8,822 pounds _ 110 pounds
below the maximum empty weight with which it can fly. It may need a
more powerful engine to deal with that weight. But a more powerful
engine may need external fuel tanks, which would scuttle the
plane's stealth characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's inspector general says the overall cost of
designing, building, flying and maintaining the helicopter has
increased more than 60 percent, exceeding $100 billion. The number
of Comanches the Army says it can afford has fallen nearly 40
percent, to 1,292. The helicopter still faces ``significant risks
of cost overruns, schedule delays and reduced performance,'' the
General Accounting Office says in a forthcoming report.
</P>
<P>
   The Army sought and received $427 million for the Comanche in
this year's military spending bill, now before the House. The
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's defense spending
panel, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said the committee ``has not
done the homework that I intend to do'' on the Comanche. ``We're
not addressing the Comanche this go-round,'' he said.

 &HT;    Presidential candidates head to Cincinnati for fund-raisers
 &HT;    By By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose presidential
campaign coffers already are bulging, is expected to take in $1
million more during his campaign's first Ohio stop today in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, is scheduled to visit a Coalition for A Drug-Free
Greater Cincinnati parent training session this afternoon and then
attend a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser at the Omni Netherland Hotel
in downtown Cincinnati. The Bush campaign already has raised more
than $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit is the first of three major political fund-raisers
in Ohio scheduled during the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, President Clinton is scheduled to follow Bush to the
Queen City for a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at the
home of attorney and prominent party fund-raiser Stanley Chesley.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, July 29, Vice President Al Gore, running for the
Democratic nomination against Sen. Bill Bradley (R-N.J.), is
scheduled to be in Cleveland for a fund-raiser at the home of
industrialist Michael Siegal. Gore hopes to raise about $200,000,
said former Ohio Democratic Chairman James Ruvolo, who's working
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit follows a host of endorsements the Texas governor
received this week from Ohio Republicans after U.S. Rep. John
Kasich (R-Westerville) folded up his presidential exploratory
committee and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft, who had been neutral, has endorsed Bush and was
named his Ohio chairman. Taft is not expected to attend today's
events because of a previous commitment to visit his daughter in
Colorado, said Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. David Hobson (R-Springfield) and John Boehner (R-West
Chester) are among the Ohio Republicans who switched their
allegiance from Kasich to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush now holds a lead over his Republican rivals as well
as Gore and Bradley in public opinion polls, it's far too early to
take anything for granted, even Bush supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a key state,'' said Ohio Treasurer Joseph
Deters. ``It's one that George Bush can't lose.''

 &HT;    Ohio Democrats spring idea of talk show host's Senate candidacy
 &HT;    By William R. Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Television show host Jerry Springer has
attracted millions of viewers with trash-talking, chair-throwing,
hair-pulling episodes ranging from ``I Married a Horse'' to ``My
Wife is Sleeping With My Aunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hamilton County Democratic Chairman Tim Burke, a longtime
friend, is trying to attract Springer to next year's U.S. Senate
race as the Democratic opponent for Republican incumbent Mike
DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wonderful,'' Burke said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before his talk show career took off, Springer served as a
Cincinnati mayor and city councilman and ran unsuccessfully for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1982. His possible return to
Ohio politics has met, to put it mildly, with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairman David Leland conceded that he's
bounced the idea off a few people. Then he quickly switched topics
to DeWine's alleged deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have bounced between outrage and chortling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pray that Jerry Springer never gets the chance to do to
the state of Ohio what he's done to daytime television,'' said
state Republican Chairman Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly assembled a ``Top Ten Prospects'' for Ohio
Democrats that included Howard Stern, Dennis Rodman, Kermit the
Frog and Tonya Harding, with Springer in the No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
   From a more distant perch, author and University of Virginia
political scientist Larry Sabato was beside himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disgrace, maybe one of the all-time low points of our
celebrity culture,'' Sabato said. ``It's an indication of how
desperate the Democratic party of Ohio is. This is one of their
modern low points. I'm sure they'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer's fame shouldn't be confused with his fitness as a
candidate, said Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be famous, but so are a number of mass murderers. I
really don't think they could get elected either,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Springer himself has not been heard from directly. A spokeswoman
for his Chicago-based show had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats may be desperate, a controversial candidacy
like Springer's might have a silver lining, said two analysts who
have worked with the Kettering Foundation to measure just how
unhappy many Americans are with politics and elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot _ at least in his first presidential campaign _
successfully tapped into that disaffection, and so did former
wrestler Jesse Ventura when he was elected governor of Minnesota as
a third-party candidate, said Richard Harwood, president of the
Harwood Institute in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Ventura and Ross Perot have been able to do is
create a sense of authenticity about themselves _ that they talk
straight, they use language people understand. In many ways, they
don't overblow expectations,'' said Harwood.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, 55, a native of London, England, might do the same
thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who might be attracted to him, I suspect it's
because he seems to be speaking with conviction. He's totally
unafraid of saying anything. All filters have been removed. He
speaks in everyday language,'' said Harwood.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura appealed to younger, less-educated and low-income
citizens who had been disaffected nonvoters, said John Doble,
president of Doble Research Associates in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Springer might do the same thing, said Doble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough about Springer and how popular he is,''
said Doble. ``The potential is there for this kind of maverick to
come from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said Springer would come to the race with some negatives.
But he also has very high name recognition, the ability to raise
money and the ability to generate excitement.
</P>
<P>
   He's also overcome political adversity. After admitting that he
paid a prostitute with a personal check, he resigned from
Cincinnati City Council in 1974, then won back his council seat in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he was one of the best campaigners. He could
walk into a crowd and deliver a message to that crowd that they
didn't want to hear. They'd come away loving Jerry,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he last talked with Springer about a week ago and
Springer had made no decision.
</P>
<P>
   Springer would be joining a nearly empty field of Democratic
candidates. The only activity right now is from Richard Cordray, a
former Columbus-area state representative and last year's
unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Ohio attorney general, who
has formed an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman hasn't
talked with Burke or Springer, but said Democrats have an
``obligation to explore all possible options,'' including Springer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an entertainer. I don't personally care for his show.
There are a lot of people in this country who do . . . You, at
least, have to take a look at it. That is not a commitment from me
that it's a good idea,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Springer might have another problem besides his controversial
show. He has a home in Florida and an apartment in Chicago, but no
longer resides in Ohio, said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio residency is not a requirement for a Senate candidate, but
it already has prompted Republicans to link Springer to first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who's running for a U.S. Senate seat out of
New York, where she's never lived.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since two Seattle teen-agers started a telephone
message service in 1907 that grew to become United Parcel Service
of America Inc., the company has been a rarity in corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by its employees and managers, it is a company where many
people spend their entire working lives. The company's top 15
executives all began their careers sorting packages. And even
odder, for 92 years UPS has resisted the persistent entreaties of
investment bankers and remained private.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, in the latest sign that the siren song of Wall
Street is too hard to resist in the age of instant riches and the
Internet, UPS announced plans to sell 10 percent of itself to the
public later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering will likely be one of the biggest in history,
raising between $3 billion and $5 billion. And in today's
overheated stock market, UPS analysts believe UPS shares will soar,
creating a windfall for tens of thousands of its managers,
employees and retirees. That means that the local UPS delivery man
in his chocolate brown uniform and matching truck _ already
considered a '90s sex symbol by many _ could also become rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years that's the thing everybody has been hoping for,''
said Jason Vines, a driver who was picking up packages Wednesday in
Manhattan and received the news from the company via its cellular
network. ``Now its going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, UPS' chairman and chief executive, said that the
company, which estimates that it carries 6 percent of the nation's
gross domestic product, had taken care to structure the deal so
that it would preserve the company's unique culture. Even though 10
percent of the company will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, 99 percent of the voting rights will remain with the
current employees and managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In designing our plan,'' he said, ``we've insured that this
fundamental element of our success will continue as an essential
part of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   But once its stock begins trading, UPS will come under the kinds
of pressure for short-term profits felt by other large
corporations. Whereas in the past it could invest in new technology
or expansion in Europe without worrying about the effect on its
stock price, that luxury might now be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an internally fed culture with an unusual sense of
purpose,'' said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the nonprofit
Chief Executive Leadership Institute in Atlanta, who worked as a
consultant to UPS for 12 years. ``There is a hometown flavor to
them. It is very meritocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula has been a success. UPS earned a profit of $1.7
billion last year on sales of $24.8 billion, making it larger and
more profitable than its rival, Federal Express. Its 330,000
employees delivered more than 3 billion packages to 1.6 million
customers in more than 200 countries. UPS trucks ply routes in
virtually every corner of the world, making it one of the most
recognizable brands.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that UPS needed to issue stock to the public in order
to maintain its competitiveness against rivals like FDX Corp.,
which owns Federal Express; DHL, and a number of increasingly
aggressive foreign postal services that are also planning to issue
stock soon.
</P>
<P>
   As the package delivery service has become global in recent
years, UPS has expanded into Europe, Asia and Latin America. It
also has moved aggressively into the fast-growing logistics
business, taking charge of the delivery of all parts and components
for large manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Though UPS has more than $3 billion in cash and can borrow
billions more, it does not have publicly traded stock to use as a
currency to buy other companies. ``We think we need this
flexibility to provide ourselves with another tool should we decide
to do the kind of strategic acquisitions we are talking about,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts also said that it was getting harder and harder for
UPS to continue to turn its back on the soaring values investors
are giving an Internet-related company. Last year, FDX shares
soared after investors identified it as a so-called Internet play.
</P>
<P>
   Always proud, UPS executives think they have an even better
story to tell. They point to a recent report by Zona Research of
San Francisco that concluded that UPS delivers 55 percent of all
the goods purchased on the Internet. While $80 billion worth of
merchandise was bought online last year, the figure is estimated to
balloon to $3.2 trillion by 2003, according to Forrester Research
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of talk should play well to investors when UPS shares
begin trading later this year. ``Their timing is excellent,'' said
Edward Wolfe, an air freight and logistics analyst at Deutsche Banc
Alex.Brown in New York. ``It is going to be perceived very well.''

MORE OPTIONS FOR CYCLISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1997, Dr. Irwin Goldstein of the Boston
University School of Medicine began what many in the cycling
industry believed to be a war on the bike.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Goldstein advocated a ban on conventional
two-wheelers because his studies were showing the bicycle _ and,
more specifically, the bicycle saddle _ was causing damage to
erectile and urinary function in males, and to a lesser degree in
females. The cause was due in large part to the inherent design of
the seat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his findings was data that indicated damage was being
caused by pressure to the perineal area, a sensitive part of the
anatomy that has important nerves and blood vessels running through
it. Goldstein's research also showed that pain, numbness and even
impotence was being experienced by recreational riders more than
with veteran cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Goldstein's findings accused the doctor of starting a
tempest in a teapot, calling his conclusions baseless and his
research flawed. Countless others contended it was not the saddle
at all but the way in which cyclists sit that causes problems.
</P>
<P>
   While far from finished, the debate has served to promote new
saddle designs, to stimulate interest in nontraditional cycles that
alleviate much of the stress and to increase awareness of proper
positioning while biking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different types of saddles out there. I
think the biggest reason for the problems associated with riding a
bicycle is a combination of improper saddle choice for the
individual and improper position on that saddle,'' said Ernest
Ferrel, a chiropractor in Santa Barbara who has coached and trained
Olympic-level cyclists and specializes in marrying the proper
bicycle design to the rider. ``It would be like running in size 10
shoes when you wear size 11, then blaming the shoes for hurting
your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have capitalized on the need _ perceived or otherwise _
for better saddle designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole issue has been brought to our awareness
through scare tactics and has been blown well out of proportion,''
said Ashton Johnson of Sundance Cycles in Agoura, who has been
using specialized bicycle fitting systems for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I think the debate has done two really good things:
First, it has made people aware of the fact that position on the
bike and saddle adjustment is critical, and, second, it has caused
manufacturers to take a hard look at saddle design, and they have
come up with some pretty innovative stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   What manufacturers have produced is a variety of ways to isolate
the perineal area so that it has little or no contact with the
seat. Experts point out that this forces the cyclist to ride with
his or her ischial protuberances _ the ``sit points'' _ on the
rearward portion of the saddle, something they should be doing
anyway ... and which can be accomplished without any special saddle
designs. This position supports the body by its skeletal structure
and naturally relieves pressure on the nerve bundle in the area in
question.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just how one sits on the saddle that will correct
problems but the placement of the entire body on bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, especially recreational riders, don't take into
account the complete body position,'' said Ferrel, a former road
racer and cycling enthusiast for more than 30 years. ``If you're
leaning too far forward because the handlebar stem is too low and
long, you're still going to be putting pressure on your privates
and causing pain or numbness. Putting the blame solely on the
saddle is erroneous and narrow-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although proper position is critical, Ferrel points out that
cyclists of all abilities should also take into account there are
anatomical differences in each rider, and what works for one might
not work for another. He also urges riders to have a certain level
of core fitness, especially the muscles that support the upper
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people overlook the fact that your upper body is
supported by your stomach muscles,'' he explained. ``So a regimen
of crunch sit-ups is essential if you want to maximize your cycling
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Ferrel said, ``Proper riding position also requires
you to have a slight bend in the elbows and relaxed shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're an experienced rider or looking to purchase a new
bicycle, it is important to spend some quality time with a
professional who can help determine the correct riding position for
each particular cyclist. Try to make certain the bike-shop
personnel is experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can buy a Fit Kit (a product that helps to properly
position riders) and suddenly start doing fittings, but that
doesn't mean they can do the job right,'' Johnson said. ``I can buy
surgical tools, but would you want me to do open-heart surgery on
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Many bike shops in the Los Angeles area offer custom fittings,
with prices ranging from $20 to $40. Some also offer a
saddle-exchange program that allows patrons to use their saddles
for up to two weeks before deciding if it is the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   There is another alternative that solves the problem of the
conventional bicycle saddle. It's the recumbent bicycle, which
places the rider in a reclined position, taking pressure off the
sit points and perineum while also relieving neck shoulder, and arm
strain. While yet to gain widespread acceptance, many feel the
recumbent is the ultimate recreational bicycle. &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD-CODE (Los Angeles) _ A broad coalition of prominent
Americans, including two former presidents and retired generals, is
launching an initiative today to urge parents to pressure Hollywood
to adopt a voluntary code of conduct when it comes to entertainment
aimed at children. The initiative urges parents to call, write and
send e-mail messages to entertainment industry executives. The
initiative seeks to reduce what its backers call the ``increasingly

U.N. SAYS IT'S NATO THAT LAGS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Stung by U.S. charges that the United Nations
is moving too slowly in creating a police force and civil
administration in Kosovo, a senior U.N. official suggested
Wednesday that it was NATO members who were at fault for not fully
deploying all their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary General John Ruggie, the senior ranking
American adviser to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said the United
Nations was moving ``according to plan'' in Kosovo. Indeed, he
added, people and resources were being sent to the region at an
``unprecedented'' pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never planned that the United Nations would be fully
operational within six weeks of the Security Council's adopting a
resolution,'' Ruggie said. ``That would have been humanly
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the resolution that ended the conflict and
made Kosovo a de facto U.N. protectorate for a time.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry
Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, complained that
because the United Nations was slow in deploying people and
resources to the Balkans, NATO forces had to perform tasks that the
United Nations should be carrying out.
</P>
<P>
   First, Ruggie said, it is not the job of the projected
3,110-member international police force, as Cohen suggested, to
insure a secure environment for the returning refugees, public
safety and civilians' freedom to move. Under the resolution
approved by the Security Council, Ruggie said, the NATO security
forces are supposed to do that. Only after a secure environment has
been established, he added, is the United Nations international
police force supposed to begin insuring law and order.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the NATO members have still not deployed all the
soldiers that they pledged, Ruggie said. The NATO force stands at
34,000 troops, he added, 16,000 soldiers short of the commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Although the force has restored a secure environment, he said,
the United Nations relief workers and police are supposed to be
``up and running.'' So far, he said, 156 police officers from 13
countries, including at least one from the United States, have been
sent to Kosovo. But those officers were from the police force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggie said that starting next week the United Nations would be
able to receive and train 100 international police officers every
five days, a figure that will increase to 200 every five days in a
month. He said he expected the full U.N. police contingent to be in
place throughout Kosovo by November or December, if present plans
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.N. officials complained that the United States, which
has promised to send 450 police officers, has given the United
Nations in the last two weeks the names of 100 candidates, 22 of
whom do not meet the organization's requirements. There are no
Americans among the 100 Bangladeshi and Nepalese officers scheduled
to be sent to Kosovo next week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington did send us another batch of 200 candidates, but
only today, the day after the Pentagon blasted us on Capitol
Hill,'' said a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official denied that Washington was dragging its feet in
recommending candidates. ``We have 100 people ready to go,'' the
official said, contesting the United Nations ban on recruits who
are retired or less than three years from retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggie said those who complained about the slow pace of
deployments were missing the point. ``If 35,000 heavily armed
soldiers cannot restore peace and security in Kosovo,'' he said,
``what will even a fully staffed 3,110-member lightly armed police
force be able to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's criticism seemed to take U.N. and even some
State Department officials by surprise. A spokesman for the
National Security Council staff, P.J. Crowley, seemed eager to
soften Cohen's criticism. ``We were just trying to make the
point,'' Crowley said, ``that we don't want to see the same vacuum
and gaps between the military and civilian authorities that
occurred in Bosnia repeat themselves in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley also suggested that the administration had been
curtailed by Congress. Only Wednesday, he said, a senior Republican
senator lifted a $17 million hold on the administration's $25
million request to reprogram money to pay for its international
police force and the other officials whom it is lending to the
United Nations for the Kosovo mission.

FOX EXPERIMENTS WITH RAW LANGUAGE, SPREAD-OUT DEBUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If Fox has a reputation, it's as the network
that's willing to break new ground. Thanks to enormous fan
response, shows like ``The Simpsons,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Ally
McBeal'' have spawned imitations across all networks.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Fox will introduce ``Action,'' a spoof of the film
industry starring Jay Mohr (``Jerry Maguire'') as a ruthless,
heartless, soulless studio mogul and Illeana Douglas (``To Die
For'') as an actress-turned-streetwalker who provides some
perspective on who the real prostitutes are in Hollywood.
Originally designed for HBO by Chris Thompson (``Laverne &AMP;
Shirley,'' ``Bosom Buddies,'' ``The Larry Sanders Show''), the
half-hour comedy is raw, irreverent and liberally seasoned with
salty language that gets bleeped to comply with the Fox network's
standards and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Fox hasn't asked him to clean up the blue
language, which is obvious despite the bleeps. He said using
euphemisms would completely undermine the point of satirizing a
``profane world where there's not a lot of exemplary behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Herzog, president of entertainment for Fox Broadcasting
Co., said ``Action'' will not be a ``bleep-out fest,'' but he
offered no apologies for what some critics view as a further
coarsening of prime-time fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pushed the envelope in terms of the formats, in the ways
we're going to tell stories,'' Herzog said. ``That's what the
audience expects from us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the different things about ``Action'' is that it's a
comedy without a laugh track. Another new Fox comedy, ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' is also trackless.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who joined Fox six months ago after more than a decade
at MTV and then four years as head of Comedy Central, said many
viewers, particularly younger ones raised on MTV and Comedy
Central, find laugh tracks annoyingly artificial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of taking risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's plan for launching new shows is unorthodox, in keeping
with its goal of spreading premieres across the calendar,
independent of the traditional fall glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' will be one of the first out of the blocks this year,
premiering Sept. 16. But ``Manchester Prep,'' a sort of ``Dynasty''
for teens, won't debut until late November or early December, and
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a comedy about a reluctant genius, might
as well be a midseason show, with its launch penciled in for
January at the conclusion of the National Football League's regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy has to do with marketing. By spacing out
the premieres, Fox can spend more time hyping one or two shows at a
given time, rather than having to spread its resources across seven
or eight shows and thus achieving very little bang for its
promotional buck.
</P>
<P>
   But another reason, Herzog said, is that the fall launch is an
``antiquated'' concept. ``It's time to shake things up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to being aimed at a lucrative syndication market
that likes half-hour comedies but loathes hourlong dramas,
``Ally,'' the half-hour version of ``Ally McBeal'' being assembled
by producer David E. Kelley, is trying to target viewers who may
not be fans of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog calls it a ``forward-thinking idea with very little
downside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty easy show to cancel,'' he joked. ``Nobody goes
home crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' will air Tuesday nights at 8, beginning Sept. 28. The
original, hourlong ``Ally McBeal'' will continue on Mondays at 9,
premiering Oct. 25.

KENNEDY MEMORIAL MASS TO BE HELD IN NEW YORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A private memorial Mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, will be held Friday morning at
a small Roman Catholic church in New York where his mother
worshiped, the family announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family was exploring burial at sea, possibly even before the
memorial service, family and military sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold the service at the Church of St. Thomas
More, which seats only 350 people, was an apparent victory for the
privacy-minded Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, JFK Jr.'s sister, over
more political members of the Kennedy clan who favored a bigger,
more dramatic farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 100 percent private,'' a family spokesman said.
Emphasizing the invitation-only nature of the service and lack of
accommodation planned for the hundreds of news media
representatives who will converge on the Upper East Side
neighborhood, the spokesman said: ``No transcript. No audio. No
video.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Wednesday night, television vans crowded Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring on the vultures,'' said a young resident of an apartment
building across from the church.
</P>
<P>
   And along the 7-foot iron fence outside the church, neighbors
were leaving bouquets of flowers as memorials to the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're smart to get it over with fast,'' one neighbor told a
police officer keeping watch outside the fence.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the family described the service as ``a Mass to
celebrate the lives'' of JFK Jr. and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will
attend, the White House said. The first lady is expected next year
to seek the U.S. Senate seat from New York held by Robert F.
Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s uncle, from 1965 until he was assassinated in
1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The service for JFK Jr., editor of the hip but money-losing
political magazine George, is certain to contrast with earlier
family funerals, including his uncle Robert's, that drew more than
2,000 people to St. Patrick's Cathedral, the home church of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Robert Kennedy's rites, in
addition to the traditional funeral Mass, was a political and
cultural extravaganza that included the New York Philharmonic
playing Mahler.
</P>
<P>
   The small stone Church of St. Thomas More, on East 89th Street
between Madison and Park avenues, was near the Fifth Avenue
apartment of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and she sometimes attended
Mass there. The church, however, was not the site of her funeral in
1994. It was held at the larger, nearby Church of St. Ignatius
Loyola on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   She was then buried beside her first husband, President Kennedy,
at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, across the Potomac
River from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the memorial Mass did not specify details of
burial for JFK Jr. and his wife. A family spokesman said, ``there's
no determination yet,'' but added that further plans may be
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the family decides on burial at sea, Navy Lt. Steve Mavica
said Wednesday night at the Pentagon, ``We stand ready to render
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavica said Navy participation would have to be authorized by
the chief of naval operations, apparently based on a finding of
``notable service or outstanding contribution'' to the nation by
JFK Jr. He might also be eligible for Navy-assisted committal at
sea as a dependent of a former member of the uniformed service.
President Kennedy was a Navy officer during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board announced Wednesday
that the bodies of the Kennedy couple and her sister, Lauren
Bessette, were found in 100 feet of water off Martha's Vineyard,
Mass. The single-engine plane JFK Jr. was piloting crashed Friday
night in the Atlantic Ocean as it approached the exclusive resort
island. The Kennedys were to drop Lauren Bessette off on the island
and then continue on to Hyannis Port, Mass., for a Kennedy family
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette
announced Wednesday that it would hold a private, nondenominational
candlelight memorial service for the two sisters Saturday evening
at Christ (Episcopal) Church in their childhood home of Greenwich,
Conn., a wealthy New York suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hugh Tudor-Foley, assistant minister at the church,
told Reuters news agency that the Bessette family ``has been very
clear that this will be a dignified service, a quiet service, and
it will reflect the lives of these two young women.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Kennedy Bessette, 33, was a fashion consultant. Her
sister, Lauren, 34, was an investment banker. Among the survivors
are Lauren's twin sister, Lisa Ann. The Bessette women's parents
were divorced about 25 years ago, and the three sisters were raised
by their mother and her new husband, Richard Freeman, an orthopedic
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Freeman family expressed thanks for ``the
tremendous support'' it had received during the tragedy, including
from the ``many individuals and governmental agencies that assisted
in the exhaustive search for our family members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   After federal officials announced the sighting of JFK Jr.'s
body, his sister emerged from seclusion at her country home near
Bridgehampton, on New York's Long Island, for a bicycle ride with
her husband. She had returned to the house with her three children
from a vacation in Idaho as soon as her brother's disappearance was
announced last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of St. Thomas More emerged Tuesday as a possible
venue for the memorial Mass, but the pastor, John Boehning, had
emphasized it was only one of several options the family was
exploring. Church sources indicated it was the smallest of the
prospective venues.
</P>
<P>
   The 125-year-old religious edifice first housed an Episcopal
congregation, a St. Thomas More spokesman said. In 1950, the Roman
Catholic church acquired the building. Four years later, it was the
site of the quiet wedding ceremony of Patricia Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s
aunt, and the British-born actor Peter Lawford. The couple divorced
in 1966.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders made a frantic effort
Wednesday night to salvage their cherished tax-cutting bill,
offering to rewrite a key component of the legislation to quell a
revolt by party moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The vote scheduled for Thursday on the $792 billion tax-cutting
package was delayed late into the night as Speaker Dennis Hastert
and other senior Republicans pressured, cajoled and finally
negotiated with a dozen or so moderates who said the tax cut was
too big and left too little money for debt reduction and domestic
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of as few as five of the moderates could leave the
Republicans short of the votes needed to pass the bill, given their
thin majority in the House and the nearly united opposition of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Wednesday evening in a conference room just off the
House floor, the two sides put together a compromise plan under
which the central element of the House tax-cutting package _ a 10
percent reduction in personal income tax rates _ would be made
partly contingent on the government's making progress in reducing
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides said they had yet to reach a final agreement, and
Republicans said it remained unclear whether the leadership had
enough votes to assure passage of the revised plan.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut under consideration would be the largest since 1981.
Many Republicans have been calling for another big tax cut for
years, and their demands have become more assertive as the
government has moved from deficit to surplus. With nearly $1
trillion in projected surpluses up for grabs in the next decade,
Republican leaders say allocating nearly all of it to a tax cut
will help limit the growth in federal spending and provide a potent
campaign issue in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But just passing the bill in the House became a high-stakes
drama Wednesday. On the line was not merely the fate of the bill,
but also the ability of Hastert and his lieutenants to hold
together their razor-thin and fractious majority.
</P>
<P>
   The gridlock in the House came as a $778 billion tax cut package
with different features from the House version was approved
Wednesday by the Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Two centrist Democrats, John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska, joined all 11 Republicans in voting in favor of the
bill, which would provide somewhat more tax relief to the middle
class than the House bill. The other seven Democrats on the
committee voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, President Clinton repeated his threat
Wednesday to veto either the House or the Senate version, saying
they would endanger the nation's long-term prosperity by risking a
return of federal budget deficits, failing to leave enough money
for reduction of the $3.6 trillion national debt and requiring deep
cuts in education, health and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must decide whether to invest the surplus to strengthen
America over the long term or to squander it for the short term,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president indirectly encouraged the Republican moderates in
the House, saying he would work with both parties to find a
compromise that provides for a smaller tax cut once Congress and
the administration settle on a plan to shore up the two entitlement
programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare. Both
programs will face increasing financial pressure as the baby-boom
generation ages and retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work with any member of either party willing to put
first things first,'' Clinton told a news conference at the White
House Wednesday. ``We can have a tax cut and do the right thing for
the long term in America.''

   SEATTLE _ Where is Nostradamus when we need him?
</P>
<P>
   Every age, it seems, has its oracles and soothsayers, and you'd
think we'd be crawling with them as the millennium draws near.
</P>
<P>
   But author Kathleen Krull says the closest thing to a modern-day
prophet is Microsoft's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't put Bill Gates in the same book with Jeane Dixon,''
concedes Krull, whose new children's book profiles a dozen of
history's most influential prognosticators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are people who are ahead of their time, and he's a
good example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Krull highlights an eclectic group in her new book, ``They Saw
the Future: Oracles, Psychics, Scientists, Great Thinkers and
Pretty Good Guessers'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $19.99, 108 pages).
</P>
<P>
   It's aimed at kids 10 to 14 but many adults will want to sneak a
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People throughout history have wanted to predict the future,''
said Krull, 46, a raven-haired writer with a soft, motherly face.
``It's something we're all curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego writer, who was in Seattle for book signings,
profiled scientists and ``armchair dreamers'' like Leonardo da
Vinci and H.G. Wells, plus mystics and seers whose predictions defy
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who were more right than wrong,'' Krull said.
``All were open-minded without being gullible. That's what I try to
be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the mystical is a departure for Krull. She's best
known for the light-hearted biographical series that began with the
``Lives of the Musicians'' and went on to include writers, artists,
athletes and presidents. (Up next: profiles of women rulers through
the ages.)
</P>
<P>
   Krull highlights the all-too-human foibles of the history's
leading lights, tailoring her writing to the big-headed portraits
painted by her friend Kathryn Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``They Saw the Future,'' Krull reins in the humor and plays
it straight. Profiles include historical and cultural details that
explain each prophet's influence on the times. Likewise, Kyrsten
Brooker's stylized portraits are more in a more dignified vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense this is a sort of history of the world,'' Krull
said, ``because you have to explain the context of their
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Krull says rulers through the ages have heeded soothsayers, from
the Oracle at Delphi in ancient Greece to contemporary psychic
Jeane Dixon, who reportedly advised presidents, congressmen and
NASA scientists even though ``her overall batting average was not
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prophets were outsiders with acute powers of observation.
Some, like the Oracle at Delphi, probably exploited gossip and
inside information from visiting supplicants.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't always right, but there are plenty of bull's-eyes
that Krull can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   We can only wonder how Hildegard of Bingen, a German nun of the
Middle Ages, came to write about the circulatory system 300 years
before it was ``discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how the 16th-century French physician Nostradamus foresaw
(depending on whose interpretation you believe) the 1969 moon
landing and the death of England's Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Krull thinks Leonardo was the most versatile, creative genius of
the bunch but she says Edgar Cayce (pronounced KAY-see) was the
most mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever explained how Edgar Cayce did what he did,''
Krull said.
</P>
<P>
   Cayce, a Kentuckian with an eighth-grade education, would go
into a trance each afternoon and answer questions posed in letters
from everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   He would speak foreign languages he'd never learned, diagnose
medical conditions for people he'd never met and display
encyclopedic knowledge far beyond his own experience or education.
</P>
<P>
   After The New York Times publicized his feats in 1910, a panel
of experts tested Cayce by shoving a pin through his cheek and
peeling back the nail of his little finger while he was in a
trance. Krull says Cayce showed no pain until he woke up, when he
began to bleed heavily. His finger throbbed for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some fakes in the field, Krull thinks certain people do
have extra intuition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she got the idea for ``They Saw the Future'' after her
acupuncturist introduced her to some psychic friends. Without
naming specifics, Krull says they ``just told me things about
myself and my past that they couldn't possibly have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Her admission may raise a few eyebrows, but Krull doesn't
foresee any serious fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the head of a government, so I don't think people have
to worry too much about me,'' she said with a chuckle. ``I'm just a
children's book writer.''

PBS DONOR LIST PURCHASES COULD BRING BAN, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When New Hampshire Public Television purchased
lists of donors to the Democrats and Republicans three years ago,
officials there assumed it was a sound business practice. After
all, they told themselves, the station was hunting for new sources
of revenue and wasn't swapping its own donor lists in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But as the controversy over public broadcasting continued to
unfold Wednesday, the actions of WENH-TV in Manchester were called
into question, and House members reviewing public broadcasting's
fund-raising efforts widened their scope to include stations that
have had any contact with political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of public stations nationwide are believed to have
purchased lists from Democratic and Republican organizations, and
several station officials Wednesday said such purchases are both
legal and a vital part of raising funds. Yet in the wake of
disclosures that some stations have also sold their donors' names
to political groups, the actions of WENH are now being scrutinized,
and the entire practice may soon be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether it's a one-way street or a two-way
street,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative W.J.
``Billy'' Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican and chairman of the
House subcommittee that oversees public broadcasting. ``They're all
going to lead to a dead-end.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadened investigation would likely include more New
England public television stations than officials previously
thought were involved. In addition to the New Hampshire television
station, which bought lists from Republican groups and the
Democratic Party in 1996, Connecticut Public Television &AMP; Radio
said Wednesday it had ``rented'' more than 17,000 names from
Republican and Democratic groups, as well as the Democratic Party _
effectively paying for a one-time usage of the names on the lists.
</P>
<P>
   The flap began when members of a House Commerce subcommittee
were informed that WGBH-TV, Boston's public station, had swapped
donor lists with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The process of authorizing federal funding for public
broadcasting susbsequently ground to a halt, as it was revealed
that public stations in other cities had also exchanged lists with
the DNC and Republican groups _ a practice that could violate
federal regulations governing tax-exempt groups if it is found the
stations made their resources available to one political party and
not another.
</P>
<P>
   Stations that have a ban on selling their donor lists _ but do
buy donor lists from political organizations _ initially believed
they would escape the scrutiny of the subcommittee, which has
requested an independent investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Reed, president and chief executive officer of KCBT-TV in
Kansas City, said, ``There's a huge distinction for us'' when it
comes to buying other organizations' lists as opposed to selling
their own. Although KCBT does not share the names of its own
donors, it has in recent years bought lists from outside groups,
including the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
and the presidential campaign of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to buy lists,'' Reed said Wednesday. ``They are names
for prospecting. They have nothing to do with our donor base. It's
just another list...I fail to see anything wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Public broadcasting officials are careful to draw a distinction
between the two practices. Doug Weiss, vice president of television
operations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said it is
common practice for non-profit groups to buy lists wherever they
can, in an attempt to find potential donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear whether you can restrict a public TV station
from doing something any other non-profit is permitted to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be no question in the minds of several House
members. A spokesman for Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, said that when
new rules are put into effect, ``it will say you shall not interact
with political parties, whether it's in the form of buying names or
swapping names.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least one Republican was more severe. If station
officials argue it was proper to obtain political lists, the
spokesman for Tauzin said, ``it's going to fall on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit trying to make excuses for what you did, and clean up
your act,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WGBH since Monday has been broadcasting a statement
from its president, Henry Becton, saying the station is ``deeply
sorry'' for the list-swapping practice. Becton also says he has
brought in an independent auditor to review donor-list practices
and has tightened the station's internal rules.

ATTORNEYS DECRY EFFECT OF MICROSOFT TEMP RULINGS ON CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuit by temporary employees against Microsoft has been
celebrated as a victory for equality _ that one group of workers
should get the same benefits as others. It is indeed that. But it
comes at some cost to the commercial rights of contracts and of
legal clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The clarity is in the dissents. ``This is a simple contracts
case,'' wrote Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the second of three 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals rulings on Vizcaino vs. Microsoft. The
temps had signed a contract, he wrote, and it should be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Judge Stephen Trott saw it in the first ruling, in
1996: ``The plaintiffs were university-educated. One had a law
degree. They knew what they were getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   That a court would tear up their contracts and award them
benefits never offered ``is so radical,'' he wrote, that it
violates the Constitution, which forbids a state from impairing the
obligation of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that view lost. It has not been a simple contracts case.
One writer has compared it to Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, the case in
Charles Dickens' ``Bleak House'' that went on and on until all the
assets were exhausted. (Except that this is Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   What the plaintiffs asked for, and got, was that the employment
contracts be declared illegal. Their Seattle attorney, Stephen
Strong, argues that the ``permatemps'' are not real temps because
they are hired by Microsoft and then assigned to an agency and
because they stay so long. The whole arrangement, he says, is a
``paycheck laundering scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is that they're Microsoft employees,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The third ruling, in May, was a bit different. The court said
the temps are ``common-law employees'' of Microsoft and the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else has come to this conclusion,'' says Fredric
Singerman, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who has filed a pro-Microsoft
brief for nine trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   Common law does have cases of someone being ``a servant of two
masters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hire a trucking company to move some goods, and the
driver is under your direction, and he hits a car, there can be
dual employment status,'' Singerman says. ``But there is zero
precedent for imposing dual-employment status for employee-benefit
purposes, and it doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule had been, if you were hired by Volt _ a staffing agency
_ and ``leased'' to Microsoft, you worked for Volt. Microsoft paid
Volt and Volt paid you. Your paycheck and benefits came from Volt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court says, you work for both. You get the benefits
offered by Volt, and you can demand at least one benefit, the
employee stock purchase plan, offered by Microsoft to employees who
don't work for Volt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of double-dipping,'' Singerman says. ``I'm a
technical benefits lawyer. This is appalling. There is no way to
deal with it. You almost have to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   This case deals with the stock-purchase plan, which offers
Microsoft stock to employees at a 15 percent discount. The temp
agencies don't offer that. But the two-bosses principle could be
applied to benefits both sides do offer. Could a temp have 401(k)
plans from Volt and Microsoft for the same job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's at all clear,'' Singerman says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's 401(k) plan is an issue in the cases. It hasn't been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, dual employers are not going to offer two full
platters of benefits for a worker doing one job. If the law
requires them to do that in circumstance X, they will avoid
circumstance X. They will change the benefits offered, the contract
duration or the means of payment. Or something. But how to do it is
not clear in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot discern the law,'' says New Rochelle, N.Y., tax
attorney Alvin Lurie, a former assistant commissioner for the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   He and other critics of the rulings would like ``check the box''
legislation to determine whether a temp is an employee of the temp
agency or the client. ``Let the parties come to an agreement,''
Lurie says.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, the temps' attorney, isn't so sure. They don't have the
bargaining power of Microsoft, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hevener, attorney for the American Payroll Association, a
Washington, D.C., trade group that represents employers, says a
system might allow employees to choose. It wouldn't matter so much
what box was checked, she says, ``as long as everybody knows what
they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Check-the-box would put the issue back in the world of
contracts: clear and practical. Not necessarily equal.

HOUSE SPEAKER GUIDES TAX-CUT THROUGH GOP MAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a desperate struggle to rein in a group of
Republican renegades, House GOP leaders labored Wednesday night to
salvage one of their prized initiatives: the largest tax cut in
nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, in an effort to fend off a crucial
challenge to his leadership, worked nearly around the clock to
cajole GOP members into closing ranks around a plan to cut federal
taxes by $792 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   After delaying action for several hours Wednesday on the massive
package - a hallmark of the Republican agenda for the 106th
Congress - Hastert appeared to achieve a breakthrough by offering a
final concession to GOP dissenters who were concerned about the
exorbitant size of the tax breaks. The deal involves including
language in the bill that would scale back the tax cuts if the
nation's $5.5 trillion debt began to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert then called for a vote on whether to open debate on the
politically explosive measure, just hours after President Clinton
vowed in a news conference to veto the House bill. The measure is
similar to a $792 billion tax-cut package that was approved
Wednesday by the GOP-controlled Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that the massive tax breaks could jeopardize the
nation's prosperity. He called for using a projected $3 trillion
federal surplus over the next decade to shore up Social Security
and Medicare and provide a smaller tax cut, in the range of $250
billion. ``I will not allow a risky plan to become law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to approve rules to debate the tax cut, which
would be the largest since a $749 billion break in 1981, President
Reagan's first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders expressed hope they had secured the votes they
would need to pass the legislation late Wednesday night or early
this morning. But with the outcome uncertain, Hastert continued to
wage a frenzied, last-minute lobbying effort with his top
vote-counter, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who is known as
The Hammer for his prowess in whipping Republican members into
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, signalled the urgency of
the GOP dilemma by joining Hastert and his lieutenants in
pressuring the dissenting House Republicans to back the giant
tax-cut package. ``What we ought to be doing here is trying to find
a way to return as much of the surplus as possible to the people,''
Lott said after one session.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil, the House majority leader, Richard K. Armey,
relied on his Texas vernacular to project confidence about the GOP
scramble to amass the necessary votes. ``You always know how many
horses are in the herd,'' Armey said. ``It's just a question of how
long it takes you to get them all in the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Hastert, there was chaos on the range, as he pursued as
many as 20 breakaway GOP members. House Democrats were nearly
unified in opposition to the Republican plan, although they were
slightly divided over their alternative plan for $250 billion in
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm adamantly against both plans,'' said Representative Gene
Taylor of Mississippi, one of the most conservative House
Democrats. ``We don't have $250 billion to give away, never mind
$792 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief supporters of the Democratic plan said it was aimed at
providing limited tax relief to middle- and lower-income families,
in contrast to the Republican plan, which they described as a boon
to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current House leadership seems ready to abdicate its duty
to future generations to make a political point,'' said
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the highest ranking
Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. ``We cannot enact the
Republican tax cut with its massive windfall for the rich and
fulfill the goals of saving Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a slender majority of 222-211 over Democrats in
the House. There is one independent who generally votes Democratic,
and one vacancy created by the recent death of a Democrat, George
E. Brown Jr. of California. Barring absences, 218 votes are needed
for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, every income-tax rate would be
reduced by 10 percent over a decade. Capital-gains taxes would
decline for individuals and businesses. Estate and gift taxes would
be gradually abolished.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the GOP measure would ease the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' by raising the standard deduction for couples who jointly
file their income taxes. The plan also calls for expanding tax
credits for education, health and retirement purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But as many as 15 moderate Republicans and five conservative GOP
members raised a variety of objections about the GOP plan. Most
sided with Democrats who have called the size of the tax cuts
recklessly massive and a threat to the nation's robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that we will get ourselves back into the
deficit situation we have just gotten ourselves out of,'' said
Representative John Edward Porter, an Illinois Republican. ``My
constituents are saying very, very strongly that we need to take
care of Social Security, Medicare, and the national debt. There is
no groundswell for tax cuts that I can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP moderates voiced concerns about Republican plans to
reduce domestic spending while approving large tax breaks.
Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert of New York, a leading
Republican advocate for environmental protection programs, said,
``Things will only get worse before they get better,'' if the $792
billion tax cut takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans complained that the measure did not address
paying down the $5.5 trillion national debt. ``It has never been a
priority for our party,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, an
Illinois Republican. ``It's something we need to pay attention to,
but our leaders aren't concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   After Republican leaders refused to permit a vote on a $514
billion tax-cut package offered by a moderate GOP group led by
Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, the moderates said
they had not expected their plan to prevail because of their
minority status.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, they wanted to force concessions from the
leadership. ``We don't expect outright victories,'' Castle said.
``Our goal is to affect the process, to achieve a better outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also heard from conservative members who said the
measure did not fully abolish the ``marriage penalty.'' The issue
has prompted a flood of correspondence to the House leader from
Christian activists.

KODAK PLANS MORE JOB CUTS BUT POSTS PROFIT FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)  (af) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday that it would close some
manufacturing operations, cutting as many as 2,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally applauded the move, which will entail a $300
million charge in the third quarter to account for the closings.
But the mood was somber in Rochester, New York, where Kodak is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak is in the process of eliminating 7,500 jobs there _ 1,200
more than it had said it would cut as part of a corporate-wide
downsizing program it announced in 1997. At least 1,300 of the new
cuts will also be in the Rochester area, where Kodak is phasing out
a huge plant in nearby Elmgrove and closing a film-coating
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But, while some community leaders reacted angrily when Kodak
executives met with them at 7 a.m. Wednesday, others took the news
philosophically, if sadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some of my colleagues ask, `When will this tide be
stemmed?' and sure, I could have the traditional response of, `How
can they do this,' '' said William A. Johnson Jr., the mayor of
Rochester. ``But Kodak is one of our largest taxpayers, and there's
got to be some short-term pain to get it back to a pre-eminent
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak is making some progress toward that goal. The company,
benefiting from a robust domestic market for film as well as
recovering markets in Asia, also reported Wednesday that it earned
$491 million in the second quarter, or $1.52 a diluted share, on
sales of $3.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding an extraordinary gain that pumped up earnings in the
second quarter of 1998, Kodak's earnings were up 9 percent, or 14
cents a share, over the year-earlier period, while sales were up 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so happy with the top line but we're very happy with
the earnings,'' said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst at First Albany
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, was
even more succinct: ``They came in on expectations, and for Kodak
that in itself is news.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there were some surprises. Kodak said it would
eliminate just 17,700 of the 19,900 jobs it had promised to cut by
year-end. Jesse J. Greene Jr., who became acting chief financial
officer when Harry Kavetas died suddenly in May, said the reduction
came from decisions to retain some operations, like film packaging,
that Kodak had planned to farm out.
</P>
<P>
   But, he acknowledged that unexpectedly high severance packages
had wiped out reserves for the downsizing program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kodak cut operating costs by $135 million in the quarter,
keeping on track toward the goal of squeezing $1.2 billion out of
costs by the end of the year. The new job cuts are in addition to
that figure, ``and Kodak is poised to cut purchasing and services
costs, too,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also held losses in its portfolio of digital products to
$28 million, well below its $46 million first-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers did not play to universal applause. Several analysts
noted that Kodak faces heavy pricing pressure in film, huge
investment costs in China, a negative impact from currency
translations and persistently sluggish top-line growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the earnings is not good,'' said B. Alexander
Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities, who also expressed
concern that some 5 cents a share of year-to-date earnings have
come from items like real estate divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts were more forgiving. ``The cost cuts are
visible intellectual pegs on which to hang higher earnings
forecasts for the year 2000,'' said Michael Ellman, an analyst with
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted indifferently to Kodak's announcements. Shares
of Kodak declined 25 cents, to $73.

FOX EXPERIMENTS WITH RAW LANGUAGE, SPREAD-OUT DEBUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If Fox has a reputation, it's as the network
that's willing to break new ground. Thanks to enormous fan
response, shows like ``The Simpsons,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Ally
McBeal'' have spawned imitations across all networks.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Fox will introduce ``Action,'' a spoof of the film
industry starring Jay Mohr (``Jerry Maguire'') as a ruthless,
heartless, soulless studio mogul and Illeana Douglas (``To Die
For'') as an actress-turned-streetwalker who provides some
perspective on who the real prostitutes are in Hollywood.
Originally designed for HBO by Chris Thompson (``Laverne &AMP;
Shirley,'' ``Bosom Buddies,'' ``The Larry Sanders Show''), the
half-hour comedy is raw, irreverent and liberally seasoned with
salty language that gets bleeped to comply with the Fox network's
standards and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Fox hasn't asked him to clean up the blue
language, which is obvious despite the bleeps. He said using
euphemisms would completely undermine the point of satirizing a
``profane world where there's not a lot of exemplary behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Herzog, president of entertainment for Fox Broadcasting
Co., said ``Action'' will not be a ``bleep-out fest,'' but he
offered no apologies for what some critics view as a further
coarsening of prime-time fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pushed the envelope in terms of the formats, in the ways
we're going to tell stories,'' Herzog said. ``That's what the
audience expects from us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the different things about ``Action'' is that it's a
comedy without a laugh track. Another new Fox comedy, ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' is also trackless.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who joined Fox six months ago after more than a decade
at MTV and then four years as head of Comedy Central, said many
viewers, particularly younger ones raised on MTV and Comedy
Central, find laugh tracks annoyingly artificial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of taking risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's plan for launching new shows is unorthodox, in keeping
with its goal of spreading premieres across the calendar,
independent of the traditional fall glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' will be one of the first out of the blocks this year,
premiering Sept. 16. But ``Manchester Prep,'' a sort of ``Dynasty''
for teens, won't debut until late November or early December, and
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a comedy about a reluctant genius, might
as well be a midseason show, with its launch penciled in for
January at the conclusion of the National Football League's regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy has to do with marketing. By spacing out
the premieres, Fox can spend more time hyping one or two shows at a
given time, rather than having to spread its resources across seven
or eight shows and thus achieving very little bang for its
promotional buck.
</P>
<P>
   But another reason, Herzog said, is that the fall launch is an
``antiquated'' concept. ``It's time to shake things up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to being aimed at a lucrative syndication market
that likes half-hour comedies but loathes hourlong dramas,
``Ally,'' the half-hour version of ``Ally McBeal'' being assembled
by producer David E. Kelley, is trying to target viewers who may
not be fans of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog calls it a ``forward-thinking idea with very little
downside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty easy show to cancel,'' he joked. ``Nobody goes
home crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' will air Tuesday nights at 8, beginning Sept. 28. The
original, hourlong ``Ally McBeal'' will continue on Mondays at 9,
premiering Oct. 25.

   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ On the fifth day of a search that framed a
great national wake, a red sonar blotch led searchers to the bodies
of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his two passengers, entombed in the
shattered fuselage of his plane on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's remains were located before dawn by an underwater
camera checking objects detected by sonar. Several hours later,
Navy divers in heavy-duty gear adjusted the crumpled wreckage and
found the passengers on his flight through black haze last Friday
night _ his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law,
Lauren G. Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   The three bodies, found at 110 feet, about seven miles off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard, were raised at about 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, wearing shorts and
looking exhausted, boarded a Coast Guard helicopter at his compound
in nearby Hyannis Port and was taken to a Navy salvage ship, the
U.S.S. Grasp, to witness the recovery. He was accompanied by his
sons, Rep. Patrick Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy accompanied the bodies on Wednesday night to the
Coast Guard station in this fishing village at the toe of Cape Cod.
Because the deaths were accidental, the bodies were to be autopsied
before being turned over to the families.
</P>
<P>
   The water temperature, about 52 degrees, helped preserve the
bodies, an investigator said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, 38, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga
with his wife and sister-in-law aboard when it was lost in the
Atlantic Friday night. He had intended to drop Lauren Bessette off
at Martha's Vineyard, then fly on to Hyannis P ort for the Saturday
wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family members, anxious to avoid having a spectacle made
of John Kennedy's final resting place, are making preparations for
him to be buried at sea in a Navy ceremony, according to a family
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided after much internal debate to hold an
intimate memorial service, which will be closed to the press. The
service will be held at a Roman Catholic Church that Kennedy's late
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, attended, the Church of St.
Thomas More in Manhattan's. The stone church seats just 350.
</P>
<P>
   The service for Kennedy and his wife will be held Friday at 11
a.m. The White House said President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton will attend.
</P>
<P>
   A candelight memorial service for Lauren Bessette will be held
on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Christopher C. Murray, the Navy's superintendent of
diving, said in an interview that Kennedy's body was in the largest
of several pieces of wreckage found near each other. Murray said
the divers made the recover in difficult conditions; visibility was
less than eight feet, the current was strong and the ocean floor
was littered with rocks and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who descended in elevator cages, were attached to
the Grasp by oxygen and radio lines, and other divers stood by on
the ship in case one of those beneath got hurt or tangled in the
wreckage. Now that the bodies have been removed, divers will use
straps and cables to form slings around the pieces of plane before
hoisting them on the Grasp's boom, which can lift 40 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members
since the plane was reported missing, said on Wednesday he had
authorized a continuation of the unusually long search, which has
been criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national
lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained
in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few
more days,'' Clinton said Wednesday afternoon during a news
conference on other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the
right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the official announcement by the National
Transportation Safety Board, ``a large portion of the fuselage''
was discovered at about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's body was identified within three hours. Then in a
45-minute dive that began just before noon, Navy divers located the
other two bodies. On Wednesday afternoon, a second set of divers
recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The debris field, which investigators call the plane's ``splash
point,'' is just off Gay Head, the western tip of Martha's
Vineyard, and very near a private beach that was once owned by Mrs.
Onassis and now belongs to her last surviving child, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Kennedy's plane was plunging at 5,000
feet per minute just before radar contact was lost Friday night,
and pilots and aviation authorities said the description that has
been provided seems to indicate a ``graveyard spiral,'' a corkscrew
descent in which the pilot becomes disoriented and loses control.

</P>
<P>
   The death of Kennedy, who grew up before the nation from a rich
scion to a ruggedly glamorous entrepreneur, has provoked an
outpouring of mourning and nostalgia for America's best-known
political family. As crowds thronged the Kennedys' home in New York
and anyplace with a Kennedy connection, the John F. Kennedy Hyannis
Museum, operated by the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, added an
easel on Wednesday afternoon featuring a quote from President
Kennedy, who was assassinated when his son was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tied to the ocean,'' Kennedy said in 1962 at a dinner
celebrating America's Cup. ``When we go back to the sea, whether it
is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence we came.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy destroyer, the U.S.S. Briscoe, which had been training in
the area, moved toward Cape Cod on Wednesday in case the family
decides to hold the funeral ceremony at sea. A Navy official said
``commitment at sea,'' as the ceremony is known, is typically
performed for active or retired members of the service, and their
dependents. But Navy regulations allow for the service to be
performed for ``notable service or outstanding contributions to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Burial at sea is a ritual that extends back to the ancient
Greeks, who dropped a coin in the mouth of the deceased for the
toll at the River Styx. Paul L. Stillwell, the director of history
at the Naval Institute, a private educational organization, said
the service has become more rare now that bodies can be airlifted
off ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   For the ceremony, the body traditionally was sewn into sailcloth
and weighted by a cannonball. The service also can be performed
with a coffin. Either way, the body is put on a board and tipped
into the sea, to the accompaniment of three rifle volleys. With a
cremation, the ashes are allowed to blow off the stern of the ship,
Stillwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board. said its investigation
into the crash will continue for six to nine more months. James
Hall, the chairman, said the agency will make no other comment
until all memorial and funeral services are complete.

ABUSED NEW YORK CITY CHILDREN ARE STILL FALLING THROUGH THE
CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than three years after the beating death of
6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo shocked New York City into overhauling
its child welfare agency, a rising number of abused or neglected
children reported to the agency have died, and an advocacy group's
analysis of such cases finds a pattern of caseworker and agency
mistakes similar to those identified in her case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's count, 36 abused or neglected children
who had been identified in reports to the city's Administration for
Children's Services died last year, up from 30 children in 1997 and
24 in 1996. That is a 50 percent increase since Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani appointed Nicholas Scoppetta as the agency's commissioner
with the mandate of overhauling the system that protects children.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger analysis of 201 child fatalities in the city during
that period, issued Wednesday by Children's Rights, a national
advocacy organization, said the handling of such cases ``raises
extremely serious concerns about the current quality'' of the
city's child welfare practices.
</P>
<P>
   But while city and state officials have acknowledged that the
city's child welfare system is dysfunctional and unwieldy, they
have also described Scoppetta's measures to improve the agency _
including increasing caseworker training, lowering caseloads and
hiring new administrators _ as the most concerted effort in decades
to tackle an entrenched system. That view is shared by many
advocates for children.
</P>
<P>
   Even the system's fiercest critics say that no city can protect
all children from fatal abuse or neglect, and that such deaths, a
tiny fraction of neglect and abuse cases, have fluctuated without a
clear causal relationship to child welfare policies.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say that the administration's emphasis on removing
children from their homes to protect them _ ``when in doubt, take
them out,'' as caseworkers put it _ has gone too far already,
hurting children who with help would be safer with their own
parents than bouncing through foster care.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that by focusing on just a handful of cases,
the report released Wednesday fails to take into account
Scoppetta's efforts to improve the system, which government
officials and child advocates alike have long characterized as
intractable and resistant to reform. Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman
for the Administration for Children's Services, stressed that the
agency investigates 51,000 child abuse and neglect reports
annually, and that 400,000 of the city's 1.8 million children have
come in contact with the agency at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``One fatality is one too many,'' she said. ``As horrible as a
child fatality is, that is not the way you measure the reform of
the child welfare system.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the analysis issued Wednesday, lawyers at Children's
Rights, who settled a federal lawsuit earlier this year that had
sought a court takeover of the agency, drew discouraging
conclusions, less from the number of deaths than from case
histories that they called ``a meaningful window into the otherwise
secret world of the child welfare system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Rights report, called ``Why Children Continue to
Die,'' examined 201 state reports on fatalities among New York City
children in 1998 and 1997. The state Office of Children and Family
Services is legally charged with reviewing how the city handles
abuse and neglect cases that involve fatalities, as well as all
cases in which a child in foster care has died, regardless of the
cause. These state reviews have found fault with the city's
performance in a majority of cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one 1998 case, the city agency had dismissed as unfounded a
child abuse report on a 1-month-old girl whose mother was seen
swinging her upside down by one foot and slapping her. A second
warning came a month later when the mother told several people that
she had cut the baby with a razor and did not care about her
because she was the result of a rape. That report was also termed
unfounded, after an investigation that failed to look at a clinical
evaluation of the mother in which she had said she was depressed
and disliked the baby. A third report said the mother had been
drunk while caring for the child.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth report, the baby was dead. She had drowned on
Sept. 6, 1998, at the age of 6 months, when her mother left her
unattended in a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Rights report said the case was typical of others
in which caseworkers either failed to gather enough information to
make a good decision or viewed the information too narrowly,
apparently lacking the knowledge to understand the significance of
the facts before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the caseworker level, where life-and-death decisions are
made concerning real children, little if anything had changed,''
the report said.

REGULATORS SEIZE DOCUMENTS FROM COCA-COLA IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest twist in Coca-Cola Co.'s fortunes _ or misfortunes
_ in Europe, its offices in four European countries have been
raided by regulators who seized company documents that may lead to
an investigation of the company's competitive practices with big
customers like supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola confirmed Wednesday that officials
from the European Commission, which has tangled with Coke several
times in recent months, appeared without warning as the business
day was beginning Tuesday and asked for access to company files.
</P>
<P>
   The offices of Coke and its bottling companies were targeted in
Austria, Denmark and Germany. Coke's bottling office in London also
received a surprise visit from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their purpose was to review internal files with respect to
commercial practices with retailers and other customers,'' said the
spokesman, Rob Baskin. ``We're cooperating fully with them. We
believe we are within full compliance of all competition laws and
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into whether Coke abused its position as the
market leader in Italy has been going on for nearly a year. The
investigation began after a complaint from Pepsi, Coca-Cola's chief
rival.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes less than six weeks after the biggest recall of
Coke products in company history because of a contamination scare
in Belgium and France. The recall hurt Coke's image in Europe, one
of its most important markets.
</P>
<P>
   It also had a significant impact on Coca-Cola's bottler,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, costing the bottler $103 million, or most of
its earnings for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has faced other problems in Europe, notably regulatory
opposition to its plan to acquire most of the overseas rights to
Cadbury Schweppes brands like Dr. Pepper and Canada Dry. Coke
announced the $1.85 billion plan in December, but by May had scaled
it back to $1.1 billion, leaving out most of the countries in the
European Union after antitrust regulators said Coke would hold too
much market share if the acquisition were approved.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Cadbury deal nor the product recall seems to have
any connection to the European Commission action. Coke and its
bottlers have disagreed with the regulators over various company
strategies, including whether the company abuses its ``dominant
position'' in certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   The three bottlers examined in the raid Tuesday are Coca-Cola
Beverages, which is in the middle of merger talks with Hellenic
Bottling and in which Coke holds a 50.1 percent stake; Coca-Cola
Nordic Beverages, a joint venture with Carlsberg A/S in which Coke
has a 49 percent stake, and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke AG,
Coke's German bottler in which Coke holds a 40 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in New York seemed shocked by what they viewed as the
latest setback for the company, which has been suffering through
one of its worst years in recent memory, with economic distress
around the world cutting into volume and profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the EU is becoming a government unto itself,''
said Emanuel Goldman, a consumer-products analyst for Merrill
Lynch. ``It's gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley, noted:
``The very nature of a dawn raid is to give the E.C. unfettered
access to Coke's files.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola stock slipped 31.25 cents Wednesday, closing at
$62.625.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chief executive, is expected to
lead a meeting in New York Thursday with analysts and investors, at
which he has said he will discuss Coke's strategic outlook as well
as the recall in Europe last month.

OF COSTS AND KENNEDYS: WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THE SEARCH? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: this is the Big City column; with KENNEDY-RDP) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most Americans are probably glad that no expense was
spared to find the plane of John F. Kennedy Jr. But many of them
might also have a hard time justifying the government's
extraordinary efforts in this case, which officially was nothing
more than a relatively routine accident involving a private
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   One way to reconcile the public's conflicting sentiments would
be for someone other than taxpayers to pay for the salvage
operation. As it happens, there are some logical candidates in New
York that have both the money and the moral obligation, although it
would not be easy getting them to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The cost has been an awkward issue since the search effort began
over the weekend with egalitarian pronouncements. ``We treat all
searches the same _ there's no difference between a celebrity and a
noncelebrity,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Roark, the director of the Air
Force National Search and Rescue School.
</P>
<P>
   That became harder to believe as the White House got involved
and the operation expanded to include hundreds of people from the
Coast Guard, the Air Force, the Navy, the National Guard, the U.S.
Customs Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   They used a search jet, helicopters, two cargo planes, 15 small
planes and dozens of boats, including ones equipped with
side-scanning sonar. After two days, when there was no hope of
finding survivors, the search continued until the wreckage was
found.
</P>
<P>
   How does that compare with a noncelebrity search? Consider the
case of Lyle Davis, an investment manager in Boston, who was flying
his Cessna over Delaware Bay on April 4, 1998, when his engine
failed. He radioed for help and then disappeared into the water
near Cape May, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard began searching as soon as he disappeared
Saturday evening,'' recalled Reese Dill, a close friend of Davis'
who lives in Weston, Mass. ``There were a couple of boats, at least
one helicopter, a cargo plane and some planes.'' The search
continued for a day, until Sunday night, when it was called off
because there was no longer any hope of finding the pilot alive in
the frigid waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard told me there was nothing more they could
do,'' Dill said, ``because their mission was to find survivors, not
find wreckage. I told them we needed to keep looking to resolve
things. They said we'd have to do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pilot's family footing the $4,000-a-day bill, Dill
arranged for the search to continue by renting a boat and hiring an
oceanographer with a side-scanning sonar unit to hunt below the
surface. After two fruitless weeks, the search was given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have used the kind of help the government provided to
the Kennedys,'' Dill said. ``But I guess there are a fair amount of
planes lost, and the government can't afford to go all out for
every one. Obviously, they paid more attention to the high-profile
case.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Wednesday that the government's efforts
were justified because of the ``enormous losses'' sustained by the
Kennedy family. But such special treatment would never be accorded
to the many others whose relatives died in public service, such as
the children of soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be argued that the government has a special
obligation simply because Kennedy is so famous that the public
demands a resolution to the case. But a country founded on the
equality of all men can't very well set up a special classification
for celebrities. Aside from the legal and moral objections, there
is a practical problem: how could bureaucrats decide who is a
celebrity?
</P>
<P>
   That's a job best left to the professionals who made Kennedy
famous and are now covering every detail of his demise. The
nation's media executives know precisely who deserves special
treatment in death: whoever sells copies and increases ratings.
This week, once again, the press is demonstrating that Kennedy
sells.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the news media could reimburse the government for the
rescue-and-recovery bill. New York's publishers and broadcasters
can certainly afford to pay a portion of the profits they have made
off Kennedy this week, not to mention the last 38 years.
Considering everything they did to Kennedy during his life, paying
this bill is the least can do.

SPORTS COLUMN: BOGGS STAYS WELL AHEAD OF THE CURVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wade Boggs is still doing the superstition thing,
``driving everyone around me nuts.'' Wearing his favorite shirt
every day, leaving the park at the same time, retracing his steps
in and out. Eighteen years of unshakable habits, of applying these
principles to the religion of hitting, have brought him to the
threshold of a careerlong dream. Why stop now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on a continuous ride for 18 years,'' he said
Wednesday at Yankee Stadium, where he rode a police horse in
celebration of his one World Series title in 1996. ``I do something
very well, and that's hit line drives.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't what you brag about if you want to be a famous
ballplayer in this unrelenting era of dingers and taters, of
getting to ``Sportscenter'' by going yard. But even as baseball
often seems to play like some 24-hour Home Run Network, the forces
of nature are in the process of making a collaborative statement
about the slow death of subtlety and the danger of extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs and Tony Gwynn have somehow come knocking together on the
door of the 3,000-hit club, while charter members George Brett and
Robin Yount are polishing their shoes for Saturday's walk into that
other baseball fraternity up in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, it's about
time we all got a break from biceps baseball. In honor of Boggs and
Gwynn, Brett and Yount, Pedro Martinez's All-Star innings,
pitcher-friendly Safeco Field replacing that awful Kingdome, and,
of course, David Cone, I would like to declare this Anti-Slugger's
Month, and hope it will become an annual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I love to hit home runs,'' Boggs said before he began the
Yankees-Devil Rays game Wednesday night with 2,986 hits, all but
117 of them placed in one unoccupied space or another. ``That's the
greatest feeling in the world, to trot around the bases,'' he said.
``I was a home run hitter in high school, but then something
happened. The parks just got bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, at 6 feet 1 inch and what he admitted was a ``scrawny 170
pounds,'' Boggs was informed way back when in the Red Sox
organization that home run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles
hitters drive Volkswagens. And while he has had the last laugh on
that particular cliche born of truth from a financial epoch that is
long dead, Boggs also understands that he came up when athletes
weren't being overwhelmed with muscular messages that imply bigger
is more than better, it's darn near essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power game was big in the 1970s, but it's nowhere near
where it is now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is tape-measure home runs in baseball and tomahawk dunks in
basketball and 140-mile-an-hour serves in tennis. The technocrats
and proponents of body enhancement have all got with the cheap
marketing program. They are making team sports look more and more
like professional wrestling, increasingly superficial for the sake
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a pleasure to have the ``scrawny'' Boggs sit down
Wednesday afternoon to talk about his race to 3,000 with the chubby
Gwynn. To claim that, at 41, his brilliant compact swing had
experienced ``not a bit of mechanical failure'' and the most
serious physical battle he's waged over the last seven or eight
years has been the one with his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He read a magazine story recently where Gwynn had said he was
never adept at picking up the spin of the ball to determine what
pitch was coming, and that surprised Boggs because, as he said: ``I
have to see spin. That's how I hit, by recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   He had laser surgery a few months ago, and discarded his contact
lenses. ``The ball has a glow to it,'' he said, proud of the fact
that he was bearing down on 3,000 with a .303 batting average at
game time Wednesday night. Having hooked on last season with an
expansion team thrilled to sign one of Tampa's own, Boggs then read
that he would be the first player to get his 3,000th hit and his
walking papers on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone could plainly see, he proudly said, ``I'm not hanging
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs, with a career batting average of just under .330,
had seven consecutive 200-plus-hit seasons from 1983 to 1989. His
first hit was on April 26, 1982. He named the pitcher (Rich
Dotson), the park (Comiskey) and the count (1-2). His 1,000th hit
was off Scott Bankhead. His 2,000th was against Mark Langston. He
doesn't care whom his 3,000th will be off, and what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's an H up on the board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's been how the ``continuous ride'' has been for 18 years.
Why stop now? &QL;

MARKET PLACE: MERGER DEAL WITH PLENTY OF INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday's $2.1 billion agreement by Cincinnati Bell to acquire
IXC Communications clearly lacked the cachet of last weekend's
merger deal between U S West and Qwest Communications
International, but it said at least as much about the
communications industry's strategic direction _ and it involved
even more boardroom bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   IXC could have had Qwest's fabulous success as an upstart
long-distance communications carrier. Qwest now has a market value
of more than $22 billion. In 1996, IXC was first to offer shares to
the public on plans to build a nationwide fiber-optic
communications network, just like Qwest, which did not go public
until a year later.
</P>
<P>
   But while IXC created a great asset in a 13,000-mile network _
with plans to expand to 18,000 miles by next year _ the company
failed to develop the advanced communications services and internal
systems that would allow it to translate the asset into a generator
of sustainable profits. That led to missed targets and unhappy
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The buck stopped with Benjamin L. Scott, who was hired as the
company's chief executive in the fall of 1997 after years with AT&AMP;T
and the Primeco wireless venture. Scott later became the company's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   IXC's investors, led by Richard D. Irwin, president of Grumman
Hill Associates, an investment firm, decided they could place the
company in more capable hands by selling it. Scott was stripped of
the president and chief executive titles in May, and on Monday
Irwin replaced him as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben had impeccable credentials, and we hoped he would do
really smart things,'' Irwin said. ``And it turned out that for
whatever reason _ he certainly has the ability to manage a business
of this size _ he simply couldn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as IXC was trying to salvage itself, Cincinnati Bell was
trying to remake itself. Long a sleepy local phone company,
Cincinnati Bell hired Richard G. Ellenberger, a former MCI
executive, in 1997 to begin a campaign to participate in the
communications revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring IXC and its national network will help Cincinnati Bell
become a mid-sized player on the national communications scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to offer long-distance, local, data and the
full suite of telecommunications services,'' Ellenberger said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still one problem: the company's own shareholders.
As an old-line phone utility, Cincinnati Bell was expected to
provide a dividend and steady earnings growth to its value
investors. But it would be impossible to do so while also making
the big investments needed to expand into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   This is a common dilemma for local phone companies these days,
even (or especially) for giants like Bell Atlantic and SBC
Communications. Generally the companies try to finesse the issue,
doing what they can to invest for growth while also satisfying
their core investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not Cincinnati Bell. As the company announced the IXC deal
Wednesday, it had an additional message for its old-line investors:
take a hike. The company made no bones about the fact that the IXC
deal would basically destroy its earnings, at least for a few
years. From now on, we want to be valued on cash flow, or earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the company
said, adding that it would change its name after the deal closes.
To top it off, the company said that after next month it would no
longer pay a dividend.
</P>
<P>
   If this bet pays off, Ellenberger will secure his place among
the minor pantheon of telecommunications luminaries. But for now
the process is likely to be fairly painful.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Bell said Wednesday that it had accepted a $400
million investment from Robert M. Bass' investment company. In a
bid to soften the earnings blow for shareholders, the company said
it would use half of that money to buy back stock. Still, the
company's stock fell $3.75 a share Wednesday, to $19.8125.
</P>
<P>
   That added yet another factor to this complicated web of
strategic and financial equations. Because most of IXC's
shareholders are to receive 2.0976 shares of Cincinnati Bell stock
for each of their IXC shares, the value of the deal fell from
$49.43 a share to $41.56. (Cincinnati Bell will also assume IXC's
debt of $1.1 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Cincinnati Bell agreed to spend the other $200 million
from the Bass investment to pay the General Electric Pension
Trust, &UR;  &LR; which owns more than 20 percent of IXC, $50 a share for
about half of its shares, regardless of the performance of
Cincinnati Bell's stock. Because a vice president for GE
Investments sits on IXC's board, that structure could very well
disturb some of IXC's other investors.

FOR ZETA-JONES, SO FAR, SO GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(for use Friday, July 23 or later) &HT;    By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All is going according to plan for Catherine
Zeta-Jones. The remarkable thing is, everyone who comes to
Hollywood has the same sort of plan, but very few get it to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has turned around exactly the way I had wanted it
to,'' says the darkly exotic, 29-year-old Welsh actress, who gave
up an impressive stage and television career in Britain to start
from scratch in America several years ago. ``I mean, I could have
completely disappeared off the face of the earth, like many people
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I am satisfied that I came 6,000 miles to do something,
the most satisfaction comes from the American public and the people
who make decisions having accepted me as one of them. That may
sound ridiculous, but it was very important for me to break into
that mainstream and convince the public that I could play something
besides the next Spanish or Welsh role.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zeta-Jones' eye-popping work as a sword-swinging
aristocrat in ``The Mask of Zorro'' last summer could have been a
flash in the pan. But a successful co-starring stint opposite Sean
Connery in this spring's romantic thriller ``Entrapment'' widened
her public profile and professional appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's building on that platform with a juicy bit in the
big-budget horror movie ``The Haunting,'' as part of an ensemble
that also features Liam Neeson (``Schindler's List,'' ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''), Owen Wilson (``Armageddon,''
``Bottle Rocket'') and indie film queen Lili Taylor (``The
Imposters,'' ``I Shot Andy Warhol'').
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a horror film (the actress's first), it's also a
nice showcase for Zeta-Jones' naturally fun and warm qualities, as
well as her remarkable physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an emotional person, really big-hearted and generous,''
says ``Haunting'' co-producer Donna Arkoff Roth. ``Those qualities
are very easy to see in her. She's very open, and that makes people
like her, not feel like they'd be excluded by her. And you want to
know that's true about a woman who is so stunningly beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Shirley Jackson's popular novel ``The Haunting of Hill
House,'' the movie places three disturbed people in a haunted New
England mansion. They think they're there for a study on sleep
disorders, but their psychiatrist (Neeson) is secretly subjecting
them to fear response stimuli. Little does he know that the house
is possessed by stimuli he never dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones plays the sensuous, free-spirited New York designer
Theo. Like the character played by Claire Bloom in Robert Wise's
subtly spooky, 1963 film ``The Haunting,'' Theo is a bisexual, an
aspect of her personality director Jan De Bont initially tried to
play up, but, through last-minute reshoots and editing, dropped in
order to secure a family-friendly, PG-13 rating for the $70 million
fright fest.
</P>
<P>
   Much as she wants to be accepted by Middle America, Zeta-Jones
admits she would have preferred keeping the gay angle in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I didn't say I was disappointed because I
wanted to pursue that avenue as an actor,'' says Zeta-Jones, who
speaks with a likable candidness despite having suffered
microscopic coverage by the rabid British tabloid press and, more
recently, a small media frenzy when her relationship with actor
Michael Douglas was revealed. ``But for me to scream and shout
about it is unproductive. It's a different kind of movie, and that
bit was not pivotal to the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   What was essential was responding to elaborately scary special
effects that were added to the film in post-production, an
extended, painstaking process that many American actors are
familiar with but was a totally new experience for a stage-trained
performer such as Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different discipline of work, a different technique of
acting,'' she confirms. ``Jan presses a button and you react like
there's going to be something there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for me was retaining a thought for one scene
that could take you three weeks to shoot. Not back-to-back, but a
bit of it one day, a bit of it in two weeks' time, and then the
reverses with the technical stuff. To retain that thought and
maintain the level of whatever _ fear, anger _ that was something
that I learned from this. That was difficult but very good, and I
did learn a lot from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do another one tomorrow?'' she says of high-tech genre
films. ``I don't know, I might. There's so much technical stuff
that goes on in filmmaking, and, I think, for years I thought that
I wasn't going to succeed in this medium because I didn't get that
whole process: the different lenses, hitting your mark, the light.
The idea of furthering that just adds more to the whole technical
rat race.''
</P>
<P>
   The lavishly detailed sets art director Eugenio Zanetti
(``Restoration,'' ``What Dreams May Come'') created for the haunted
house interior were so massive that they made Zeta-Jones feel, not
like a rat in a race, but a tiny little mouse. Built in the old
Spruce Goose hangar in Long Beach and in Raleigh Studios' new
Manhattan Beach facility, the massive rooms featured not only
people-dwarfing furniture, mantelpieces and statuary, but
state-of-the-art hydraulic systems that brought entire ceilings and
spiked bed canopies to alarming life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first walked on the set down in Long Beach, I really
felt like a miniature, like a little ant,'' Zeta-Jones recalls.
``And I was awestruck when I walked into my bedroom at the
Manhattan Beach studios. After a while, I got really friendly with
Eugenio. And when I bought a house, Eugenio said, `Darling, don't
worry. I will help you decorate!'
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother visited the set, I told her Eugenio was going
to give me ideas. I could see her looking around and thinking,
`I'll never stay there alone!'''
</P>
<P>
   Her dad, too, was a little spooked by the set visit. The first
``Haunting'' had scared the wits out of him as a child. For the
most part, though, Zeta-Jones' non-show-biz parents _ who indulged
their daughter's dancing and acting dreams for years before she
left Swansea for London while still in her teens (and quickly
landed a starring role in a ``42nd Street'' revival) _ are digging
Catherine's international celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Cannes promoting `Entrapment,' and I was so tired
from hours and hours of back-to-back interviews,'' she explains.
``That night was `The Spy Who Shagged Me' party, and I think the
whole south of France was invited. I couldn't make it; I fell
asleep in my room at 7 o'clock, but my parents were partying till
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when did that transition happen? Aren't the parents
supposed to go to bed early while the kid stays out all night? My
mother was like _ with sunglasses on _ `Great party. You missed
it.' OK, Mum, I'll just do my work. So funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Zeta-Jones finally took a month of serious relaxation
time for herself this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first holiday in years and years and years that I
was able to turn off and relax like I've never done before,'' she
says. ``Because, I think, there was an inner sense of the
turnaround that I made actually working. I was able to completely
chill and say to people, `You won't be able to contact me for a
month.' Didn't pick up the phone, didn't even check my messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I lost loads of friends in the meantime,'' she says
with a hearty laugh. ``They think, `That bitch! She won't return my
calls since she got so successful!' The reality is, I didn't want
to speak to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everybody. Zeta-Jones spent much of her vacation with
Douglas in the Spanish Mediterranean, where enterprising paparazzi
photos made their low-key relationship public. Intrusive as that
was, she reports that the press coverage has been relatively mild
compared to the sensationalistic frenzy that helped drive her out
of Britain. A couple of semi-nude, long-lens pictures and questions
about their age difference (Douglas, who's been separated from his
wife for several years, turns 55 on Sept. 25 _ the same day
Zeta-Jones hits 30) are nothing compared to tab reporters rifling
her garbage and chasing her car at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is that we're great friends,'' she says.
``Regardless of any age difference _ and I've never, ever read
anywhere that you have to be a certain age to get along and have
fun with anybody else _ we're basically just having a great time.
We're born on the same day and it's kind of bizarre how similar our
heads are tuned in. We're having a great laugh together and,
finally, have been able to spend some real time with each other. So
far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in general, so far so good in the U.S. media, which seems
more interested in describing Zeta-Jones' beauty than prying into
her personal life. But the actress, once again displaying a kind of
everywoman likability, refuses to let that affect her, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's better than being told you look like the Hunchback
of Notre Dame,'' she cracks. ``I've been glorified before, then
nightmarishly slagged off. At this point in my life I realize, and
I accept, that whatever people write now ain't gonna be what they
write later. Maybe it will be, I dunno, but really _ and I'm not
saying this to fish for compliments _ I do not believe I'm that
aesthetically beautiful. Take every piece, and I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is full of beautiful women. But I know what I do
have is a talent, and I want to be here for the long run. I'm not
obsessed with myself, and I try not to rely on any kind of beauty.
That's why I try to put a certain oomph into my performances, some
fun and physicality. And right now; I'm not going to be cast as a
wallflower anytime soon, but I can do it and someday I'd like to
try.'' &QL;

GM ADMITS   BRAKE FLAWS   AFTER INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After a five-year federal investigation, General
Motors acknowledged Wednesday that the anti-lock brakes on 3.6
million sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and full-size vans
would be slow to stop the vehicles under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of those vehicles will be asked to take them to
dealerships for brake repairs during the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The action covers an unusually large number of vehicles because
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and GM
discovered two different problems affecting different vehicles. One
problem involves a switch on many four-wheel drive vehicles and the
other problem involves a computer program in many two-wheel drive
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency said that it had received 10,861 complaints
from the public about brake problems in the vehicles, involving
2,111 crashes and 293 injuries. The agency did not try to estimate
how many of the crashes were caused by the problems because it did
not look into the details of most of the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lange, GM's vehicle safety director, said that the
company had not linked any of the crashes or injuries to the
problems that the company had now agreed to fix. Many factors may
be involved in any crash, he cautioned, and there will inevitably
be many complaints and crashes when such a large number of vehicles
is involved. Still, the more than 10,000 complaints were among the
highest the federal agency has received for any brake issue.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers consistently deny that safety defects are related to
crashes; to do otherwise would increase their exposure to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Lange did acknowledge in a telephone conference call with
reporters Wednesday that the two problems would sometimes lengthen
stopping distances.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are designed to help drivers avoid skidding,
allowing motorists to continue steering as they slow down. When the
wheels start to skid during braking, the electronic anti-lock
devices automatically reduce the amount of braking pressure being
applied until the wheels begin rolling again. The devices then
continuously adjust the brakes so as to apply as much braking as
possible without allowing the wheels to lock and skid.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are supposed to allow a driver to steer around
an obstacle while braking. They also tend to reduce stopping
distances on wet pavement, although that is not their primary
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   For the more serious of the two anti-lock brake problems
addressed Wednesday, GM is recalling 1.1 million four-wheel drive
versions of the Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy sport utility
vehicles and Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma pickup trucks sold in
the 1991 through 1996 model years. A switch in those vehicles'
anti-lock brakes is prone to failure, Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   When these vehicles are using two-wheel-drive, the anti-lock
brake system does not apply the brakes hard enough if the switch
fails, Lange said. Stopping distances then lengthen by 10 percent
to 30 percent, he said. He did not characterize how often the
switches fail, but estimated that the majority of the switches in
the recalled vehicles functioned properly.
</P>
<P>
   GM is also issuing a ``service policy'' for 2.5 million
two-wheel-drive sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans. The
company fixes vehicles free under a recall or a service policy; a
service policy is a less drastic action, and is often used for
minor difficulties like paint flaws. Because a manufacturer does
not admit a safety defect in a service policy, such policies also
provide weaker evidence than a recall for people suing auto makers
after crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes in the 2.5 million vehicles have a computer
program that can cause the brakes to be applied too gently when the
vehicle runs over a certain combination of surfaces, Lange and
regulators said. The problem occurs some of the time when a vehicle
runs over a high-traction surface, like dry concrete, then over a
slippery surface and then back onto a high-traction surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the vehicle returns to the high-traction surface, it
sometimes continues to brake gently as though on a slippery
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.5 million two-wheel drive vehicles are: 1993 to 1996
Blazers and Jimmys, 1994 to 1996 S-10s and Sonomas along with 1992
to 1995 Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari full-size vans and 1993 to
1996 ``G'' vans, which are often used as small shuttle buses.
Federal regulators are continuing a separate investigation into
brake problems on Chevrolet and GMC Suburban sport utility vehicles
from the 1992 to 1994 model years, which were not covered by either
the recall or service policy.

ADVERTISING: NEW LOOKS FOR THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is that ancient wisdom about not judging a book
by its cover. But in the beverage industry, some companies seem
convinced that they can win consumers over to their products by
putting the usual brew in an unusual package.
</P>
<P>
   With substances like aluminum, glass and the clear plastic known
as polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, all in vogue, and the
opportunities those offer for industrial-strength decorative arts
like embossing and surface printing, companies like Triarc Beverage
Group, Heineken USA and Miller Brewing Co. are trying on some new
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how successful it's going to be, but there is a
trend toward making bottles more consumer friendly,'' said Murray
J. Lubliner, a packaging consultant in Manhattan who runs a design
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Textured glass, pinched-in plastic bottles that are easier to
grip and painted-on labels, particularly for wine, are among the
changes he has noticed recently. He also sees a propensity among
manufacturers to make bottle openings a lot wider _ possibly to
speed up consumption and lift that market share.
</P>
<P>
   Certain companies see changing the package as intrinsic to
increasing sales. Heineken USA, the United States branch of
Heineken NV, the Dutch brewer, introduced a keg-shaped can in May,
an innovation that is supposed to wow and woo drinkers in the 21-35
age group who might have thought that Heineken was an old-folks'
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Heineken recently lost its longtime No. 1 position among
imported beers in the United States. It was edged out by Corona in
volume, though it continues to dominate in dollar sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quickly becoming your father's Oldsmobile,'' said
Steve Davis, Heineken USA's vice president for marketing. The keg
can, however, is intended to evoke keg parties, beer on draft and
other associations that appeal to younger people. ``The keg can has
a connotation of image enhancement,'' he said. ``People see it, and
they say, `Wow, that is really cool.''' The keg can, produced in as
many as one million cases, has sold out, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cans themselves are a recent focus for Heineken. About 90
percent of the company's sales have been in glass bottles, to a
relatively elite clientele in bars and restaurants, but a shift to
cans is seen as crucial to expanding the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't just go forward with our bottles and say, `Here it
is _ take it or leave it,''' Davis said. Cans are being sold in
12-packs in supermarkets, priced slightly less than bottles, he
added, and Heineken hopes that people will drink them while
lounging in front of the television with their friends, like any
other beer in a can.
</P>
<P>
   Heineken packaged in a silver-and-green can and labeled for the
millennium is being sold in Europe and will be on sale by October
on cruise ships and in duty-free stores in United States airports.
Also in the pipeline is an Amstel Light can that is flared at the
ends and is already being distributed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Another beer maker, Miller Brewing Co., is committing itself to
selling beer in plastic bottles _ made of the same material used
for unbreakable bottles of soft drinks, juices and water. Since
November, Miller, which is a unit of the Philip Morris Companies,
has been putting its Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft and Icehouse
brands into bottles made from multiple layers of PET and polyester,
the latter intended to seal out oxygen, which can ruin the taste of
beer.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the polyester is tinted brown or amber to match
the color of glass beer bottles. The plastic bottles are on the
market in about nine metropolitan areas, mostly in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The people who want their beer in a plastic bottle are not, by
any means, the majority, said Scott Bussen, a Miller spokesman,
estimating that perhaps 1 percent of the company's sales will be in
plastic. But it does have its attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbreakable, and it can allow you to go anywhere, to
places that do not allow glass bottles,'' he said. In addition, the
bottles stay cold longer, he said, and can be resealed.
</P>
<P>
   For all those people who, teetering in the upper reaches of a
baseball stadium, have dropped or knocked over a top-heavy paper
cup of beer just before taking the first sip, ``it's a
no-brainer,'' he said. ``Instead of a vendor pouring a can of beer
into a paper cup, he can just hand you a plastic bottle of
Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   While expensive to make, the plastic bottle _ which a rival,
Anheuser-Busch, tested and then gave up on last year _ ``all in all
is a good package for us,'' Bussen said.
</P>
<P>
   On the soft-drink side, many smaller companies have come up with
the most prominent innovations. In April, the beverage arm of the
Triarc Companies came out with its Elements line, featuring drinks
like Fire, made from dragon fruit, ginseng and ginkgo biloba, in a
glass bottle with a label that changes as the contents decrease.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the bottle empties, it reveals more color in the label, and
that's an aspect consumers really love,'' said Ken Gilbert,
Triarc's senior vice president for marketing. People have been
writing in to describe other uses they have found for the bottles,
including filling them with colored sand or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to combine its best-selling contour glass bottle with the
resilience of aluminum, the Coca-Cola Co. came up with a can shaped
somewhat like the bottle two years ago. The effect was somewhat
shorter and squatter than what fans of the bottle appreciated, and
the can has disappeared from the marketplace, said Havis Dawson,
editor in chief of Beverage World, a trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like an old bottle with the bottom inch cut off of
it, and the top four inches cut off,'' he said. ``It was not a
shape that jumped up and screamed at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream soft-drink companies tend to invest minimally in such
packaging devices, Dawson added, because their prices tend to be
lower than beer prices and, as a result, the effort does not offer
that much return.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's meeting of the Society for Manufacturing
Engineers _ the group that thinks up new package designs _ the mood
was gloomy, Dawson said. ``Every bit of innovation they could bring
to the market,'' he said, ``didn't do much.'' &QL;

PROFIT UP 6 PERCENT AT TIMES MIRROR; 2 PERCENT RISE AT LOS ANGELES
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by a turnaround at The Los Angeles Times, where national
advertising volume increased by 33.5 percent, Times Mirror Co. said
Wednesday that its second-quarter profit rose 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Los Angeles, earned $74.7
million, compared with $70.5 million in the period a year earlier.
The extensive repurchase of shares by the company over the last
year, coupled with lower taxes, translated into a 28 percent
increase in earnings per diluted share, to 92 cents from 72 cents
in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $801.3
million from $755.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Times Mirror to earn 86 cents a share,
according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Times Mirror rose 25 cents, to $61.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times increased its quarterly operating profit
by at least 2 percent, Thomas Unterman, the chief financial
officer, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ad volume rose at each of the company's three largest papers.
Volume at The Times was up 8.4 percent, outpacing a 2.7 percent
gain at Newsday but trailing The Baltimore Sun's 30.5 percent gain.
Over all, the newspaper group reported a 6.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly some good things going on here,'' said
Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, citing ``the
continued strength of the East Coast newspapers and, more
importantly, the improving result at The Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``On the cost side, this company has been aggressively
managing its cost structure to drive margins higher. This is the
first quarter in five they reported profit growth out of The Los
Angeles Times. It wasn't outstanding growth, but it was growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``beyond the core newspaper business, the
results were sort of messy'' because of the number of one-time
charges. For instance, included in the reported earnings per share
was an after-tax profit of $4.3 million, or 5 cents a share, on
gains from the sale of shares in America Online. Excluded was an
after-tax gain of $10.7 million, or 13 cents a share, on the sale
of Hollywood Online.

ONLINE BEATS IN LINE _ ONLINE GROCERIES TAKE HASSLE OUT
OF  SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ It's the ultimate express lane.
<P>
   Online grocers say they can harness the Internet to take the
drudgery out of grocery shopping _ at prices comparable to those of
regular supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area is home to two Internet grocery-delivery services,
Peapod (www.peapod.com) and Webvan (www.webvan.com). Peapod is a
10-year-old veteran that has outlasted earlier rivals and says it
has worked out all the kinks of online shopping. Webvan is an
aggressive upstart that has been operating for just seven weeks but
is spending lavishly to build market share.
</P>
<P>
   Both offer about 20,000 food and drugstore items, and both have
lined up well-known Bay Area firms as suppliers. Peapod (no longer
affiliated with Safeway) uses Andronico's for meat and produce and
Walgreens for drugstore items. Webvan gets goods from GreenLeaf
Produce, Monterey Fish Market, Niman Ranch, Semifreddi's, Just
Desserts and Grace Baking. &UR;  &LR; They contract directly with wholesalers
for nonperishable items.
</P>
<P>
   I've been shopping on both for the past few weeks, and I'm sold.
I expected prices and selection in line with those of a 7-Eleven.
Instead, the Web grocers rival Safeway _ and I could shop much
faster online than in line.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two services, Webvan offers greater coverage of the Bay
Area, a more convenient delivery policy and, most importantly,
lower prices. However, it still has some growing pains: Some items
arrived in less-than-pristine condition, and some didn't arrive at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod is more expensive but more reliable. It also has some
better features, like list sorting, unit-price comparison and a
tastier array of prepared meals.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, Webvan was marginally cheaper than Safeway (by
53 cents) for a sample 37-item order. The total was $108.34 with
Webvan and $108.87 with Safeway. The same items were $120.62 at
Peapod _ 12 percent more than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod charges an additional $5 for delivery, which made it even
more expensive than Webvan or Safeway. Webvan imposes no delivery
fee on orders over $50, and charges $4.95 for smaller orders.
Safeway's ``do-it-yourself delivery'' is free.
</P>
<P>
   The services work in much the same way: You ``load'' items into
a virtual shopping cart on the Web site, then schedule a time to
have the groceries delivered to your door. You pay with a credit
card over the Web or, if you are worried about security, by phone.
Peapod also lets you pay the delivery person with a check.
</P>
<P>
   You can browse ``aisles'' organized in the usual fashion: dairy,
produce, meats, canned goods, frozen food. If you know what
category or specific product you want _ say, Vlasic dill pickles _
you can type it in a ``find'' window, which beats hunting down a
supermarket employee to help you find something on the shelves. The
sites show thumbnail-size pictures of food; you can click to read
the nutrition label.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod makes price comparisons easier, with a column showing the
price per unit (for example, a 26-ounce jar of spaghetti sauce
works out to 13 cents an ounce). Webvan leaves it up to you to do
the math.
</P>
<P>
   Both services let you create and save lists, so your future
shopping experiences can be extra quick. You can transfer the
contents of an entire list to your shopping cart with a single
click, or go through the list item by item.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's lists are more helpful than Webvan's. Peapod's handy
sorting feature lets you organize a list by category (dairy, meats,
breads, etc.), by price, alphabetically and even by fat or sugar
content.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan items are listed in the same helter-skelter order you put
them in. This is annoying if you want to make sure you haven't
forgotten the ketchup or check that everything on your list
arrived. And you do need to double-check. One of my orders was
missing an item, although it was included on the invoice. The
driver quickly subtracted the cost when I pointed out that the Ben
&AMP; Jerry's had not shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan advertises that its prices average 5 percent less than
typical supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   This was not true overall in my experience, but more than half
the items on my list were cheaper at Webvan _ sometimes by much
more than 5 percent _ than Safeway. Manischevitz Egg n' Onion
matzos cost just $1.85 from Webvan, versus $3.39 at both Peapod and
Safeway. Its Ziploc snack bags were 22 percent less than those at
Safeway and Peapod.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod aims to meet Safeway prices and in some cases it does.
Some items, such as Formula 409 and Wisk detergent on sale, were
cheaper from Peapod than Safeway and Webvan. But for many items,
Peapod's prices were a few cents higher than the others. And those
cents add up.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway trounced the online competitors in produce prices and
``store specials.'' At the height of white-corn season, Safeway is
selling five ears for a dollar. They're $1 each at Peapod and 50
cents each at Webvan. And of course, Safeway aisles are sprinkled
with numerous Club Card sale items.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod accepts coupons; you give them to your driver and they
are credited to your next order. Webvan does not accept coupons.
Both services let you return items by giving them to your driver
and credit you on your next order.
</P>
<P>
   Quality was not an issue for produce and meat, the two
categories where freshness counts most. Both Webvan and Peapod
delivered nectarines that turned perfectly ripe in one day; the
ones I selected at Safeway were more on the mushy side. Peapod
delivered a head of lettuce with a couple tablespoons of water in
the bag, but it was still crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan and Peapod use dry ice to keep food cold in transit, and
it usually works fine. Meat and fish were cold and freshly
packaged; produce was fresh. A carton of ice cream and Eskimo bars
from Peapod arrived rock solid. But Eskimo bars from Webvan had
partially melted, then refroze.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan had a couple other problems: A package of
chocolate-covered biscuits arrived with all the cookies inelegantly
melted together. A jar of peanut butter was oddly mealy in texture.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan has a better delivery policy. You only have to specify a
30-minute window when you will be home. (Utilities, plumbers,
furniture stores, take note!) Peapod requires a two-hour window.
Both consistently arrived within the specified time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were friendly, professional and willing to cart the
goods into the kitchen. Both deliver until 10 p.m., a boon for busy
working families. Peapod drops off groceries in the same plastic
bags used by most stores; Webvan delivers them in large bins and
charges a refundable $3 deposit per bin. In double-checking an
invoice, I found a glitch: Webvan charged me a deposit for one more
bin than I actually had received. Again, the driver was quick and
courteous in correcting the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Although Webvan advertises same-day delivery, it never offered
me a delivery time earlier than 24 hours from when I placed my
order. Both services sometimes did not have delivery times
available until 48 hours after ordering. Webvan currently does not
deliver on Sundays and Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites suffered from some vagaries of the Web: Peapod was
difficult to connect to on several occasions; Webvan's site said it
was temporarily experiencing system difficulties a couple of times.
But once online, both were fast and easy to use, even with a 56K
dial-up connection.
</P>
<P>
   Selection seemed broad. I was able to find the brands I was used
to, and plenty of speciality and gourmet items. However, both
sites, especially Webvan, sometimes did not carry the sizes I
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan also had more out-of-stock items, seemingly a result of
its newness. Some staples such as frozen peas, whole-grain waffles
and mineral water were listed as ``coming soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Peapod substituted jumbo eggs for large eggs at the same price
and delivered a smaller bag of chips than I had ordered, charging
the lower price. It did not tell me in advance about the
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond groceries, Peapod and Webvan offer prepared foods _
entrees, appetizers, salads, soups, side dishes. Peapod's
selections _ identical to those in the deli aisle at my local
Andronico's _ were delectable but pricey. For example, moussaka at
$7.99 for a half pound was well-seasoned, not greasy _ but just
enough for one person.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan said its meals are developed by a chef formerly with Chez
Panisse and Greens, but the array of ribs and pasta is more
reminiscent of Sizzler. Chicken noodle soup, at $3.50 for a pint,
was chock-full of vegetables but light on the chicken; a simple
basmati rice pilaf was perfectly prepared, albeit a tad expensive
at $4.99 for a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Although I live within blocks of a produce mart that carries
eight nationalities of eggplant, another market selling meat from
animals who eat better than I do, and some outstanding bakeries, I
have no desire to ever again personally lug home cat food, paper
towels, milk, cereal and other staples.
</P>
<P>
   I will still cruise the Berkeley, Calif., boutique grocers for
the visceral sensations of hefting a perfectly ripe melon and
smelling freshly baked bread _ not to mention the samples. While my
experiences online weren't perfect, neither is shopping at a
supermarket. For bread-and-butter items, including produce and
meat, I found the Web a fast, cheap and painless way to grocery
shop.

ARMSTRONG ENGULFED BY FEEDING FRENZY OVER USE OF SALVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAU, France _ Lance Armstrong continued to make news on two
fronts Wednesday: he protected his commanding lead in the Tour de
France with only four more race days to go and he found himself
ensnarled in still more charges and countercharges about drugs,
with cycling's governing body and Armstrong both stating that he
has been using a skin cream, with authorization, to treat saddle
sores.
</P>
<P>
   The cream contains corticosteriods, which are anti-inflammatory
and pain-killing drugs that are banned unless prescribed by doctors
for health reasons. Armstrong's use of the cream is apparently why
legal trace amounts of the substance had shown up in his urine
tests early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Countering accusations in a French newspaper that he has used an
illegal drug, Armstrong acknowledged Wednesday that he had treated
a rash with the cream, but that ``it has absolutely nothing to do
with performance'' and that ``this is not a doping story.''
</P>
<P>
   The governing body of the sport agreed, saying in a statement
that ``minimal traces'' of a cortisone substance that were found in
a test of the American ``did not constitute doping.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised news conference after Wednesday's stage, a bitter
Armstrong described himself as ``persecuted'' and a victim of
``vulture journalism.'' He singled out Le Monde, which has devoted
two long articles to Armstrong and drug tests he took in the race's
first two days, July 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the results, the newspaper said that they showed
``traces'' that ``do not show quantity but do show that he used a
banned medication.'' It identified the product as a glucocorticoid,
which it described as ``steroid hormones secreted naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did not identify the salve he used. ``They say stress
causes cancer,'' said Armstrong, who was diagnosed with testicular
cancer two and a half years ago and underwent three months of
chemotherapy. ``So if you want to avoid cancer, don't come to the
Tour de France and wear the yellow jersey'' of the overall leader.
``It's too much stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The rider, who, after another strong performance in the Pyrenees
Wednesday, seems certain to win the Tour de France when it finishes
Sunday in Paris, seemed strained and weary as he spoke. Part of
that was because of the long stage over four mountains that he had
completed, consolidating his lead, half an hour before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in taking something I didn't consider to be a
drug,'' he said, referring to what he called ``a topical cream''
for a skin rash. ``When I think of taking something, I think of
pills, inhalers, injections,'' he said. ``I didn't consider skin
cream `taking something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Defending him, the International Cycling Union said Wednesday
that he had used the salve Cemalyt ``to treat a skin allergy'' and
had presented a medical prescription to justify its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``After discussion with French authorities,'' the organization
said, ``we declare with the greatest firmness that this was a use
authorized by the rules and does not therefore constitute doping.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Armstrong was pressed by a reporter from
Le Monde, an authoritative and respected daily newspaper but one
considered to have a bias against the Tour de France. Its reporters
have been refused interviews by officials of the U.S. Postal
Service, Armstrong's team, with the explanation that the paper's
goals were not the team's.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde's reporter asked why the race leader denied this week
that he had presented a medical certificate to justify the use of a
banned substance. ``Are you calling me a liar or a doper?''
Armstrong asked in his only flash of anger. He then said that he
had made a mistake in making the earlier denial.
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question about the speculation that has
surrounded his domination of the bicycle race after his treatment
for the cancer that spread to his lungs and brain, Armstrong said
that he was tired of questions about ``How is that possible?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe in yourself,'' the 27-year-old Texan said.
``You have to fight. You have to hold the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about his comeback, especially in the French news
medias, began shortly after he won the race's short prologue on
July 3 and increased after he crushed his opponents in a long time
trial, or race against the clock, on July 11. He followed that
performance with another victory on July 13, this time on the first
of two stages in the Alps, and has held the yellow jersey ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   With a lead of more than six minutes, Armstrong is virtually
assured of victory, barring illness or injury, and would become the
second American, after the three-time winner, Greg LeMond, to win
the world's greatest bicycle race. Yet, speculation about
Armstrong's stirring comeback has turned into what he describes as
``innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the sport, for the Tour and for me,'' he said.
``I understand why there are more journalists here this year than
ever before,'' he said, referring to the fact that about 950
reporters are accredited, about 200 more than the normal
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand their interest,'' Armstrong said, noting last
year's scandal that resulted in the ouster of the Festina team on
charges of systematic use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs.
But, he said, reporters should be ``a little more respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   After his news conference, he appeared on a television program
devoted to the Tour and was asked briefly about the charges and his
defense. ``I'll sleep better tonight,'' he said. &QL;

FIRM'S REMOTE-CONTROL CAMERA WAS KEY TO DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searchers found the plane and bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren _ a discovery
many had likened to finding a needle in a haystack _ using a
remote-controlled, camera-equipped vehicle made by a Falmouth,
Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   The box-like vehicle, operated from the surface and equipped
with propellers, lights, cameras, sonar, and a robotic arm, was
sent down late Tuesday night off Martha's Vineyard to investigate a
sonar target. It found an 8- to 10-foot section of Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, all still inside the fuselage, were positively
identified by divers Wednesday morning, said Rear Admiral Richard
Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Several technologies were used to find the plane. Radar data
analysis helped locate where the plane went down and sonar surveys
of the seabed in that area identified items that didn't seem to
belong there.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's remote-controlled vehicle, manufactured by Benthos
Inc. of Falmouth, made it possible to explore likely sonar targets
easier and faster. Divers had been hampered by low visibility and
strong currents.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos officials said their remote-operated vehicles are
capable of generating high-quality pictures and video that can not
only help locate items on the sea bottom but aid in their salvage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer than sending a diver down and it's usually a lot
faster,'' said John Coughlin, president of Benthos.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee, who directed the search, said the vehicle was also
sent down with the divers Wednesday and its lights aided them in
their work. He declined to say how the bodies were brought to the
surface Wednesday afternoon, but said it was done in a way that
``respected the situation we were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Benthos vehicles were used in the search for wreckage from the
Swissair flight that went down off of Nova Scotia last year, and
from TWA flight 800, which fell to the sea off of Long Island in
1996. A Benthos vehicle was also used in 1994 to search the Quincy
quarries for a missing student from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are relatively small and operate much like
the robot vehicle used in the movie ``Titanic'' in the simulated
exploration of the sunken ship. The operator pilots the vehicle
using a joy stick and watching a TV monitor hooked up to the
vehicle's cameras. The vehicle is linked to its operator by a
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said his company's vehicles are most often purchased by
oil and gas companies, underwater construction firms, and nuclear
power plants. He said the equipment is useful in monitoring
underwater equipment or construction, as well as for research and
archeological work.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos makes two models that often operate in tandem. One is
about 5 feet long, weighs 700 pounds, and is capable of carrying
lots of equipment, said company spokesman Peter Zentz. The other is
about 4 feet long, weighs about 50 pounds, and is used for quick
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy purchased its Benthos vehicles around 1993, Zentz said.
The vehicles cost anywhere from $50,000 to $1 million, depending on
what additional equipment is added. Zentz said the larger vehicle
purchased by the Navy cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are currently capable of descending to
depths of 5,000 feet, but the company is preparing to unveil one
that will dive to 10,000 feet. Kennedy's plane was found at a depth
of 116 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos is a publicly traded company with 110 employees and $14
million in revenues. It was founded by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology graduate Sam Raymond.

VULCAN VENTURES YANKS INVESTMENT IN DATEK ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vulcan Ventures, the venture capital fund financed by Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen, has pulled out of its part of a planned $300
million investment in Datek Online Holdings Corp., partly because
of concerns about criminal and regulatory investigations into the
online brokerage firm, according to people familiar with the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Vulcan, Susan Pierson Brown, confirmed that
the fund had withdrawn from the deal, announced two months ago, but
she declined to elaborate. Just before the deal closed, Vulcan
changed its mind, citing ``due diligence'' problems, according to
people who worked on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Datek officials said that the two other venture capital firms,
Groupe Arnault of Paris and TA Associates of Boston, that had been
part of the original announcement signed contracts on Tuesday to
complete their Datek investments, though they lowered the amount to
$195 million from the expected $225 million to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan, which is based in Bellevue, Wash., was expected to
invest $50 million to $75 million in Datek, people familiar with
the deal said. Vulcan also dropped plans for an additional $25
million investment, or 12 percent interest, in the Island ECN, a
fast-growing electronic stock exchange operated by Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan's withdrawal is a serious setback to Datek Online, which
in the mid-1998 canceled an initial public offering of stock after
the Manhattan district attorney said he was investigating whether
Datek had taken part in a money-laundering operation and former
traders at Datek said they were interviewed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission about whether there were illegal trading
practices at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the SEC nor the Manhattan district attorney would
comment Wednesday on whether those investigations were continuing,
but law-enforcement officials said that Datek remained under
investigation by at least two regulatory and law enforcement
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Datek was named, but not charged, in a federal
indictment in Florida last month that accused five non-Datek
individuals, including two with ties to organized crime, with mail
fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sheldon Maschler, a former owner and trader at Datek,
was sued by the SEC, which accused him of improperly handling one
account at the center of the Florida indictments. The beneficiary
of that account was named Martin Clainey, according to the SEC.
Prosecutors in Florida now say that Clainey was really Philip
Gurian, who was banned for life from the securities industry and
worked closely with Philip Abramo, a captain in the Decavalcante
crime family. Datek officals said Wednesday that they had not been
informed about the Florida case.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Datek was sanctioned by the SEC and fined $50,000 for
filing false financial reports and illegally dipping into customer
money to pay its bills in spring 1998. The company was censured and
the former chief financial officer was fined and suspended from
Datek. The company says he has since been dropped from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Datek has said that since around mid-1998 it has reorganized its
operations and hired well-respected executives to lead its
aggressive push into the booming online trading arena. The company
is now the nation's fourth-largest online broker with more than $6
billion in customer assets and 253,000 online trading accounts.
Last May, its credibility was enhanced when it won the backing of
the three prominent venture capital firms, and in particular Allen,
one of the best-known names in the world of high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Datek was expecting to use the infusion of cash, about $300
million in all, to upgrade its technology at its fast-growing
online brokerage firm and help prepare the Island ECN, which has
petitioned the SEC to become a full-fledged stock exchange. To do
so, it will have to come up with a regulatory scheme, among other
costly endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The company remains upbeat about its prospects and said
Wednesday that it was exploring other financing options. Earlier
this year, Waterhouse Securities, another big online trading firm,
made a $25 million investment in Datek. Robert Bethge, a spokesman
for Datek, said Wednesday that TA Associates and Groupe Arnault had
agreed to invest $195 million, trimmed back from a proposed
investment of $225 million to $250 million. As for Vulcan Ventures,
Bethge said, ``The investment has closed, and Vulcan has opted, for
whatever reason, not to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Vulcan expressed concern about Datek's past,
including its long history of regulatory problems and
investigations into the company, Bethge said, ``I can't give you
the specifics but that's the sense I've gotten. That's a fair
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at TA Associates and Groupe Arnault each said
Wednesday that they remained confident in Datek and their
investment. They had no comment on the decision by Vulcan Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our due diligence very seriously,'' said Jean-Bernard
Tellio, head of the Internet unit at Group Arnault, a private
holding company run by the French businessman Bernard Arnault.
``The story of the company is very complicated, and there were some
clouds, but we spent three months investigating this company and it
looks terrific. We wouldn't risk our reputation if we weren't
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   TA Associates, a venture capital fund, said it was also
confident about its investment in Datek, which was arranged through
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``We were given all the facts by Datek
and we did our own investigation,'' said Kenneth Schiciano, a
principal at TA Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Datek has won praise from Wall Street analysts as a
powerful online brokerage firm, even company officials concede that
Datek's history is troublesome. ``There's no hiding from the fact
that Datek Securities had a questionable past,'' Bethge said
Wednesday, speaking of the company that is now Datek Online.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which began in the 1970s as Datek Securities,
gained fame in the 1980s and early 1990s as a day trading firm that
specialized in NASDAQ stocks under its two chief traders, Maschler
and Jeffrey Citron, now the chief executive of Datek Online.
</P>
<P>
   But with that success came repeated regulatory scrutiny and
fines against Datek traders, including Maschler and Citron for
engaging in illegal trading practices. Datek officials said
Maschler was no longer an owner of the company.

PENTAGON SPENT MONEY THAT WAS NEVER APPROPRIATED, CONGRESS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  (See also PENTAGON-CONGRESS) 
(lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress says in a new report that the Pentagon
defied the law and the Constitution by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars on military projects lawmakers never approved,
including a super-secret Air Force program. The Pentagon
acknowledged some of the accusations Wednesday night, saying that
honest mistakes had led to its failure to notify Congress about the
way it was spending money.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee, expressing anger and
astonishment in a report accompanying this year's military spending
bill, which is scheduled to be debated by the House on Thursday,
said the practice had eroded trust between the nation's lawmakers
and military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the committee's defense
spending panel, said the Pentagon's actions showed its belief
``that it can even move money to a program Congress has closed
down, maybe presuming, `Oh, well, nobody will know,''' he said.
``What do we have to do to make them understand what we mean when
we say no?''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Wednesday night that
failures to notify Congress about the military's juggling of
appropriated funds had taken place. ``We work very hard to respond
to the directives Congress gives us,'' he said. ``Do we get it
right 100 percent of the time? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Air Force wrongfully started and
financed a highly classified, still-secret project, known as a
``black program,'' without informing Congress last year. The
committee said that act was illegal. It also raises questions about
civilian control of black programs, whose costs and nature are the
most highly classified secrets in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 313-page report says the Air Force financed an
$800 million military communications satellite without lawful
authority, and illegally diverted hundreds of millions of dollars
to update its C-5 transport plane. It also says the Pentagon spent
millions on a ``Star Wars'' missile defense program previously
canceled by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited three other examples involving military trucks,
missiles and tanks. It did not provide specific cost figures, but
committee staff members said these practices were a chronic and
worsening problem adding up to billions spent improperly and
illegally over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the specific charges other than the Air Force black
program, Bacon said the military had on occasion failed to notify
lawmakers about the way it spent money on these and other military
projects. But he said these were honest errors, not open defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said there were legitimate disputes over whether caches of
research money should be segregated from money for the research
satellite. He said that there had been a simple failure to notify
Congress about changes the military made in the C-5's funding, and
that there was controversy over whether the ``Star Wars'' program
had been completely canceled by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The law and Pentagon procedures allow military officials to
shift funds from one account to another, but not without telling
Congress. They cannot finance programs Congress never approved, or
use money for a purpose lawmakers never intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution is pretty clear on this,'' Lewis said. It
says: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in
consequence of appropriations made by law.'' That means the
Pentagon cannot spend money unless Congress authorizes and
appropriates it for specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress struggles every year over the military's budget and the
costs of weaponry. But the Pentagon now consumes half the available
funds in the federal budget, and some senior Republican lawmakers,
mindful that their party is cutting billions from domestic
programs, are trying to be more vigilant about military spending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon spending battle has been joined this year in the
House on two fronts: the accountability of Pentagon officials and
the costs of weapons, including the $70 billion F-22 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has withheld $1.8 billion sought to produce the
first six F-22s, which are supposed to be the flagship of the 21st
century Air Force, producing howls of protest from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can fund the F-22,'' President Clinton said Wednesday. ``It
would be a mistake to abandon the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's defense bill finances the first six F-22s. But Sen.
John Warner, R-Va, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
told Defense Secretary William Cohen this week that ``we can't be
giving you a blank check to buy aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee's report noted that the Air
Force was trying to write its own checks for the F-22. It said the
Air Force requested hundreds of millions of dollars that were
supposed to help buy the first F-22s, but Air Force officials, ``in
violation of specific congressional direction,'' earmarked the
money for additional research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force issued a statement saying it ``had not misled
Congress or misused appropriated funds.'' It called the committee's
report a product of ``misunderstanding or misinterpretation,'' and
said it would ``work with Congress to clear this up.''
</P>
<P>
   That may take some doing. The committee called the Air Force's
``lack of accountability astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Its report said the Air Force broke the law by starting a new
program to update electronics and software on the C-5 transport
plane. This program, ``which the Congress never formally
approved,'' cost several hundred million dollars. The money was
obtained ``by diverting funds specifically provided by the Congress
for another program,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the Air Force has been taking money out of
research funds to help finance a new $800 million Milstar military
communications satellite. One of the satellites was lost in space
this spring, but because appropriated money was diverted, the Air
Force cannot say how much a replacement will cost taxpayers, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is little short of amazed,'' the report said in
describing how Pentagon and missile-defense officials illegally
financed a ``Star Wars'' system known as the Medium Altitude Air
Defense program, or Meads.
</P>
<P>
   Meads has cost $100 million but produced nothing, the committee
said. It was canceled last year by Congress. But it received at
least $2 million diverted by Pentagon and missile-defense officials
from another missile-defense program to help keep it alive, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, Bacon said, honest mistakes and
misunderstandings had taken place, not deliberate violations of
law.

DECKHAND FOR A DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Call me the Tangle Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   The endearing term was bestowed upon me during my self-appointed
duty of unraveling fishing lines as the charter boat Southern Cal
swayed on the anchor in 90 feet of water outside Long Beach Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   I now know what it's like to be a deckhand, if only for a day.
The big difference, of course, is that these anglers were kids
willing to listen and learn, not bullheaded fishermen with their
own agendas. I'll be more than happy to limit any subsequent
deckhand chores to teen-agers and grade-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other helping hands donning blue shirts tagged along
for the Los Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club's 50th annual Kids Trip out of
Long Beach. They were there to aid the 458 counselors and mostly
underprivileged youths aboard eight half-day charter boats based at
Pierpoint Landing. While this was the first time fishing for many
of the children, it also was a big departure for the club's
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reeling in fish themselves, they were assisting
others. Instead of slapping the back of a deckhand after a fish is
gaffed, they were getting their backs slapped. Instead of sharing
stories that only anglers can tell _ and embellish _ they listened
intently to those handling the reels and rods spin the day's tales
taller and taller.
</P>
<P>
   What they received was a better appreciation for the highs and
lows that full-time deckhands go through _ from witnessing the
elation of a first-time angler's inaugural catch to being treated
like a part of the railing by a bunch of whining youngsters
squeamish about baiting their own hooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' said volunteer deckhand Jayme Dinovitz, a
fourth- and fifth-grade teacher at Haynes Street Elementary in
Canoga Park. ``You have eight people in a row and one person
catching a fish on the end and it crosses everybody else and you
have eight lines in a big, huge cluster. Then you have to cut
everyone's line and you have to hand-line the fish in and bring it
all up while everyone else is screaming, `Where's my fish, where's
my fish?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are kids,'' Dinovitz said. ``So a deckhand with a bunch
of adults with no patience, there's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   He fully understands the plight of the professional deckhand,
who can just as easily be a hero when fish are coming over the
rails and as a heel when the bite gets picky. Ryan Carino, of
Signal Hill, a full-time deckhand aboard the Southern Cal, hopes
the volunteers can spread their newfound knowledge to other anglers
on future outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like it if when they go on the other boats, they can
explain what deckhands do,'' Carino said. ``When fishing's kind of
tough and you get a lot of guys (gathering) in circles and they
start rippin' you, I would hope one of these (volunteers) might
step up and say, `Hey, this is how it is; you can't catch them
every day. Hey, I did this one day; it's not that easy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the volunteers, my goal for the adventure was to
instill in the youngsters a better sense of independence while
having a little fun and promoting a new recreation that, hopefully,
would lead to a lifelong pursuit, if only for a single angler.
Phrases such as, ``Hold on,'' ``Wait your turn'' and ``The only way
to learn is to bait your own hook,'' were etched on my mind upon
departing the Southern Cal after the four-hour tour.
</P>
<P>
   There were some success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood's Ron Taylor _ a cousin of the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal
who, at 12, already stands 6-foot-1 and wears a size 16 shoe _ was
timid around the bait tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put on the bait,'' I told Taylor when he hesitated. ``Am I
going to have to tell Shaq you were scared of a little anchovy?''
By journey's end, he was baiting the hooks of anyone who asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was little 8-year-old Kenif Lucas of Hollywood, who
was too shy to speak up when volunteers asked who hadn't taken a
fish. As the skipper called for all lines to be pulled up for the
ride back to port, he tugged my shirttail and explained he was
fishless. Turns out he was the only kid who hadn't caught anything.
</P>
<P>
   This just wouldn't do, so I tossed a line out as the anchor was
being retrieved, hooked a sand bass and handed it off to the boy.
The day's final fish was the first catch of his young life. I got a
chill when he turned around after speaking with his friends and
explained, ``I caught the last fish with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The life of the deckhand is seldom glorious. It's not a big
moneymaker, benefits are few and advancement is tough, so you've
got to love your work. On the other hand, they're out on the water
all the time and enjoy that unexplainably detached feeling when the
metropolis is left back dockside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never the same thing twice, that's what I like about
it,'' Carino said. ``You can go from catching nothing in the
morning to going out in the afternoon and just catching so much you
could go to jail for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like it when people thank me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any story about deckhands would be remiss without
mentioning that the crews of some party boats are anything but
scrupulous. For as many deckhands who are sincerely helpful, I've
seen others who would just as soon demean newcomers, have a good
chuckle over customers who get seasick and extend preferential
treatment to ringers aiming to hustle jackpot money for the captain
and crew in exchange for a free trip. As a result, their reputation
is far from sterling.
</P>
<P>
   The young crew aboard the Southern Cal on this fine afternoon in
the San Pedro Channel appeared genuine, if not grizzled, and pumped
up to lend any support they could. Then again, when one of the
vessel's deckhands was reminded after he threw a broken reel handle
overboard that youngsters learn by example, the offender quipped,
``It's only plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong answer. I guess you get the respect you deserve.
</P>
<P>
   But enough on the good, the bad and the ugly of deckhands. The
Los Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club's volunteers got a taste of it all on
this day. And no doubt they would agree with me the experience was
enlightening and well worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime you can be even a small part of putting smiles on faces,
yeah, it's well worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about,'' said volunteer deckhand Steve
Simon of Valley Village. &QL;

   UPS PLANS TO GO PUBLIC, RAISING AT LEAST $3 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service has resisted the persistent entreaties of
investment bankers and remained private for 92 years. But now it
has decided to sell 10 percent of itself to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The package delivery company, which earned $1.7 billion last
year on sales of $24.8 billion, plans to raise between $3 billion
and $5 billion in the offering.
</P>
<P>
   OPPOSITE RESULTS ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   America Online said its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled,
topping estimates, as it signed up 755,000 new subscribers and ad
revenue surged. Amazon.com said its second-quarter loss widened
because of increased spending to promote and expand its Web site,
but its results matched expectations. Both companies reported after
the market closed, and both stocks had gained.
</P>
<P>
   JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON TO BUY CENTOCOR
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson has agreed to acquire biotechnology company
Centocor for $4.9 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported
higher second-quarter profits as advertising increased sales of
medicines for allergies, depression and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON VALLEY'S DOMINANCE SLIPPING
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the business consulting firm A.T. Kearney
shows that the booming Internet economy is decentralizing
technology industries and threatening Silicon Valley's domination
of all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS REVERSE SLIDE AND EDGE UP
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose for the first time this week. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 6.65 points, to 11,002.78. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.19 points, to 1,379.29, and the
NASDAQ composite index climbed 29.59 points, to 2,761.77.
</P>
<P>
   KODAK PLANS CLOSINGS, JOB CUTS
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak said that it would close some manufacturing
operations, cutting as many as 2,500 jobs. Analysts applauded the
move, which will entail a $300 million charge in the third quarter,
but the mood was somber in Rochester, where Kodak is already
cutting 7,500 jobs. Kodak also reported a 9 percent quarterly
earnings rise to $491 million.
</P>
<P>
   NEW PACKAGES FOR FAMILIAR BRANDS
</P>
<P>
   In the beverage industry, some companies are trying to win
consumers over to their products by putting the usual brew in an
unusual package, using substances like aluminum, glass and clear
plastic and the opportunities those offer for industrial-strength
decorative arts like embossing and surface printing. The new
packaging ranges from a can for Heineken beer to plastic bottles
for Miller Beer brands to a glass fruit-drink bottle with a label
that changes as the contents decrease. Advertising.

 WASHINGTON: in America.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The compromise plan under consideration in the House Wednesday
night was complicated but spoke to the main concern of many of the
Republican moderates _ that the party was not doing enough to
reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt held by the public _ the portion that is most
economically important _ is about $3.6 trillion, and is the legacy
of years of budget deficits in which the government had to borrow
money by selling Treasury bonds. This year, Washington will pay
interest on those bonds of about $229 billion, or about 14 percent
of the total federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being considered by the moderates, there would
have to be agreed-upon reductions in the interest payments in order
for the proposed reductions in income-tax rates to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the personal income tax brackets _ which
start at 15 percent and rise to 39.6 percent _ to be reduced by 10
percent over the next decade in four steps. In 2009, the 15 percent
bracket would be 13.5 percent and the 39.6 percent bracket would be
36.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's compromise would allow the first of the four
phased in reductions to take effect as planned in 2001, but would
delay reductions in the rates if the interest payments on the debt
have not declined. The money that would then be saved by not
enacting the tax cut would go to debt reduction instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a deal,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who
was among the moderates holding out for changes in the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everything, but it surely makes it more realistic in
terms of relating the across-the-board tax cuts to the surplus,''
Ms. Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   The change, however, could prove politically controversial and
difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to administer. Democrats
said voters would not appreciate being promised a tax cut and then
having it taken away if the debt reduction targets were not met.
And they said it would be difficult for the IRS to prepare
tax-return forms and make technical changes to income tax
regulations if the rates are uncertain from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the reduction in income tax rates, the House bill
includes a reduction in the top capital gains tax rate to 15
percent from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, would also reduce the so-called
marriage penalty, which forces many two-income couples to pay more
in taxes than they would if they were single, repeal the
inheritance tax on large estates and create deductions for health
insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved by the Senate Finance Committee Wednesday
is somewhat more favorable to middle-income taxpayers than the
House bill. It would reduce the bottom income tax bracket of 15
percent to 14 percent, would extend that bottom bracket to a higher
income level and would all but eliminate the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The committee defeated an alternative proposal introduced by
Democrats that would have cut taxes by $290 billion over 10 years,
the highest level that Clinton has said he would accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to be doing as much as we can to return this
overpayment, this surplus, to the people,'' said Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.

A GUN ACCORD IN NEW YORK COULD SET NATIONAL STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., La.)  (See also special report, GUN-LAWS-I) 
(rk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If New York's state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer,
sues the gun industry as he has threatened, he will simply join a
long line of 23 cities and counties that have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   But if Spitzer succeeds in striking a deal with some firearms
producers over issues like the way they monitor gun distribution,
then New York will score a first that could set a national
standard.
</P>
<P>
   There is no assurance that the talks Spitzer began recently with
two gun makers and a trade group will succeed, and one person
involved in the talks said he expected them to move ahead or to
collapse quickly. And in the broadest sense, the New York talks may
prove to be only another in a series of stillborn efforts to settle
the growing wave of lawsuits against gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials in other cities who have sued the gun industry
said Wednesday they were pleased because the talks might lead to a
break in that logjam of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a positive sign that some members of the gun
industry are willing to talk,'' said Louise Renne, the city
attorney of San Francisco, which along with more than a dozen
California cities sued gun makers this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suits accuse gun companies of negligently marketing
guns by failing to impose proper control over distributors and
dealers. As a result, those lawsuits charge, guns easily fall into
criminal hands. Gun makers have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The New York lawsuit has yet to be filed. But under discussion
in the talks are a number of issues aimed at tightening how guns
are marketed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal long championed by some gun control advocates would
involve the appointment of an independent monitor, either by a
court or through an agreement between the state and the industry,
who would review the distribution of guns.
</P>
<P>
   That monitor would then identify companies, distributors and
dealers who were failing to keep guns from being sold to people
planning to resell them to criminals or other prohibited buyers
like teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's office is also pressing makers to start test-firing
their guns before they ship them, then submit the cartridge casings
and bullets to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
the agency that regulates the manufacture and sale of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The agency could then use the unique markings on those casings
and bullets to identify a gun used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The talks apparently began in recent days when Spitzer's office
contacted Colt's Manufacturing, one of the country's largest
firearms producers. Richard Esposito, a consultant to Colt, said
the ``company had been invited to a meeting'' with Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   From there, an industry trade group, the National Shooting
Sports Foundation, was brought in because Colt's felt it was
inappropriate for one company to talk separately with Spitzer,
according to two people, one who took part in the talks and one who
had been briefed about them. Robert Delfay, the president of the
group, has declined to confirm or deny that a meeting with Spitzer
took place.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of Smith &AMP; Wesson, the largest gun maker in the
country, also met with Spitzer's aides, said one person who had
been briefed about the talks. Kenneth Jorgensen, a spokesman for
the firearms producer, said he was not aware that anyone at the
company had talked with Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   John Coale, a lawyer in Washington who is involved with five
cities suing gun makers, including New Orleans and Bridgeport,
Conn., said he believed that Spitzer's talks would be important
only if they produce some agreement, since some of the issues in
the New York talks have already been the subject of failed
discussions between his group and gun industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 10 days ago, for example, Coale said he met with
Delfay, the president of the industry trade group, to discuss
settlement-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking at the issue of global talks and how to
get everybody in the same room,'' Coale said. The agenda included
issues like better distribution controls and tighter oversight on
how many guns a customer can buy each day.
</P>
<P>
   Coale also said one gun maker, Glock Inc., was moving close to
adopting the type of bullet tracing system that Spitzer was
proposing all gun makers adopt.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Delfay acknowledged that those talks
had taken place. Paul Jannuzzo, a lawyer for Glock, did not return
a phone call seeking comment.

 FREMONT, CALIF., CALLED BEST U.S. CITY FOR RAISING KIDS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to raising healthy kids, Fremont,
Calif., may be the best big city in America, while Oakland, Calif.,
ranks near the bottom, far below San Jose, Calif., and San
Francisco, according to a national public health study unveiled
Wednesday.
<P>
   The study was compiled by the National Public Health and
Hospital Institute, an 11-year-old nonprofit think tank in
Washington, D.C. The two-year study was funded by the independent
Robert Woods Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study is believed to be the first comprehensive effort to
correlate socioeconomic status with public health indicators in the
nation's 100 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Neuhauser, a public health professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, said the results reinforce a growing
consensus that health and wealth are tightly linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is wide agreement in academic circles that the most
important single factor in the relative health of someone is their
social class,'' Neuhauser said. ``To put it simply, the poorest
people almost always have the worst health.''
</P>
<P>
   The 403-page study ranks the 100 largest cities by two sets of
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The first gauge, called the child welfare index, uses three
statistics _ childhood poverty, infant mortality and the incidence
of babies with low birth weight. Fremont tops the child welfare
list, with the lowest incidence of these public perils.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose placed 10th on the same child welfare index, while San
Francisco ranked 15th and Oakland came in 70th out of the 100
cities surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The second ranking, called a deprivation index, took into
account various socioeconomic data, including per capita income,
educational attainment and the incidence of crime. A rank of one on
the deprivation index meant the city was least deprived; a rank of
100 meant the city was the most deprived.
</P>
<P>
   In this category, Fremont took a desirable second place, while
San Jose came in 21st and San Francisco 27th. Oakland was not
ranked in the deprivation index because not all data were available
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont was included because it is the 93rd-largest city in
America, with a 1994 population of 184,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of data that city, county and state
officials need to take into account when setting public health
priorities,'' said Dennis Andrulis, a public health expert with the
New York Academy of Medicine and the study's principal author.
</P>
<P>
   But Alameda County Supervisor Gail Steele, who represents the
relatively well-off southern end of the county, said elected
officials can't simply give all their public health dollars to the
poorest cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always this political battle,'' Steele said. ``We
know Oakland has great need, but even in the more affluent areas
there are pockets of tragedy, and they tend to get ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   No city proves better than Fremont the link between
socioeconomic factors and health.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont's per capita income _ at $20,101 _ was the
second-highest among cities surveyed. Its violent crime rate was
the six lowest on the list. These two factors helped make it the
second-least-deprived city among the largest 100.
</P>
<P>
   The study also gave Fremont high marks for child welfare. It had
an infant mortality rate of just 3.79 deaths per thousand births,
the third best showing in the nation, and far below the national
average of 7.51.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three other Bay Area cities in the study, San Jose turned
out the next-best showing on the two indexes. But a closer look at
the data revealed that San Jose seemed to be losing a little
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The study took two statistical snapshots of each city: one using
1980 data, and another using 1990 to 1996 data. So the report also
showed how each city improved _ or lost ground _ over time.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's rank on the deprivation index fell from 17th using
1980 data to 21th using the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Andrulis, the study's author, attributed San Jose's slip to a
spike in violent crime in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the separate child welfare index, San Jose improved slightly,
moving from 11th using 1980 data to 10th using more recent health
indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Although San Francisco trailed San Jose in both indexes, the
city showed encouraging improvements in both categories. San
Francisco moved up sharply _ from 50th to 27th _ on the deprivation
index, thanks to rising income and lower crime.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco also showed a strong improvement in child welfare,
moving from 22nd in the 1980 computation to 15th in the current
reckoning. The study cited San Francisco's ``great success'' in
cutting infant mortality in half during the survey period, one of
the sharpest drops of any big city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Katz, director of San Francisco's Public Health
Department, attributed the improvement to city programs that target
poor pregnant women for special prenatal and postnatal care. San
Francisco also earned public health points for aggressive programs
to reduce the rates of infection for syphilis, tuberculosis and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oakland rated low among the nation's 100-largest cities
on the child welfare index, the city moved up from 78th to 70th.
The study noted that a 46 percent reduction in Oakland's infant
mortality rate boosted the city's overall child welfare rating.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown called the reduction in infant
mortality ``a very encouraging sign,'' adding that ``Oakland
clearly has a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking disparity between Oakland and Fremont comes as no
surprise to county health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fremont has become a de facto suburb of Silicon Valley,'' said
Sherri Willis, spokeswoman for the Alameda County Public Health
Department. ``It's not even in the same league as Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   She said county officials needed more time to study the report.
But there may be no easy ways to cure the public health ills that
seem to follow poverty, said Vince Miller, a health care consultant
with Berkeley Economic Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there are no programs set up to recognize
these kinds of socioeconomic disparities or how deal with them,''
he said.

BUSH WILL NOT PUSH FOR `FEDERALIZATION OF EDUCATION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The White House would be a great bully pulpit for
promoting school choice issues, but presidential candidate George
W. Bush says he does not plan to use it as a launch pad for
national education legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in federalization of education,'' the Texas
governor said after touring an inner-city charter school. ``Matter
of fact, I think we ought to pass that power back to the states and
local jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush brought his campaign Wednesday to the city with arguably
the broadest selection of publicly funded education choices in the
country, including vouchers, charter schools and a statewide open
enrollment program. While Bush has been unable to pass voucher
bills through the Texas Legislature, thousands of low-income
Milwaukee students have been allowed to trade tax-funded vouchers
for a private school education since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's support for vouchers and other school choice
issues, he said he would not pursue federal legislation on those
issues if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the president to set high standards
and high expectations. We expect the best from every child. We
should encourage local folks to develop accountability measures _
we ought to blow the whistle on failure,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do believe a president can highlight programs that work,
and encourage different innovations,'' Bush said. ``I believe the
charter school movement is an important reform. It gives parents
more choices and says we're going to provide an outlet for
educational entrepreneurs''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was showing off his
school choice program when he invited Bush, the front-runner for
the GOP presidential nomination, to tour the Bruce-Guadalupe
Community school in a predominantly minority neighborhood near
downtown. The private school began accepting students who paid
their tuition with tax-supported vouchers in 1991, but later
re-organized as a charter school, which provides a higher
per-student tax stipend.
</P>
<P>
   Although education experts say the jury is still out on whether
Milwaukee's school choice program produces more academic gains for
participating students than traditional public schools,
Bruce-Guadalupe School is an academic success that supporters say
has also helped stabilize and strengthen the surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bring my friend Governor Bush here to see the
Hispanic north,'' Thompson said as he introduced Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really impressed,''Bush responded a few minutes later,
lauding Thompson for his leadership on school choice as well as
welfare reform issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the school, shaking hands and chatting with its
uniformed summer school pupils. Bush then sat in a small,
schoolhouse chair and read a book titled ``El Gato Azul'' (The Blue
Cat) to a group of preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   He followed up his reading with an anecdote about Ernie, the
Bush family's six-toed cat, that he used as a parable about
overcoming adversity. He described to the children how his family
dog first discovered stray-cat Ernie cowering in a tree, and how
the cat eventually ingratiated himself into the Bush household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're going to find yourself in a tough
situation,'' Bush advised the youngsters. ``Don't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess where Ernie was when I left?'' Bush queried. ``Right on
my pillow.``
</P>
<P>
   Thompson squired Bush to a downtown fund-raising luncheon, where
he spoke to a crowd of nearly 400 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   National campaign chairman Don Evans said Bush took in about
$300,000 at the Milwaukee fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate is scheduled for another large fund-raising
luncheon Thursday in Indianapolis. His campaign said that Bush will
deliver a major policy address in Indianapolis on specific
proposals to ``rally the armies of compassion.''

<P>
   There was a time when he was The Man, The Star, a McDonald's
high school All American, a NCAA Final Four MVP, a North Carolina
hero.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when he enjoyed the vast trappings of athletic
success, the constant applause from fans, the constant attention
from autograph-seekers, the constant attention from media, the
constant greetings and handshakes from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when he was secure about his station on a
basketball court, like his senior year in high school when he
averaged 35 points a game and like his career at North Carolina
when he was a starting guard for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all changed now for 25-year-old Donald Williams, just
another player in the Summer Pro League who's been trying to make
an impression in recent days with the NBA scouts as a member of the
Lakers team.
</P>
<P>
   He's far removed from those memorable moments in the spring of
1993 when as a 19-year-old sophomore he made all the big shots he
wound up with 25 points in leading the Tar Heels to a dramatic
victory over Michigan at the Superdome in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different now. . .no doubt about it,'' says Williams.
``You remember when you were assured of a starting job, and you
never even worried about it. You remember when the crowd was
cheering you, and everyone gravitated to you. Now no one pays
attention to you, and you just hope that you do well enough so
someone in the NBA will notice and give you a chance at a tryout.
It's difficult, tough, hard, all those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kind of learned to live with it since I got out of
college in 1995 and then got cut by the Philadelphia 76ers during
training camp. I thought I was good enough to play in the NBA, and
still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then, I've been working hard on improving all
aspects of my game, especially my ball-handling. I just hope
someone notices the little things I've learned to do out there
because everyone knows I can shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting, of course, was Donald Williams' strong suit with the
Tar Heels, but he discovered to his dismay that his extraordinary
jump shot wasn't enough to secure himself work in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And so for the past three years, Donald Williams has followed
the course of countless American players, performing in foreign
countries like Greece, Germany and, most recently, the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I made decent money in the Philippines because my
team won the championship,'' says Williams. ``But I'm tired of
playing overseas. It just gets very lonely if you're single like me
and you find yourself in a foreign country. The easiest part is
playing the actual games. The toughest part is the constant
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Williams wouldn't even have been given an opportunity to
perform in the Pro Summer League had it not been for his old North
Carolina coach, Dean Smith, who three weeks ago made a phone appeal
to one of his other former players, Lakers' general manager Mitch
Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean told me that Donald needed some help,'' relates Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   The Dean Smith NBA Connection Smith has strong ties to
Milwaukee's George Karl, Philadelphia's Larry Brown and Indiana's
Donnie Walsh was in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Donald Williams was a member of the Lakers entry,
although with an encumbrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Donald when he joined our team that he might not be
playing much because we wanted to get a look at our young guards
like Tyrone Lue and John Celestand,'' says Kupchak. ``But Lue got
hurt, and Williams has seen some action.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has displayed his long-range shooting touch, as he did in
Sunday's match against the Dallas team at The Pyramid when he hit 7
of 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Donald Williams' chances of eventual hooking on with an
NBA team aren't good.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts will tell you the 6-foot-3, 200 pounder has two
serious flaws. One his ball-handling he can do something about, but
the other his quickness he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Donald Williams has the quickness needed to play
in the NBA,'' said one NBA coach. ``He's a good guy, and works
hard. And he definitely can shoot. But you need more than that to
play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Williams, who earned a degree in communications at
North Carolina, plans to continue chasing his NBA dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make it with the NBA this season, I'll just go back
and play overseas again,'' he says. ``Why not? Where else can a
25-year-old guy like me make a six-figure salary playing a game I'd
gladly play for nothing. I'm never going to stop playing basketball
until I get too old to play. I love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago in a pick-up game at his alma mater,
Williams played against his idol, a gentleman named Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be there to see it,'' says Williams. ``Michael was
Michael just incredible. No one could stop him. He was totally
dominant. He could come back to the NBA next season and still be
the league's best player. I don't think he's slowed down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Donald Williams, whose glory days might be in the
past but whose resolve and spirit presage a bright future even if
it doesn't include employment in the NBA.

`THE HAUNTING' HAUNTED BY BAD TIMING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A triumph of production design, Jan De Bont's
richly rococo remake of Robert Wise's spare, subtle 1963 film ``The
Haunting'' is living dead proof that, when it comes to delivering
screen chills, less is often more effective.
</P>
<P>
   As if doubly damned, this beautifully bloated mega-production
also suffers the misfortune of being released in the deservedly
hyped shadow of the no-frills, innovatively chilling ``Blair Witch
Project.'' That some $70 million worth of top Hollywood production
values can't generate a smidgen of the disturbance that a lunch
money indie does is probably the most frightening thing to be said
about ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are dark pleasures here, though not of the
shriek-inducing kind. First and foremost, of course, are Eugenio
Zanetti's clever and cavernous interiors, huge castle spaces that
are not only filled with monstrous appointments but feel like they
were carved out of giant gargoyle innards.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``Citizen Kane,'' ``The Shining'' and, most
obviously, De Bont and Zanetti's familiarity with the great
edifices of Europe, these built-from-scratch sets overflow with
plush menace: colossal leering portraits, carvings so detailed it's
hardly surprising when they come to life, furnishings that look
like they could not only swallow you but chew you up, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are halls of mirrors, halls of horrifically cut filigree
that seem to go on more infinitely than the reflecting glass
corridors, a crazy kaleidoscopic ballroom with a rotating floor, a
flooded library and the requisite secret passageway to a dusty
study full of skulls and secrets. Of course, the whole building has
a life of its own _ more life, in fact, than David Self's script,
which like the 1963 movie's is based on Shirley Jackson's popular
novel, ``The Haunting of Hill House.''
</P>
<P>
   The story this time around involves deceptive, self-serving
psychologist David Marrow (Liam Neeson, not really engaged)
tricking three insomniacs _ naive Nell (Lili Taylor), outgoing
bisexual bombshell Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones, fun but hardly
developed to the fullest) and zonky skeptic Luke (Owen Wilson,
expendable) _ into spending a few nights at the late Victorian New
England mansion. They think the doc is researching sleep disorders;
he's really pursuing some murky experiment in group fear.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, Marrow seems unaware of the house's
supernatural reputation (which makes you wonder why he chose it in
the first place). When the whole place starts morphing into
spectral manifestations of the industrialist pig who built it and
the child workers he abused there, Marrow seems more unnerved by
the screw-turn of events than his guinea pigs do.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, than any but the most easily spooked
audience members will. De Bont, who proved himself a master of
techno-film pacing with ``Speed,'' and utterly inept at sustaining
it with ``Speed 2,'' tries to have it both ways here _ slowly and
elliptically building up a tense atmosphere a la the Wise version,
then overpowering us with barrages of ghostly special effects _ and
ends up canceling out each, strenuous effort with the clashing tone
of the other. Trying to integrate subtle and spectacular, De Bont
mostly achieves an unhappy balance of tedious and shrill.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Lili Taylor. Best known for a sensational string of
challenging indie film roles (``Household Saints,'' ``The
Addiction,'' ``I Shot Andy Warhol''), Taylor brings precise
emotional resonance to the interesting Nell. A waif who's devoted
her life to caring for her disabled, demanding and mercifully just
departed mother, Nell has a special connection to the house and a
fragile psyche that makes her growing understanding of what's going
on there appear to be madness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the script doesn't really understand what's going on
in ``The Haunting's'' Hill House, or at least can't impart it in a
coherent way. But Taylor's empathetic performance somehow makes
sense of her corner of this overstuffed, dramatically jerry-built
parcel of expensive cinematic real estate. &QL;

2 WORKERS DIE WHEN OXYGEN FAILS 9 MILES INTO UNDERSEA TUNNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Seattle)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ AND ROB NELSON AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Four hundred feet beneath the floor of Massachusetts
Bay and nine miles into the Deer Island outfall tunnel _ a mammoth
pipe built to carry treated water far out to sea _ two workers in a
HumVee monitored the oxygen supply of three co-workers when
something went fatally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Their own oxygen supply suddenly malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that something was amiss when they couldn't contact
the men in the HumVee by radio, workers on the surface desperately
alerted the three co-workers to check on the two in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The three co-workers, who were outside the HumVee, found them
unconscious about 2 p.m. in the dimly lit tunnel where air flow is
restricted and supplemental oxygen a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   With helicopters waiting, the three surviving workers traveled
for two hours with their fatally stricken co-workers, moving
through water several feet deep on the floor of the tunnel back to
the bottom of a 400-foot shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers had alread been lowered in a cage to the
bottom of the shaft and immediately started working on the
unconscious workers who were in full cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had missions in that hole before, but nothing like
this,'' said Richard Serino, of the Boston Emergency Medical
Service ``This is not a call we get everyday. It's hard to
describe, but while you're in the middle of it, you do everything
you can to save someone. That's what you focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the surface, one man was airlifted to Boston Medical
Center and the other to Massachusetts General Hospital. Both were
dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The other three workers were rushed to Massachusetts General for
observation but were not injured, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they were doing a dangerous thing,'' said Tom Lee,
spokesman for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which is
overseeing the project.``They are highly trained specialists. They
took all the precautions, and something went horribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee could not say why the oxygen system for the two men in the
HumVee malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the unidentified men who died worked for Black
Dog Divers of New Hampshire, and the other was employed by Norwesco
Marine of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The accident is under investigation by the MWRA and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are the fourth and fifth fatalities in the last 10
years on the outfall pipe project, a key element of the Boston
Harbor Cleanup. The tunnel is scheduled to begin sending treated
water from the Deer Island sewage treatment plant into
Massachusetts Bay by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible story.'' said Doug MacDonald, MWRA
director. ``We're all in a state of shock here. It is really
devastating for everyone conected with this project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost two workers today and we still have a challenge
of finishing this project.'' he said. ``But people do fly in
airplanes again and we will fly again too.'
</P>
<P>
   The MWRA recently received tentative federal approval to begin
using the 9.5 mile outfall pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Crews have been at work for several days at the end of the pipe
preparing to fill the tunnel with water and open valves that will
allow treated sewage to rise up from the tunnel through diffusers
to the ocean floor and mix with waters in Massachusetts Bay.
</P>
<P>
   All five workers in the tunnel Wednesday were getting a mixture
of oxygen and nitrogen through face masks from tanks on the HumVee.
The two workers in the HumVee were assigned to monitor their three
co-workers' oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
   The three men out of the HumVee worked 2,000 feet away and had a
backup supply of oxygen stored on their hips, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The three workers who survived worked in a section of the tunnel
that is only 12 feet in diameter, They were removing caps that cut
off diffusers from Massachusetts Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the HumVee, the two workers were equipped with spare air
tanks as well as liquid oxygen. Lee said the HumVee has three
backup oxygen sources in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatality on the project happened in 1995 when engineer
Richard White was crushed to death in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1992, Charles Spears, 47, a drill operator, died
from injuries suffered when he was thrown from a drilling platform.
Michael Lee, 39, of Quincy was killed two weeks later when a crane
dropped a prefabricated concrete section on him.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been also been plagued by floods and fires in
its 13-year history.

 ELECTRIC SHORTAGES MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT CALIFORNIANS  &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Energy experts fear that California is veering
toward shortages of electricity that could cause rolling brownouts
or outright blackouts like those that paralyzed parts of the
Northeast two weeks ago.
<P>
   The outlook is especially troubling because California has been
extremely slow in building new plants, relying instead on
electricity surpluses from other states to meet rising peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   But those surpluses may be running low as other states rush to
deregulate the energy industry and compete vigorously for limited
supplies of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was graphically demonstrated during last week's heat
wave when power plants were pushed to the limit to meet demand that
surged to a record 45,884 megawatts. Including power that must be
kept in reserve, the effective demand on July 12 was 49,090
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, a tightening supply of electricity in a
deregulated world means more volatile energy prices. For industrial
customers, it means more service interruptions. Hundreds have
signed up for ``interruptible power'' in exchange for lower rates.
In effect, periodic shortages mean they will be called on to reduce
demand more often to ease the threat to electric system stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a danger zone here in California,'' says Ron Walter,
senior vice president at Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif.,
proposed builder of four new plants with total capacity of 2,680
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two emergencies, already this summer, and we haven't
even hit the highest temperatures which we usually reach in August
or September.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief is still in the planning stage. Private generating
companies are proposing to build 20 new power plants that could add
13,500 megawatts of badly needed capacity. That's more generation
than has been proposed in any decade since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But only one _ Calpine's proposed 540-megawatt plant near Yuba
City, Calif. _ has received regulatory go-ahead from the California
Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the state has used up the ``excess capacity'' that
once looked inexhaustible. Still two to three years away from any
hope of relief, the situation could become dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to reliably meet the summer peaks is becoming
shaky,'' says Richard Grix, an energy analyst for the California
Energy Commission, which is expected to release a report next week
showing that the state is headed for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure how much electricity California can
produce. On paper, it is 50,667 megawatts. But many experts think
the actual maximum output may be 5,000 megawatts less.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the state's aging power &UR;  &LR; plants _ 61 percent of
the fossil-fuel plants are more than 30 years old _ cannot be
pushed as hard as when they were young. Also, 3 to 4 percent of the
electricity that is generated gets lost as it travels along
high-transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming actual output is roughly 45,000 megawatts, that is
4,000 megawatts less than the amount the state needed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to 45,000 to 46,000 megawatts of demand, we're
getting close to the system's limits,'' says Terry Winter, chief
executive of the grid-operating Independent System Operator in
Folsom, Calif., the quasi-public agency formed a year ago that is
responsible for state electricity reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at actual demand tells only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require electrical system operators like the
ISO to keep extra energy in reserve equal to 7 percent of the
``load'' or demand. That's needed to cover emergencies like power
plant failures. On July 12, it meant California needed an
additional 3,206 megawatts of power in reserve, pushing total need
to 49,090 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that utilities swapped power around. When one
utility came up short, it borrowed from a neighbor and repaid the
loan later with a like amount of power.
</P>
<P>
   Now the utilities have sold off most of their plants and there
is a tumultuous free market. Every time the system comes close to
its limits, power prices rise dramatically on a new power auction.
</P>
<P>
   And it is going to get worse. Demand is growing 2 percent a year
here. It's growing even faster in Arizona and Nevada. And there are
plans to build a huge transmission line from Oregon to southern
Nevada, bypassing California consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is nothing inherently bad about the use of
power from other states. Because some of the cheapest power in the
world is generated by the Depression-era federal hydropower
projects on the Columbia and Snake rivers, California would be
foolish not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is California's reliance on that power to stave off
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   When supplies get tight, the ISO can implement three stages of
emergency alert.
</P>
<P>
   If reserves slip below 7 percent, a ``stage one'' alert, the ISO
asks the public to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   If the margin dips below 5 percent, the ISO initiates a stage
two alert and tells utilities to implement ``interruptible load''
programs in which industrial customers are removed from service in
exchange for rates that are 10 to 15 percent lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Masonite Corp., a maker of exterior house siding in Ukiah,
Calif., is one of 215 companies signed to PG&AMP;E's interruptible load
program. It is being asked to use its emergency generators more
often these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, power was ``interrupted'' five times as a result of
stage two emergencies. By contract, power to the company can be
interrupted only six times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO has not reached a stage three alert, but it is
increasingly likely that that will happen. It would begin if
reserves dipped below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What would it mean? Power would be cut off to homes and
nonessential businesses. There would be rolling brownouts, or even
blackouts, of whole communities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, utilities from Maine to Virginia cut the
voltage they supplied to customers by 5 percent because the three
regional power pools were approaching capacity limits.
</P>
<P>
   More than reliability of an essential service is at stake. There
is also the issue of cost now that the state's electricity market
has been deregulated. As demand rises, prices rise because of the
bidding rules adopted by the state's new energy auction, the
California Power Exchange in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, generators tell the quasi-public Power Exchange how
much power they have for sale and at what price they will sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Exchange or ``PX'' obtains power on behalf of
utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. from the lowest-priced
providers. The PX works its way down the ``bid stack'' from
cheapest power to more costly power until it has bought enough
electricity to meet the expected demand.
</P>
<P>
   But generators are not just paid the price they demanded. They
are paid the price asked by the final _ and thus highest-priced _
generator whose power is bought that day. That means the priciest
power sets the price for the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at what happened on July 12:
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., with demand at 30,693 megawatts, the price of power
on the PX was $33.49 per megawatt hour, an unremarkable price.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., when temperatures were at their peak, demand surged
by 2,824 megawatts. That modest increase in demand pushed the price
of power up a whopping 450 percent to $153.83 per megawatt hour for
the entire market. (Total PX demand is less than total state demand
because not all power that is consumed is traded over that
exchange.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all still learning how this market behaves,'' says
George Sladoje, chief executive of the Power Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For now, consumers are insulated from these price shocks. That
is because rates are frozen. But the rate freeze ends for San Diego
Gas and Electric customers this autumn. PG&AMP;E and Southern
California Edison are close behind.
</P>
<P>
   So price swings soon will be averaged and passed along to
customers. If they experience power failures and price shocks, they
soon may wonder why the state chose a time of scarcity to
deregulate an essential service.

2 WORKERS DIE WHEN OXYGEN FAILS 9 MILES INTO UNDERSEA TUNNEL

<P>
   BOSTON -- Four hundred feet beneath the floor of Massachusetts
Bay and nine miles into the Deer Island outfall tunnel _ a mammoth
pipe built to carry treated water far out to sea _ two workers in a
HumVee monitored the oxygen supply of three co-workers when
something went fatally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Their own oxygen supply suddenly malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that something was amiss when they couldn't contact
the men in the HumVee by radio, workers on the surface desperately
alerted the three co-workers to check on the two in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The three co-workers, who were outside the HumVee, found them
unconscious about 2 p.m. in the dimly lit tunnel where air flow is
restricted and supplemental oxygen a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   With helicopters waiting, the three surviving workers traveled
for two hours with their fatally stricken co-workers, moving
through water several feet deep on the floor of the tunnel back to
the bottom of a 400-foot shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers had alread been lowered in a cage to the
bottom of the shaft and immediately started working on the
unconscious workers who were in full cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had missions in that hole before, but nothing like
this,'' said Richard Serino, of the Boston Emergency Medical
Service ``This is not a call we get everyday. It's hard to
describe, but while you're in the middle of it, you do everything
you can to save someone. That's what you focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the surface, one man was airlifted to Boston Medical
Center and the other to Massachusetts General Hospital. Both were
dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The other three workers were rushed to Massachusetts General for
observation but were not injured, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they were doing a dangerous thing,'' said Tom Lee,
spokesman for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which is
overseeing the project.``They are highly trained specialists. They
took all the precautions, and something went horribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee could not say why the oxygen system for the two men in the
HumVee malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the unidentified men who died worked for Black
Dog Divers of New Hampshire, and the other was employed by Norwesco
Marine of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The accident is under investigation by the MWRA and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are the fourth and fifth fatalities in the last 10
years on the outfall pipe project, a key element of the Boston
Harbor Cleanup. The tunnel is scheduled to begin sending treated
water from the Deer Island sewage treatment plant into
Massachusetts Bay by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible story.'' said Doug MacDonald, MWRA
director. ``We're all in a state of shock here. It is really
devastating for everyone conected with this project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost two workers today and we still have a challenge
of finishing this project.'' he said. ``But people do fly in
airplanes again and we will fly again too.'
</P>
<P>
   The MWRA recently received tentative federal approval to begin
using the 9.5 mile outfall pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Crews have been at work for several days at the end of the pipe
preparing to fill the tunnel with water and open valves that will
allow treated sewage to rise up from the tunnel through diffusers
to the ocean floor and mix with waters in Massachusetts Bay.
</P>
<P>
   All five workers in the tunnel Wednesday were getting a mixture
of oxygen and nitrogen through face masks from tanks on the HumVee.
The two workers in the HumVee were assigned to monitor their three
co-workers' oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
   The three men out of the HumVee worked 2,000 feet away and had a
backup supply of oxygen stored on their hips, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The three workers who survived worked in a section of the tunnel
that is only 12 feet in diameter, They were removing caps that cut
off diffusers from Massachusetts Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the HumVee, the two workers were equipped with spare air
tanks as well as liquid oxygen. Lee said the HumVee has three
backup oxygen sources in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatality on the project happened in 1995 when engineer
Richard White was crushed to death in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1992, Charles Spears, 47, a drill operator, died
from injuries suffered when he was thrown from a drilling platform.
Michael Lee, 39, of Quincy was killed two weeks later when a crane
dropped a prefabricated concrete section on him.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been also been plagued by floods and fires in
its 13-year history.

MILLER LOOKS AHEAD AS ORIOLES FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Like most of us, Orioles manager Ray Miller enjoys
talking about the good old days. Good times when Brooks and Frank
Robinson were household names. Exciting times when a fiesty little
man named Earl Weaver stood 10 feet tall and helped make Memorial
Stadium a regular Field of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Miller can recall watching from afar in 1971 as a minor league
hopeful in Rochester, N.Y. He never made it to the Show as a
player, but in 1978, Miller came out of the Orioles farm system as
a pitching coach. He had eight good years in Baltimore _ five under
Weaver's wing _ and picked up two World Series rings. From there he
managed two years with the Minnesota Twins and followed with 10
years as pitching coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Now he's back
in Baltimore as manager _ and waiting for those good times to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter came in and said to me, `I could tell you what Earl
Weaver would have done with this club,' '' Miller said when asked
to compare his team with the Orioles of the 1970s. ``I told him
don't tell me what Earl would have done. Weaver never had a
four-year middle reliever making $4 million or a six-year right
fielder making $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl went away for a year and the salaries doubled. He came
back and said to me one day at home plate, `What happened? What has
happened to the game?' I could ask the same question, but I won't.
I told the club at the All-Star break if we could pick up one game
a week, we'd be in good shape. We play Boston and New York at the
end. Something could happen. But we have to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, a preseason favorite in many polls, limped into
town for Wednesday night's opener of a two-game series at Fenway
Park with a 40-53 record, some 15 1/2 games behind the Yankees and
11 1/2 behind the Red Sox in the wild-card race. But there is still
time, Miller says. And in that regard, he sounds like Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we capable?,'' he said. ``Yes. But we have to play good
and Boston has got to come back and Toronto has to cool off. There
are a lot of clubs ahead of us and we have to take care of our own
business. Our club has played reasonably well for quite awhile. But
the bullpen has had problems. Hopefully, they'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former pitching coach, Miller does not hesitate to place
blame with the faulty relievers. The bullpen has 20 blown saves in
34 chances. Mike Timlin, obtained from Seattle and signed to a
three-year contract to be Baltimore's closer, is the aforementioned
middle reliever. He has eight blown saves in 17 chances and hadn't
pitched since the All-Star break entering Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 79-83 season, the Orioles retooled, and except for
injured second baseman Delino DeShields, much of the club put
together by general manager Frank Wren is intact.
</P>
<P>
   That includes $65 million baby Albert Belle, a free agent
signing who came in hitting .275 with 20 home runs and 59 runs
batted in. Considering what he is making _ and Baltimore's dreadful
start, that's a bad year. So bad Belle reportedly has voided the
no-trade clause in his five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard that one,'' said Miller. ``I know Albert is
not at the pace that he was last year. But still he's going to
drive in 100 runs. Obviously, he's hasn't gotten as hot as he has
gotten the last several years. But he's been hitting pretty good
the last month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a top player and getting top billing, it comes
back on you. When the bullpen isn't doing the job, the pitching
isn't doing the job and you're losing games. That's also true if
you leave a lot of men on base. The other night he (Belle) left six
on base.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Orioles have had three six-game losing streaks and
a 10-game losing streak. But in the club's 40 victories, the team
ERA is 2.86.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the way our club has played all year,'' said
Miller. ``We had pitching problems the first month. Other than Mike
Mussina, nobody was pitching well. In the last 40 games, our
starters are second in all of baseball. As it is, we score more
runs than the Yankees. We're second in hitting and first in
defense. That's pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bullpen does the job we've got a chance. But we've had
20 blown saves. Cut that to a normal amount, four or five, and
we've got 15 in the win column. We can't continue to do that. We
were 1-11 in games against Toronto and we had the lead in nine of
them. But then, they've been kicking everybody's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you say about the Orioles, it all gets back to
Belle. And you can't ask him about the key to the second half
because he's not talking. But Belle can make a statement with his
bat in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Albert is the guy who's taking the biggest beating
because he's got a big contract and still leaves men on base,''
said Miller. ``But we're a team. You've got B.J. Surhoff hitting
right in front of him leading the league in total bases and hits.
Belle and Brady Anderson are 2-3 in walks. Harold Baines has 60
RBIs in 200 at-bats hitting behind him. If Belle was hitting 20
points higher, we'd be hitting .305. So whatever he does has an
obvious effect.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller said he thinks help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wren is doing a heck of a job because he's the first GM to
come in that hasn't traded away all of our prospects,'' he said.
``We had eight prospects last year and they're still here. We had
eight first-round draft choices this year. We're stockpiling
pitching and everyday players. We want to get the organization back
to where it was. Since Eddie Murray and Cal Ripken came up, we
haven't had an impact player to come out of the organization.
That's over 20 years.''

 &HT;    Halt in F-22 production funds reflects dispute between House,
Pentagon
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As members of Congress drifted back to the Capitol
last week after the Fourth of July recess, Rep. Jerry Lewis
(R-Calif.) summoned Georgia Republicans to an evening meeting to
deliver some bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis told the Georgians that his defense appropriations
subcommittee had just voted unanimously to eliminate $1.8 billion
in production funding for the F-22 Raptor manufactured by Lockheed
Martin in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the six F-22 fighter jets the Pentagon wanted, the
House panel decided to fund neglected maintenance operations, beef
up incentive programs to attract new pilots and replenish the
nation's existing fleet of F-15s and F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   To soften the blow to Georgia, Lewis said the committee would
spend $576.3 million on eight new KC-130s, a refueling tanker also
built by Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) was stunned. No one, not even the
Pentagon, had an inkling that the cut was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious it had not occurred overnight,'' Chambliss
said. ``I said to him, 'If you've been thinking about this, why
haven't you talked about it to anybody else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although plans to eliminate F-22 funding had begun to
crystallize two months earlier, the story of how the Air Force's
marquee weapons program suddenly lost key support in the House was
actually years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   It involves a long-simmering dispute between House members and
the Pentagon over buying costly new technology at the expense of
nuts-and-bolts priorities such as the health and living standards
of enlistees. For the first time, the House moneymen are also
feeling the effects of the 1997 balanced budget agreement, which
enacted stringent spending caps on defense and all the other
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22's turn of fate is also a story about the political
muscle a state can wield _ and then lose _ when influential members
such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Sam Nunn retire from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed also helped make the F-22 a prime target for the budget
ax. Since the program was first promoted in the 1980s, the
estimated cost of delivering each plane has skyrocketed from $35
million to more than $185 million.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the F-22 program is now estimated at around
$62 billion _ a huge price tag even by Washington standards _ and
Lockheed and the Air Force have completed only a fraction of the
required testing on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   No one is yet predicting that the F-22 will simply die after
more than 15 years of congressional support and nearly $20 billion
in start-up costs. But there is also widespread agreement that the
program faces the most serious threat in its long, tortured
history.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected today to vote on whether to approve the
overall $266.1 billion defense appropriations bill without the F-22
funding.
</P>
<P>
   At a new conference Wednesday, President Clinton said it would
be a ``mistake'' to abandon the F-22 and said he will fight for it.
</P>
<P>
   But as a measure of how seriously support for the program has
eroded on Capitol Hill, Georgia lawmakers will not even risk a vote
on the House floor on restoring the funds for fear that they would
lose. Such a loss would weaken their bargaining position when the
defense bill goes into conference committee with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense is that we want to make our case on the House
floor,'' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.). ``But you don't want to
risk a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, House members have been staring in the
face of a budget train wreck involving three expensive warplanes
ordered up by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22, a super-stealth plane designed to replace the F-15, is
the oldest plane in development, having won initial congressional
backing in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is also funding development and production of the
F/A-18E/F ``Super Hornet,'' a strike fighter to be used by the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A third tactical warplane, the Joint Strike Fighter, is in the
earliest stages of development, but holds the promise of being the
military's most versatile and affordable plane.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Joint Strike Fighter program is to produce a
common fuselage and engine that could be modified by the Air Force,
Navy and Marine Corps to suit their individual missions. The Navy
version of the JSF would be configured to take off and land from
aircraft carriers, while the Air Force could configure it for
air-to-ground combat, ultimately replacing the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of developing and producing the Super Hornet, the F-22
and the Joint Strike Fighter, however, is a staggering $340
billion, Lewis estimates. The budget demands of the F-22 alone
total $23 billion over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way you can fund all three programs in the out
years,'' said Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), the ranking Democrat on the
defense appropriations subcommittee. ``The money just isn't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost worries over the three tactical weapons programs have been
compounded by profound disagreement between the House budget
writers and the Pentagon. House members have been insisting for
years that the Pentagon has ignored warning signals that impact the
military's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are particularly acute in the Air Force. For the
first time since 1979, the Air Force will miss recruiting goals, by
some 2,600 enlistees. The force has a shortage of 1,100 pilots that
is expected to grow to 2,000 over the next three years. The
equipment shortages and operations problems have been exacerbated
by costly engagements in Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo. The price tag for
the five-year involvement in Bosnia is already $14 billion. To make
up these shortfalls, the Pentagon has dipped into research and
development funds from other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bill Clinton's peace dividend,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon
(R-Pa.), chairman of the armed services research and development
subcommittee. Weldon supports cutting the F-22 funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 33 deployments in eight years at a cost of $22
billion. Let him go down to see those union workers in Marietta and
explain that,'' Weldon said of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the House and the administration over defense
priorities have been building for years. The decision to cut the
F-22 funding now, however, was set in motion by Gingrich's decision
to resign after the Republicans' disappointing showing in midterm
elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 lost not only its most powerful backer in the House,
but Gingrich's departure also brought Lewis to the helm of the
defense subcommittee as Rep. Bob Young (R-Fla.) moved up to become
Appropriations Committee chairman. Lewis had been concerned for
some time over the difficulty in funding the three lines of
tactical fighters requested by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said the committee never would have been able to cut F-22
funding when Gingrich was speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have vetoed it,'' Murtha said. ``He would have given
his priorities and his priorities would have been Georgia.''

EDITORIAL: A FOOLISH TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 22: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders struggled mightily Wednesday to muster
enough votes in their own caucus to pass a huge and irresponsible
tax cut. That so many moderate Republicans were reluctant to
embrace the cause was a good indication that there is little public
demand for such a bill. Only the true believers in the tax-cutting
gospel of the Reagan years would think a tax break of this size
would be sound policy and smart politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cut taxes over the next decade by $792 billion,
but even that figure considerably understates the cost. That is
because some of the biggest cuts are delayed until 2008 or 2009.
The Treasury Department estimates the cost during the following 10
years could be more than $3 trillion. The biggest damage to federal
revenues would come just as the baby boomers begin to retire,
driving up the costs of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   To make the numbers work, the House Republicans are using rosy
forecasts of a continued strong economy and unrealistic assumptions
about the level of spending cuts that they are likely to make. We
hope the economic predictions prove accurate, but there is a good
chance they will not. A prudent tax bill would leave a margin of
error, knowing that further cuts could be passed in the future if
needed. One reason for not adopting that strategy is that it would
require choosing from among the many special-interest corporate tax
breaks now in the bill _ each of which is backed by lobbyists with
access to campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In scaling back the House bill from the previous level of $864
billion, the Republican leadership generally left those provisions
intact, while stretching out tax cuts that would affect individual
taxpayers, most of which go to the wealthiest 10 percent of
taxpayers. Much of the savings for middle-income taxpayers would
probably vanish, since the Republican leadership made them
contingent on unrealistic budget surplus forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they rounded up votes Wednesday, the Republican
leadership knew that the bill had no chance of becoming law. At his
news conference Wednesday, President Clinton reaffirmed his threat
to veto the bill. If they think courting such a veto is good
politics, the Republicans have forgotten Clinton's skill at turning
such debates into discussions about the threat to Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The proper course continues to be a delay in action on taxes
until Congress has acted on spending bills. Then a much smaller tax
cut might be considered, but only after Congress and the president
have faced up to the hard decisions on Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The American public knows the economy is good, and is not eager
for tax cuts. But many people are concerned about their retirement
security. Taking care of those issues and making sure the budget
remains balanced before turning to tax cuts would be both good
policy and good politics.

   He remains at home in Salt Lake City, where he'll probably stay
if the gap can't be closed between the signing bonus Anderson is
seeking and what the Falcons are offering in contract extension
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Anderson playing out the final year of his
contract and angling for unrestricted free agency next winter is
not viable, agent Jim Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't do that, not with the Falcons in a position to put
the `franchise tag' on Jamal next year,'' Sims said. ``We'll just
end up right back in this same spot.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of possible outcomes here.
</P>
<P>
   _ An agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anderson could play out the contract, earning $1.6 million in
base salary plus about $1 million in incentives achieved last year,
and then either become an unrestricted free agent and sign a new
contract with any team, or end up as the Falcons' franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   _ He could play, and get an extension during the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anderson could sit out the season, and not get franchised,
while saddling the Falcons with a salary cap charge this season of
$3.6 million despite having no player to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ He could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he knew that the Falcons could still retain the
rights to him in 2000 if he sits out this season, Anderson said,
``I'm not aware of that. I'm not prepared to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson then said he would return a call after consulting Sims,
but did not. He could not be reached later.
</P>
<P>
   As a franchise player, he would earn the average of the NFL's
five highest-paid backs, probably a little less than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are more or less settled on a five- or six-year
extension, averaging $5.2 million to $5.6 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson wants about $8 million up front, down from $10
million. He also wants about $13 million guaranteed (including the
signing bonus) over the first three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are offering a signing bonus of about $6 million,
and don't want to guarantee anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The front office contends multiple player contracts with big
signing bonuses impact the salary cap exponentially in the future.
Quarterback Chris Chandler got a $6 million signing bonus last year
when he signed an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close to a point where I don't see us moving (off the
latest offer),'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I didn't say we wouldn't
move, but we're close (to that).
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we won't continue to try to get the thing
done during the season, but you'd like to get the thing resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Harold Richardson spoke with Sims on Wednesday,
but Sims said nothing was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said trade rumors are preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also said he has no intention of waiving Anderson, or
Gene Williams, the starting right guard who also is holding out for
an extension.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Williams would prefer to be cut so the
Cleveland, Ohio, resident could sign with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't even thinking of trading anybody,'' Reeves said.
``And ... we're not going to waive either one of them. We're not
going to ... make it easier for (a player) to get what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sims said the recent signing bonuses received this
week by San Francisco wide receiver Terrell Owens ($7.5 million),
and Detroit receiver Herman Moore (more than $8million) prove his
asking price is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been pretty much right on with regards to the
signing bonus,'' Sims said. It was unclear Wednesday if the Falcons
have the right to require Anderson to show up or risk being put on
a retired list. Team officials, though, said that even if that
option exists, it almost certainly wouldn't be exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't come to that because (Anderson) has got a
contract I hope he's going to honor it,'' Reeves said. ``It's time
to make a decision. If you don't like (the latest offer), play and
take the chance on being a free agent or getting what franchise
players get.

EDITORIAL: THREE PEOPLE, DYING YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 22: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the tortuous retrieval of a small airplane and its
passengers from the ocean floor, the nation can begin formal
mourning over the deaths of three promising citizens, while
families and friends grieve their more personal and intimate loss.
The private memorials Friday in New York City and Saturday in
Connecticut will not be based on one family's mythical place in our
public psyche or on the celebrity of the victims or the drama of
their last helpless moments, but on the untimely, incurable loss.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton artfully balanced the public and private
aspects of the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy and Lauren Bessette at his press conference Wednesday. Any
comments on recovery of the bodies should come from the Coast Guard
or the families, he said. But he correctly defended the decision to
expend extra resources in the search for three private citizens
engaged in private travel as ``the right thing to do under the
circumstances.'' In most cases, of course, government services
should be offered according to strictly uniform rules. But the
chief executive also has the right to respond in a broad, humane
way to the public mood, as Clinton properly did in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited ``the role of the Kennedy family in our
national lives.'' He did not need to mention that in an era of
conspiracy addicts, the country did not need to extend the aura of
uncertainty that still surrounds President Kennedy's own death to
that of his son.
</P>
<P>
   When Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard told the president
that the plane could be recovered with some extra time and effort,
Clinton supported him. Now the process of explanation and forensics
will bring some small comfort to reasonable minds. There was by all
available early signs nothing sinister at work in this accident,
just that mundane blend of bad luck and error from which neither
fame nor wealth nor lineage nor youth nor beauty can protect any
one of us.

REPORTS ON KENNEDY `DREAM HOME' ARE FALSE

<P>
   NEW CANAAN, Conn. _ A local architect and town building
department officials said there was no truth to news reports that
John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, were
building a sprawling three-story ``dream home'' in this affluent
Connecticut suburb near the New York state border.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kaali-Nagy, an architect and developer who has designed
large houses along the Fairfield County gold coast in Connecticut,
said Wednesday: ``I have absolutely no idea how these rumors got
started. All I know is, I turned on the television and saw this
very erroneous report.'' He added that he was building the house in
question for himself and his wife, Karen.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Appleby, news director at News 12 Connecticut, the Norwalk
cable station that broke the story, now says of the broadcast: ``It
was done on the weekend, and we didn't have enough information. The
word was that everybody in town was talking about this, very
wealthy people were talking. Our reporter made the leap of faith.
I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Daley, executive vice president of Country Living
Associates, a real estate agency, said, ``I think these wild rumors
got started because the Bessette family just moved out of town to a
home in Old Greenwich a few months ago and someone might have
spotted John Kennedy Jr. and his wife here during that time and
jumped to the conclusion they were buying a home here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her firm had handled the sale of the Bessettes' home
when they moved out of New Canaan.

KINGS SIGN FOUR PLAYERS FOR DEPTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kings signed four players Wednesday, adding depth and a
possible replacement for enforcer Matt Johnson, who was lost to
Atlanta in last month's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by the Kings were 32-year-old tough guy Bill Huard;
center Len Barrie, 30; goalie Mike O'Neill, 31; and right wing Brad
Chartrand, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Huard played three games last season with Edmonton and the
balance of the season with the IHL champion Houston Aeros, whose
coach was Dave Tippett, now a Kings assistant coach. In 38 games in
Houston, Huard had 14 points and 201 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie has spent the past two seasons in Germany. Previously, he
has starred at the IHL level, and has 18 points in 64 NHL games
with Philadelphia, Florida and Pittsburgh. If Barrie doesn't make
the Kings, he probably will be assigned to the Long Beach Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who spent the 1996-97 season with the Ice Dogs, played
in Austria last season and could return to Long Beach this year,
though it also is possible he will be assigned to the Kings'
American Hockey League affiliate in Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand had 30 points in 64 games with the AHL's St. John's
Maple Leafs last season, and played for two seasons for Kings coach
Andy Murray with the Canadian national team.

 &HT;    Sign of the times
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For decades Bill Russell would sign nothing at any
price. It was, as was everything with Russell, a matter of
conscience. In his 1979 book ``Second Wind,'' he expounded on his
stance over the course of five pages in a chapter titled
``Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many fundamentally nice people who ask for
autographs and want little more than a chance to express kindness
toward me,'' Russell wrote, ``but in order to accept their kindness
I would have to increase the risk of growing dependent on it. I'd
also have to expose myself to people who dislike me, and to violate
my belief that there should be no glories or obligations imposed on
people other than by their own choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Agree or not, nobody could read those words and feel that their
author was anything less than a man of deep and enduring principle.
All of which makes these next words even sadder:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell will be signing basketballs for $350 Friday and
Saturday. For $475 he'll sign a jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing for the crass hustler Pete Rose to peddle his
signature. Of him, we expected no more. But for the elegant Russell
to dip into the same fetid swamp is one more indication that this
mania for Collecting Stuff has turned malignant. Even the most
principled athlete of the era is cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be, we'd go to a game, buy a program and maybe, if we
were unbelievably lucky, get somebody famous to sign it. We'd take
our booty home, store it in a footlocker, haul it out some winter
day and be warmed by the memory. Today we look upon autographs and
their kin not as keepsakes to admire but as investments to
appreciate. A footlocker can't be trusted to hold such precious
commodities; only a triple-locked safety-deposit box will do.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sports Collectors Convention opens today at the
Georgia World Congress Center. There you can pay $10 to walk in the
door, pay $20 to have Ron Guidry autograph your baseball, pay $20
extra if you want it signed ``Louisiana Lightning.'' (Lots more
letters, y'know?) For $130 Wilt Chamberlain will sign a basketball;
for $30 more he'll add ``Wilt the Stilt.'' This is what has become
of our little world: Nicknames carry a surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cepeda will be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame on
Sunday. There was a time when such honors were considered
priceless. No longer. For signing something ``Hall of Fame '99,''
Cepeda will get an extra $10 today and Friday. Steve Carlton, who
couldn't be troubled to address his fans via the media while
playing, will gladly scribble his name for $25 a pop today.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is mere prelude. The main event comes Saturday,
when signing at one table you'll have Bill Russell, famous for
winning 11 NBA titles, while at another will be Pamela Anderson,
famous for... well, you know. And then, when you've secured both
prized signatures _ Anderson's goes for $100; it's $150 to have a
picture taken _ you can complete your portfolio of memorabilia by
paying $15 for the autograph of the man who needs no introduction,
the man whose claim to fame is that he does introductions:
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Buffer!

 &HT;    Texas prison chief in line for $23,000 raise
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when the Texas prison system is having
trouble hiring guards because the pay is too low, prison system
Chief Wayne Scott is line to get a $23,000 a year raise, which is
$5,300 higher than the starting salary for a prison guard.
</P>
<P>
   If approved as expected, the pay raise will leave Scott with one
of the biggest pay raises awarded to state agency chiefs this year,
state budget records indicated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday meeting in San Antonio, the Texas Board of Criminal
Justice is expected to approve the nearly 20 percent raise for
Scott, who has headed the 145,000-convict, 45,000-employee
corrections system for 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves a raise and is long overdue for one, and we're
extremely pleased with the job he has done,'' board Chairman Allan
Polunsky said Wednesday. ``He has had a number of other job
opportunities for three or four times his current salary. It's time
we increased his pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, prison officials lamented a growing problem
in hiring guards, citing the $17,700-a-year starting pay as one
reason for their more than 1,000 job openings statewide _ 5 percent
of the authorized positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are simply leaving for other jobs that pay more,'' Gary
Johnson, prisons director for the agency, said in explaining the
attrition rate that has left several prisons understaffed, although
adequate security levels are being maintained through overtime and
parttime replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other state employees, the 23,755 guards at the 112
prisons and state-run lockups received a $100-a-month pay increase
from the Legislature this year _ a figure Polunsky acknowledged was
too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are upset that our correctional officers did not receive a
larger raise, and I can understand the frustration on their part in
relation to this increase (for Scott),'' Polunsky said. ``But I
don't think that the increase the Legislature has set for employees
should have a bearing on the salary of the executive director.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Legislature suggested the salary increase for
Scott, along with raises it recommended for many other agency
heads.
</P>
<P>
   In the new state budget that takes effect Sept. 1, legislative
budget-writers studied the compensation of agency executive
directors and recommended increases for Scott and others. Each must
be approved by the governing board of the agency and cannot exceed
a ``cap'' written into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   That budget allows Scott to be paid up to $150,000, and Polunsky
said that is the amount he will recommend for approval by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the criminal justice agency, Scott oversees a $2
billion a year budget, 40,000 employees and 145,000 convicts _ the
largest state agency in terms of employees, officials said.

PENTAGON SPENT MONEY THAT WAS NEVER APPROPRIATED, CONGRESS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 9th graf to clarify.)  (See also PENTAGON-CONGRESS) 
(lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress says in a new report that the Pentagon
defied the law and the Constitution by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars on military projects lawmakers never approved,
including a super-secret Air Force program. The Pentagon
acknowledged some of the accusations Wednesday night, saying that
honest mistakes had led to its failure to notify Congress about the
way it was spending money.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee, expressing anger and
astonishment in a report accompanying this year's military spending
bill, which is scheduled to be debated by the House on Thursday,
said the practice had eroded trust between the nation's lawmakers
and military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the committee's defense
spending panel, said the Pentagon's actions showed its belief
``that it can even move money to a program Congress has closed
down, maybe presuming, `Oh, well, nobody will know,''' he said.
``What do we have to do to make them understand what we mean when
we say no?''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Wednesday night that
failures to notify Congress about the military's juggling of
appropriated funds had taken place. ``We work very hard to respond
to the directives Congress gives us,'' he said. ``Do we get it
right 100 percent of the time? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Air Force wrongfully started and
financed a highly classified, still-secret project, known as a
``black program,'' without informing Congress last year. The
committee said that act was illegal. It also raises questions about
civilian control of black programs, whose costs and nature are the
most highly classified secrets in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 313-page report says the Air Force financed an
$800 million military communications satellite without lawful
authority, and illegally diverted hundreds of millions of dollars
to update its C-5 transport plane. It also says the Pentagon spent
millions on a ``Star Wars'' missile defense program previously
canceled by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited three other examples involving military trucks,
missiles and tanks. It did not provide specific cost figures, but
committee staff members said these practices were a chronic and
worsening problem adding up to billions spent improperly and
illegally over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the specific charges other than the Air Force black
program, Bacon said the military had on occasion failed to notify
lawmakers about the way it spent money on these and other military
projects. But he said these were honest errors, not open defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the military satellite, Bacon said there were
legitimate disputes over whether caches of research money should be
segregated from money to the satellite. He said the several hundred
million dollars transferred to the C-5 program involved a
misunderstanding between the Pentagon and Congress. With the ``Star
Wars'' program, he said, there was a controversy over whether the
program had been completely canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The law and Pentagon procedures allow military officials to
shift funds from one account to another, but not without telling
Congress. They cannot finance programs Congress never approved, or
use money for a purpose lawmakers never intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution is pretty clear on this,'' Lewis said. It
says: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in
consequence of appropriations made by law.'' That means the
Pentagon cannot spend money unless Congress authorizes and
appropriates it for specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress struggles every year over the military's budget and the
costs of weaponry. But the Pentagon now consumes half the available
funds in the federal budget, and some senior Republican lawmakers,
mindful that their party is cutting billions from domestic
programs, are trying to be more vigilant about military spending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon spending battle has been joined this year in the
House on two fronts: the accountability of Pentagon officials and
the costs of weapons, including the $70 billion F-22 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has withheld $1.8 billion sought to produce the
first six F-22s, which are supposed to be the flagship of the 21st
century Air Force, producing howls of protest from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can fund the F-22,'' President Clinton said Wednesday. ``It
would be a mistake to abandon the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's defense bill finances the first six F-22s. But Sen.
John Warner, R-Va, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
told Defense Secretary William Cohen this week that ``we can't be
giving you a blank check to buy aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee's report noted that the Air
Force was trying to write its own checks for the F-22. It said the
Air Force requested hundreds of millions of dollars that were
supposed to help buy the first F-22s, but Air Force officials, ``in
violation of specific congressional direction,'' earmarked the
money for additional research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force issued a statement saying it ``had not misled
Congress or misused appropriated funds.'' It called the committee's
report a product of ``misunderstanding or misinterpretation,'' and
said it would ``work with Congress to clear this up.''
</P>
<P>
   That may take some doing. The committee called the Air Force's
``lack of accountability astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Its report said the Air Force broke the law by starting a new
program to update electronics and software on the C-5 transport
plane. This program, ``which the Congress never formally
approved,'' cost several hundred million dollars. The money was
obtained ``by diverting funds specifically provided by the Congress
for another program,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the Air Force has been taking money out of
research funds to help finance a new $800 million Milstar military
communications satellite. One of the satellites was lost in space
this spring, but because appropriated money was diverted, the Air
Force cannot say how much a replacement will cost taxpayers, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is little short of amazed,'' the report said in
describing how Pentagon and missile-defense officials illegally
financed a ``Star Wars'' system known as the Medium Altitude Air
Defense program, or Meads.
</P>
<P>
   Meads has cost $100 million but produced nothing, the committee
said. It was canceled last year by Congress. But it received at
least $2 million diverted by Pentagon and missile-defense officials
from another missile-defense program to help keep it alive, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, Bacon said, honest mistakes and
misunderstandings had taken place, not deliberate violations of
law.

EDITORIAL: THE RIGHT LEADER FOR CUNY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, July 22: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political infighting and chaotic management have made the last
few years especially damaging for the City University of New York,
driving off first-rate talent and causing potential replacements to
rule out CUNY. After failing for nearly two years to find a
permanent chancellor, the Board of Trustees has settled on an
excellent candidate, Dr. Matthew Goldstein, the president of
Adelphi University and a former head of Baruch College.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein has a strong record as a scholar, administrator,
fund-raiser and, most important, as an educational reformer. But
his talents will come to nothing unless the trustees suppress the
urge to micromanage, and the Giuliani and Pataki administrations
throw their support behind measures that strengthen and expand
public higher education instead of those that weaken it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is known primarily for his work at CUNY's Baruch
College, where he served as president from 1991 to 1998. He focused
Baruch on business education, made it one of the most selective in
the system and cut remedial courses, replacing them with a tutoring
system and other academic supports. Goldstein was a logical
candidate for the chancellorship two years ago, but the trustees
were paralyzed at that time. He went instead to Adelphi University
on Long Island, which had just endured the trauma of having most of
its trustees dismissed for mismanagement. He steadied the school
and helped it attract one of its largest entering classes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein has his work cut out at CUNY, where he must rebuild a
demoralized, decimated faculty and work with Gov. George Pataki to
broaden opportunities for the state's poorest students. While
Pataki was wooing him to CUNY the state legislature was beating
back a Pataki plan that would have cut tuition aide to students who
take less than a full load of courses, often because they have to
work. This bill would have affected about 45 percent of CUNY's
student body, causing some to abandon the dream of a college
degree.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY has historically been an engine of upward mobility for New
York's poor. If Goldstein is to restore and enhance that legacy, he
will require help from Albany.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since two Seattle teen-agers started a telephone
message service in 1907 that grew to become United Parcel Service
of America Inc., the company, now the world's largest package
delivery service, has been a rarity in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by its employees and managers, it is a company where many
people spend their entire working lives. The company's top 15
executives all began their careers sorting packages. And even
odder, for 92 years UPS has resisted the persistent entreaties of
investment bankers and remained private.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, in the latest sign that the siren song of Wall
Street is too hard to resist in the age of instant riches and the
Internet, UPS announced plans to sell 10 percent of itself to the
public later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering will likely be one of the biggest in history,
raising between $3 billion and $5 billion. And in today's
overheated stock market, UPS analysts believe UPS shares will soar
because of the company's role as prime deliverer of goods bought on
the Internet, creating a windfall for tens of thousands of its
managers, employees and retirees. That means that the local UPS
deliveryman in his chocolate brown uniform and matching truck could
see his net worth soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years that's the thing everybody has been hoping for,''
said Jason Vines, a driver who was picking up packages Wednesday in
Manhattan and received the news from the company via its cellular
network. ``Now its going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, UPS' chairman and chief executive, said that the
company, which estimates that it carries 6 percent of the nation's
gross domestic product, had taken care to structure the deal so
that it would preserve the company's unique culture. Even though 10
percent of the company will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, 99 percent of the voting rights will remain with the
current employees and managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In designing our plan,'' he said, ``we've insured that this
fundamental element of our success will continue as an essential
part of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   But once its stock begins trading, UPS, which is based in
Atlanta, will come under the kinds of pressure for short-term
profits felt by other large corporations. Whereas in the past it
could invest in new technology or expansion in Europe without
worrying about the effect on its stock price, that luxury might now
be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an internally fed culture with an unusual sense of
purpose,'' said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the nonprofit
Chief Executive Leadership Institute in Atlanta, who worked as a
consultant to UPS for 12 years. ``There is a hometown flavor to
them. It is very meritocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula has been a success. UPS earned a profit of $1.7
billion last year on sales of $24.8 billion, making it larger and
more profitable than its rival, Federal Express. Its 330,000
employees delivered more than 3 billion packages to 1.6 million
customers in more than 200 countries. UPS trucks ply routes in
virtually every corner of the world, making it one of the most
recognizable brands.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that UPS needed to issue stock to the public in order
to maintain its competitiveness against rivals like FDX Corp.,
which owns Federal Express; DHL, and a number of increasingly
aggressive foreign postal services that are also planning to issue
stock soon.
</P>
<P>
   As the package delivery service has become global in recent
years, UPS has expanded into Europe, Asia and Latin America. It
also has moved aggressively into the fast-growing logistics
business, taking charge of the delivery of all parts and components
for large manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Though UPS has more than $3 billion in cash and can borrow
billions more, it does not have publicly traded stock to use as a
currency to buy other companies. ``We think we need this
flexibility to provide ourselves with another tool should we decide
to do the kind of strategic acquisitions we are talking about,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts also said that it was getting harder and harder for
UPS to continue to turn its back on the soaring values investors
are giving an Internet-related company. Last year, FDX shares
soared 47 percent after investors identified it as a so-called
Internet play.
</P>
<P>
   Always proud, UPS executives think they have an even better
story to tell. They point to a recent report by Zona Research of
San Francisco that concluded that UPS delivers 55 percent of all
the goods purchased on the Internet. While $80 billion worth of
merchandise was bought online last year, the figure is estimated to
balloon to $3.2 trillion by 2003, according to Forrester Research
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of talk should play well to investors when UPS shares
begin trading later this year. ``Their timing is excellent,'' said
Edward Wolfe, an air freight and logistics analyst at Deutsche Banc
Alex.Brown in New York. ``It is going to be perceived very well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also a strong reservoir of demand for UPS stock from
employees and their families and friends. Under its current
structure, the company issues stock to managers as part of their
annual compensation and allows employees to set aside a portion of
their paycheck to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board sets the price of the stock each quarter
based on the company's performance and future prospects. But it
retains the right to buy back the shares when employees retire so
that it can reissue them to others.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 50 years, the value of the stock has risen every
quarter except for one, in 1997, when it fell 25 cents after the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 202,000
UPS workers, struck the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS family members and friends that have seen the performance
of UPS stock have always wished they could buy some,'' Sonnenfeld
said. UPS employees also ``hated to have to sell their stock back
to the company,'' he added. ``They didn't want to let stock go but
management needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   But employees will be trading the stability of a stock that may
not have risen as fast as those of publicly traded companies but
also did not decline during bad times either. In exchange, they
will have shares that will be subject to the wild swings of the
overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's with the company, I always felt it would be more
safe and secure,'' said Bill, a customer service representative and
35-year UPS employee in New York who declined to give his last
name. ``When it doubles in value, it is more risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, UPS will create two types of stock: A shares
held by insiders and B shares held by the public. Each A share
would have 10 votes compared to one for every B share. But instead
of having to sell the shares to the company, holders of A shares
can convert them to B shares and sell them on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who holds 207,000 shares, said UPS plans to offer 10
percent of the company to the public. Today its internal stock is
priced at $47 a share, giving the company a value of about $26
billion. But most analysts believe that that figure is extremely
conservative, given the valuations given to FDX and others. Some
said it could go as high as $50 billion, which would mean that the
company would raise $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   UPS said that it does not need the cash and that it will use it
to buy shares from employees who wish to sell. But none of the UPS
employees interviewed Wednesday said that they would sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a pot of gold for when I retire,'' said David
Arroyo, 32, a driver who has worked at UPS for nine years and holds
500 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Uriguen, who drives a tractor trailer at UPS and holds
1,500 shares after 12 years, said he also was reluctant to sell
out. ``All these companies have gone up two and three times and had
stock splits and they aren't even making any money,'' he said,
referring to Internet stocks. ``UPS is a company that always turns
a profit and only has room to grow.''

EDITORIAL: LESSONS OF THE F-22 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, July 22: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives should follow the lead of its
appropriations committee and deny the Air Force money for buying
the costly and unnecessary F-22 fighter. The F-22, also opposed by
Speaker Dennis Hastert and the minority leader, Richard Gephardt,
had been scheduled to begin production next year at an average cost
of $200 million per plane. The Senate has already approved buying
six F-22s. But if the House stands firm in a vote expected
Thursday, only research money will be available next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for Congress to kill a major new weapons program
after billions of dollars have already been spent on development
costs. But it makes no sense for the Pentagon to proceed with three
separate advanced fighter programs when no other country has a
chance of threatening America's air superiority in the foreseeable
future. America's current top fighter, the Air Force's F-15,
remains a highly effective warplane. Two successors now under
development, the Joint Strike Fighter and an updated version of the
Navy's F-18, should prove more than adequate to future needs.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing all three fighter programs would cost $350 billion
over the next two decades. Eliminating the F-22, produced by
Lockheed Martin, could save about $50 billion. Costly and
duplicative weapons programs, fueled by intra-service rivalries,
distort the defense budget and American military capabilities. The
Joint Strike Fighter, designed for use by the Air Force, Navy and
Marines, represents a more rational approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon needs to reduce wasteful duplication and shift
purchasing away from modernizing the Cold War arsenal toward
meeting the very different military needs of the 21st century. It
should spend less of its budget on short-range fighters like the
F-22 and other dubious and expensive projects like the $37 billion
Comanche helicopter program, leaving more for readiness, mobility,
pay and pensions. It needs to equip itself for peacekeeping
operations and to counter biological and chemical weapons and
international terrorism, missions it is much more likely to face
than aerial dogfights against a technologically advanced foe.
Fighter planes still have a role to play in 21st-century warfare.
But they should not consume a disproportionate share of the Air
Force budget.

<P>
   MENEMSHA, Mass. _ With an honor guard of family members at hand
to bring them home, the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette were recovered Wednesday from
their wrecked plane on the rippled sand of the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's family requested a burial at sea, and the Pentagon
granted that request. The Navy destroyer USS Briscoe was headed
toward Cape Cod to participate in a mariner's funeral, tentatively
scheduled for Thursday morning, pending completion of the autopsy,
government officials said. Burial plans for the Bessette sisters
were not announced.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries and the sight of US Senator Edward M. Kennedy
leading his two sons on a sad, seafaring mission brought an
emotional end to what began Saturday as a hopeful effort to find
survivors. By Sunday night it had turned into a sober search for
the remains of a celebrated young man with a unique pedigree, his
glamorous wife, and her investment banker sister.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies were found together in the twisted ruins of the
Piper Saratoga II that Kennedy was piloting toward what had
promised to be a weekend of summer fun and the wedding of a Kennedy
cousin. The 8- to 10-foot-long section of fuselage where the bodies
were found was located by a robot dive vehicle in 116 feet of water
roughly seven miles off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   When three shiny metal caskets were taken off a Coast Guard
cutter at Woods Hole late Wednesday afternoon, four cousins of John
F. Kennedy Jr. _ Patrick, Edward Jr., Douglas, and Max Kennedy _
joined two Coast Guardsmen as impromptu pall bearers. Standing
beside them were Edward Kennedy, his wife Vicki, and a priest.
Edward Kennedy and his sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., had gone out
to the Navy salvage vessel USS Grasp to retrieve the latest family
members who had met young and sudden deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really were no real good things that occurred during
this event,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee, who
oversaw the massive five-day search. ``We were here to save lives,
and we felt very optimistic that we would find people alive. That
wasn't the case. . . . But I think today we were able to bring
closure to two families.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for Kennedy, 38, and his 33-year-old wife is
scheduled for Friday morning at the Church of St. Thomas More in
Manhattan, where his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, sometimes
prayed. President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton are scheduled
to attend the private Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After her brother's body was found, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg
and her husband went for a bicycle ride near their summer home in
Bridgehampton, N.Y. She made no public comment.
</P>
<P>
   An invitation-only service for Lauren Bessette, 34, is scheduled
for Saturday night at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn. ``We
believe that our children are with us in spirit each and every
moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' their mother, Ann
Freeman, and stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery effort began after a device deployed by the Grasp
called a remote-operated vehicle discovered a large portion of the
plane's fuselage. The discovery at 11:40 p.m. Tuesday was confirmed
when the a camera aboard the underwater vehicle spotted the Piper
Saratoga II's registration number, N9253N. Kennedy's body was still
inside the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The first dive to the site began at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, during
which two divers from the Grasp spent 40 minutes on the ocean
floor. Visibility was 5 to 8 feet, and the divers made positive
identifications of all three.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, a Coast Guard helicopter touched down at the Kennedy
family's Hyannis Port compound to collect Edward Kennedy and his
two sons. With the last surviving son of a storied generation of
Kennedys leading the way, the three were taken by boat to the USS
Grasp.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m., the victims were raised to the surface. Larrabee
declined to discuss the conditions of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were brought up in a way that I think respected the
situation that we were in, and I guess I don't need to add any more
to that. It was something that we were very, very sensitive to,''
Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard cutter with Edward Kennedy and his two sons aboard
then brought the bodies to Woods Hole, where they were placed in
two white medical examiner vans that drove slowly away. Autopsies
were to be performed at Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne on
Cape Cod by the state pathologist, according to the office of
Philip Rollins, Cape and Islands district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage, which included the plane's propeller and the
instrument panel, was taken to the Cape Cod Coast Guard station for
examination by the National Transportation Safety Board. Larrabee
said the airplane's colors were still visible, but the mangled
fuselage was a mass of wires and debris, ``the kind of things you
could imagine from a high-impact contact with the water.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the salvage operation should be completed within the
next few days, and he said he expected almost all major parts of
the plane would be recovered. As the salvage work ended Wednesday,
there were still some pieces of the plane's wings that had not been
recovered, though Larrabee said they were spotted 20 to 40 yards
from the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   News of the recoveries was at once a relief and a cause for
tears for family, friends and strangers who had spent days waiting
for word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very sad, very emotional and heartwrenching
week,'' said Debbie Lamoureux, a high school friend of Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, choking back tears. ``But at least today there is
some closure. It's still really hard to believe and it's all still
so shocking to me, but at least the families know what happened.''

RAMIREZ IS PRODUCING RUNS AT A BLISTERING RATE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Manny Ramirez digs his right foot into the back of
the right-handed batter's box and glances toward the first-base
side to focus for a second. Then Ramirez moves his left foot into
the box, taps the dirt with his bat and waves it slowly through the
strike zone once, sometimes holding the bat steady until the
pitcher begins his motion. Then Ramirez is ready.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is the continued evolution of a superb hitter.
Ramirez, his forearms as thick as telephone books, is hunched over
in a slight crouch as he lifts his left leg and unleashes a
smoothly powerful swing. The strength of the swing emanates from
his back leg, carries through his rotating hips to his front leg
and seemingly allows him to whip the bat around like a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   This vision of Ramirez as an artist is enjoyable to watch,
unless you are perched 60 feet 6 inches from him. Try to throw
Ramirez sliders and curveballs on the outside corner and he is
smart enough to extend himself and rope the ball the opposite way.
Attempt to sneak fastballs past Ramirez on the inside half of the
plate and he is quick enough to pound the ball as if it were
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   It is this approach that has enabled Ramirez, the former
baseball prodigy from George Washington High School in Manhattan,
to fashion a memorable season with the Cleveland Indians. The
27-year-old outfielder is knocking in runs at such a blistering
rate that he has 101 over his first 84 games and has drawn the
inevitable and enviable comparison to Hack Wilson, whose record of
191 with the 1930 Chicago Cubs has stood for 69 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season started, it was my goal to get 100 for the
whole year,'' said Ramirez, who has missed nine games with
injuries. ``I guess I could go home now.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was a rare moment of glibness from Ramirez, who
usually gives no answers or brief answers to questions. But before
the Indians played host to the Toronto Blue Jays Wednesday night,
Ramirez agreed to an interview and even offered a chair to a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's remarks remained bland, but he showed a boyish side as
he talked about friends and relatives who still live in Washington
Heights and about chatting with David Cone at the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never met him,'' Ramirez said. ``I started talking to
him and he was really nice. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That should make Cone, who will follow up his perfect game by
opposing the Indians on Friday night at Yankee Stadium, feel old
and honored. Ramirez has been so productive that one fan held up a
sign this week that read, ``The Heck with Hack, Manny's the Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ramirez has slipped behind Wilson after accumulating
55 RBI in the first 39 games and is on pace to finish with 176.
That would be the fourth-highest total ever. When informed of it,
Ramirez, who is also hitting .331 with 26 homers, shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good at not letting things get to him,'' said Jim Thome,
his teammate. ``Even with the streak of RBI he's had, he's stayed
focused and hasn't got caught up in the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in my mind that I was going to work hard and see what
happened,'' Ramirez said. ``I'm just happy with what I've done.
That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is treating RBI like multivitamins, as in one a day,
mostly because he is one of the most dangerous hitters in the
majors and partly because he has a dynamic 1-2-3 punch hitting in
front of him. With Kenny Lofton, Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar,
the Indians have three speedy players batting over .300, with
on-base percentages around .400. So Ramirez digs in and feasts; he
is hitting .372 with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's amazed a lot of people,'' Alomar said. ``He's a
great hitter who knows what to do. I don't think he gets all the
credit he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez initially said that he was ``just getting lucky hits at
the right time'' to drive in so many runs, but humility turned to
prickliness when he was asked the importance of the three rabbits
preceding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter,'' Ramirez said. ``You still have to
get the hits to bring them in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   True, but it helps to have them set the table. Ramirez insisted
that he is an aggressive and instinctive hitter and that he has not
made any adjustments this year, but Alomar called him a studious
sort who seeks advice on pitchers and who has become more selective
in choosing pitches to hit. One American League pitcher who
insisted on anonymity said he tries to intimidate Ramirez by firing
inside fastballs and pushing him off the plate, but admitted that
strategy might be futile now.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians did not have to be in uniform until 6 o'clock
Wednesday night, but Ramirez was one of two players at his locker
at 4 p.m. and he had taken batting practice before half the team
arrived. Manager Mike Hargrove said the most impressive aspect of
Ramirez's season has been his consistency in right field, which
means Ramirez, an erratic fielder, has not embarrassed himself in
weeks now that he is catching fly balls with two hands.
</P>
<P>
   It is arduous to improve upon belting 45 homers and collecting
145 RBI, which Ramirez did last year, but he is doing it.
</P>
<P>
   When Hargrove was asked if he ever thought that Ramirez could
better those numbers, he said: ``If he was 35 years old, I'd say
no. How old is he? He's 26 or 27. If you look at it, Manny hasn't
even entered the prime of his career. I don't know how high he can
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove then spoke about Ramirez stroking 45 to 50 homers and
delivering 130 to 150 runs for the next 10 years. ``I don't think
that you have to go beyond that,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about his formidable statistics and about where he
belongs among the premier hitters in baseball causes the
Dominican-born Ramirez to bow his head, smile sheepishly and offer
one final answer before resuming his silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' Ramirez said. ``I don't care if I
get that big reputation like other guys. As long as my teammates
know I'm out there to win. Getting the ring is important. That's
what counts.''

 MENEMSHA, Mass.: ... what happened.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the recovery marked an emotional transition for the
public, for investigators it promised to provide a wealth of
information in the painstaking effort to learn what went wrong. A
final report is not expected for six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy will determine whether Kennedy was killed by the
trauma of impact or _ based on whether there is water in the lungs
_ survived the crash and drowned, said Michael L. Barr, director of
the Aviation Safety Program at the University of Southern
California, a training center for crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, the Allegheny, Pa., county coroner,
said that after five days in the ocean there almost certainly would
be water in the lungs, regardless of how they died, making a
determination of drowning questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Wecht said the bodies would be X-rayed for broken bones, and a
review would be undertaken to determine if a heart attack or stroke
could have incapacitated the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology studies will be used to learn whether Kennedy had
taken any prescription or nonprescription drugs. Kennedy injured
his ankle in a paragliding accident several weeks before the crash,
and witnesses said he was limping during his preflight inspection
Friday night. Investigators want to know whether he had taken
painkillers before flying, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests will also determine the amount of carbon monoxide in his
blood, an excess of which would suggest engine troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A less technical part of the investigation will focus on
Kennedy's behavior before he set foot in the cockpit. A key factor
in many small-plane crashes is pilot fatigue, Barr said, so
investigators will try to reconstruct his final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be asking what time did he get up that morning,'' Barr
said. ``Did he put in a full work day? Did he plan to leave
earlier? How intent was he to get to the wedding? When you get
fatigued, especially at night in the dark, it affects your thought
processes, your motor skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary clues as to whether there was a mechanical failure
will be evident almost immediately, Barr said, though a full review
of the plane's engine and other parts will take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the tips of the Piper Saratoga II's propeller
are curled inward, it will lead investigators to believe the
propeller was still spinning at the moment of impact, Barr said.
The tighter the curl, the faster it was spinning. By contrast, if
the propeller is bent but not curled, it most likley was not moving
at the time of the crash, possibly as a result of engine failure or
fuel exhaustion, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will be able to determine whether the plane ran
out of fuel. That is considered unlikely, however, unless a leak is
found; five days before the flight, Kennedy purchased 62 gallons of
fuel, more than enough to make the trip from Essex County Airport
in Fairfield, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard several times over.
</P>
<P>
   A close examination of the plane's instrument panel is expected
to reveal key missing details of the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   The crash likely created tiny nicks on the instrument casings
known as impact marks that will record the readings at the moment
the plane hit the water, Barr said. Investigators will look for
marks on the airspeed indicator to reveal how fast the plane was
going. Marks on the attitude indicator will be used to determine
the angle at which Kennedy's plane fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   A third instrument, the vertical velocity indicator, is likely
to reveal little beyond what is already known. The gauge only goes
to 2,000 feet per minute, while radar reports indicate the plane
was descending in excess of 5,000 feet per minute. In the parlance
of pilots, that means the needle was ``pegged'' at the maximum
descent rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find nothing wrong, they can disregard mechanical
failure and turn their attention to human error. They always try to
prove mechanical error first,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a military pilot in Vietnam and former military flight
instructor, said a majority of the small plane crashes he has
investigated were caused by human error.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate on Kennedy's crash, but other aviation
authorities have said Kennedy might have grown disoriented on his
approach to the island airport and sent the plane into a fatal,
spinning plunge into the ocean. That scenario appeared consistent
with radar data released Tuesday that showed Kennedy made several
unexplained maneuvers in the final minutes of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   A federal transportation source familiar with the investigation
said the National Transportation Safety Board might not go to the
extent of rebuilding the airplane, ``but they will examine all the
fracture sites and make sure what direction the wings came off,
assuming they came off.''
</P>
<P>
   If one or both wings came off in flight, the tears would
indicate upward pressure on the wings. If the plane was intact when
it hit the water, the wings would be ripped from the fuselage from
the front to the rear of the plane, creating different tear
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will also examine parts of the plane including
various cables, the flaps on the tail and wings, and the rudder, to
see if they were attached and what position they were in at the
time of the crash. They will also take apart the engine to examine
its workings to the smallest detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not want to impeach (Kennedy) without exploring all
the possibilities,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whatever conclusion is reached will no doubt conform
with what Barr called the black humor of flight crash
investigators: ``In our business, the number one cause of all
accidents is gravity.''

CLINTON REMEMBERS A VISIT BY KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(yn) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a misty reminiscence, President Clinton said
Wednesday that John F. Kennedy Jr. came to the White House a year
ago for the first time since his father was assassinated in 1963,
and had visited only once he had felt ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy had actually not been back to the White House
since his father was killed, until I had become president,''
Clinton said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the president's son had visited the White House on at
least two prior occasions, once in 1971 when Richard M. Nixon was
president and again in 1985 when Ronald Reagan was president.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, informed by aides later that Kennedy had been
to the White House before, said he had based his statements on what
Kennedy had told him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Wednesday that he had showed Kennedy
``for the first time since he was a little boy'' the Oval Office
and the desk in which he had been photographed playing. He took him
and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, to the residence ``which
he'd not seen since he was a tiny boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described how he and Kennedy, who was killed in a plane
crash Friday night, pored over Clinton's collection of Kennedy
memorabilia. He said that he later sent Kennedy pictures of their
evening together and that in return, Kennedy sent him his favorite
picture of his father, campaigning in 1960 in Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he really wanted to kind of come to terms with
all of it,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Kennedy, his sister, Caroline, and his mother,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, were invited to the White House on Feb.
3, 1971, by the Nixons to see the portraits of the Kennedys,
according to John Taylor, executive director of the Nixon
Foundation at the Nixon Library. The White House log shows that the
Kennedys had dinner with the Nixons in the second-floor dining room
of the residence and then visited the Oval Office for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a handwritten thank-you note supplied by the Nixon Library,
Kennedy, who was then 10, wrote to the Nixons the next day: ``I can
never thank you more for showing us the White House. I really liked
everything about it. You were so nice to show us everything. I
don't think I could remember much about the White House but it was
really nice seeing it all again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 television interview with Chris Matthews, Kennedy
talked about that visit with the Nixons. He said he saw the Oval
Office and the rooms where he had lived. He later spilled his milk
on the president's lap.
</P>
<P>
   John and Caroline Kennedy returned to the Oval Office again in
1985 at their request. They asked Reagan to appear at a fund-raiser
at the Kennedy Library, which he did.

   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ On the fifth day of a search that
accompanied a great national wake, a red sonar blotch led searchers
to the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his two passengers,
trapped in the shattered fuselage of his plane on the floor of the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's remains were located about 2:30 a.m. by an underwater
camera checking objects detected by sonar. Several hours later,
Navy divers in heavy-duty gear moved the crumpled wreckage and
found the passengers from his flight through black haze last Friday
night _ his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his
sister-in-law, Lauren G. Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery marked the conclusion of a frantic search that had
begun Saturday morning when Kennedy did not arrive at Martha's
Vineyard, where he had planned to land before attending a family
wedding. Rescuers fanned out by air, sea and land, over 9,000
square miles. The first certain clue to what had happened came
Saturday afternoon, when a luggage tag bearing the name of Lauren
Bessette washed ashore on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The three bodies were found at 116 feet, about seven miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard. At a news conference on Wednesday
night at the investigation's command center in nearby Bourne, Rear
Adm. Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard said that all three
victims were ``near and under'' the fuselage, still strapped in.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy boarded a Coast Guard
helicopter at his compound in nearby Hyannis Port and was taken to
the Navy salvage ship Grasp to witness the recovery. Senator
Kennedy was joined by his two sons, Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy and
Edward M. Kennedy Jr. The bodies were raised about 4:30 p.m. The
senator and his sons accompanied the bodies on Wednesday night to
the Coast Guard station in this fishing village at the heel of Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts State Police escorted the coroner's vans on
yet another dark Kennedy motorcade, this time to the Barnstable
County Medical Examiner's Office in nearby Pocasset, where the
bodies were to be prepared for return to the families. Senator
Kennedy remained at the office for about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the senator and his sons had ``made a request to
come out prior to the time that the victims were removed, and they
were on board for quite a while before we actually recovered the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The water temperature, about 52 degrees, helped preserve the
bodies, an investigator said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, 38, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga
with his wife and sister-in-law aboard when it was lost in the
Atlantic on Friday night. He had intended to drop Lauren Bessette
off at Martha's Vineyard, then fly on to Hyannis Port for the
Saturday wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family members, citing his wishes and hoping to avoid
having a spectacle made of Kennedy's final resting place, have
decided to have his body cremated and his ashes scattered at sea in
a Navy ceremony, a family adviser said. Plans call for the women to
be buried at sea as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy destroyer Briscoe, which had been training in the area,
moved toward Cape Cod for the burial at sea, which could take place
as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided after much debate to hold a private memorial
service. The service will be held in New York City at a Roman
Catholic church that Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, attended, the Church of St. Thomas More, on 89th Street
between Park and Madison. The church seats 350.
</P>
<P>
   The service, described in the family announcement as ``a Mass to
celebrate the lives of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and John F. Kennedy
Jr.,'' will be held at 11 a.m. Friday. The White House said
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, had argued in
favor of small service instead of a large service in a cathedral, a
family source said.
</P>
<P>
   A candelight memorial service for Lauren Bessette will be held
at 7 p.m. Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn. It, too, is
also by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Christopher C. Murray, said the divers made the recover in
difficult conditions; visibility was less than eight feet, the
current was strong and the ocean floor was littered with rocks and
boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who descended in elevator cages, were attached to
the Grasp by oxygen and radio lines, with divers standing by on the
ship in case one of those beneath got hurt or tangled in the
wreckage. Now that the bodies have been removed, divers will use
straps and cables to form slings around the pieces of plane before
hoisting them on the Grasp's boom, which can lift 40 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members
since the plane was reported missing, said he had authorized a
continuation of the unusually long search, which has been
criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national
lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained
in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few
more days,'' Clinton said on Wednesday afternoon during a news
conference on other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am,'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the
right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the official announcement by the National
Transportation Safety Board, ``a large portion of the fuselage''
was discovered about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's body was identified within three hours. Then in a
45-minute dive that began just before noon on Wednesday, Navy
divers located the other two bodies. On Wednesday afternoon, a
second set of divers recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The debris field, which investigators call the plane's ``splash
point,'' is just off Gay Head, the western tip of Martha's
Vineyard, and near a private beach that was once owned by Mrs.
Onassis and left to her children.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of fuselage, about 8 to 10 feet long, was also
recovered on Wednesday night, Larrabee said. He said the propeller
was nearby, and said searchers found ``wires, seats, the kinds of
things that you can imagine that would be the result of a
high-impact contact with the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Kennedy's plane was plunging at 5,000 feet
per minute just before radar contact was lost Friday night, and
pilots and aviation authorities said the description that has been
provided seems to indicate a ``graveyard spiral,'' a corkscrew
descent in which the pilot becomes disoriented and, desperate to
right the plane, loses control.

</P>
<P>
   The death of Kennedy, who grew up before the nation from a rich
scion to a ruggedly glamorous entrepreneur, has provoked an
outpouring of mourning and nostalgia for America's best-known
political family. As crowds thronged the Kennedys' home in New York
and anyplace with a Kennedy connection, the John F. Kennedy Hyannis
Museum, operated by the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, added an
easel on Wednesday afternoon featuring a quote from President
Kennedy, who was assassinated three days before his son turned 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tied to the ocean,'' President Kennedy said in 1962 at
a dinner celebrating America's Cup. ``When we go back to the sea,
whether it is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence
we came.''
</P>
<P>
   Burial at sea is a ritual that extends back to the ancient
Greeks, who dropped a coin in the mouth of the deceased for the
toll at the River Styx. Paul L. Stillwell, the director of history
at the Naval Institute, a private educational organization, said
the service has become more rare now that bodies can be airlifted
off ships at sea. With a cremation, the ashes are allowed to blow
off the stern of the ship, to the accompaniment of three rifle
volleys, Stillwell said.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy official said ``commitment at sea,'' as the ceremony is
known, is typically performed for active or retired members of the
service, their spouses and their dependent children. But Navy
regulations allow for the service to be performed for ``notable
service or outstanding contributions to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said its investigation would continue for six to nine
more months. James Hall, the chairman, said the agency would make
no other comment until all memorial services were complete.

EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON'S WIDE-RANGING NEWS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-NYT) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the news conference by
President Clinton Wednesday at the White House, as recorded by The
New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Prepared Statement
</P>
<P>
   Today I want to make a brief statement about the choice we face
here in Washington and in our country about how best to move
forward into the new century and what to do with the surplus. When
we look toward the future, it is helpful to remember at least the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Six and half years ago the budget deficit was $290 billion and
rising, wages were stagnant, inequality was growing, social
conditions were worsening. In the 12 years before I took office,
unemployment averaged more than 7 percent. It's almost difficult to
remember what it was like. No one really thought we could turn it
around. Let alone bring unemployment to a 29-year low or turn
decades of deficits during which time the debt of our country was
quadrupled in only 12 years into a surplus of $99 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation has made a seismic shift in the last six years from
recession to recovery, from a crisis of confidence to a renewal of
resolve, from economic disorder to a fiscal house finally in order.
</P>
<P>
   Now as we debate what to do with our prosperity, we face a
critical choice, whether to move forward with the fiscal discipline
that got us to where we are today, or return to the kind of risk
taking that got us into recessions and deficits before. We must
decide whether to invest the surplus, to strengthen America over
the long term, or to squander it for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   I think the right course is clear and a bigger surplus only
means that the mistake could be bigger and the missed opportunity
greater if we take the wrong course.
</P>
<P>
   I have proposed a balanced budget that puts first things first.
I believe we must maintain our sound economic strategy and invest
the surplus in long-term goals, saving Social Security, saving and
strengthening Medicare, modernizing it by providing a long overdue
drug benefit and continuing to meet our basic responsibilities in
education, defense, the environment, biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow I will release a report that shows a great and growing
need for prescription drug coverage. What the study shows is that
75 percent of our older Americans lack decent dependable
private-sector coverage of prescription drugs. That's three out of
every four seniors. Clearly America needs a prescription drug plan
that is simple, universal and voluntary. Anyone who says we don't,
I believe, is out of date and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   As I've described, my plan meets these national priorities,
while paying off the debt by 2015, while investing in America's new
markets, the places that have not yet felt our prosperity, and
while providing substantial tax relief, $250 billion of it targeted
to help families save for retirement, pay for child care, long-term
care, for modern schools.
</P>
<P>
   So let's be clear about something. We're not debating whether to
have tax cuts or not. We should have tax cuts, but tax cuts that
provide for us first to save Social Security and Medicare, not
undermine them. Tax cuts we can afford, not ones that would demand
drastic cuts in defense, education, agriculture, or the
environment. Tax cuts in the national interest, not special
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these are the risks that are posed by the Republican tax
plan that the House is about to vote on. Let me tell you what their
plan would do. It would pile up $3 trillion in debt over the next
two decades, right when the baby boomers start to retire _ that's
what it costs _ right when Social Security and Medicare feel the
crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cost of the tax plan over the next two decades, I
should say what it doesn't do. It doesn't do anything to extend the
solvency of Social Security, to extend the solvency of Medicare to
provide the prescription drug benefits, and it would require
significant, significant cuts from where we are today in education,
defense, biomedical research, the environment and other critical
areas. If we don't save Social Security, it's not because we can't.
If we don't strengthen Medicare and add the prescription drug
benefit, it's not because we can't. If we don't meet these clear
national needs, it's because we choose not to do so. It will be
because instead we choose to reward ourselves today by risking our
prosperity tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Congress will make the right choice. When members cast
their ballots on the Republican tax plan, they're really voting
also on whether to save Social Security and Medicare. They're
voting on whether to pay off the national debt for the first time
in over 150 years, something that would guarantee us lower interest
rates, higher investment, more jobs, higher incomes and for average
citizens, lower home mortgage payments, car payments, credit card
payments, college loan payments. They're voting whether to meet our
most pressing national priorities in education, defense, nearly
every other domain in our people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   I think the choice is clear between the plan the Republican
leadership has outlined and the national priorities of the American
people. I hope we can still work together across party lines to
save Social Security and Medicare, to safeguard our priorities and
have the right kind of tax cut. If Congress passes the wrong kind,
of course I will not sign it. I will not allow a risky plan to
become law. And as I said, we now have six and a half years of
evidence. This is not really a debate that's just about ideas
without any evidence. We clearly know what works now and we ought
to stay with it.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I will work with any member of either party willing
to put first things first. We can't have a tax cut and do the right
thing for the long term in America. That is my commitment and I
hope that together we can fulfill it for our people.

   Q. Mr. President, in U.S. treaty relations, is it obligated to
defend Taiwan militarily if it abandons the one-China policy, and
would the U.S. continue military aid if it pursues separatism?
</P>
<P>
   MR. CLINTON. Well let me say first of all, a lot of those
questions are governed by the Taiwan Relations Act, which we intend
to honor. Our policy is clear. We favor the one-China policy. We
favor the cross-straight dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   The understanding we have had all along with both China and
Taiwan is that the difference between them would be resolved
peacefully. If that were not to be the case under the Taiwan
Relations Act, we would be required to view it with the gravest
concern. But I believe that both China and Taiwan understand this.
I believe that they want to stay on a path to prosperity and
dialogue and we have dispatched people today as the morning press
reports to do what we can to press that case to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   This is something that we don't want to see escalate, and I
believe that what Lee said yesterday was trying to move in that
direction. We all understand how difficult this is, but I think
that the pillars of the policy are still the right ones. The
one-China policy is right, the cross-straight dialogue is right,
the peaceful approach is right and neither side, in my judgment
should depart from any of those elements.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But we would still have to go to war with China if it decided
to break away.
</P>
<P>
   A. I will say what I've already said. The Taiwan Relations Act
governs our policy. We made it clear and I have, as you remember. A
few years ago we had a physical expression of that, that we don't
believe there should be any violent attempts to resolve this. We
would view it very seriously. But I don't believe there will be. I
think that both sides understand what needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Economists have been calling on you to indicate now whether
you intend to reappoint Alan Greenspan in order to avoid having the
issue become mired in election year politics and upsetting
financial markets next year. Would you like to see the chairman
stay on? And has he given you any indication of his plans?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have, as you know, enjoyed a very good relationship, both
personally and professionally, with Mr. Greenspan. I think he has
done a terrific job. I have no idea whether he would even be
willing to serve another term. I will make the decision in a timely
fashion. I do not expect it to become embroiled in election year
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sir, you talk about how expensive the Republican tax cuts
would be. But the Congressional Budget Office has now just come out
with a report saying that even with their tax cuts, almost $800
billion in tax cuts, they would save about $277 billion over a
10-year period where by your program would save only about $50
billion. That's about $227 billion difference. How do you reconcile
that and, you know, people on the Hill listen to the C.B.O.
</P>
<P>
   A. They listen to the CBO except where it's inconvenient for
them, like the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Republicans have freed
us all now to question the CBO since they ignored the CBO on the
Patients' Bill of Rights. They have discredited their own CBO. Let
me say, I haven't seen that C.B.O. accounting.
</P>
<P>
   All I can tell you is that all of our budget people were rolling
their eyes and saying that it was a very creative study. Let me
just say this: You have six and a half years of experience with the
numbers we have given you and the estimates we have made. And every
single year our numbers have not only been accurate, but we have
done better than we said we would do. Every single year for six and
a half years now. Our studies show that their tax cut, over the
next two decades, will cost, first a trillion dollars and then
three trillion in the second decade. And that then the enormous
loss to the American people in interest savings. That is, we'll
have to keep spending more and more of our tax money paying
interest on the debt and it will require huge cuts in education and
defense and other things ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. The CBO says it estimates the cost of your Medicare reforms
are more than twice what you say they are.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, again, you have evidence. Let me just say this. In the
1997 balanced budget agreement, we agreed to a Medicare savings
figure. OK And we _ and this is the reason all these teaching
hospitals are in trouble today. We agreed to a Medicare savings
figure. And we said OK, here is our health information. This is
what we do in the executive branch, we deal with these hospitals.
Here are the changes you need to make in the Medicare program to
achieve the savings that the Republicans and the Democrats in
Congress and the White House agreed on. And the CBO said no, no,
no, no. That won't come close. You need these changes plus these
changes. And we said OK, we're following the CBO. We put it in
there.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? That's one of the reasons the surplus is somewhat
bigger than it otherwise would be, the cuts in Medicare were far
more severe, our numbers were right, their numbers were wrong and
that's why you've got all these hospitals all over America, every
place I go, talking about how they're threatened with bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   So when it comes to estimating Medicare costs, again we have
evidence and whenever there's been a difference between us and the
CBO, we've been right and they've been wrong. That's all I can you.
No serious person _ and so what are they going to do about
Medicare? They say our drug program will cost more. They don't put
a red cent into it. What are they going to do about it? Even if you
don't have a drug program, if you adopt their tax-cut program they
won't be able to do anything to extend the solvency of Medicare and
they will have to have huge cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For them to produce those savings, they are going to, they can't
even fund my defense budget, much less the one they say they want.
They're going to have cuts in defense, cuts in education, cuts in
the environment. That's all their savings assumed that there going
to stay with the present budget levels, which they themselves are
trying to get out of even as we speak here today ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sir, in your conversation with Chairman Arafat this morning,
did you ask him to take any specific steps to advance what you
believe is new momentum toward peace? And did you discuss with him
his complaints yesterday that he found Prime Minister Barak's
15-month timetable unacceptable?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I told him only this. I said that, I generally
described my meetings with Prime Minister Barak to him. I told him
that he was committed to working in partnership with Chairman
Arafat and honoring any agreements that had been made to this point
and that any, any modifications they make going forward to the
benefit of either or both sides would have to be done by mutual
agreement, that I thought he was completely committed to resolve
the, all the issues outstanding in the peace process in an
expeditious manner.
</P>
<P>
   And what I urged him to do was to have this one-on-one meeting.
Hear him out, think it through and if he wanted to talk to me again
after the meeting occurred, that I would be happy to talk to him.
So I went out of my way not to describe the prime minister's
proposals or to advocate or not advocate, but simply to say that I
was convinced they were being made in complete good faith and that
they would, that the peace process would be revitalized and
whatever they did from here on out is something that they would do
together. And I think he felt good about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The House of Representatives appears to be on the verge of
terminating funding for the F-22 fighter. Will the White House
fight hard for full funding for that program, even if it means
sacrificing other Pentagon airplane programs, or even pay for
servicemen?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I don't think we should sacrifice the pay for our
service personnel because we now are getting back in the ball game
in recruitment. The good economy and the increased deployments and
the low pay all combined, making it hard for us to both recruit and
retain people. And the people are still the most important part of
our military, their quality and their training and their morale and
their commitment and the condition of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't think that. Now the Congress every year puts other
things into the Defense budget which are not priority for the
Pentagon and are priorities for the Congress. We can fund the F-22,
we can fund the plane without compromising the basic priorities of
our national defense, within the funds set aside and that is what I
will fight to do.
</P>
<P>
   I think it will be a mistake to abandon the project. I think it
has real potential to add to our national defense. I have always
supported it. And I hope that it can be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You had some fun recently with George W. Bush and his slogan
of compassionate conservatism, but you went beyond the notion that
he's not offering many details of his policy and seemed to ridicule
his slogan and even question his sincerity. Were you just trying to
help Gore's candidacy or were you taking the opportunity maybe to
just needle the leading Republican candidate?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I was just having a little fun. I, you know, this is such
a long time, if we don't have any laughs, this is going to be a
very tedious struggle between now and November of 2000. Let me say
this, I think that you know every, every person struggles to find a
phrase, or something that will sort of stand for what he or she is
trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   So, I was really just having a little fun. I think the most
important thing is that all the candidates make their positions
clear on the great debates going on now. And make their positions
clear on what they would do if they got the job. To me, that's the
most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I am not involved in this campaign as a candidate. And
I have a full-time job so I'm not involved in any sort of full-time
consulting role. So I look at this, I look at this more from the
point of view of the average American voter.
</P>
<P>
   What will change the lives of America? For example, every
candidate should tell us, you know, are you for the Patients' Bill
of Rights? Are you for closing the gun-show loophole? Are you for
raising the minimum wage? Are you for the House Republican tax plan
or do you favor our plan on Social Security and saving Social
Security and Medicare and making America debt free and having a
smaller tax cut that enables us to continue to fund education and
defense and these other things? What are going to do if you get
elected?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, to me the best thing the vice president's done is to
talk about, you know, dramatically intensifying the war on cancer,
making preschool universal, increasing access to college by helping
people save without tax consequences, what he would do to make
America a safer country, what he would do in communities to have
faith-based organizations cooperate with governments more.
</P>
<P>
   I think these are interesting ideas about how you build on the
progress the country's made the last six and a half years. So I
would say to everyone, use whatever slogans you want, but tell us
where you stand. I think that's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, the economy is going great and in a new USA
Today/CNN poll this week, your approval rating was at a very
healthy 58 percent. But that same poll showed that by 50 percent to
38 percent Americans said they wanted to see a change from Clinton
administration policies, not a continuation of them. What do you
think accounts for that sentiment for change? And do you think it
means that you present something of a mixed blessing to Mrs.
Clinton and Vice President Gore in their campaigns next year?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I think what that means is people think things are going
well, but they want to change a policy. So I think that's right. If
you ask me, if you ask me that question and you word it in that
way, I'd be in the 50 percent because I think that my own view is
that in a _ particularly in a dynamic time when things are
changing, you should want continued change. But is _ the question
is should we change in a way that builds on what has been done and
goes beyond it, which is what I would argue.
</P>
<P>
   Or should you change and go back to the policies we were
following when we had $290 billion deficits and we averaged over 7
percent employment for 12 years? I mean, I think that's really the
question the American people have to ask themselves. Is _ I think
change is good.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about this country is that it works best when
it's sort of in a perpetual stage of renewal. So I would, myself,
as a citizen, I would vote against somebody who said `Vote for me
and I'll keep it just like it is, everything that Bill Clinton did
is exactly what I'll do.' I would vote against that candidate
because I do not believe that is the right thing to do. But what I
think we should do is we should build on what the progress of the
last six years, and go beyond it. And not adopt a completely
different approach which has been proven not to work.
</P>
<P>
   So all I want the American people to do is to remember what it
was like before, think what it's like now, recognize that ideas and
policies have consequences and you know, the American people
usually get it right. That's why we're all still around here after
more than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your last press conference, sir, with the Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, you mentioned you wanted better normalized relations
with Syria. Now have you received any response, positive response
or indication from Syria towards that? And on Iran, can you share
with us the administration views of the last events and
administrations in Iran?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, on Syria let me say I _ the only thing I can tell you
is that the statements, at least, that have been coming out of
Syria have been quite encouraging in terms of the regard that
President Assad seems to have for the Prime Minister and the
willingness, the openness that there is to negotiating and moving
toward peace, so I'm encouraged by that.
</P>
<P>
   And on Iran, frankly I'm reluctant to say anything for fear that
it will be used in a way that's not hopeful to the forces of
openness and reform. I think that people everywhere, particularly
younger people hope that they will be able to pursue their
religious convictions and their personal dreams in an atmosphere of
greater freedom that still allows them to be deeply loyal to their
nation. And I think the Iranian people obviously love their country
and are proud of its history and have enormous potential. And I
just hope they find a way to work through all this, and I believe
they will.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned the patients' bill of rights. It seems like
that was an argument by both parties over providing more for people
who already are lucky enough to have health insurance. And in fact
neither party dealt with some very fundamental issues that
energized you and the first lady five and six years ago. My
question is, with such a robust economy and the budget surpluses,
if not now, when? And if not you, who would provide the leadership
to provide for those folks?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but I think the bigger question is how. That is, it is
true that just as we predicted in 1993 and 1994, that the
percentage of people who have health insurance on the job is going
down. Just as we said it would, if nothing was done.
</P>
<P>
   So what we have tried to do is to isolate discrete populations
that seem to be most in need and try to offer them help. In the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we reached bipartisan agreement on a
proposal that would fund providing health insurance for up to five
million more children through state-designed programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've been a little disappointed, and I'm not being critical
of any of the states either here, but I've been a little
disappointed that the uptake on the program has been a little slow.
That is, I would have thought by now we'd have almost three million
of those five million children enrolled already, because we've got
the money there. And we're well behind that.
</P>
<P>
   So we are looking at whether there are things we can do at the
national level to work with the states to simplify access to the
children's health insurance programs that the states have set up.
But and I also had a talk with Senator Kennedy the other day who
believes that for little or no more extra money we could actually
adjust the program and take in several million more children. So
the children are the biggest group.
</P>
<P>
   Then I have a proposal, as you know, that's part of my Medicare
reform proposal that I didn't mention today but I want to reiterate
it, that would allow the most vulnerable group of people without
health insurance, people between the ages of 55 and 65, to buy into
the Medicare system in a way that would not compromise the
integrity of the system. So I think that is quite important. In
addition to that, there are a lot of states, or excuse me, there
are some states _ Tennessee was the first state to do this . . . _
which are allowing lower-income working families to buy into their
Medicaid programs on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   So if all these things were done, we would dramatically reduce
the number of people without health insurance, and will eventually
probably get down to the _ ... if we keep pushing in this
direction, getting down to the point where the largest group of
people without health insurance are young, single people who
believe that they're going to live forever and be healthy forever
and don't want to bear the cost. And we'll have to think about
them, what to do, but what, I think the best thing to do is to try
to get as many kids as we can covered and then try to get these
people who are out of the work force, who are older, but they're
not old enough to get Medicare, to get them at least where they can
all afford on the sliding scale to buy into the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sir, you've stressed that you have plenty to do and yet for
some time your political career has enjoyed the benefits of support
from two people in particular: the vice president and the first
lady, two people who are now in a position to expect some support
from you. I'm wondering what you feel you owe those two people in
terms of political support and as you plan your schedule in the
weeks and months ahead, how you'll balance that assistance against
your job as president and, finally, how you personally are
adjusting to what people might think is an interesting shift in
role.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I will do whatever I'm asked to do, basically. I'll try
to be helpful. And if I can be helpful, I will be. But I think it's
_ the best thing I can do for anyone who is _ generally shares our
ideas, part of our party, trying to move the country forward, is to
continue to be a good president and take care of our country.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't mind hard work and I don't mind long hours _ and I
find myself apparently unlike some of my predecessors _ but I just
read what you all say about it, but I don't feel myself winding
down. I feel myself keying up. I want to do more. I want to try to
make sure that I give the American people as much as I can every
day. So I've got plenty of energy and I'll do whatever I'm asked to
do. I owe them a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   I mean I think Al Gore _ everybody in this room knows that he's
had far more responsibility and gotten more done, than any vice
president in history. Nobody's ever had a role that even
approximates that. I don't think the American people know that yet.
But I know that. And he deserves a lot of credit for what he's
done. And he has my friendship and my support ...
</P>
<P>
   And of course I did an interview and I talked about Hillary and
this road. If she decides to do this, I will do whatever I can do
and if she's successful I will happily go to the Senate spouse's
meeting if that's part of the job. I think the _ I have never known
anybody who didn't run for office who was a more effective, more
consistently committed, completely passionate public citizen than
her ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, in that same vein sir, as the spotlight shifts
from you to your vice president and to your wife, are you likely to
be content drifting slowly off stage? Or do you think that someday
you will want to run for office, some office, again?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't have any idea. I really, I don't _ let me just say, I
love this job. I love it. Even on the bad days, all of a sudden you
can do something good for the country, you can do something good
for the future. I have loved doing this. And I have given it every
ounce of my energy and ability and judgment and I have _ I feel
very fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   But we have a system that I frankly agree with, even though I'm
in pretty good shape, we have a system that says the president gets
two terms and then the president has to go find something else to
do with his life. And there are lots of other worthy things to do.
And I was a very happy person before I became president. I've never
had any trouble finding something interesting to do that I believed
in, and I will do my best to use the opportunity and the gift the
American people gave me to serve in this position, to be a useful
citizen of my country and the world for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   And I have no doubt that they'll be some way that I can do that.
And I'm frankly kind of excited about it. I mean it's a new
challenge. I'll have to think in a different way and do a different
way. Will I miss a lot of the things about this job? Yes, I'll even
miss all of you, believe it or not. But, and then _ but I'm just
grateful that I've had the chance to serve and that the results
have been good for our people and for our country and I think for
the world.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NCAA'S HODGEPODGE AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a blue-ribbon panel appointed by the NCAA
offered pointed advice on how to manage student athletes. Not all
student athletes, just the association's Golden Geese: basketball
players, specifically those at the top 100 men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with plummeting graduation rates and a rising
perception of rowdier games, the 27-member committee studied issues
ranging from low graduation rates to gambling scandals to
recruiting problems and agents.
</P>
<P>
   You have probably heard the recommendations before. The NCAA is
the big dog that chases its tail. It's a bizarre mixture of huge
schools that run professional sports enterprises, and medium range
to modest programs that live off television revenues the giants
generate. There are bandit NCAA programs and squeaky-clean programs
and a lot of programs that can go either way, depending on the
recruiting year.
</P>
<P>
   What they all have in common is the need for young, supple
bodies. How they get them is the age-old issue, and why these
proposed measures sound familiar, and why the NCAA manual gets
thicker with each new year.
</P>
<P>
   The fun is obviously in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested that the number of basketball scholarships
schools can award should be tied to the academic success of their
players. Those schools with graduation and/or academic standing
rates of 75 percent or higher would be allowed 14 full
scholarships, schools with rates of 33 to 74 percent would be
allowed 13, and schools with rates below 33 percent could award 12.
Programs would be limited to offering four new scholarships each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will suggest stiffer penalties for players who
gamble, including the permanent loss of all collegiate eligibility
for attempting to fix the outcome of a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's recommendations begged the question that has
become a mutual concern to the NCAA and the NBA: how to stem the
outflow of talented players from colleges into the pros, and funnel
phenomenal high school talent to the colleges. The college game is
hurting in noticeable ways; ultimately, the NBA will suffer, too.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the NCAA relationship to athletes fleeing to the
pros is like the South's relationship to the freed man following
emancipation. Faced with the sudden depletion of cheap labor, which
was going North and West, the South devised Black Codes, laws to
curb the flow and ensure a labor force.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA over time has devised its own ways of keeping its labor
pool in place. It has rules governing every facet of a
student-athlete's life: What sneakers to wear, what gifts to
accept, what can be promoted, what meals are allowable. In the
summer, the NCAA determines where they can play, how much they can
play and how many leagues they can play in.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the NCAA is discussing whether to allow
athletes with high draft potential to take out low-interest loans
of up to $20,000 while still in school. A few years ago, the NCAA
gave football and basketball players the right to put their names
in the draft without losing eligibility if they subsequently
removed them as long as they didn't hire an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could set a minimum age, it would be a start,'' Gene
Keady, the Purdue head coach said. ``I would like to see them in
some way help the projected first-round draft choices stay in
school by the NBA paying them _ some kind of stipend where they can
have enough money for a car or living expenses or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel wants male basketball players at Division I colleges
to attend programs that ``should address sportsmanship and
leadership, manners and etiquette, on- and off-court behavior and
public-speaking skills. ``This is a showcase sport,'' said Kenneth
Shaw, the chancellor of Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   What about the behavior of head coaches? Clem Haskins coached at
Minnesota for 13 years. Then the school bought out his contract for
$1.5 million this summer after the program became engulfed in
charges of academic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA infractions committee placed Purdue on two years'
probation, with loss of a scholarship. The committee found that
Purdue violated extra benefit rules in the summer of 1995 when an
assistant coach arranged for Luther Clay to receive a $4,000 bank
loan through a booster so he could repay his prep school tuition.
The loan was never repaid and the NCAA alleges minimal effort was
made to collect the balance. The player said the coach told him the
loan would not have to be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA wants Purdue to reimburse the association for revenues
distributed from the 1996 post-season tournament, and perhaps
forfeit any uncollected revenue from that tournament. The total
could approach $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the athlete's name is dragged through the mud and, if
the statistics are to be believed _ just 41 percent of male
basketball players starting college in 1991 earned degrees _ he
won't graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs this?
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA always wants it both ways: Carnegie-Mellon when it
comes to business, Mary Poppins when it comes ethics.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a player and the pros come calling, the NCAA makes it
easy to take the money and run.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Oerter, the only athlete to win a gold medal in
the same event in four consecutive Olympics, looks as young as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch frame that helped the Long Island native win
the discus throw in the 1956, 1960, 1964 and 1968 Olympics is down
20 pounds to 255. His hair is still sandy. Everything is fine, he
said, and forget what those three cardiologists told him last year
about needing a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been hypertensive from birth,'' he said casually in an
interview. ``My heart is enlarged and has thickened, and I've had
63 years of that. I told them I didn't want a transplant, so they
put me on pills. I looked up the pills in a medical book and it
said if you don't get a transplant, take the pills.''
</P>
<P>
   His high blood pressure makes it more difficult for his heart to
pump blood throughout his body. If the condition is unchecked, the
heart can give out.
</P>
<P>
   He has made health accommodations. He and his wife, Cathy, have
moved from the thin air of Monument, Colo., to sea level in Fort
Myers Beach, Fla. He stopped lifting weights for 10 months, but
resumed light lifting six weeks ago. He said the lifting has made
him feel a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Why is an old-timer lifting weights? There is always masters
competition, although Oerter says he throws at masters meets for
athletes 40 and over without competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago,'' he said, ``I was showing some old
duffers how to do it. They were so excited competing. One guy said,
`I just threw 120 feet. What did you do?' I told him I just threw
204 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Oerter was here for Wednesday rededication of ``The Discus
Thrower,'' a life-sized statue on Randalls Island. The statue, by
Kostas Dimitriadis, was donated to the city in 1926. It was put in
storage in the 1970s after vandals had removed the discus, part of
an arm and the fig leaf. The Randalls Island Sports Foundation
rescued it, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the chief executive officer
of Bloomberg News, donated $25,000 to restore it.
</P>
<P>
   Oerter is a public and motivational speaker and makes
appearances for Xerox, but he is trying to scale back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made 440 flights in 1996 and more than 300 in 1997,'' he
said. ``There's no such thing as a trick of traveling. It wears you
down. I do some anyway, but basically I'm retired and feel good
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That retired part does not apply to discus throwing, where his
retirements have not lasted long. He quit in 1968 and came back the
next year. He quit again, returned in 1977 and won the metropolitan
championship after six months of training. He tried to make the
Olympic teams in 1980 and 1984. Then he quit elite competition
because, he said, ``the drug culture had taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at 43, he threw his career best of 227 feet 11 inches.
He is still history's eighth-longest American thrower and not that
far off the world record of 243 feet by Juergen Schult of East
Germany in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Oerter says the United States has a good future in the discus
with such throwers as John Godina, Anthony Washington and Andy
Bloom. But with appearance and prize money available, he questions
the lifestyle priorities of some athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently,'' Oerter said, ``I was at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs. I saw athletes in their 30s training
full time there. That's their life. What happened to the rest of
it? I'm happy that I had a normal life, with a career and family.
That makes a person whole.''

`RAGTIME' ACTOR GETS OVATION FOR A REAL-LIFE PERFORMANCE

<P>
   It is rare for a star in a hit Broadway show to receive an
ovation from his fellow cast members. But Alton Fitzgerald White
got one Wednesday, five days after he was mistakenly arrested on
drug charges and strip-searched, then released after the police
acknowledged their error.
</P>
<P>
   The applause came Wednesday at a curtain call after the matinee
performance of the musical ``Ragtime.'' The cast joined the
audience in applauding White, who plays Coalhouse Walker, the
talented musician whose life is changed forever when he is harassed
by white firemen simply because he is black. It was White's first
performance since his arrest, and he said his real-life ordeal had
added a stark resonance to his onstage role.
</P>
<P>
   After his performance, White, who has also appeared on Broadway
in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and in the original cast of ``Miss
Saigon,'' admitted that he had been nervous at first. ``But as I
got into the show,'' he said, ``I realized how much stronger I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   The police have said that White's arrest was simply a case of
mistaken identity by officers responding to a report of drug
dealing, and have apologized to him. But White claims he was
arrested and humiliated for no reason other than his race. The
incident comes amid heightened concern over the practice known as
racial profiling, in which officers stop people solely because of
their race.
</P>
<P>
   White's co-star, LaChanze, who plays the woman Coalhouse loves,
said that she expected his performance would change after his
experience. But she added: ``Alton is a professional. He went on
with business as usual.'' His arrest hit the black members of the
cast particularly hard, she said. Earlier, White met with the
members of the production to thank them for their support.
</P>
<P>
   White offered new details Wednesday on his arrest. He said he
was in the vestibule of his apartment building at 935 St. Nicholas
Ave. in Washington Heights _ where Duke Ellington had lived, he
noted _ preparing to go to the bank and then his gym, when he
spotted a group of police officers, led by a policewoman, outside
the front door. White, 35, who was raised in Cincinnati and
attended the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music, said his
parents had taught him to be a gentleman, so he ``stepped forward
and opened the door.'' He said he thought the police had come
because an elderly person in his building had taken ill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White said, the officers said they were searching for
four Hispanic men in white T-shirts who were believed to have
weapons and to be dealing drugs. White saw two Hispanic men in the
lobby, one in a white T-shirt, whom he did not recognize. The
police say the officers discovered a kilogram of cocaine in the
lobby and arrested White, who was wearing a white T-shirt, along
with three other black men and the two Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors were vouching for us,'' White said. He said the
neighbors told the police, ``He's starring on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was taken with the others to the 33rd Precinct station
house.
</P>
<P>
   White said that as he waited in a cell, he became increasingly
distraught about missing his performance, and found himself weeping
from humiliation. ``I said, `Do you have any idea how hard I've
worked as a black man to be the star of a show?' The officer says,
`This is standard procedure.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two Hispanic men were charged with criminal drug possession.
White and the other men were not charged. But even after the police
realized that he was not involved, he said, he was kept in custody.
When he was finally released, White said, one officer apologized
and said, ``You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's where I live _ that's my home,''' White
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, White said, he had remained in his apartment,
except for a trip to buy a newspaper, because he was afraid to go
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was ``very seriously considering'' a lawsuit
against the police. ``I'm dealing with that issue in my job,'' he
said. ``And now it's in my personal life. It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ragtime,'' after Coalhouse is humiliated and the woman he
loves, the mother of his child, is killed, he becomes a
revolutionary and a bomber. Although he said he was still angry
about his arrest, he added, ``I can let my anger fester and make me
feel worse, or change it into confidence and fearlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the last song in ``Ragtime'' is called ``Make Them
Hear You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make them hear me,'' he said.

   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ On the fifth day of a search that
accompanied a great national wake, a red sonar blotch led searchers
to the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his two passengers,
trapped in the shattered fuselage of his plane on the floor of the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's remains were located about 2:30 a.m. by an underwater
camera checking objects detected by sonar. Several hours later,
Navy divers in heavy-duty gear moved the crumpled wreckage and
found the passengers from his flight through black haze last Friday
night _ his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and his
sister-in-law, Lauren G. Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery marked the conclusion of a frantic search that had
begun Saturday morning when Kennedy did not arrive at Martha's
Vineyard, where he had planned to land before attending a family
wedding. Rescuers fanned out by air, sea and land, over 9,000
square miles. The first certain clue to what had happened came
Saturday afternoon, when a luggage tag bearing the name of Lauren
Bessette washed ashore on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The three bodies were found at 116 feet, about seven miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard. At a news conference on Wednesday
night at the investigation's command center in nearby Bourne, Rear
Adm. Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard said that all three
victims were ``near and under'' the fuselage, still strapped in.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy boarded a Coast Guard
helicopter at his compound in nearby Hyannis Port and was taken to
the Navy salvage ship Grasp to witness the recovery. Senator
Kennedy was joined by his two sons, Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy and
Edward M. Kennedy Jr. The bodies were raised about 4:30 p.m. The
senator and his sons accompanied the bodies on Wednesday night to
the Coast Guard station in this fishing village at the heel of Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts State Police escorted the coroner's vans on
yet another dark Kennedy motorcade, this time to the Barnstable
County Medical Examiner's Office in nearby Pocasset, where the
bodies were to be prepared for return to the families. Senator
Kennedy remained at the office for about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the senator and his sons had ``made a request to
come out prior to the time that the victims were removed, and they
were on board for quite a while before we actually recovered the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The water temperature, about 52 degrees, helped preserve the
bodies, an investigator said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, 38, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga
with his wife and sister-in-law aboard when it was lost in the
Atlantic on Friday night. He had intended to drop Lauren Bessette
off at Martha's Vineyard, then fly on to Hyannis Port for the
Saturday wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family members, citing his wishes and hoping to avoid
having a spectacle made of Kennedy's final resting place, have
decided to have his body cremated and his ashes scattered at sea in
a Navy ceremony, a family adviser said. Plans call for the women to
be buried at sea as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy destroyer Briscoe, which had been training in the area,
moved toward Cape Cod for the burial at sea, which could take place
as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided after much debate to hold a private memorial
service. The service will be held in New York City at a Roman
Catholic church that Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, attended, the Church of St. Thomas More, on 89th Street
between Park and Madison. The church seats 350.
</P>
<P>
   The service, described in the family announcement as ``a Mass to
celebrate the lives of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and John F. Kennedy
Jr.,'' will be held at 11 a.m. Friday. The White House said
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, had argued in
favor of small service instead of a large service in a cathedral, a
family source said.
</P>
<P>
   A candelight memorial service for Lauren Bessette will be held
at 7 p.m. Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn. It, too, is
also by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Christopher C. Murray, said the divers made the recover in
difficult conditions; visibility was less than eight feet, the
current was strong and the ocean floor was littered with rocks and
boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who descended in elevator cages, were attached to
the Grasp by oxygen and radio lines, with divers standing by on the
ship in case one of those beneath got hurt or tangled in the
wreckage. Now that the bodies have been removed, divers will use
straps and cables to form slings around the pieces of plane before
hoisting them on the Grasp's boom, which can lift 40 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members
since the plane was reported missing, said he had authorized a
continuation of the unusually long search, which has been
criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national
lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained
in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few
more days,'' Clinton said on Wednesday afternoon during a news
conference on other topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am,'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the
right thing to do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the official announcement by the National
Transportation Safety Board, ``a large portion of the fuselage''
was discovered about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's body was identified within three hours. Then in a
45-minute dive that began just before noon on Wednesday, Navy
divers located the other two bodies. On Wednesday afternoon, a
second set of divers recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The debris field, which investigators call the plane's ``splash
point,'' is just off Gay Head, the western tip of Martha's
Vineyard, and near a private beach that was once owned by Mrs.
Onassis and left to her children.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of fuselage, about 8 to 10 feet long, was also
recovered on Wednesday night, Larrabee said. He said the propeller
was nearby, and said searchers found ``wires, seats, the kinds of
things that you can imagine that would be the result of a
high-impact contact with the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Kennedy's plane was plunging at 5,000 feet
per minute just before radar contact was lost Friday night, and
pilots and aviation authorities said the description that has been
provided seems to indicate a ``graveyard spiral,'' a corkscrew
descent in which the pilot becomes disoriented and, desperate to
right the plane, loses control.

</P>
<P>
   The death of Kennedy, who grew up before the nation from a rich
scion to a ruggedly glamorous entrepreneur, has provoked an
outpouring of mourning and nostalgia for America's best-known
political family. As crowds thronged the Kennedys' home in New York
and anyplace with a Kennedy connection, the John F. Kennedy Hyannis
Museum, operated by the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, added an
easel on Wednesday afternoon featuring a quote from President
Kennedy, who was assassinated three days before his son turned 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tied to the ocean,'' President Kennedy said in 1962 at
a dinner celebrating America's Cup. ``When we go back to the sea,
whether it is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence
we came.''
</P>
<P>
   Burial at sea is a ritual that extends back to the ancient
Greeks, who dropped a coin in the mouth of the deceased for the
toll at the River Styx. Paul L. Stillwell, the director of history
at the Naval Institute, a private educational organization, said
the service has become more rare now that bodies can be airlifted
off ships at sea. With a cremation, the ashes are allowed to blow
off the stern of the ship, to the accompaniment of three rifle
volleys, Stillwell said.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy official said ``commitment at sea,'' as the ceremony is
known, is typically performed for active or retired members of the
service, their spouses and their dependent children. But Navy
regulations allow for the service to be performed for ``notable
service or outstanding contributions to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said its investigation would continue for six to nine
more months. James Hall, the chairman, said the agency would make
no other comment until all memorial services were complete.

RUMORS PRECEDE MUSIC AT WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Spelling of ``Grifiss'' in 8th graf is correct.)

<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Psychedelic school buses are cruising through
downtown, raising eyebrows. Bands of wannabe hippies are illegally
camping in the woods on the outskirts of town, raising suspicion.
And rumors, benign and hideous, have already begun spreading around
town faster than blotters of brown acid.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the music is set to begin, Woodstock fever appears
to have gripped this city in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   As the bulk of an estimated 250,000 fans flow into the city by
car, train and plane for Woodstock '99, a three-day mega-concert of
more than 60 bands that begins Friday, Rome's streets have filled
with cruising police officers, giddy concertgoers and sleepless
Woodstock roadies. No bad things have happened so far; everyone
appears to be getting along swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   But Rome police officials have been keeping a gimlet eye on the
``very noticeable crowd'' of Woodstock devotees, Deputy Chief
Patrick Miller said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a certain style of dress up here, and these people are
dressed a little bit differently,'' Miller said. ``Most are wearing
tie-dye shirts, and their vehicles are a little bit different than
what you normally see in the city of Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrolling officers have already spotted dozens of young people
camping inside Rome's city limits as well as in the surrounding
woods, waiting for the show to start, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are peaceful, cooperative and rather articulate,''
Miller said. ``They seem to have had life experiences that are
somewhat interesting, and they seem able to verbalize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, all 74 Rome police officers will be on duty this
weekend, supplementing 500 state troopers, many of whom have been
borrowed from their Buffalo and Long Island stations to control
traffic along the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and to keep order on
local highways. A sprinkling of special agents from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is also said to be on duty for Woodstock
'99, set to start on the grounds of what was once Griffiss Air
Force Base, a former Cold War nerve center for a nuclear attack on
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Rome's 40,000 residents are excited to have Woodstock in
their back yard. Local officials have even started referring to the
tattooed, tie-dyed concert fans here as Rome's links to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having all these people coming to our little town is very,
very exciting,'' said Phyllis Domenico, 60, a retired secretary
born and reared in Rome. ``Something big hasn't happened here in a
long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Domenico has heard some of the good rumors, mostly
concerning celebrity sightings. ``Somebody said Willie Nelson was
in town and had dinner at one of our restaurants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more serious rumors have caught the police's attention.
There is the unsubstantiated rumor that someone at the concert is
planning to stab people at random with an H.I.V.-tainted hospital
needle. Another rumor concerns an actual execution-style double
murder at a Pennsylvania campground Wednesday. The police, the
story goes, are concerned that the suspects, two hitchhikers, may
be on their way to the concert.
</P>
<P>
   But city and concert officials said there was no reason to think
the fugitives were coming to Woodstock. ``If someone got killed in
Ohio right now, they'd probably blame it on Woodstock,'' said
Hayley Sumner, a concert publicist.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the concert weekend has caused only a few minor
complications for local residents like Joey Surace. Surace is the
man responsible for luring 110 former high-school classmates back
to Rome this weekend for the Rome Free Academy's 30-year reunion.
He thinks Woodstock is helping raise attendance. ``I think it's
acting as a plus, dragging some guys back that are going to both''
the reunion and the concert, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one will be allowed into the concert site, which unfolds
between a B-52 runway and two cavernous airplane hangars, until
noon Thursday. As beer trucks and workers buzzed around their
offices, in an old Federal Aviation Administration building, the
Woodstock press office hummed like a not-so-well-oiled machine,
handling hundreds of calls from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian arriving this week after hitchhiking from the
Northwest Territories said he was a reporter for a backwoods weekly
newspaper, said Ms. Sumner, the Woodstock '99 publicist. Until the
start of the concert, the man is working as a cook in a local
diner, she said.

spotted a group of police officers, led by a policewoman, outside
the front door. White, 35, who was raised in Cincinnati and
attended the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music, said his
parents had taught him to be a gentleman, so he ``stepped forward
and opened the door.'' He said he thought the police had come
because an elderly person in his building had taken ill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White said, the officers said they were searching for
four Hispanic men in white T-shirts who were believed to have
weapons and to be dealing drugs. White saw two Hispanic men in the
lobby, one in a white T-shirt, whom he did not recognize. The
police say the officers discovered a kilogram of cocaine in the
lobby and arrested White, who was wearing a white T-shirt, along
with three other black men and the two Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors were vouching for us,'' White said. He said the
neighbors told the police, ``He's starring on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was taken with the others to the 33rd Precinct station
house.
</P>
<P>
   White said that as he waited in a cell, he became increasingly
distraught about missing his performance, and found himself weeping
from humiliation. ``I said, `Do you have any idea how hard I've
worked as a black man to be the star of a show?' The officer says,
`This is standard procedure.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two Hispanic men were charged with criminal drug possession.
White and the other men were not charged. But even after the police
realized that he was not involved, he said, he was kept in custody.
When he was finally released, White said, one officer apologized
and said, ``You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's where I live _ that's my home,''' White
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, White said, he had remained in his apartment,
except for a trip to buy a newspaper, because he was afraid to go
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was ``very seriously considering'' a lawsuit
against the police. ``I'm dealing with that issue in my job,'' he
said. ``And now it's in my personal life. It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ragtime,'' after Coalhouse is humiliated and the woman he
loves, the mother of his child, is killed, he becomes a
revolutionary and a bomber. Although he said he was still angry
about his arrest, he added, ``I can let my anger fester and make me
feel worse, or change it into confidence and fearlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the last song in ``Ragtime'' is called ``Make Them
Hear You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make them hear me,'' he said.

KENNEDYS PLAN BURIAL AT SEA FOR JFK JR. AS BODIES RECOVERED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOE STINEBAKER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ The bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and sister-in-law were recovered Wednesday from the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean where they had lain inside their crashed plane for
nearly five days. As the bodies were recovered, the Kennedy family
made plans for a burial at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of JFK Jr., 38, his 33-year-old wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, 35-year-old Lauren Bessette, were
placed aboard a Coast Guard cutter and brought ashore to waiting
cars from the local medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Three of JFK Jr.'s relatives were aboard the cutter when the
bodies were recovered _ Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
his two sons, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Edward
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the bodies ended five days of sorrowful vigil
for the Kennedy and Bessette families and set the stage for
ceremonies to say goodbye to their loved ones. The Kennedys will
hold a memorial Friday morning in New York City, and the Bessettes
announced a memorial service will be held Saturday in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported late Wednesday that the Kennedy family had plans to
bury JFK Jr. at sea, possibly Thursday morning in a ceremony off
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today we were able to bring closure to two families,
and I think that, we realize, is very important,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee. ``I think it's amazing we were able to get to
this point.``
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the three bodies were ``in or near'' an 8-10 foot
section of the Kennedy plane's fuselage, and were still strapped
in.
</P>
<P>
   The victims and the section of fuselage, which included the
plane's instrument panel, were brought to the surface about 4:30
p.m. EDT, about six hours after they were first identified by Navy
divers searching for the plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys had been picked up by a Coast Guard helicopter at
the family compound at Hyannis Port about 1 p.m. and taken to the
wreckage site. Ships, helicopters and airplanes in the area were
barred from coming within five miles of the recovery ship.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were to be examined by the medical examiner's office
and soon returned to their families.
</P>
<P>
   The successful recovery followed days of often frustrating
searches involving ships and personnel from the Coast Guard, Navy
and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although
investigators believed they had promising leads on the wreckage
location as early as Monday, the recovery efforts moved relatively
slowly until late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said search ships identified ``a major piece of
wreckage'' 116 feet below the surface about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
Searchers then anchored a naval recovery ship above the wreckage
about 7 1/2 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard, within sight of
the former summer home of JFK Jr.'s mother, former first lady
Jacqueline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   After several surveys by a remote-operated vehicle equipped with
cameras Wednesday morning, searchers were able to confirm they had
found the main body of the plane. At 10:30 a.m., two Navy divers
tethered to the USS Grasp descended to the wreckage for about 45
minutes and were able to locate and find the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, searchers achieved their primary goal and had the
three bodies recovered from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the bodies were brought to the surface ``in a way
that I think respected the situation we were in. It was something
we were very sensitive about.``
</P>
<P>
   Officials said efforts to recover other pieces of the plane,
which shattered on impact with the water after a 30-second
freefall, will continue for several days.
</P>
<P>
   According to radar data turned over to the National
Transportation Safety Board, the flight's last minute was a
harrowing experience.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. and his passengers took off at 8:38 p.m. Friday from the
Essex County airport in Fairfield, N.J. The three were en route to
the Martha's Vineyard airport, where the Kennedys planned to drop
off Bessette and continue on to Hyannis Port, where the couple was
to attend Saturday's wedding of JFK Jr.'s cousin _ 30-year-old Rory
Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, radar information showed the plane traveling at
5,600 feet, just 34 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport. The
plane then began descending at about 700 feet per second, a descent
rate experts say is about typical. After about five minutes, the
plane was within 20 miles of the airport at 2,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the plane's actions become more puzzling. NTSB
officials said JFK Jr.'s plane turned to the right, off course from
the airport and climbed to 2,600 feet. After one minute, the plane
turned to the right again and began plummeting toward the ocean at
more than 5,000 feet per minute, a rate experts have described as a
freefall or ``death spiral.'' About 30 seconds later, the plane
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, state and federal agencies launched a
massive search effort, giving up hope of finding survivors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the bodies of the victims recovered Wednesday,
attention turned almost immediately to memorial services and
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family sources said Wednesday night that Sen. Kennedy
had requested and obtained permission from the Navy to have his
nephew buried at sea, and the naval destroyer USS Briscoe was
reported en route to Cape Cod. It was not known whether the sea
burial plans included JFK Jr.'s wife.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for several memorial services were firmed up Wednesday
afternoon, however. The first service was planned by the Emerald
Isle Immigration Society, an Irish group in New York City. That
service was scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at old St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy and Bessette families also planned private services
for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   A service for JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy will be held
at 11 a.m. Friday at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan.
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have said
they will attend.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for Lauren Bessette will take place at 7 p.m.
Saturday at the Christ Church in the Bessette's hometown of
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences for the Kennedy family can be sent to Sen. Kennedy's
office at 315 Russell Senate Building, Washington, D.C., 20510.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended the search and recovery efforts at a
news conference Wednesday, saying the efforts were ``consistent
with what would have been done in any other case.'' Clinton said
the effort was warranted because of the Kennedy family's ``role in
our national lives, and because of the enormous losses that they
have sustained in our lifetimes.``

WEBSTOCK '99 : HOUSTON COMPANY TO WEBCAST WOODSTOCK'S EMERGING
ARTISTS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The phone is ringing off the wall at the AMP3.com
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual there. With the Woodstock '99 Festival taking
place this weekend in upstate New York, people from all over the
country are trying to reach the upstart Houston company, which
bills itself as ``the Internet's fastest-growing independent artist
site.''
</P>
<P>
   AMP3.com will begin Webcasting from Woodstock on Friday. In
addition to presenting excerpts of the main stage acts, the company
is producing the festival's Emerging Artist stage. Performances on
this stage will be Webcast in their entirety 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Friday
through Sunday at www.amp3.com.
</P>
<P>
   But one phone call is not strictly about Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael,'' calls out a receptionist, ``Bruce Pilato with
Emerson, Lake and Palmer holding on Line 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sharp, a former musician and computer consultant who
launched AMP3.com in February, apologizes to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really got to take this call. It won't take long,'' he
promises.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Greg Lake, a partner in the British classic-rock
firm of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, is interested in posting one of
his unreleased recordings on the AMP3.com site, where fans can
listen to the music in ``real time'' or download it into highly
compressed MP3 computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, who combines a salesman's spiel with computer-geek savvy,
listens impatiently to the voice on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah. Been there, done that and ate the baloney,'' Sharp
tells Pilato, who manages ELP, Foreigner and other veteran rock
bands as well as a couple of the unsigned acts performing on the
Emerging Artist stage.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation briefly turns to one of these new acts, then
comes back to Lake's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, please,'' Sharp urgently concludes. ``Get back to me this
afternoon. I want to put it up as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He hangs up the phone and shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what I mean? It's been kind of hectic around here this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, there is nothing to distinguish AMP3.com
fromother tenants in an industrial office complex overlooking a
quiet fishing pond in the Houston community of Kingwood, which is
about 20 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But in five months, the company has charged to the front lines
of the technological revolution that is well on the way to turning
the music industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, 41, founded AMP3.com with financial backing from his
brother-in-law, Nigel Brassington, who was looking to diversify
after years in the oil drilling business. Brassington has since
become an active partner in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this?'' says Sharp, holding up a Rio PMP300, the first
portable music player, which allows Internet users to take MP3
computer files with them wherever they go, like a Sony Walkman
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's what folks have been saying about the Internet
for the past six years. It's also what the major record companies,
retail record stores and radio stations are afraid of.
</P>
<P>
   If artists can promote and distribute their music directly to
consumers, who needs the middle men?
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up a whole new paradigm,'' says Sharp. ``It's a way
for independent artists to get heard, with instant delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the record industry unsuccessfully attempted to keep
the Rio PMP300, produced by Diamond Multimedia, off the market on
the grounds that it encourages musical piracy. This year, the five
biggest record labels reached an agreement with the consumer
electronics and computer industries on a modified MP3 format that
will contain a security system to prevent illegal downloading and
copying.
</P>
<P>
   The new format will help protect copyrights and pay artists
royalties on electronically delivered music.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the MP3.com Web site _ named for the technology but not
affiliated with MP3's developers, and not to be confused with
AMP3.com _ has refused to cooperate with the record industry
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3.com site offers a library of 100,000 songs by about
18,000 musicians, the vast majority of whom are relatively unknown
and unsigned by major labels. The site averages 325,000 visitors a
day, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, MP3.com made an initial public stock offering. The
company's shares more than doubled in value in its first day of
trading, despite concerns that its appeal will fade after the major
labels start selling music by well-known artists online later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes AMP3.com from MP3.com is that at AMP3,
artists get paid whenever anyone downloads their song. This is more
attractive to former stars such as Lake, who don't have record
deals and don't get played on the radio but are still looking to
get their music out to fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a musician,'' says Sharp, who spent his younger years
playing in cover bands and still keeps a guitar and keyboard in his
office.

BASEBALL PREPARED TO ACCEPT UMPIRES' RESIGNATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major League Baseball is prepared to accept its
umpires' resignations and could take that step as early as Friday,
a person with knowledge of the baseball officials' thinking said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials moved closer to that decision as more umpires
tried to rescind their resignations. Another umpire said that
Richie Phillips, the head of the umpires' union, did not spell out
at their meeting last week the peril that umpires faced if they did
sign letters of resignation. Phillips disputes that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig, his chief aides and the league
presidents have all maintained complete silence on the umpires'
action and their likely response; they apparently feel their
silence has worked in their favor as the umpires stew among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have not communicated with the umpires or
Phillips. But the officials have been talking daily among
themselves and the person familiar with their thinking said Selig
is close to making decisions on when to accept the resignations,
whether to accept them totally or selectively, whether to accept
the revocations of the resignations and when to start hiring new
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The person privy to the hierarchy's thinking said that while
nothing was definite, Friday could be the day the umpires receive
notification advising them that their resignations have been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't interpret whether that's a low blow or not,'' Jerry
Davis, a National League umpiring crew chief, said in Miami. ``I
think it's all part of a negotiating posture.''
</P>
<P>
   When Richie Phillips was asked about the prospect of something's
happening Friday, he said, ``That is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Five American League umpires had written letters rescinding
their resignations earlier this week. Two National League umpires,
Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, sent similar letters Thursday as did
Tim Welke of the American League, another umpire said.
</P>
<P>
   The leagues received 54 letters of resignation last Thursday, 34
from NL umpires, 20 from AL umpires. There are 68 umpires in the
majors. Mark Hirschbeck and Greg Bonin were the only two members of
the NL staff who did not sign letters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 10 union members from the American League who did not,
an umpire said, were Joe Brinkman, Drew Coble and Jim McKean, all
crew chiefs, and Terry Craft, John Hirschbeck, Tim McClelland and
Durwood Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips declined to comment on the efforts of some
umpires to withdraw their resignations. The mass resignations,
which occurred at a meeting in Philadelphia the day after the
All-Star Game, was a negotiating tactic, Dave Phillips, an A.L.
umpire since 1970, said Wednesday. At the urging of Richie
Phillips, the umpire said, the union members signed the letters in
an attempt to induce Major League Baseball to begin negotiations
with them for a new labor contract. The current contract expires
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dave Phillips, an A.L. umpire, said, they were told that
the letters were not going to be sent to the league offices and
they weren't told that the resignations were irrevocable if Major
League Baseball chose to accept them. The umpires apparently
thought that because the resignations weren't effective until Sept.
2, they could withdraw them until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in that room thought they were going to be signed
but not sent,'' said Phillips, 1 of 14 umpires who voted last
February to oust Richie Phillips as their union leader. ``Some guys
called me the next day and said they haven't been sent, have
they?''
</P>
<P>
   But they were faxed to the league offices that day, last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips, one of the five umpires who rescinded
resignations before Wednesday, said that until he spoke with his
own lawyer, he had not understand the ramifications of his letter,
that he no longer had control over his future employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never told to the guys in the room that this was
irrevocable, that guys were literally resigning their jobs
immediately,'' Phillips said by telephone from his home in
Missouri. ``Our attorney never told us that, and in fact indicated
we could tear it up. It's very upsetting to me that someone would
lead you down this path.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Dave Phillips' view of the meeting, Richie Phillips
said, ``It's nonsense, all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not all umpires shared Dave Phillips' view.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at Yankee Stadium whether he knew his resignation could be
accepted at any time, Tim Tschida said, ``We were aware of it.''
Asked why he was willing to take the chance, he said, ``Based on my
faith in our representatives and the ability of our umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips was obviously counting on baseball officials
being reluctant to go without the regular umpires, but they seem
prepared to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips said he thought Richie Phillips should resign
because ``it's been a disaster.'' Then noting the strong support
Phillips has in the National League, he said, ``There are probably
a lot of National League guys who are following him on top of that
ship and I have a strong feeling that the ship is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the nine-member board of directors of the Major League
Umpires Association had a conference call Wednesday and stood
solidly behind their leader. ``There's no threat of Richie losing
his job,'' Terry Tata, in his 27th year as an N.L. umpire, said in
Montreal after the call. ``We're solidly behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   The intramural fighting is not good for the umpires' cause, Tata
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Selig sees infighting, he knows, `We've got these
guys on the run,''' Tata said. ``They're not going to come to the
bargaining table if they see that. So we have to get our house in
order.''

A LOOK INSIDE THE MP3 FILE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: What is MP3?
</P>
<P>
   A: MP3 is a computer file format that's used to record and play
back sound. These days, it's mostly used for music. The acronym
stands for MPEG-1 Layer 3, which is a standard for recording images
and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is it suddenly so popular?
</P>
<P>
   A: MP3 actually has been around since the early '90s. But it
didn't become popular until about two years ago. Computer-game
players first picked the format up because they wanted to listen to
their favorite music CDs while playing games, which also come on
CDs. The problem: one CD drive, two CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Then musicians without recording contracts realized they could
get more exposure by posting songs online in MP3 format. This drew
in fans of new and underground music.
</P>
<P>
   There are also technical reasons why MP3s are popular. The files
are relatively small when compared to other audio formats, such as
the popular WAV format found on computers that use Microsoft
Windows. On average, a minute of music in the MP3 file format takes
up about one megabyte. This makes MP3s relatively quick and easy to
download from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are MP3 files illegal?
</P>
<P>
   A: MP3 files themselves are not illegal. If an artist has
recorded a song and agreed to allow it to be posted on the
Internet, then downloading and transmitting in MP3 format is legal.
</P>
<P>
   But if a song is posted that has not been approved by either an
artist or his or her label, that constitutes a copyright
infringement and is not legal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought record companies were trying to crack down on MP3
files.
</P>
<P>
   A: The record industry is not happy about the explosion of MP3
technology, largely because they believe it leaves them open to
rampant music piracy. The recording industry unsuccessfully tried
to stop the launch of the first portable MP3 player, Diamond
Multimedia's Rio, on the grounds that the device would promote and
encourage piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry, along with major music hardware vendors
who make the MP3 players, have come up with a new music file
format, which includes a security system for ensuring that songs
are not illegally traded. Future portable music players will
recognize this digital watermark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get MP3 files?
</P>
<P>
   A: You actually can make your own from your CD collection, using
the right software (see next question) on your personal computer.
This is legal so long as you do not trade, sell or publicly post
the MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   You also can download software from dozens of Web sites that
publicly post MP3 files. Among them are Houston's AMP3.com,
MP3.com, Rioport.com and nomadworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   There also are dozens more sites on the Web set up by

A SPEAKER UNDER PRESSURE BESEECHES THE MEMBERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y., Mich., Texas)  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One after another, all afternoon Wednesday, House
Republican dissidents were summoned to the office of Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, who sought their votes to pass a $792 billion tax
cut, the centerpiece of the leadership's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert asked what problems they had with the bill. He discussed
economics. He talked about the importance of tax cutting to the
Republican Party. He told skeptics that the bill was only an
opening step, a bargaining position in the negotiations yet to come
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Republican moderates held out throughout the long
afternoon and into the evening, until many were satisfied by a
concession linking part of the tax cut to a reduction in the
national debt. Even a fellow Illinoisan, Rep. John Edward Porter,
would not succumb at first to Hastert's pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did explain to the speaker that my constituents are saying
to me, `Fix Social Security, fix Medicare, pay down the debt,' that
tax cuts come in fourth place,'' Porter said on emerging from
Hastert's office late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The one-on-one sessions were just one element of an intense
lobbying campaign waged by Hastert and his leadership team as they
tried to keep an assortment of Republican moderates and
conservatives from jeopardizing a piece of legislation that was
supposed to be the crown jewel of the Republican program.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was not just the Republican agenda but also the
credibility of Hastert as speaker. And he came close to pointedly
telling his colleagues just that. Republicans said that on Tuesday,
at the party's morning caucus, he told them in unusually personal
terms that he needed their votes for the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican involved in the vote-gathering said House leaders
were also turning to officials of the Republican National Committee
and to party donors, asking them to telephone members. The message
was implicit: that campaign support for the holdouts could be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, when the 40 or so moderate Republicans who call
themselves the Tuesday Group emerged from their weekly lunch, they
found lobbyists from the National Association of Manufacturers and
the National Association of Homebuilders waiting for them, to argue
in favor of the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty for the leaders was the pure arithmetic
of pushing anything through a House in which the Republicans hold
one of the smallest majorities of this century. Their edge is only
five seats after Rep. Michael Forbes of New York defected to the
Democrats on Saturday, charging that his party was run by
extremists. Uncertain whether they would draw any Democratic votes
over to their tax bill, the Republicans could afford to lose only
four votes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The day was made more difficult by the fact that tax cuts, which
once served as the glue holding together the various elements of
the Republican Party, no longer work like cement. In the new age of
surplus politics, some moderates say they are determined not to do
anything that might cause renewed budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the rubber hits the road,'' declared Rep. Fred
Upton, R-Mich., who had been pushing for assurances that the tax
cut would not relegate debt reduction to second place and risk
deficits' return. ``These are real decisions on budget strategy and
tax changes, and we need to be honest with the American people
about where this debate is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Republican spectrum, some conservatives
as well were threatening to vote against the bill. Their problem
was that it would not fully eliminate the so-called marriage
penalty, which results in some married couples' paying more in
taxes than they together would pay if they were single. Republican
leaders were trying to placate the moderates in part by promising
to adopt a nonbinding provision pronouncing debt reduction a
priority of the party. Indeed, Wednesday night they were hammering
out a more stringent provision making full implementation of the
tax cut contingent on government progress in lowering the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, insisted
that the leadership would yet prevail. ``You always know how many
horses are in the herd,'' Armey said as he went off to another
meeting in the early evening. ``It's just a question of how long it
takes to get them into the barn.''

HOUSTON: in his office.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These other guys (competitors) are database programmers. I
think I have more empathy for the artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``A'' in AMP3.com stands for ``artist.'' Songs by
more than 4,000 performers are posted on the site, which receives
an average of 18,000-20,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's innovation _ based on the model of radio stations airing
commercials between hit records _ is to allow advertisers to put a
five-second jingle at the beginning of each piece of music posted
on his site.
</P>
<P>
   Artists then receive a nickel each time someone hits on their
song, according to Sharp. If 1,000 people anywhere in the world
check out a particular tune on a given day, that artist has made
$50. If the number of hits eventually adds up to 10,000, then the
artist has made $500.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much, but it's better than giving the work away for
free. (At MP3.com, artists make money when customers order a full
CD. Artists set the prices on their own albums and split the money
evenly with the site.)
</P>
<P>
   AMP3.com's growing list of advertisers includes computer giants
Apple and Microsoft as well as instrument manufacturers such as
Fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking to sell a product, it's not that efficient.
It's only five seconds,'' says Barry Raskin of Creative Labs, an
AMP3.com advertiser and co-sponsor of the Woodstock Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your main objective is brand awareness, it'll benefit you
there. You do get the brand impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs, which specializes in sound and graphics hardware
for computers, has introduced its own portable music player called
Nomad, similar to the Rio PMP300. The company is hoping it will be
a hot seller around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   As on MP3.com, most of the artists on AMP3.com are relatively
unknown. But Sharp is looking to bring in more established acts. He
foresees the day when AMP3.com will offer tour support to bands,
similar to the financial underwriting now offered by record labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a farmer,'' says Sharp, unconsciously echoing the words of
the late Max Yasgur at the original Woodstock gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a talent farmer. I want to grow some new talent, and I
want to help some talent that has grown to bloom again.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for artists is protecting their intellectual
property rights. If Internet users can download music for free,
then copy it to portable computer files or compact discs, the
artists lose out, as well as the record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Like most artist managers, Gold Mountain Entertainment's Ron
Stone is less concerned about the future of the record label cartel
than he is about making sure his artists get paid. Stone was
introduced to Sharp by a client, recording artist Tom Cochrane, who
now has songs on AMP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are two issues here,'' says Stone, who manages
Bonnie Raitt, Tracy Chapman, Ziggy Marley, Rodney Crowell and Nanci
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1 is to make sure we get paid our fair share of royalties.
The second issue is promotion and marketing. There is so much going
on on the Internet. How is anyone going to know where to buy music
on the Internet if they don't already know what they want?''
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, he doesn't foresee any overnight demise of
the major record labels and the retail record business. But Stone
was impressed enough with AMP3.com that he recommended Sharp to his
friend John Scher, one of the co-producers of Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aspect of the Internet that's yet to be fully
explored,'' Stone says of the Woodstock Webcast. ``I thought this
could serve the interests of Woodstock, and it could serve the
interests of AMP3.com.''
</P>
<P>
   AMP3.com's technology partner, 21e Web Network Inc., will stream
music from the Emerging Artist stage through the Web site.
Better-known artists signed to appear there include the
Supersuckers, Ben Lee and the Chris Perez Band. AMP3.com also will
host a 10,000-square-foot tent at the festival where fans can
e-mail friends around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to mention, the Luddite hippies playing in the mud at
the first Woodstock festival wouldn't have known what to make of
this revolutionary digital music technology. But many of them would
have recognized the name Greg Lake, whose acoustic live version of
``Lucky Man'' was Thursday's pick hit on AMP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the Internet has been for all of us?'' says
Sharp. ``It's a catch-up thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we didn't know how to use the Net. Now we are
learning what we can do with the Net. One of those things is
instant music.'' &QL;

THE JOY OF CABLE:  
</HEADLINE>
 TV-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>

   &QL; 
PASADENA, Calif. _ Laughter, joy and loneliness and sex and sex and
sex and sex.
</P>
<P>
   You know that as a lyric from ``Shattered,'' the Rolling Stones
song. But it also serves as a pretty good description of what
you'll find on cable television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cable networks spent Thursday through Sunday here trotting out
their major fall offerings to television critics. As fewer people
watch the major networks, think of cable as a school of piranhas,
dozens of tiny mouths nibbling at you all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Some sharper than others.
</P>
<P>
   You won't watch all of it. You may not watch much of it. If you
don't have cable, you won't watch any of it. But there are some
interesting projects out there.
</P>
<P>
   We might as well start with the sex. You'll find that _ and
plenty of it _ in ``The History of Sex,'' a five-part special shown
on consecutive nights beginning Aug. 16 on the History Channel, of
all places, a channel known more for its military bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be watching five hours of History Channel and see
only one exploding battleship,'' said Charlie Maday, the vice
president for historical programming. ``And I can't remember why we
put that in. It's a tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because it's the History Channel doesn't mean there
won't be flesh aplenty. Just, you know, tastefully done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line,'' Maday said. ``We are the History Channel,
we're not a pay service. So we have to be careful. But it's
probably more explicit than anything I've seen, let's say, on
public television or Discovery or A&AMP;E or anything like that. . . .
When you present a program called ``The History of'' ``Sex,'' you
have to deliver a little bit. I mean, you can't disappoint the
audience and have no sex in it. So it has sex in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Point taken. Put the kids to bed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Maday's comments, laughter comes from, not
surprisingly, Comedy Central. The network will again cover the
presidential race in its own inimitable style with ``Indecision
2000.'' The mainstay of the coverage will be ``The Daily Show,''
hosted by the brilliant Jon Stewart, who leads a team of hilarious
correspondents, including Ben Stein.
</P>
<P>
   What, no Al Franken or Chris Rock, previous contributors to
campaign coverage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al might do something,'' Stewart said. ``I think Chris
is out of the business now. I haven't heard from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Always important for your lead person to be well-informed.
</P>
<P>
   On a somewhat more serious note, if anything Stewart says can be
taken seriously, he said he's not worried about ``Indecision 2000''
hitting below the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are times you step over a line when you're in the
mix and things are happening fast and furious,'' he said, ``I think
the truth is, we, as fake journalists, exercise far more restraint
than the (real) journalists I see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you, I watched the coverage of Columbine,
and when those kids, scared as they were, got off that bus, coming
out of that school, I thought they were being reunited with their
friends and camera crews. I've never seen anything like it, and we
didn't make one joke about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as far as the depths, I think we've got a long way to go
towards the bottom until we take on the actual ethics of real
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   For joy, the Disney Channel's new series ``The Jersey'' has
potential. Each week, a 13-year-old boy (Michael Galeota) and his
girl cousin (Courtnee Draper) will be transported, by way of a
magical jersey they inherited, into the bodies of famous sports
stars, such as Lisa Leslie and Jason Seahorn. (It's Galeota, by the
way, who becomes Leslie.)
</P>
<P>
   Although after the women's World Cup, perhaps Disney should
change the title (and the method of transport) to ``The Black
Sports Bra.''
</P>
<P>
   And to represent loneliness, who better than Geraldo Rivera? In
1997, he and his family set out for an on-again, off-again sailing
trip around the world. This being Geraldo's family, the voyage has
been exceedingly well documented. He plans to ring in the new year
by crossing the international date line at midnight on Dec. 31. The
Travel Channel will broadcast ``Sail to'' ``the Century With
Geraldo Rivera,'' two one-hour specials about the trip, beginning
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a traditional travel documentary,'' Rivera said. ``I
think of it as ``National Geographic Meets the Loud Family.'' . . .
It's as much of a journey of the soul, it's as much an evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you ask, what's lonely? That's easy. The television set when
``Sail to'' ``the Century'' is on. &QL;

REJECTION STINGS; REJECTION FROM KIDS HURT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I always thought I was a pro at handling rejection.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the engraving says on the Loser
Championship Cup that proudly rests on the mantel of my fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, I had four boyfriends who turned out to be gay,
two of whom eventually dated each other.
</P>
<P>
   I have enough ``Thanks for asking, but you suck'' letters from
book publishers to wallpaper my office, and that's above and beyond
the ones my agent sends me in a crisp brown envelope every week.
</P>
<P>
   So you understand why I thought I had seen it all, had touched
and been singed by the flames of multiple humiliations and have
lived to tell the tales.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out I didn't know anything.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know the first thing about heartbreak until the moment,
two weeks ago, that I saw my nephew Nicholas, 3, wipe my kiss from
his mouth with the back of his dimpled baby hand.
</P>
<P>
   At first I had the ego to laugh. ``Did I tickle you?'' I asked
as he looked at me from his car seat in my sister's minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why did you just do that?'' I inquired.
</P>
<P>
   He took a deep breath, rolled his eyes and said plainly, ``Your
kisses are YUCKY.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I've heard that before from one of those
aforementioned boyfriends who considered the affections of someone
named Alan far more delightful. But this time it really hurt.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew is supposed to be my little pal. I'm the Good-Time
Aunt; I bring him a toy every time I see him to bribe his love. I
know that works, because when I was little, my Auntie Ida and my
Uncle Jimmy used to bring me toys every single time they visited.
On one occasion, I got so excited to see them that I fell down a
whole flight of stairs, punched out my eye and very nearly
alleviated the need for future orthodontic work by smacking my two
tiny buck teeth against the big wooden banister at the bottom of
the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   I laid in a minuscule, yet effective, pool of my own blood for
what seemed like an hour, but that's how much I loved them. I would
have killed myself for those toys, and despite the fact that half
my face looked like an eggplant, I gathered up enough strength to
lift my head off the floor when they finally came through the front
door to gasp, ``What did you bring me?''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of aunt I set out to be. I wanted that
kid to figuratively throw himself down a flight of stairs because
he loves me so much. But this child _ blood of my blood, flesh of
my flesh _ considered my love a vile, ``vile'' thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas,'' my sister beckoned from the front seat, ``give
Aunt Laurie a kiss. Please. PLEASE.''
</P>
<P>
   His expression drew upwards and then back, he uttered a
high-pitched ``Oh, why?'' and promptly burst into tears, thrashing
his head back and forth and finally pummeling the armrest of his
car seat with a pudgy fist.
</P>
<P>
   I briefly entertained the thought of saying, ``I paid for that
kiss with that $19.95 Tarzan Tree House Playset I just bought
you!'' but instead, I got myself together, choked back the tears
and simply waved good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   I called him when I got home, just to make sure that things were
still OK between us, but my sister relayed that he couldn't come to
the phone, although I heard him happily playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he has a headache,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, we met at my Nana's to have supper, and
Nicholas greeted me at the door, wearing a felt loincloth of sorts,
a necklace of plastic teeth and carrying a spear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaaaaaahhhh!'' he yelled, beating his bare little chest. ``I'm
Tarzan! You be tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that we had made tremendous strides since it had been
publicly announced that my mouth held the appeal of an ashtray, I
quickly agreed, hunkering down on all fours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad tiger!'' he yelled as all 34 pounds of him leapt from the
couch onto my back with the herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna get you, tiger!'' he shrieked, running from the far
corner of the room and body slamming me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad tiger to get out Nana's house,'' he said, picking up two
wooden drumsticks from his play wagon and pointing them at my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait!'' I screamed as he came running toward me. ``Could we
not use props, please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's props?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can make Aunt Laurie bleed or result in her
wearing diapers and living at Grandma's house again,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You silly,'' Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes I am,'' I replied. ``But when you grow up, they call it
manic depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas,'' my sister called. ``It's time for supper, get
dressed now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Lord of the Flies,'' I said as looked for his
clothes. ``Let's get you changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nooo!!!'' he screamed with all of his might. ``Not Aunt
Laurie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' my sister asked.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I never saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``She too fat,'' he said, then turned and pointed to my belly.
</P>
<P>
   The room suddenly stood still. No one _ my sister, my
brother-in-law, my nana, me _ no one said a word. It was as if my
boob had just suddenly popped out of my shirt and was hanging
there, the silence was that stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas,'' my sister finally said quietly between clenched
teeth, ``say you're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mean it, he's 3, I told myself as I realized that
maybe I really was one meal away from being trapped inside my
house, spending the remainder of my days on a king-size bed with
dirty sheets, hugging a bucket of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas lifted his little shoulders in a shrug and said, ``I'm
sorry you fat, Aunt Laurie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about trying to find a big enough casket when my
fat finally kills me,'' I said to my family. ``Just drain Mom and
Dad's pool, roll me in and fill it in with some gravel. I'm totally
fine with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ``three,'''' my sister said with a weak grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' I said, shaking my head. ``But how much more can I
take?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six to nine pounds more?'' she asked. ``By next March?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought about it, nodding. ``Eight months?'' I smiled. ``I
think I could probably lose some weight by then.'' &QL;

   It will be a beach party for the tourists, college kids and San
Diego County socialites who set the unique tone at Del Mar
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a heavy study day for the serious handicappers
who bet most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this afternoon's 60th opening-day races at Del
Mar will mark the debut of a new main-track surface, installed
after the 1998 season in which six horses fatally broke down in a
notorious one-week span.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar officials are happy with the early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the track has been great,'' said trainer Jenine Sahadi,
whose horses have been working out at Del Mar for more than a week.
``The (soil) doesn't stick to the bottom of a horse's foot like it
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the new track should be safer for horses, it might be
more treacherous for horseplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Some tracks favor front-runners, and others favor
stretch-runners. Some favor horses from inside post positions, and
others favor the outside. Some show the same tendencies from day to
day and others are inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   The question a handicapper must answer during the 42-day season,
the sooner the better, is whether Del Mar racing is affected by the
new soil composition, and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it might be,'' said Steve Wood, track superintendent at
Del Mar and Santa Anita. ``I'm not sure which way. I'm hoping it's
almost identical to the way Santa Anita's races are run. Santa
Anita is a pretty fair racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's track, over the years, has been thought to favor
horses rallying on the outside. Sahadi thinks the new surface will
continue to put a premium on stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think you'll have to be a fit horse (to win),'' Sahadi
said. ``Good horses are working fast. Bad horses are working slow.
That's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wood said he thinks the new surface will prove to be less
tiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as forgiving as I've ever seen it,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The new surface has more fine sand and less silt and clay, which
gives it a lighter brown appearance and should simplify
maintenance, promoting day-to-day consistency. A new layer of
limestone 15 inches below the surface should prevent soft spots
such as the ones found near the rail at the 6-furlong pole and near
the finish line when core samples were taken following last season.
</P>
<P>
   Director of racing Tom Robbins said Del Mar Thoroughbred Club
might have resurfaced the track even if the '98 injuries hadn't
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve horses had to be destroyed after injuring themselves in
races or workouts last summer. That was actually two fewer than the
average for the previous three years. But the damage to Del Mar, in
terms of unflattering newspaper and TV coverage, was done by six
deaths in the first six days of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Track conditions were only one of the factors cited when the
California Horse Racing Board investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar officials hope the racing itself will get most of the
attention this season, when more than $17 million in purses will be
on the line again.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly $6 million stakes schedule is headed by the $1
million Pacific Classic on Aug. 29. The 1\-mile race serves as the
``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series finale and should attract Real
Quiet and other top older horses.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Corey Nakatani and trainer Bob Baffert will begin
defending their '98 Del Mar titles on today's nine-race card, which
starts at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The meet has been shortened by a day and its opener pushed back
24 hours as part of the state's effort to ease the racing glut.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day features the Oceanside Stakes for non-stakes-winning
3-year-olds on turf. The Oceanside drew enough horses to be run in
two divisions for the 11th year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The 6{-furlong Fantastic Girl Stakes looks to be a three-way
battle among Brulay, an early speedster, Love That Jazz, a
late-runner, and the more versatile Snowberg.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new track favor one of them? The Fantastic Girl could
be a race to go to school on.

CREAR'S TIMING IS PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good timing plays a crucial part in track and field. But timing
can't always be measured in tenths and hundredths of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, Mark Crear became only the sixth hurdler in history
to break the 13-second barrier when he ran a 12.98 in the 110-meter
high hurdles in an IAAF permit meet in Zagreb, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Crear, a Valencia resident and 1996 Olympic silver medalist, is
posting the best marks of his career at just the right time, in the
weeks leading to the World Championships and the months leading to
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you're ready,'' Crear said. ``You get to a point
where you know that the only person who is going to beat you is
yourself, the point where nobody is going to beat you unless you
make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Crear, 30, has been a force since winning the 1992 NCAA title at
USC, and he appears to be entering his prime. He ran 12.98 just
eight days after he edged rival Allen Johnson to win the USA
Championships in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just coming together right now,'' Crear said.
``I knew I could run these times last year, but I've been a lot
more focused. I usually need three or four races every season to
get into race-shape, so I'm really starting to feel good right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing in Europe this month, Crear finished first or second
in four of his last five races. His times have been consistent, if
not spectacular, but consistency is what Crear strives for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five years ago, Mark told me that his goal was to
regularly run in the 13.20s,'' said Roger Lipkis, Crear's manager
and friend since 1992. ``If he could do that, he knew he would hit
some times in the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he aimed to start running consistently in the teens, and
the zeros started popping up. Now he's to the point where the 12s
will start showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   So it came as little surprise to Lipkis when Crear bested his
personal record of 13.00 last week and joined Johnson, Renaldo
Nehemiah, Roger Kingdom, Jack Pierce and world-record holder Colin
Jackson (12.91) in the sub-13 club. An exclusive club, to be
certain, and the significance is not lost on Crear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like hitting five of six numbers in the Lotto, or getting
on the freeway at 9 a.m. and not hitting any traffic,'' Crear said.
``I'm just trying to stay so focused right now, so I probably won't
allow myself to celebrate it until September or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud, but you get in trouble if you start talking
about what you've done instead of what you're going to do. Right
now I'm gearing myself to run 12.89.'' &QL; 
Late start
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, 12.89 would have been a decent hourly wage for
Crear, who didn't start running track until his junior year at
Rowland Heights High and worked his way through Mt. San Antonio
College by delivering packages part-time for United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Crear finished second in the 110 hurdles in the
California State Community College Championships, but by then he
had already caught the eye of then-USC track coach Jim Bush, who
offered Crear a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working with the hurdlers at the time, and frankly we
didn't have anybody left who could run hurdles, so I decided to go
find somebody,'' Bush said. ``I went out to an all-comers meet at
Mt. SAC, and I just saw something in Mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pinpoint, but I just knew that the young man had
something special. After a while I asked him if he wanted a
scholarship to USC, and he said, `Yeah, sure!'''
</P>
<P>
   Crear showed some flash early in his college career by finishing
third in the 1990 NCAA Championships, but a serious groin pull
forced him to redshirt in 1991. Crear came back strong in his
senior season in 1992, winning the Pac-10 Conference Championship
and the NCAA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the NCAA Championship, that's when I knew I could
make it in track,'' Crear said. ``I had the fastest time in the
country coming in and I had all the cameras in my face, so I had
all the pressure on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like being Michael Jordan and having people
expect you to score 50 points every night. It was the first time I
had to deal with that type of pressure, and when I crossed the
finish line it was like 100 pounds had been lifted off of my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he ranked sixth in the world, and a year later won his
first USA Championship and improved to third in the world. 1995 saw
Crear improve his personal best to 13.02 and prepared him for the
biggest event of his life, the 1996 Olympics, which almost turned
into his biggest nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the Olympics, during a routine training
session, Crear fell and broke his left arm. Even though not being
able to take pain medication (because of drug testing) prevented
him from running the race of his life, Crear finished in 13.09,
second to Johnson's Olympic-record 12.95. &QL; 
Taking the next step
</P>
<P>
   Despite his silver medal in the Olympics, Crear has never been
viewed within the track community as the man to beat. The specter
of Allen Johnson is never far away and is impossible to shake.
Either Crear or Johnson has been ranked No.1 in the world in each
of the past four years, and both will be strong contenders in the
Aug. 21-29 World Championships in Spain and the 2000 Olympics in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics are always in the back of my mind, that is the
ultimate goal,'' Crear said. ``That's when I turn into `Rocky IV'
training mode, go out running in the snow, get myself a girlfriend
named Adrian... But when you start to get older, you can't take
things for granted because there are a lot of young, hungry people
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm always thinking about the Olympics. That will be my
main focus, and I know that the next two years are going to be the
best of my career.''

PRESSURE GROWS WITHIN NAVY TO REVOKE WOMEN'S EXCLUSION FROM SUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Six years after women began going to sea on combat
warships and carrier aircraft, there is a campaign to re-examine
opening the Navy's last all-male arena _ the elite submarine
service _ to females.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial move is coming from the service's senior
civilian official, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a challenge and a problem for the submarine force that
it excludes half the population, females,'' Danzig said Wednesday
as he wrapped up a two-day visit to Puget Sound-area Navy bases and
The Boeing Co. ``This is a significant thing to be grappled with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy four years ago studied placing women on submarines but
concluded the absence of privacy and constrained space would create
too many tensions among a mixed-gender crew. Danzig reintroduced
the issue last month during an appearance at the non-profit Naval
Submarine League, where he also called on the submariners to make
an increased effort to recruit minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Revoking the combat exclusion rule for submarines would have an
immediate effect at the Bangor Naval Submarine Base in Kitsap
County, where about 2,700 sailors are assigned to crews for the
eight Trident submarines and spy sub USS Parche stationed there.
The larger Trident missile subs are considered the best candidates
for mixed-gender crews.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said Wednesday that his concern over the ban is with the
long-term implications it might have for the all-volunteer
submarine force to win congressional and political support for its
missions and expensive construction programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to build a strong submarine force''
Danzig said. ``Is this (ban on female personnel) something that you
can work your way around, or is it a disadvantage you need to be
burdened with?''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig noted that five of the top 10 graduating seniors in this
year's class at the U.S. Naval Academy _ including the top two
midshipmen overall _ were females.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said there is no deadline to the policy review he has
ordered. ``I did not dictate a conclusion with respect to this,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   In other remarks, Danzig:
</P>
<P>
   _Defended the large Navy involvement in the search and recovery
of the private plane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., saying the
service was responding to requests by the White House and Coast
Guard to bring its specialized recovery capabilities to help in the
accident;
</P>
<P>
   _Praised the performance of the Whidbey Island-based EA-6B
Prowler squadrons in the Kosovo air campaign, and confirmed that
the overworked units have been excused from other commitments to
allow personnel to spend more time with their families and to catch
up on maintenance of the aircraft;
</P>
<P>
   _Reaffirmed that the complex of naval bases in Western
Washington, which now constitutes the third-largest Navy operation
after Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, remains vital to future naval
plans and operations. There are now 41,000 military personnel and
civilian employees in the Navy in the Puget Sound area, with a
total annual payroll of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig and Rear Adm. William Marshall, commander of Navy Region
Northwest, spoke to a session of the Defense Writers Group, a
non-profit organization that brings together senior military
leaders and the news media.

LUDWIK GROSS, A TRAILBLAZER IN CANCER RESEARCH, DIES AT 94 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Ludwik Gross, who influenced cancer research by showing that
viruses could cause cancers in animals, died on Monday at
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 94 and lived in the
Riverdale section of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was stomach cancer, said his daughter, Dr. Augusta H.
Gross.
</P>
<P>
   Gross won an Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation prize in 1974 for
his discovery of what became known as the Gross mouse leukemia
virus. His work in the 1950s, the Lasker jury said, opened the
field of tumor virology in mammals and ``laid the foundations for
the subsequent discovery by others of cancer-inducing viruses in
animals of various species ranging from rodents to the higher
primates.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1951, scientists believed that mouse leukemia, and many
other leukemias, were genetic diseases and not transmissible. Then
Gross upset that dogma by showing that a virus caused mouse
leukemia and could be passed naturally from generation to
generation, mother to baby. For many years ``there was considerable
reluctance and often even frank hostility to accept'' his findings,
he wrote in Cancer Research, a scientific journal, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   For the half-century before Gross' discovery, scientists had
largely ignored the role of viruses in cancer even though,
beginning in 1908, researchers had suggested a viral cause by
transmitting leukemia and sarcomas in chickens. Over the next 30
years, scientists transmitted a type of kidney cancer prevalent in
frogs in New England lakes to other frogs, and also transmitted
breast cancer in mice through milk from mothers to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists called the mysterious factor responsible for
transmitting the mouse breast cancer ``milk influence,'' not a
virus, and used similarly meaningless terms to explain other
transmissions now known to result from viruses.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the ignorance was understandable: laboratory tools
for detecting viruses were crude. But another problem was attitude.
For decades, ``investigators hesitated strongly to accept even as a
working hypothesis the existence of a transmissible virus as the
cause of tumors,'' Gross wrote in a Cancer Research article in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Gross attributed that resistance to scientists' penchant for
following certain generally accepted concepts. ``Research projects
and experimental approaches radically different from such accepted
concepts or theories were not only frowned upon,'' he wrote, ``but
often resulted in the refusal of the necessary financial and
logistical support needed by the investigator to carry out his
proposed studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before his discovery, Gross had theorized that a virus
caused mouse leukemia. But for some time his many experiments at
the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital, where he was chief of
cancer research, failed to find it. One day he heard a lecture by a
scientist who was working on a different virus and who said he
could show its harmful effects by injecting it into suckling mice,
though not by injecting it into older mice.
</P>
<P>
   So Gross injected material from leukemic mice into newborn mice
of a strain known to be free of the leukemia, thus isolating a
virus. He then showed that the virus was passed naturally through
successive generations of mice to cause leukemia. ``Thus,'' Gross
said, ``not only in chickens but also in mammals,'' he had
demonstrated that leukemia often had a viral cause.
</P>
<P>
   The ``frank hostility'' that Gross would describe years later
gradually eased as he went on to show that radiation or a chemical
could induce leukemia in an animal by activating a dormant virus.
As time passed, other scientists developed vaccines against the
feline leukemia virus in cats and a cancer known as Marek's disease
in chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also proved his hypothesis that viruses could cause
some human cancers. Among these viruses: two retroviruses, called
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, that cause rare types of leukemias and
lymphomas; the Epstein-Barr virus, which is linked to Burkitt's
lymphoma and to cancer of the nose and the mouth, and the
hepatitis-B virus, which can lead to liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gross' research led indirectly to the discovery of the AIDS
virus, and some of his papers late in his career discussed how that
virus was transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwik Gross was born in Krakow, Poland, on Sept. 11, 1904. Both
parents were lawyers, and his father was a member of the
Austro-Hungarian Parliament. After earning his medical degree at
Jagiellonian University in Krakow in 1929, Gross trained in
internal medicine for three years at St. Lazar General Hospital
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, he worked at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and
wrote medical articles for Poland's largest-circulation newspaper,
IL Kuryen Codzieny in Krakow. It was while he was on a visit to
Krakow in 1939 that Germany invaded Poland. A member of a prominent
Jewish family, he escaped to Romania with a journalist friend just
days ahead of the Nazis, who were hunting him and also closed the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After immigrating to the United States in 1940, Gross worked at
Jewish Hospital and Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, where he
developed an interest in cancer research. In 1946, after service in
the Army during World War II, he became chief of cancer research at
the Bronx VA Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gross the medical journalist had many letters published in The
New York Times. In one, he opposed fluoridation of the water supply
to prevent tooth decay, calling fluoride ``an insidious poison,
harmful, toxic and cumulative in its effect, even when ingested in
minimal amounts.'' He never changed his view.
</P>
<P>
   Another letter criticized wholesale dealers who kept meat
unwrapped in the trunks of their cars, often next to spare tires,
as they made deliveries to butchers.
</P>
<P>
   He urged prohibition of smoking on airline flights in yet
another letter, published in 1958, more than three decades before
the industry itself adopted the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Gross' textbook, ``Oncogenic Viruses,'' was a standard in the
field. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and his
last scientific article, in 1998, appeared in the organization's
Proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, he leaves a brother, Felix, of
Manhattan. Gross' wife, the former Dorothy Nelson, died in 1988.

 By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ With seven no-hitters, 5,714 strikeouts and 324
victories, Nolan Ryan frequently had the last word during his 27
seasons as a major-league pitcher.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, the Alvin Express is about to claim the last space in the
National Baseball Hall of Fame's revered members plaque gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery, whose oak walls are graced by bronze plaques
commemorating inductees from Babe Ruth and Satchel Paige to Ted
Williams and Roberto Clemente, is the first and longest stop for
many awe-struck visitors to baseball's 60-year-old shrine.
</P>
<P>
   But as currently arranged, it can accommodate only 240 plaques
at eye level. And through last year, 237 baseball legends _
players, managers, executives, umpires and pioneers _ had been
inducted.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ryan and six others will be inducted in formal ceremonies
Sunday well, you do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though. Everyone will get his due.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than extending plaques higher on the walls _ and making
it difficult for some visitors to read and relish each tribute _
Hall of Fame officials have reserved the last three existing spots
for Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount, each selected in his first
year of eligibility by voting members of the Baseball Writers
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   For now, plaques of players Orlando Cepeda and Smokey Joe
Williams, umpire Nestor Chylak and 19th-century manager Frank Selee
_ other inductees Sunday _ will reside on a wall in an open rotunda
directly adjacent to the gallery's main room.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, an expansion will allow plaques of all Hall of
Famers _ including those selected well into the future _ to again
be displayed together.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Sunday festivities, Ryan's presence is deeply
felt here. More than 20 artifacts commemorate his no-hitters, and
12 pertain to his strikeout records.
</P>
<P>
   Already standing at the entrance to the first-floor gallery is a
large grouping of induction exhibits honoring Ryan and the other
1999 honorees. This display will remain in place through next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan exhibit includes these mementos from his nine seasons
(1980-88) with the Astros:
</P>
<P>
   A cap and baseball from April 27, 1983, when he passed Walter
Johnson as the major leagues' all-time career strikeout leader.
</P>
<P>
   Another Astros cap worn July 11, 1985, when Ryan recorded his
4,000th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   Spikes worn by Ryan on Sept. 27, 1973, when as a California
Angel he established a single-season record by striking out his
383rd batter.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Rangers cap worn Aug. 22, 1989, when Ryan got career
strikeout No. 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers road jersey worn during Ryan's sixth no-hit game June
11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers cap and autographed baseball used during his 300th
major-league victory July 31, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to three of Ryan's milestone games with the Rangers:
Aug. 22, 1989 (5,000th strikeout); July 31, 1990 (300th career
victory); and May 1, 1991 (seventh no-hitter).
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers cap and baseball from Ryan's final game Sept. 22,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's Hall of Fame plaque, to be unveiled Sunday, will include
a cap with a Rangers logo.
</P>
<P>
   As the main feature of a separate exhibit on no-hitters, also on
the museum's first floor, a cap and baseball from each of Ryan's

JOHN STEELMAN, 99; FROM RIDING THE RAILS TO TOP TRUMAN AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John R. Steelman, a onetime hobo from Arkansas who later earned
a Ph.D. in economics and became one of President Harry Truman's
closest aides, particularly on labor matters, died on July 14 at a
retirement home in Naples, Fla. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   With the official title of the assistant to the president,
Steelman was, in his words, ``the president's chief chore boy,''
according to a 1951 article in The New York Times that listed him
as among Truman's top 10 friends and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest job in the Truman administration, according to David
McCullough, the author of ``Truman'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1992), was
probably negotiating a settlement in a 52-day strike by steel
workers in 1952, the longest and costliest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Steelman, a cheerful, buoyant man, was appointed to the new post
of the assistant to the president on Dec. 12, 1946. Historians
believe he is the only person ever to hold that title.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment came about when Truman dissolved various wartime
boards and agencies and made Steelman the assistant to the
president with the specific function of coordinating federal agency
programs and policies. Many believed that the appointment was a way
of marginalizing Steelman, who had become a focus of controversy
because of his role in labor negotiations. Instead, Steelman became
an even more powerful adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Krock of The New York Times later noted that Steelman's
title meant exactly what it implied. ``When the president went away
on his election campaign in 1948, he left Steelman in the White
House to keep the wheels of government rolling,'' Krock wrote.
</P>
<P>
   John Roy Steelman was born on a farm in Thornton, Ark., on June
23, 1900. He graduated from high school and served in World War I.
Needing money for college tuition, he had jobs that included
bookkeeping and logging. He also rode the rails to Wichita, Kan.,
to work in the wheat fields. He was a ``blanket stiff,'' in hobo
argot _ a roving laborer who carried his blanket with him.
</P>
<P>
   Steelman eventually earned a bachelor's degree from
Henderson-Brown College in Arkadelphia, Ark. He also studied at
Vanderbilt University and Harvard University and received his
doctorate in economics and sociology from the University of North
Carolina in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   He was a professor of sociology at Alabama College when the
secretary of labor, Frances Perkins, delivered the commencement
address in 1934. She was impressed by Steelman's recent settlement
of a labor dispute in Mobile, Ala., and she asked him to join the
government as a member of the U.S. Conciliation Service, which
helped settle labor disputes. Three years later, he became director
of the service.
</P>
<P>
   He left the conciliation service post after President Franklin
Roosevelt was elected to a fourth term in 1944 and briefly worked
as a public relations consultant in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Truman became president on the death of
Roosevelt in 1945, Steelman returned to Washington as an adviser to
the secretary of labor and later became a special assistant to the
president, director of the Office of War Mobilization and
Reconversion and director of Economic Stabilization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he became the assistant to the president. In 1948, he
was offered the post of secretary of labor but turned it down,
saying he preferred to work in the White House, where he helped in
establishing policies on science and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Steelman also acted as a de facto labor secretary. He helped
avert a nationwide strike by railroad workers in 1950. In 1952,
Truman appointed his ``right-hand man'' _ as he called Steelman _
to the head of the Office of Defense Mobilization, replacing
Charles E. Wilson, who had resigned to protest the White House's
support of a Wage Stabilization Board recommendation to grant
raises for steel workers without giving steel companies the right
to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   When no agreement was reached, the administration seized the
steel companies under emergency presidential powers that were later
declared unconstitutional. When the companies were returned to the
operators, however, members of the United Steel Workers of American
went on a strike that lasted 52 days before Steelman brokered an
agreement that gave the workers their raises and the steel
companies a price increase.
</P>
<P>
   After Truman left office, Steelman stayed on for several weeks
to help President Dwight Eisenhower with the transition. He later
became a director of the Audio-Dynamics Corp. in Washington and a
trustee of the Nationwide Investing Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Doris Frakes, died earlier this year. He is
survived by his wife, Ellen; two brothers, P.C. Steelman of Little
Rock, Ark., and Horace Steelman of Camden, Ark.; a stepson, Robert
Hart of Woodbridge, Va., six grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS WORK OUT TAX-CUT BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans hammered out an agreement with
moderates in their own party Wednesday night on a $792 billion
tax-cutting package that would provide the first across-the-board
reductions in the federal income tax rates since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders mustered what they believed will be enough
votes to pass the 10-year tax-relief package today, but only after
promising a group of renegade Republicans that the cuts would not
phase in unless the nation's debt declines simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to require discipline on our part,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the
bill's author.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, R-Texas, and other Republican leaders were forced to
make concessions to the more moderate members of their party after
head counts earlier in the day found they were 10 votes shy of
passing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the renegade Republicans had favored a smaller tax
package in the neighborhood of $500 billion, but they agreed to the
full $792 billion plan in exchange for the provision linking tax
cuts to debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   While the tough negotiations consumed lawmakers for much of two
days, the House vote may well prove to be the easiest step in the
process of turning a tax plan into law.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have crafted their own tax-cutting package
which, while the same size as Archer's package, takes a
substantially different approach.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, has threatened to veto any bill
the size of the Republican packages. The White House and many
Democrats say no tax bill should be larger than $250 billion to
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Congress will make the right choice,'' Clinton said
during a news conference Wednesday. ``If Congress passes the wrong
kind, of course, I will not sign it. I will not allow a risky plan
to become law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that the Republican tax cut plan would cost $1
trillion over the first decade and then another $3 trillion in the
second decade.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would reduce each of the five major income tax
brackets by 10 percent over a 10-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for instance, would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket
_ the rate currently levied on the first $25,750 of any single
filer's income and the first $43,050 for joint filers _ to 13.5
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The first cut would come in 2001, with the 15 percent bracket
dipping at that time to 14.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10-year period, the current 28 percent tax bracket
would drop to 25.2 percent, while the 31 percent would fall to 27.9
percent, 36 percent to 32.4 percent and the highest income tax
bracket _ 39.6 percent _ would drop to 35.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But under the deal worked out with the moderate Republicans, the
second phase of the rate reductions _ scheduled to start in 2004 _
would not go into effect unless the government's debt load drops
each year as well, said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., one of the
renegades leading the revolt against the original Archer bill.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates had refused to accept a nonbinding resolution
known as a ``sense of Congress'' expressing lawmakers desire to
attack the debt load. ``This is not a `sense of Congress' or a
lollipop,'' said Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H. ``This is the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board cuts in the tax brackets _ the largest
piece of the tax package _ would be the only aspect of the tax
relief held hostage to debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, dubbed the Financial Freedom Act of 1999, also would
exempt the first $200 of interest and dividend income for single
filers, $400 for married couples. These changes, likewise, would be
phased in over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the effects of the so-called ``marriage penalty'' _
the aspect of the tax code that forces many dual-income couples to
pay more in taxes than they would if they had remained single _ the
bill would raise the standard deduction for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the standard deduction for couples
filing jointly from the current $7,200 a year to $8,600, equal to
twice the deduction allowed for single filers. Such a measure would
benefit an estimated 21 million couples _ including many who don't
actually suffer the marriage penalty _ saving the average family an
estimated $243 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes many provisions popular with the
Republicans' base constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The top tax rate on individuals' capital gains, the income
earned on stocks and other investments, would drop from the current
20 percent to 15 percent. Estate and gift taxes would be
eliminated. And the alternative minimum tax, the tax wealthier
Americans and corporations with a large number of deductions and
credits are forced to pay to ensure they provide some revenue to
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   For corporate America, the House bill would ratchet down the tax
rate that corporations pay on capital gains, from 35 percent to 30
percent. It would provide tax breaks for oil and gas producers,
help utilities afford to close unneeded nuclear plants and raise
the exclusion for income earned overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the north side of Capitol Hill, the Senate Finance
Committee signed off on a bill sponsored by Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., that would reduce only the lowest income tax rate from 15
percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's bill lacks many provisions particularly popular with
conservatives, including the capital gains tax cuts and the
elimination of inheritance taxes. Roth's bill would merely trim the
maximum estate tax from 55 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote on its tax package next week.
House and Senate negotiators will then meet to try to work through
their differences.

TYSON COULD FACE DOUGLAS _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas II? It's a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who shocked the world when he knocked out then-unbeaten
Tyson in 1990, is on the short list of possible opponents for
Tyson's comeback fight on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dan Goossen, Tyson's promoter, said lesser-known Orlin
Norris and Zeljko Mavrovic are the leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said Douglas is asking for too much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if Buster is pricing himself out of the market,''
Goossen said. ``It's a Showtime event. We have to work within the
confines of the agreement. Nothing is impossible, though.''
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, Douglas' longtime manager, was irked by Goossen's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's fair to say,'' Russell said. ``You have
to understand this: Douglas didn't lose to Tyson. Buster Douglas
knocked out Mike Tyson.... Why should Mike Tyson get all the
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a much bigger draw than Douglas, who is 39 and well
past his peak. Douglas knocked out his last two journeyman
opponents but was stopped himself in one round by Lou Savarese in
June of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russell doesn't believe a 50-50 split with Tyson is
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' he said. ``Tyson isn't such a great draw anymore.
He didn't draw well at all for the (Francois) Botha fight. If he
was a good draw, Showtime wouldn't have lost money (on that
card).''
</P>
<P>
   As with Tyson, Norris is a smallish heavyweight who was once a
crusierweight champion. Mavrovic went 12 rounds with Lennox Lewis
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will be fighting for the first time after spending four
months in prison for assaulting two elderly motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Fights set: Valley products Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas,
attempting their own comebacks, are scheduled to fight on Aug. 7
and 8, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Ruelas will face Jose Rodriguez of Nicaragua in a
10-round lightweight bout in Miami on Telemundo. Rafael Ruelas will
face Hicklet Lau of Miami in a 10-round lightweight bout in Las
Vegas on Fox Sports Net the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker watch: Another Valley fighter, Lance ``Mount''
Whitaker, is scheduled to face contender Monte Barrett on the
undercard of the yet-to-be-finalized David Reid-Keith Mullings
fight on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitaker wins, he could be in line to face Michael Grant in
December.

KIDNEY FAILURE IMPERILS CAREER OF SPURS' ELLIOTT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sean Elliott tiptoed along the baseline in Game 2 of the
Western Conference finals in May and let fly the most memorable
3-pointer of his career, the winning shot was immediately dubbed
the Memorial Day Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, how the 31-year-old forward even played that game
against Portland and eventually helped the San Antonio Spurs win
their first NBA title may go down as a much more remarkable feat.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after he and his team frolicked on the Madison
Square Garden floor after beating the Knicks in the NBA finals,
Elliott and his physicians disclosed Wednesday in San Antonio that
he is suffering from worsening renal function and will undergo a
kidney transplant as soon as a matching donor is found, perhaps as
early as August, leaving his basketball future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation that I've known about for a while, so for me
it really hasn't been a shock,'' said Elliott, who has anticipated
needing a transplant for the past year. ``Ask me if I'm a little
scared; yeah, I'm a little worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was upbeat and matter-of-fact during a 30-minute news
conference in the team's executive offices at the Alamodome. He
said he was not in pain and added that he hoped to resume his NBA
career after a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Reineck, a kidney specialist who has been treating
Elliott, said there is no precedent for a professional athlete
returning to action after a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's family members underwent blood screening last week to
determine whether they qualify as kidney donors. If there is no
family match, he will be placed on a transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ``In monitoring Sean's kidney function, we've seen a steady but
unrelenting decline,'' Reineck said. ``It has declined to a point
where we know that if intervention is not done, Sean will soon
become symptomatic from kidney failure and we'd like to avoid that
if at all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott does not undergo dialysis or a transplant, the
symptoms will initially be a generalized weakness and nausea,
Reineck said. Weight loss and the inability to eat would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said: ``It's a devastating loss for
us basketball-wise, but beyond that he's a monster piece of the
family in how we are connected and relate to each other. On a
personal basis, it's a huge loss to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott learned of his deteriorating condition around the
beginning of April, with about a month left in the regular season,
although Reineck said he and Elliott have known for more than a
year that at some point a transplant would probably be necessary.
Among his teammates, Elliott said he told only Steve Kerr of his
plight, doing that late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I had a responsibility to the team,'' he said of
his continuing to play. ``It's been something I've been living with
for a while, so I really didn't let it creep into my mind that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott first learned of his kidney disease, called focal
segmental glomerular sclerosis, after the 1992-93 season, his
fourth in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted by the Spurs out of Arizona in the first round in 1989,
Elliott was traded by San Antonio to Detroit after that fourth
season. The Pistons tried to deal him to the Rockets in 1994, but
the agreement fell through when Elliott failed his physical because
of his kidney condition. The Pistons dealt him back to the Spurs
later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to form this season, Elliott persevered through
a series of knee injuries and other physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt star-crossed, Elliott replied: ``Absolutely
not. I've had a great career. If that's the end of it, then so be
it. ``There are a lot of people that go through this every day, so
why should I be the exception? There are a lot of people that deal
with transplants and a lot don't make it that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Reineck speculated it would be two to three months after the
transplant before it is known whether Elliott could begin to ponder
a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott averaged 11.9 points and four blocks in the playoffs. He
had 14 points and four assists in a 96-89 victory over the Knicks
in Game 4 of the finals, complementing the twin, 7-foot towers of
Tim Duncan and David Robinson with his outside game.

PRESSURE GROWS WITHIN NAVY TO REVOKE WOMEN'S EXCLUSION FROM SUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Six years after women began going to sea on combat
warships and carrier aircraft, there is a campaign to re-examine
opening the Navy's last all-male arena _ the elite submarine
service _ to females.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial move is coming from the service's senior
civilian official, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a challenge and a problem for the submarine force that
it excludes half the population, females,'' Danzig said Wednesday
as he wrapped up a two-day visit to Puget Sound-area Navy bases and
The Boeing Co. ``This is a significant thing to be grappled with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy four years ago studied placing women on submarines but
concluded the absence of privacy and constrained space would create
too many tensions among a mixed-gender crew. Danzig reintroduced
the issue last month during an appearance at the non-profit Naval
Submarine League, where he also called on the submariners to make
an increased effort to recruit minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Revoking the combat exclusion rule for submarines would have an
immediate effect at the Bangor Naval Submarine Base in Kitsap
County, where about 2,700 sailors are assigned to crews for the
eight Trident submarines and spy sub USS Parche stationed there.
The larger Trident missile subs are considered the best candidates
for mixed-gender crews.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said Wednesday that his concern over the ban is with the
long-term implications it might have for the all-volunteer
submarine force to win congressional and political support for its
missions and expensive construction programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to build a strong submarine force''
Danzig said. ``Is this (ban on female personnel) something that you
can work your way around, or is it a disadvantage you need to be
burdened with?''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig noted that five of the top 10 graduating seniors in this
year's class at the U.S. Naval Academy _ including the top two
midshipmen overall _ were females.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said there is no deadline to the policy review he has
ordered. ``I did not dictate a conclusion with respect to this,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   In other remarks, Danzig:
</P>
<P>
   _Defended the large Navy involvement in the search and recovery
of the private plane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., saying the
service was responding to requests by the White House and Coast
Guard to bring its specialized recovery capabilities to help in the
accident;
</P>
<P>
   _Praised the performance of the Whidbey Island-based EA-6B
Prowler squadrons in the Kosovo air campaign, and confirmed that
the overworked units have been excused from other commitments to
allow personnel to spend more time with their families and to catch
up on maintenance of the aircraft;
</P>
<P>
   _Reaffirmed that the complex of naval bases in Western
Washington, which now constitutes the third-largest Navy operation
after Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, remains vital to future naval
plans and operations. There are now 41,000 military personnel and
civilian employees in the Navy in the Puget Sound area, with a
total annual payroll of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig and Rear Adm. William Marshall, commander of Navy Region
Northwest, spoke to a session of the Defense Writers Group, a
non-profit organization that brings together senior military
leaders and the news media.

DANIEL H.H. INGALLS, 83, SANSKRIT SCHOLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel H.H. Ingalls, an impassioned scholar of the ancient
Indian language Sanskrit and a longtime professor at Harvard
University, died on Saturday at Bath County Community Hospital in
Hot Springs, Va. He was 83 and lived in Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls, an expert on Sanskrit literature and Indian history and
philosophy, retired as the Wales Professor of Sanskrit in 1983
after 35 years as a professor at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He was also chairman of the department of Sanskrit and Indian
studies and president of the American Oriental Society.
</P>
<P>
   He won praise for his translation and commentary in ``An
Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry'' (Harvard University Press,
1965). The book contains some 1,700 Sanskrit verses collected by a
Buddhist abbot, Vidyakara, in Bengal around A.D. 1050.
</P>
<P>
   In the book Ingalls compares the impersonality of Sanskrit
poetry with the predominantly personal poetry of the West. He cites
these lines:
</P>
<P>
   They lay upon the bed each turned aside and suffering in
silence;
</P>
<P>
   though love still dwelt within their hearts each feared a loss
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   But then from out the corner of their eyes the sidelong glances
met
</P>
<P>
   and the quarrel broke in laughter as they turned and clasped
each other's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls wrote that ``Half the charm of the verse lies in the
anonymity of the lovers,'' and that Vidyakara had furnished him
with ``the happiest hours of labor that I have yet known.''
</P>
<P>
   He served as chairman of Virginia Hot Springs Inc. from 1963
until his death. Its holdings formerly included the Homestead
resort in Hot Springs, which had been bought in the 1890s by
Ingalls' grandfather Melville Ezra Ingalls, president of the
Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he received bachelor's and master's degrees
from Harvard and was an Army officer in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He married Phyllis Sarah Day in 1936 and she died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Joanne; two daughters, Sarah Daughn of
Providence, R.I., and Rachel Holmes Ingalls of London; a son,
Daniel H.H. Jr. of Truckee, Calif.; five grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Marlins extend Braves drought to 5 in a row
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Staring down the worst losing streak of the year and
fresh off a three-game sweep in Toronto, the Braves were welcomed
to South Florida by the team with the worst record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Back in their country, in their division, and with their starter
Greg Maddux giving them lots of chances, the Braves lost 2-0 to the
Florida Marlins and knuckleballer Dennis Springer, their
season-high fifth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves last lost five games in a row Sept. 8-14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There were no grand slams to fume about, no bad calls at the
plate, just a regular National League East loss to a team the
Braves had beaten in six of the previous eight meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy threw a good game,'' said Maddux, now 10-6. ``Whatever it
was, it was funky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were shut out on seven hits, one each in seven of the
first eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had runners in scoring position with fewer than two
outs in the second, third and fourth innings. The best scoring
chance came when Keith Lockhart tripled over Preston Wilson in
center field. Chipper Jones walked to bring up Brian Jordan, but he
grounded into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy had the knuckleball fluttering pretty good,'' Jones said.
``Goes to show, even a guy who throws 68 miles an hour can beat
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth inning was a good indicator of how the night went for
Atlanta, when the Marlins used a pair of infield hits, one by Danny
Bautista and another by Wilson, to score a run and increase the
lead to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second run kind of irritated me a little bit, the way I
gave it up,'' Maddux said. ``I'm not complaining, other than the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand the game well enough to realize
something like this isn't as uncommon as some people might think,''
Maddux said of the five-game skid. ``I think the effort is there,
we've got the right people playing, people are healthy for the most
part. It's going to happen sometimes. We'll come to the park maybe
a little more hungry tomorrow.

DECEPTION IN ROAD RACE HAS RACE OFFICIALS SEEING DOUBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ One of the top finishers in South
Africa's most famous road race admitted Wednesday that he had
cheated by running it in relays with his virtually identical
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Motsoeneng, 21 years old, and his brother, Fika, 19, were
desperate for prize money, their lawyer said, and gave the $1,000
Sergio won to their father, who lives in Qwa Qwa, a depressed
former black homeland, with 11 children. The lawyer added that the
family had been on the verge of selling the $85 gold medal Sergio
received for finishing in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Comrades Marathon, first run in 1921 by 34 men raising money
for a veterans group known as the League of Comrades of the Great
War, has grown into South Africa's biggest road race, with nearly
15,000 entrants of all ages. Each year, it reverses direction
between two cities, Pietermaritzburg in the Drakensberg Mountains
and Durban on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   This year, on June 16, it was the downhill run, which is 89.9
kilometers long, for which the record is 5 hours 24 minutes 7
seconds. But watching the winner finish is far less entertaining
than the bitter end of the race. It is considered a great shame to
be among the last 1,500 competitors who fail to finish in 11 hours
and are ``swept up by the broom wagon,'' sometimes paralyzed by
cramps and clawing at the rescue vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The whole race is covered on national television, and most of
the runners finish in the last hour, staggering into the stadium,
collapsing at the finish line, crawling or carrying each other
over.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account by the South African Press Association,
Nick Bester, a former champion who finished 15th this year, had
complained that something was wrong with Sergio Motsoeneng's
ninth-place finish. Bester had counted everyone who passed him in
the final miles and there was one too many _ and electronic-race
records showed Sergio was behind him earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio confessed through his lawyer Wednesday after Beeld, an
Afrikaans-language newspaper, published pictures of both brothers
in the race wearing the same number. They looked very much alike,
but their watches were on different hands, and one runner has a
scarred shin.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Sergio began the race and ducked into a mobile
toilet after 45 minutes to change shirts and shoes with Fika. Fika
ran the next 30 kilometers, and they changed again at least once.
Changing shoes was necessary because microchips in each runner's
shoelaces and sensors allowed constant tracking of every entrant.
South Africans across the country were able to log onto a Web site
and find out exactly where their favorite racers were at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Clem Harrington, a lawyer who has run in 21 Comrades, said
Sergio Motsoeneng was a desperate young man from a poor family. He
and his unemployed client, both from the town of Bethlehem, will
meet with the Comrades Marathon Association on Saturday to return
the medal and negotiate repayment of the $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a great year for the Comrades. Motsoeneng is
the third runner to be dropped from the list of top-10 finishers.
Viktor Zhdanov, from Russia, who finished second, was disqualified
after testing positive for ephedrine, and Mahlala ``Rasta''
Mohloli, the sixth-place finisher and a popular local runner in the
same club as as Motsoeneng, tested positive for nandrolone, a
strength-building steroid.
</P>
<P>
   The Comrades prize money is so low that it attracts few
world-class entrants, but many runners from the former Soviet Union
participate and do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragic story,'' the press association quoted
Harrington as saying. ``Hopefully, Sergio will not be lost to the
sport because he is a highly talented runner. If he harnessed the
energy he put into cheating into rather running the race properly,
who knows, he might have finished among the top five.''

QB LOSMAN QUITS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it was the number of quarterbacks ahead of
him. Perhaps the jump from high school to college was overwhelming.
Or could it have been a young man took too large a step too soon?
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Losman knows why he decided to transfer from UCLA, but he's
not talking. His mother said the reasons were ``personal'' and that
she didn't know where Losman might go.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Losman, the Bruins' top quarterback recruit, is leaving
the program, the school announced Wednesday, just three months
after the outstanding prospect arrived from Venice High, where he
graduated early. The school said it will release Losman from his
scholarship commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with J.P. and his father a few weeks ago. At that time,
J.P. indicated that he was considering transferring,'' UCLA coach
Bob Toledo said in a press statement. ``I told him to take some
time to think about what he wanted to do. I spoke by telephone late
last week and he told me he decided to transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Losman arrived at Westwood having been named a Parade
All-American. He completed 163 of 274 passes for 3,544 yards and 49
touchdowns his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   He thought that with Cade McNown gone, the competition was wide
open and he could win the starting job in spring practice. Yet he
discovered Venice doesn't necessarily prepare one for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' playbook is four inches thick and far more advanced
than a high school's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different than high school,'' Losman said before
announcing his desire to transfer. ``I got the playbook the day I
signed and I didn't know what I was looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Losman had to beat out junior Drew Bennett, sophomore
Scott McEwan and redshirt freshmen Ryan McCann and Cory Paus. Those
four will be at Spaulding Field when fall practice begins Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned about not getting a lot of reps,'' said his
coach at Venice, A.C. Chretin. ``He might've been down about that.
He has a tendency to be impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   The news brought frustrationto at least one local family. Karen
Boller didn't want to be reminded of the past. Her son, Kyle,
passed for more yards than Losman and led Hart High to the Southern
Section Division III championship.
</P>
<P>
   Karen wanted Kyle to go to UCLA. Kyle wanted to go to UCLA. But
UCLA committed to Losman, promising it wouldn't recruit any other
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle signed with Cal. It's only an hour plane ride, Karen says
to comfort herself. Yet she wonders what if.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Boller) went to (UCLA's) camp the day J.P. signed,'' Karen
Boller said. ``He was so disappointed. We did a lot of whining.''
</P>
<P>
   When Karen told Kyle the news, he was shocked. Perhaps as much
as Losman was when he discovered what UCLA was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. told me he does not want to redshirt this year and I
think he's concerned about the number of quarterbacks we have in
the program,'' Toledo said. ``I told him that there will be
competition anywhere he goes and that he's only been in our system
for one quarter and should be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretin said that was the type of challenge Losman relished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knewit would be tough, but that wouldn't deter him in
anything,'' Chretin said.

 &HT;    Auction bids for baseball signed by pope quiet
 &HT;    By Andy Staples
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The organizers of a local auction expected a bidding
war of Biblical proportions Wednesday night. They got a lot of
curious onlookers and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Only two out of several hundred in attendance placed bids on a
Pope John Paul II-signed baseball at the 20th annual National Live
Memorabilia Auction at the Atlanta Hilton and Towers. Both bids
came woefully short of the $50,000 asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' said Avron Fogelman, the Memphis, Tenn.,
businessman who topped off the bidding at $12,000. ``I've
participated in auctions for 15 years, and I've never seen anything
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogelman was angry because he believed a bid of $10,000 or more
would be enough to buy the ball. That price was the starting bid
listed in the auction's catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Jasperson, who directed the auction for Beckett
Collectible Auctions, said Wednesday's auction used a ``reserve''
system, which places a required price on each item. That price is
usually substantially higher than the listed opening bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest bid didn't meet the reserve,'' Jasperson said.
``It could have sold for $100 without the reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogelman was not satisfied with that explanation, though. He
also was not satisfied with the lack of interest in the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any bidding,'' Fogelman said. ``That defeats the
purpose of an auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Interested parties could bid in person, by proxy, by Internet or
by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve was set by former San Francisco Giant Mike Sadek,
the owner of the ball. The Beckett company's commission was set to
go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is believed to be one of only three papal autographs in
existence outside the Vatican. The highest price ever paid for an
autographed ball is $36,000 for a ball signed by former President
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Friedman was trying to buy the ball for his company, Sports
Investments. His top bid was $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the ball being so rare would get a very
good price,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett now will return the ball to Sadek, who may or may not
choose to put the ball up for sale again.
</P>
<P>
   The highest price paid for any item Wednesday was $24,200 for a
1933 Napoleon Lajoie baseball card. A $25 cancelled check from Lou
Gerhig for a lifetime subscription to ``The Sporting News'' fetched
$10,175.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was a prelude to the National Sports Memorabilia
Collectors Convention, which begins today at noon and runs through
Sunday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will feature nearly 1,000 dealer booths and will
give patrons a chance to get autographs from a bevy of current and
former professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Those in attendance will get a chance to get autographs from
people like former NBA stars Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell,
former NFL stars Joe Montana and Len Dawson and former Major League
Baseball players Orlando Cepeda and Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $10 a person each day, but children under 15 get in
free today only.

JETER POWERS YANKEES OVER DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How frustrating it is for clubs like the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays to think they have the defending champion New York
Yankees right where they want them and then realize it was the
other way around all along.
</P>
<P>
   Here it was, the seventh inning at Yankee Stadium, and Bobby
Witt was pitching with a 2-1 lead. The Tampa Bay right-hander had
struck out the league's leading batter, Derek Jeter, three times by
the fifth inning, all swinging. And then just liked that, Witt was
watching Jeter parade around the bases with a two-run home run that
lifted the Yankees to a 4-3 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been swinging on bad pitches,'' Jeter explained later.
``I wasn't going to swing at any more bad sliders. Only
fastballs.'' He got his pitch on a 2-0 count and laced it to right
field. The homer followed Chuck Knoblauch's run-scoring single that
had tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's drive, his 17th of a marvelous season, helped Orlando
Hernandez, the Yankees starter, win his fourth straight decision
and improve to 11-6. Hernandez kept Tampa Bay batters mostly off
balance for eight innings with his off-speed deliveries, giving up
just two runs, permitting only five hits and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth and earned a save for the
second straight night, though he yielded a single and a run-scoring
double before retiring the last two batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees boosted their July record to 10-8, not quite gaudy,
but actually significantly better than Boston's. The month began
with the Yankees enjoying a two-game edge over the Red Sox in the
East. It is now five games.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Hernandez have been prominent. As Paul O'Neill watched
Jeter Wednesday night, it occurred to him that ``he's having one of
those dream seasons; who knows, this may be the way his career
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter claimed he had not been hitting the ball well all week,
yet before his three strikeouts he was 5 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   This is how startling it was to see Jeter's flailing in his
first three at-bats: coming into the game, he not only was leading
the American League in batting at .376, but he also had struck out
an average of roughly once every six at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous three career at-bats against Witt, Jeter had
been hitless. But Witt can get the ball past most people if the
setting is right. He has 11 seasons of more than 100 strikeouts. In
1990, the only pitcher with more strikeouts in the American League
was Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Witt faced the Yankees, a month ago, he was
shelled in what turned out to be his briefest outing of the season:
he faced 11 batters and eight reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez mowed down the first nine batters he faced with only
one ball reaching the outfield. Did he think about David Cone's
perfect game of last Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time when he goes to the mound he thinks of pitching a
perfect game,'' Hernandez's Spanish-speaking interpreter said.
</P>
<P>
   Things started brightly for the Yankees as O'Neill swatted a
two-out double into the left-field corner in the first inning and
scored on Bernie Williams' single.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays picked up two runs in the fourth. But the
Yankees' breakout seventh began when Ricky Ledee ended an 0-13
slump with a double to left center. He scored on Knoblauch's
single, putting Witt right where the Yankees wanted him and setting
the stage for Jeter's wrong-field home run to right.  &QL;
